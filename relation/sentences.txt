division	multiplication
pattern7	cheaper	
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and it s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because it s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .

if you re really concerned with portability i m not sure that there s any better option than using printf and strtod and assuming that you may not necessarily have any more accuracy than the absolute minimum required by he relevant specification section 5.2.4.2.2 of the c99 spec.

for instance a plain old c-array of 100 000 chars is smaller than the same 100 000 int by a factor of four but if during an enumeration reading out each index involves a cast boxing unboxing of sorts will we see overall lower performance despite the saved memory overhead

you should probably always use an id number that way if you change the type name you don t need to update the user table it also allows you to keep your datasize down as a table full of int is much smaller than one full of 45 chars varchars

adding a dynamic salt to each user would mean that you will have to hit a datastore to retrieve the dynamic salt and the hash version of the user s password then you will have to perform the cpu intensive hash function in your code twice -- you are hashing a hash which is less secure and more likely to have collisions

as for not reinventing the wheel like many have said already make sure to first explore the possibilities in the standard template library stl which is much richer than you might think and then look at boost www.boost.org which has libraries for a lot of diverse purposes and they are extremely high quality and some are just works of art like spirit proto lambda and mpl

datamapper	activerecord

so far the only legitimate reason i ve found to use datamapper over activerecord is that datamapper is better in terms of the single responsibility principle -- because the database rows are not the actual objects being persisted but with propel that doesn t really concern me because it s generated code anyway

case-sensitive	case-insensitive
pattern0	slower	
this tiny overhead on add is vastly outweighed by the savings on lookups since all programmers should know and understand that case-insensitive compares are vastly slower than case-sensitive especially with unicode - the cpu can t just do a block compare of data but must check each pair of characters specially even using a table look-up this is vastly slower

obviously that number has to be something wider than a byte since there are more than 256 chars java uses a version of unicode where every chars is assigned a 16-bit value and this is why java chars are 16 bits wide and have int values from 0 to 65535

hex is easier for most people to convert to and from binary in their heads since binary numbers are usually expressed in blocks of eight because that s the size of a byte and eight is exactly two hex digits but hex notation would have been clunky and misleading in dennis time implying the ability to address 16 bits

the basic idea behind the approach is that you map the coordinates of the images to the interval by dividing by the width assuming the width is the larger dimension but it does not matter if it is smaller than the height

19591563
int	double
pattern7	type substantially narrower	
the int portions of the logarithms of 31 and 310 use different numbers of bits so there are different numbers of bits left for the significand so they end up being rounded to slightly different values. as long as the int type is substantially narrower than the double type the calculated limit will be much larger than the error in log10

the problem is that when i move to an android device whose orientation is landscape by default the device s hardware is arranged in such a way that it is clear it is intended to be used mainly in landscape orientation the x and y coordinates are reversed and the fact that the window s height is greater than its width can t be used to determine whether the user is holding the device with it s top up and its bottom down
