but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads

sockets,encapsulations,slower,ofcourse,cost,info,websockets,ideal,server

packets,better,option,guarantee,box
if you can t afford lost packets then tcp is probably a better option than udp since it provides that guarantee out of the box

only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

note,exceptions,firewalls,better,due,security,voip,speech,part,journey
note that there are exceptions to the above - for example tcp generally traverses firewalls better than udp which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over tcp for part of its journey at least

assumption,faster
i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp

also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of udp that performs worse than tcp

confirmation,packets,faster
because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp

problem,bigger,packages,data,kb
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

first of udp s datagram is simpler than tcp s one

packets,slower,data,transfer,simple,connection,faster,flow
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

attempting,performance,shifting,part,lower,tracks,redelivers
if you were attempting to beat the performance of tcp by shifting to udp keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with tcp is because tcp tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you

more,processing,interface,level,itâ
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not

in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

application,image,socket.i,better,protocol,kryonet,java,type

protocol,particular,easier
but with the udp protocol in particular this is easier than for tcp

faster,simple,non-existent,packet,stream,set,packets,using,window,size
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features

packets,slower,data,transfer,simple,connection,faster,flow
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

socket,more,likely,work
tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

udp is faster than tcp because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order

scales,better,states,operating
udp scales better than tcp because of reduced states that need to be maintained in the operating system

the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

quicker,using
udp is quicker than tcp but if you re using quickfix you ll be using tcp

heuristics,servering,connections,more,aggressive,sockets,continuous,processing
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

udp is not always faster than tcp

slower,machines,lan,reliable
tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable

faster,simple,nonexistent,packet,stream,set,packets,using,window,size
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

iot,domain,more,popular,bigger,transport
but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads

think,faster,slower,wrong
don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong

tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted

index,client,better
for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client tcp will not perform any better than udp

multicast,lan,cache,identity,main,exchanging,more,reliable
you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp

and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp

better
tcp is way better then udp for that

slower,realtime,multiplayer
tcp is slower than udp and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer

faster,missing,extra,reality,many,congestion,control
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

header,more,fields,many
you will notice that the tcp header has more fields than the udp header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake

nat,traversal,harder,problem
but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp

applications,faster,better,throughput

udp port scanning is possible but it is harder than tcp scanning

faster,applications
if i d directly say that udp is faster comparatively than tcp that it is used for such applications

matzi,lower,latency,header,smaller,downside,delivery
like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp

btw,more,appropriate
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

byte,mtu,faster
i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

specific,scenario,better
or is there any specific scenario where udp is better than tcp

faster,congestion,detection
udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

lower,overhead,packets,smaller
one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data

development,cost,transport,higher,degree,re-inventing
so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp

better
-- does udp always perform better than tcp

tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

using,faster,sure,packet,side,program,sending,ack
i am using udp because it is much faster than tcp but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use tcp at all so i am sending ack packets

sequence,events,socket,harder,normal
when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

more,flags,way,handshake,source,ip
for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

faster
tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some

zeromq,leverage,multicast,faster,protocol,application

i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp average 65 better

going,more,reliable,guarantee,packet
tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

fact,size,less,simpler,protocol
the fact that udp s header size is less than tcp s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it

windowing,more,expensive,raw,faster,custom
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

trying,tcpclient,faster,work
i m trying to avoid tcpclient because udp is faster but would this work in tcp since it s streamed
