(("<p>There's a lot of people who will push <code>JSON</code>. It's a lot lighter weight than <code>XML</code>.  Personally, I find <code>XML</code> to be a little more standard though.  You'll have trouble finding a server side technology that doesn't support <code>XML</code>. And <code>JavaScript</code> supports it just fine also.<br>&#xA;You could also go a completely different route. Since you'll only be sending information back when the form design is complete, you could do it with a <code>form submit</code>, for a bunch of hidden fields. Create your hidden fields using <code>JavaScript</code> and set the values as needed.<br>&#xA;This would probably be the best solution if didn't want to deal with <code>JSON/XML</code> at all.</p>&#xA;",),)
