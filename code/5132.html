(('<p>Just a bit of a question, is the reason they are choosing Grails because Groovy is closer in syntax to Java than Ruby, or because they want access to Java?</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>If it is the former, then I would say try to focus on Grails since that is what you will be using.  If it is the latter, you might want to see if the development team is open to using JRuby.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>I have never used Grails or Rails before, but I have used Groovy and Ruby before, and as a language I think Ruby is much cleaner and more consistent, and the team might enjoy production more.  As a platform, Rails has been out longer and has a lot of attention, so I would imagine it is a more stable platform to use with more fleshed out features.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>JRuby has full access to classes written in Java, so this is why I would say consider trying Rails.  If it is too late in the decision time to consider it then I guess you can just ignore this post.</p>&#xA;&#xA;<p>Basically, if you just want to hook in with Java, then JRuby is an option you should consider, but if the team is afraid of non-Java like syntax, maybe continue as is.</p>&#xA;',),)
