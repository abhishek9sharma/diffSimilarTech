several,faster
on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition

operations,execution,time,exponent
so ideally i want to have approximate relative times of elementary operations execution like multiplication typically takes 5 times more time than addition exponent is about 100 multiplication

speed,faster
the same speed as addition though still faster than multiplication

faster
but in many cases addition is faster than multiplication

time,faster
at the time this was faster because addition was a lot faster than multiplication but that s no longer the case

speed,operations,slower
if we look at the speed of operations multiplication is not drastically slower than addition

x,faster
instead of computing the slower it instead computed x + x because addition is faster than multiplication

faster,better,solution
in any case if addition is faster than multiplication a better solution might be to use a table and index by it

faster
i would also be moderately surprised if the multiplication actually was faster than the addition

pow,slower
yes pow is slower than multiplication multiplication is slower than addition

slower
multiplication is generally slower than addition

slower
multiplication is nearly always a lot slower than addition

technique,easy,better,serial
for multiplication the technique described at is a reasonably easy thing to implement and is better than serial addition

slower
if multiplication is slower than addition instead of doing

faster,shift
because addition is faster than multiplication and can be faster than shift

faster,somebody,well-versed
if the multiplication is truly faster than the addition then i expect somebody well-versed in byte code could explain why the load_fast for num is faster than the five operations for line 12

faster
even if addition is faster than multiplication i think that you will lose more because of the branching

integers,harder,slower,long,sufficient
for integers multiplication is harder than addition may be slower than addition etc but may still be very fast as long as there is sufficient cpu-power dedicated to it

integer,floating-point,faster,counterparts
my question is why do both integer and floating-point multiplication execute faster than their addition counterparts

sure,time
not sure about this but multiplication should take more time than addition so it s slowing it down ex

cpus,cycles,slower
other cpus take three or four cycles to do a multiplication which is a bit slower than addition

cheaper
addition is cheaper than multiplication

faster,division
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

1---------------------------------------------------

higher,precedence
for example since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition is read as not

more-expensive,calculators,higher,precedence
in arithmetic books and computer software and more-expensive calculators this means 12+ 34 56 not 12+34 56 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

oprator,higher,precedence
that s because the multiplication oprator has higher precedence than addition

precedence,rules,higher
this is valid under normal arithmetic operator precedence rules because multiplication has higher precedence than addition +

higher,precedence,+,c
multiplication has higher precedence than addition + which is why 2+3 4 is interpreted as 2+ 3 4 both in c and normal math

operator,lower,precedence
of course it is 10 because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator and so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2

class,sense,operator,higher,precedence
for example if you had a class in which it would make sense to do addition before multiplication how could you make the addition operator have higher precedence than the multiplication one

precedence,lower,higher
trig functions should have precedence lower than multiplication and higher than addition

higher,precedence,convention
since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition the same convention is used

higher,precedence,turn
note that the type cast has a higher precedence than multiplication which is in turn higher than addition 3 vs

higher,precedence
for example 1 + 2 3 is treated as 1 + 2 3 whereas 1 2 + 3 is treated as 1 2 + 3 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition +

strings,tighter,brackets
remember that multiplication even with strings binds tighter than addition so we must use brackets

precedence,relationship,higher
the precedence relationship is the same multiplication is higher then addition

binary,operator,higher,priority
they state that the binary multiplication operator has higher priority than the binary addition operator +

arithmetic,higher,precedence
in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition

akin,higher,precedence,sticks,output
that s akin to multiplication has higher precedence than addition so 3 sticks to 4 instead of 5 so the output is 17

higher,precedence
which doesn t do what you want because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

higher,precedence,subtraction
multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction

higher,precedence,left-associative,equivalent,first,second
multiplication is higher precedence than addition and addition is left-associative so this is equivalent to but knowing that only tells you that the first addition will happen before the second addition and that the multiplication will happen before the second addition

precedence,rules,higher
and the value of this expression evaluated according to the precedence rules is 62 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

numeric,expression,higher,precedence,subtraction
either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

lower,precedence,mathematics
or has a lower precedence than just as addition in mathematics has a lower precedence than multiplication

higher,precedence
because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

expensive
also remember multiplication is much more expensive than addition

standard,example,higher,precedence,simple,left-to-right
i assume that is parsed correctly because the two operators have different precedences meaning that associativity does not come into play and that your grammar correctly implements precedence although you should note that is a more standard example for showing that multiplication has higher precedence than addition since simple left-to-right parsing of gives the same result as your parser

grammar,higher,precedence
why with this grammar multiplication have higher precedence than addition

expressions,parentheses,higher,precedence
just like it would be possible to come up with arithmetic expressions that could be written with less parentheses if addition had a higher precedence than multiplication

slower,programers,several,tricks,haswell
it used to be that multiplication was slower than addition and programers used several tricks to avoid multiplication but with haswell it seems that it s the other way around

precedence,binary,operator,higher
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first

operator,higher,precedence
it is because multiplication operator has higher precedence over the addition + operator

higher,precedence
and has higher precedence than or just like multiplication has higher precedence than addition

processor,instruction,several,time,division,worse
it is well-known that the processor instruction for multiplication takes several times more time than addition division is even worse upd which is not true any more see below

brackets,optional,higher,precedence
and has higher precedence than or so the brackets are optional - in the same way as multiplication has higher precedence than addition so

expression,higher,precedence
so in your case an expression like 3+2 5 would yield 25 instead of 13 because addition is of higher precedence than multiplication

higher,precedence,equivalent
for example multiplication is of higher precedence than addition so 2 + 3 x 4 is equivalent to 2 + 3 x 4 not 2 + 3 x 4

higher,precedence
you probably already remember that multiplication is higher precedence than addition

terms,x,operator,higher,precedence
in technical terms the x multiplication operator has higher precedence than the + addition operator

higher,precedence,expression,equivalent
and as you hopefully knows multiplication have higher precedence than addition so the expression is equivalent to probably not what was intended by the macro writer

ruby,operator,higher,precedence
clearly ruby considers the multiplication operator to be of a higher precedence than the addition + operator

x,x|y,higher,precedence,pattern,equivalent
the difference is that in the second pattern the concatenation x followed by y in xy has higher precedence than the choice either x or y in x|y like multiplication has higher precedence than addition so the pattern is equivalent to

higher,precedence
of course multiplication has higher precedence binds more tightly than addition

division,higher,precedence,subtraction,parentheses
division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

expression,answer,operator,higher,precedence
for example in the expression 1 + 5 3 the answer is 16 and not 18 because the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition + operator

operators,higher,precedence,pemdas
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

higher,precedence,mean,expression
just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition

g.lower,g,higher,precedence
isinstance g str and g.lower or g multiplication is of higher precedence than addition

instance,arithmetic,higher,precedence
for instance in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition

guess,expensive
but i guess multiplication is more computationally expensive than addition

division,higher,precedence,parentheses
but that s not the case here since division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition and there are no parentheses involved

higher,precedence
the and operator has higher precedence than or just like multiplication has higher precedence than addition

expression,higher,precedence
you expression is then 7 + 5 7 + 5 which is 7 + 35 + 5 as multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

division,c++,slower,subtraction,c#
i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

higher,precedence
it s because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

higher,precedence
for example 1 + 2 3 is treated as 1 + 2 3 whereas 1 2 + 3 is treated as 1 2 + 3 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

precedence,mathematics,higher,priority
this is similar to operator precedence in mathematics where for example multiplication has a higher priority than addition

school,recall,harder,division
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication

parentheses,language,lower,precedence
since parentheses were used around the addition but not the multiplication we can infer that probably in this language addition has lower precedence than multiplication

order,operations,higher,precedence
mathematics clearly defines the order of operations as giving multiplication higher precedence than addition

b,c,lower,precedence
that is if you have then you are guaranteed that a happens before b and that b happens before c regardless of the fact that a is involved in an addition which is lower precedence than a multiplication

operator,precedence,higher
this line works because of operator precedence multiplication has a higher precedence than addition + so it will be done first

expensive,subtraction,division
multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

higher,precedence
multiplication has a higher precedence than addition so it is evaluated first

higher,operator,priority
multiplication has higher operator priority than addition in java

priority,a+1,macro
since multiplication has more priority than addition when you give a+1 to the macro it becomes 10 + 10 + 1 21

higher,operator,precedence,additions,value
multiplication has a higher operator precedence than addition so it s done before the two additions when calculating the value for a

unaries,tighter,operations,a_expr,m_expr
m_expr can expand to a u_expr because unaries bind tighter than multiplication operations and a_expr can expand to a m_expr because multiplication operations bind tighter than addition operations

order,operations,higher,priority,operators,operands
based on the order of operations e.g where multiplication is evaluated with higher priority than addition push the operators and operands onto a stack

statements,order,higher,precedence
associativity and precedence specify that the last two statements must be performed in that order since multiplication has higher precedence than addition

higher,precedence,grammar,reverse
usually multiplication has a higher precedence than addition but the grammar you have posted has the reverse that might be part of your problem

basics,division,higher,subtraction,esoteric
i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

higher,precedence
the multiplication has higher precedence and therefore binds more tightly than addition

division,higher,precedence
division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition so what this is actually doing is

expression,associativity,higher,precedence
an expression like binds as not because of associativity but because 2 multiplication has higher precedence that + 2 addition

2---------------------------------------------------

difficult
multiplication is not more difficult than repeated addition

harder
multiplication is much harder than addition

other---------------------------------------------------

strong,math,stronger
the reason for this is that and is strong than or it s like in math where multiplication is stronger than addition 3 5+3 15+3 18

expensive,machine,paralleliz,possible,stalls,time,loop
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loop than you would in the multiplication loop

specific,length
each operation takes a specific length and typically multiplication will take more than addition

multiplicative-expression,additive-expression,tighter
so every multiplicative-expression is an additive-expression but not vice-versa and this is what makes multiplication bind tighter than addition

ints,overhead,simple
as multiplication of ints has more overhead than simple addition

bottleneck,calculation,instruction,longer
the multiplication are the bottleneck of the calculation even though they may be one instruction a multiplication takes longer than an addition

divisible,divide,results,shorter,solution
start with the number you want to reach and if it s divisible by 5 then divide by 5 because multiplication by 5 results in a shorter solution than addition by 3

string,number,little,faster,common,action
i used instead of to convert the string to a number since addition is usually a little faster than multiplication and it s the more common way of performing that action see to force a string to be converted to a number add zero to that string

operations,jit,opcodes,relationship,cycles,faster,clock,clocks
in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

simple
though i was thinking the addition is more simple than multiplication

processors,point,expensive,compilers,x+x
on modern processors floating point multiplication is generally slightly more expensive than addition which is one reason why compilers will typically replace by x+x

algorithms,integer,circuit,log,slower,number
proposition when implemented in logic gates using the usual algorithms an integer multiplication circuit is o log n times slower than an addition circuit where n is the number of bits in a word

complex,operation,likely,slower,comparison
multiplication is a relatively complex operation and is likely to be slower than say addition or comparison

complex,solution,efficient,128-bit,flag
multiplication is more complex and you can reference the solution in the question efficient 128-bit addition using carry flag

advantage,idea,easier,exposure,rules
if memory serves this is the same technique slide rules used although they also took advantage of with the idea being that addition is easier than multiplication but my exposure to slide rules is limited to an eccentric high school physics teacher and a cryptographic teacher using it to explain certain tricks with big number math

operation,trivial
i know that addition operation is more trivial than multiplication operation
