suggestion,kernel
the cpu affinity is more like a suggestion to the kernel regarding which cpu to use

core,time,performance,better,vs
but i found if i do not set their cpu affinity that is they run on same core 0 the time performance get better than setting cpu affinity 8.76s vs 14.66s

better,load,average,single,core
cpu affinity it s better for the cpu to have a load average of 1.0 and processes to have affinity to a single core
