format,capable
the gif format is substantially less capable than png

bigger,alos,cant,use
also if i change all to png is not bigger and alos i am using prawn pdf outputting these images so cant use gif

edge,better,format,larger
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

newer,format,better,jpeg,screenshots
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

better,support,transparency,jpeg
for example png has better support for transparency than gif or jpeg

better,alpha,result
png gives you better alpha result than gif

better,colors,time
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

images,lossless,better,competition
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

format,better,compression
according to wikipedia the png format provides better compression than gif

better,use,format
while png is definitely better that gif occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in gif format

better,size.
many people don t know about 8-bit png which is usually better than gif in size.

animated,better,file,size
animated png is better than gif if we re focused on file size Ã¢ achieving a smaller file size was one of the reasons the apng format was designed

1---------------------------------------------------

wewtaco,file,wider,dimension,guess
wewtaco i noticed that your png file has wider dimension than the gif file and i am guess that could be a reason the black bars are showing up

index-color,files,smaller,doxygen
since that appears to generate index-color gif files which are smaller than the png files that doxygen generates

smaller,colour,group,pixels
gif is smaller because it s based on an colour palette of 256 colours rather than the separate rgb values for each pixel or group of pixels in jpg and png

8-bit,shim,smaller,dimension,pixel
a 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as planned

web,format,unlikely,limitations,colors,larger
it will always be a web format which basically comes down to jpg png and gif with gif being very unlikely because of its limitations gif can contain 256 colors at most and is generally larger than png

imagecopy,image,background,imagepng,output,better,compression,colors
you can then use imagecopy to insert each gif image including the background and imagepng to generate png output which is better for line art than jpeg offers better compression than gif and can support more than 256 colors

color,palette,smaller
but keep in mind that the gif color palette is way smaller than png

thing,note,smaller,palette,colors
one thing to note is that gif supports a smaller palette than png - only up to 256 colors

files,larger,equivalent,source,image
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

colors,smaller,time
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

file,smaller,oh,images
it might help to reduce your gif file sizes smaller oh and i believe -depth 8 can only be used for png images

smaller,optimisation,progams
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

wider,color,pallete,properitary
png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

transparent,background,file,colors,smaller,good
just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpg

applications,files,larger,simple,graphics
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

sure,matters,larger,files
i m not sure if this matters but the gif is significantly larger than the png files

smaller,average
convert it to png 10-30 smaller than gif on average

file,size,jpeg
i used gif because its file size 2.1kb was considerably less than png or jpeg in this case

regard,smaller,alpha,transparency,pixels,transparent,opaque,images,colors
but in that regard it is replaced by png which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where gif pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly gif images are limited to 256 colors

icon,size,smaller
icon size indexed png is often smaller than the same gif

other---------------------------------------------------

general,rule,worse,better,superior,compression
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

achieves,better,compression,pre-filtering,step,wikipedia,explanation,filtering
png achieves better compression than gif because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of png filtering

paul,static,line,art,better,situation
paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation
