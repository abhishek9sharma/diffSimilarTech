jquery,ui,page,id,anchor
i am using jquery ui dialog to show more than one pop-up on one page each pop-up will have its own id and it will be triggered by an anchor with a attribute

divs,modal,better
use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up

alternative,startling,boxes,intrusive,windows
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows

better,option,login,main,page
generally a pop-up is a better option for a login dialog and a pop-up would allow you to easily navigate to the main page

feed,intrusive,sense,facebook,window
feed dialog is more intrusive in the sense that it has a facebook pop-up window

easier,window,contents
dialog makes it easier for you to create a pop-up window with customized contents
