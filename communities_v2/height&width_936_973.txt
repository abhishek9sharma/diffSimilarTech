0---------------------------------------------------

image,greater,.png,generated,smaller
more specifically if the image height is greater than the width the generated height will be the same as the resulting .png s height but the generated width will be slightly smaller

squares,rectangles,greater,closer,north
this is to make grid consist of squares instead of having them look like rectangles with height few times greater than width closer to the north and south poles

ratio,imageview,image
the images ratio does not fit with imageview s width and height or the image width or height is less then the imageview s width or height

image,greater,original
then since width of your image is greater than height multiply the original width and height by 250 498

greater,x
our height y is greater than width x

greater,img,height.
or div s width and height is greater than img s width and height.

ratio,large,number,real,smaller
in this case if i want to have a fixed width while keeping ratio i just set height to a very large number so that the resizer will actually ignore it since the ratio of real height to desired height is far smaller than the ratio of real width and desired width

greater,individual,page
if the width is greater than the height of an individual page add a dictionary entry to that page and explicitly set it s rotation

min-width,pixel,count,higher,element,size
if the fixed min-width height pixel count is higher than the width height set on the element then the element will be the size of the fixed min-width height and the element size wont look the same across all monitors

place,image,file
for this you can create a new transparent png or white 200 200 jpg and place the newly generated image apprioriately i.e if height is less place it vertically centered or if the width is less place it horizontally centered and save that file

lower,imagebuttons,image,imageview
my problem is that lower imagebuttons are not shown whenever height of image in imageview is more than its width

isolation,verify,larger,scalr.mode.fit_to_width
personally i would extract it to a separate class just so that i could in isolation verify that given a width larger than a height i was returned a scalr.mode.fit_to_width and vice-versa

greater,swaps,calculation
this is the same as before if height is greater than width and swaps the calculation logic for the two directions otherwise

property,images,greater
what i was looking to do was to assign a width property of 100 if the height of the images is greater than the width and the height if the width is greater than the height

cell,sizes,section,inset
i have also messed with various cell sizes width 1 less than height height 1 less than width etc and messed around with some section inset combinations but have not managed to find the source of this issue that is causing the animated view to not to show up

outer,div,smaller,contents
how can i make the outer div height and width never be any smaller than the height and width of its contents

square,uiimage,larger
although the uiimageview is square the uiimage s height is much larger than the width

larger
the canvas height is slightly larger than the width

popup,display,size,larger,css
when you are using the orientation landscape you have to consider whether the keyboard popup will change the display once the width size is larger than the height size the css will consider it as landscape

smaller,able,issue
if the width is still smaller than the height adjust it manually and you should be able to fix your issue

greater
this should work as long as the height is never greater than the width

experia,model.whose,less.this,particular,layout,fine,physical,devices.like
please help...this is the problem of one sony experia model.whose height is more but width is less.this particular layout is working fine where the height and width is almost adjusted in physical devices.like samsung and htc

problem,screen,bigger,image
but the problem is because the screen height is bigger than the width is makes image looks expanded in height like this

image,square,larger
the right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the height

screen
unless the screen height is less than 580px or width less than 930px

larger,aspect,fit,uiimageview
however if the height is larger than the width aspect fit will increase the height of the uiimageview

image,greater
otherwise if the height of the image id greater than its width

110px,relevant,bigger
height 110px | width relevant to the height if the width is bigger than height

views,larger
it breaks in case of views with width comparatively larger than height

greater,landscape,printing
now additionaly i would like to detect if the printed width is greater than the printed height and then change to landscape printing

viewer,landscape,greater
the printer sees and feeds them as portrait no rotation but the report viewer prints them landscape because the width is greater than the height

landscape,mode,greater,phone,portrait
and i want to show the video in the landscape mode if the height is greater then the width of the phone otherwise to show the video in the portrait mode

image,screen,smaller,max-width,auto,css
and to resize the image proportionally when the screen width is smaller than 1000px i set the max-width as 100 and height as auto using css

top
to avoid cropping either top if width is more or left if height is

jquery,javascript,table,div,smaller
using jquery of javascript you can get the height of the table and set the div to be slightly smaller than the width you retrieved from the table

select,images,bigger
when i select images which height is bigger than width

portrait,device,smaller
if you have a portrait device the width is smaller than the height

pixels,thumbnail,visible,new,image,aspect,ratio
i want to make an 100x100 pixels thumbnail of it and in this case because the height is less than the width the height should be 100 visible on the new image and the width should keep the aspect ratio of the image

xml,tag,bigger,oval
in your xml the tag specifies height bigger than width hence the oval

first,orientation,longer,textureview,degrees
so when playback i first check the orientation of the video by measuring width and height and if width is longer than height rotate textureview by 90 degrees by below code

viewport,equal,greater,landscape
if you resize your browser window to still have a viewport with a with equal or less than 1024px but have an height greater than your width the viewport is no longer considered to be in landscape mode but switch to portrait mode

problem,hit,bigger
the problem i hit is when the width is bigger than the height

widthmeasurespec,item,larger
surprisingly if i set the heightmeasurespec to a lesser value than widthmeasurespec still the item height gets larger than the width

cameras,server,greater
the uploaded images taken on cameras arrive on the server with a width greater than the height regardless of how they were shot

larger
now if you get these confused and use the height for the width and the height is larger than the width this is going to blow up

view,keyobard,available,screen,higher,change,orientation
it is quite interesting since you are in portrait view but when keyobard is shown width of the available screen is higher than height and that change orientation to landscape

images,greater,class,parent
basically i m comparing the images height to it s width and then if its height is greater than it s width i m adding a class to it s parent called horizontal that has the appropriate styles

total,images,greater,screen,br
in that case if the total images width height is greater then the screen s width height it will just cut off. br

picture,greater
the width of the picture is greater than the height

vertices,editable,rectangle,greater
i have an application which has a rectangle on a google map at the certain point i have to rotate the rectangle along the vertices as well as it should be editable but the width of the rectangle should be always greater than its height

greater,min-aspect-ratio
if you want to target any case when width is greater than height i think something like min-aspect-ratio 101 100 or something like this might work

attributes,svg,bigger,iframe,element
you can change the width and height attributes on the referenced svg if they are bigger than the width and height on the iframe element you should get scrollbars

img,#clock,clock,viewport,greater
likewise if we change img and #clock to have a defined width instead of a defined height then we have a clock that can scale properly but only if the viewport height is greater than the width

sql,server,greater
i m trying to generate a multiplication table with t-sql in microsoft sql server 2012 and have been stuck on cases where width is greater than height

compattible,menu,page,loads
i am trying to make my html page tablet compattible by trying to hide the menu if width is less than height it works when page loads but when i change the orientation of tablet the menu div remains at its place

x,window,greater,user,device
the problem is that when i move to an android device whose orientation is landscape by default the device s hardware is arranged in such a way that it is clear it is intended to be used mainly in landscape orientation the x and y coordinates are reversed and the fact that the window s height is greater than its width can t be used to determine whether the user is holding the device with it s top up and its bottom down

load,viewport
or does it only load the portrait.css file on page load and if the viewport width is already less than its height

image,style,portrait,mode,larger
i was wondering how to get the height and width of an image if i m rendering it react style so i can process it to flip it to portrait mode if the width is larger than the height

image,larger,value,space,smaller
specifically i take the image s height and width and then divide both by larger value 300 so that the aspect ratio is maintained and the image is optimized to fit in the space i have designed for it a width that is never smaller than 320 and a height that is always exactly 320

ratio,maths,larger
in this post he used 56.25 to make a ratio of 16 9 while i understand the maths 100 16 9 it doesn t seem to be the case if the height is larger than the width

smaller,horizontal,rectangles
is there a way to change the height so that its smaller than the width to make horizontal rectangles

larger
so the height must be 1.24 times larger than the width

auto,smaller,insufficient
auto shrink only seems to apply when the width is smaller than needed and not when the height is insufficient

image,smaller,equal,crop,aspect,unchanged
if the height of the image is smaller than the width i set the height to be equal to the width and crop the width accordingly with aspect unchanged

bigger,pictures,img
because the width was bigger than the height of the pictures the img element was too small and the rotated picture overlaid some of the text above and below

ways,image,code
i ve tried 2 ways of rotating the image when the width is less than the height both are in this code

page,wider,desktop,simulator
you can see the page s width is wider than the height but when the app runs on a desktop or a simulator device like 7 pad the extra space is pushed into the top and the bottom

approaches,element,larger,scale,elliptical,tweaking,attributes,changes
other approaches like making the element s width larger than height or using scale would result in an elliptical arc and it would also require tweaking to positioning attributes when height or width changes

image,bigger,minumum,zoom
my image has the width bigger than the height so i want that the minumum zoom is the width

browser,div.banner,div.title
if browser width is less than 1670px and height of div.banner is less than 1253px then let div.title and div.social s parent be div.banner else let the parent of div.title and div.social be the body or browser window

new,row,greater
add a new row until height is greater than width

mode,window,larger
portrait mode is when the window height is larger than window width

image,greater
these are the cases if the image width is greater than 2048 then we need to scale down to 2048 same as if the image height is greater than 1229 then we need to scale down to 1229

8th,area,dialog,taller,wider
i interpred this to mean that for example the width will be 5 8th of the width of the working area unless this results in the dialog which is taller than the height of the working area in which case it will use a wider width

table,cell,bigger,whole
but in safari browser the table cell height is bigger than the width i did not set the whole table dimensions

portrait,orientation,smaller
portrait orientation is that one where the width smaller than the height

hand,image,greater,show
on the other hand i uploaded an image with height much greater than width but it doesn t show

browser,bigger
therefore when i get my browser bigger width gets bigger as well as height

smaller
and the height is smaller than the width physically

image,greater,crop
if an image s height is greater than the width i want to switch to the height crop else keep the width crop

grater,imageview,adjustviewbounds,property,size,use,scaletype
there is two case if your actual image size is equal or grater than your imageview width and height then you can use adjustviewbounds property and if your actual image size is less than imageview width and height than use scaletype property to shown image in imageview based on your requirement

ratio,text,box,smaller,area
the height width ratio since the height of the text box is relatively smaller than the width and the area of the text box

image,greater
if the height of the image is greater than the width i just want to crop the height

auto,picture,greater,div,image
i want the div to auto adjust for the picture so if the height is greater than the width then the div should adjust to the image s size

storyboard,image,greater
currently i am using the universal storyboard and want the image to be 3 4 so the height needs to be 33 greater than the width

greater,screen.width
if the width is greater then height 3 4 screen.width then

greater,image
if the height is greater than the width then scale the image to 200px width

bar,controller,smaller,gutter
the presence of a tab bar controller was enough to make the height 768 - 20 - 49 699 just smaller than the width 1024 - 320 - 1 gutter 703

id,screen,greater,h
all i need is simply to append a w to the end of the div id if the screen width is greater than the height or an h if the height is greater

settings,larger
you ll need to change the width and height settings so that the width is larger than the height

facebookâ,database,larger,maximum,image,notification,entire,allowable
second if a notification image is displayed from facebookâ s database and the height is larger than the width and also the height exceeds the maximum image height for the notification the entire image will be resized to fit the maximum allowable height for the notification image leaving white vertical bars on either side

run,time,greater,match,parent,wrapcontent,vice
in addition to that you can also check at run time if width is greater than height programmatically set width as match parent and height as wrapcontent and vice versa

laptop,screens,greater
so the majority of desktop and laptop screens nowadays have a width greater than the height

new,result,trapezoid
so if you want to draw a trapezoid the adjustment must be calculated like this subtract the top of the trapezoid to the base divide by 2 the result and divide the new result by the height of the trapezoid if the height is less than its width or by its width in the other case

max-height,effect,greater
similarly max-height will be in effect when height is greater than width

longer,labels
you may even make its height longer than its width to let the labels spread out

devices,smaller,card,90deg
if the devices width is smaller than its height the card should also rotate 90deg

image,larger,reality
it seems like image in width is larger then the image in height where as it is not in reality

greater,rows,columns
in the case the height is greater than width simply not all the rows will be used but all of the columns must always be used

image,larger,portrait,pixels,scale,appropriate,value
if image height is larger than width portrait then scale the width to 1024 pixels and scale the height to appropriate value to maintain aspect ratio

page,greater,device
when the width of the page is greater than the height the device is

orientation,device,greater,tablet,mobile
the logic is that the default orientation for a device who s width is greater than it s height is most likely a tablet and not a mobile phone device

frame,tableviewincell,larger,cell,heywire
if i set the frame of the tableviewincell to a width larger than the height of the containing cell then it goes heywire

margin,divs,smaller,aspect,ratio
when i add a margin to the divs the width becomes smaller and the height stays the same so the aspect ratio changes

problem,image,higher,listview
the problem that i have is that some image the height is higher than width and then the listview looks like this

image,degrees,greater
in some scenarios i can prevent the image from getting too torn apart by rotating the image 90 degrees if the width of the image is greater than the height of the image

portrait,photo,greater
when working with a portrait photo the height is greater than the width

logic,image,x,product,greater,new,values,large
i ve used resize_to_fit to reduce images to a specific pixel size depending on the longer side but i m wondering if it s possible to do it with this logic instead for any image whose width x height product is greater than a set value resize the image so that the new width and height values are as large as possible while still being under that value

mode,stream,greater,laptop
i am making a webrtc video call between a mobile and laptop the mobile is in portrait mode so it sends the stream with the height greater than width and the laptop send the stream with the aspect ratio reversed

smaller,larger,whole
if the width gets smaller the height should get larger accordingly to display the whole content

wrapper,containers,larger
but if i look at in the firefox responsive design developer mode the circle takes always more space than it should when the wrapper containers height is larger than its width -

code,view,top,greater,bitmaptosave
however nowhere in the code have you checked that the width of the view added to the top of the view is not greater than the height of bitmaptosave

query,images,greater,landscape,image
i updated the query to select only images whose width was greater than the height so as to only select a landscape image

approach,work,container,larger,child,parent
this approach doesn t work when the width of the container is larger than the height as the child overflows the parent as demonstrated in the following snippet

auto,scrollable,bigger,screen,vertical
try to change overflow hidden to overflow auto this should make it scrollable horizontally if width is bigger than screen and vertical if height is

opposite,greater,pixels,scale
and opposite if height is greater than width then resize height to 500 pixels and scale width accordingly

matrix,greater,square
in the case the matrix s width is greater than height it will be padded with 1 s to make the matrix square

container,fluid,harder,browser
edit okay so the real problem comes when you try and make your container that fluid because height is harder for a browser to calculate than width

container,length,smaller,image
basically it should check weather container length or height is smaller compared to image width and height normalized and adapt it to that

query,device,larger
how would i write a media query for when the device height is larger than device width or vice-versa

larger,angle
if the width is larger than the height then width and height are swapped and the angle is corrected

greater,vice
this assumes that height is greater than the width and vice versa

sizes,images,greater
working with image sizes i need a regular expression which returns sizes of images which their height is greater than their width

x,greater
but you only want it to be negative when x is greater than the width or y is greater than the height

landscape,i.e,greater
take screenshot of rotated screen and while uploading turn the dimension to portrait if their dimension is landscape i.e width is greater than height

attributes,pixels,badge
the width and height attributes should be two pixels less than the width and height of your badge

bigger,y-axis,wrapper,distorted
the code that i have so far seems to work as expected when the x-axis of the wrapper is bigger than the y-axis width height but for some reason when the height of the wrapper is bigger than width it gets all distorted

current,size,greater
how can i call this method manually and pass the current size in which width is greater than the height

png,image,greater
so this script will take a jpg gif of png image resize it to 110px width if width is greater of 110px height if height is greater

tools,rectangle,pens,program,draw
when i want to draw a rectangle in c# using pen tools if the rectangle width and height is less then the pens width then program draw nothing in from if pens alignment property inset .but when i set alignment center then it print a rectangle

window,tall,greater,header,footer
i d like to do this with media queries so that if someone on a mac with a big monitor has their browser window sized so that it s very tall height is greater than width they would see a header and footer

bigger
also make it so it ll always be centered horizontally and vertically and the width will always be 1.5x bigger than the height

version,image,larger,screen,lay
if i have a writeablebitmap version of my image and either the height or width whichever is larger is scaled to be either the screen height or width then how might i over lay that image on top of another image that is the page size to make the image become a full screen image

image,landscape,bigger
yet when i save the image the image his in landscape width is bigger than height

circle,greater
then the circle gets vertically centred because the height is greater than the width

greater,portrait,mode
however the height was greater than the width indicating it was still in portrait mode .

parameter,size,greater
my question is how can i call the reorientation method viewwilltransitiontosize manually and pass a size parameter in which the size width is greater than the height

portrai,css
so whenever width is less than height this shall be a portrai eventually will load your css file even if the original screen was initialized at landscape

classes,viewport,greater
you could also do some magic with jquery on orientationchange and toggle some classes when viewport width is greater as viewport height

photo,properties,lower,bigger
the problem i m experiencing is that when i use javascript to grab a portrait photo s properties when it s loading the height is significantly lower than what it should be and the width is bigger than it should be

class,screen,greater,portrait
on pageshow or pagebeforeshow add that class if screen height is greater than width portrait

ratio,bigger
you have to calculate a ratio like this when width is bigger than height

larger,crops,image
but when i stretch the width to be larger than the height it crops the image even if i switch to object-fit contain

landscape,bigger,top,bottom
on landscape as the width is bigger than the height you should set top and bottom 0 and ratio 1 1 and center it horizontally in container

greater
how can i detect if the printed width is greater than the printed height

images,smaller,tall
so something happens with the images that their width is smaller than their height or images that are tall

ratio,sure,larger,maximum
one that maintains the aspect ratio one that makes sure the width is no larger than the maximum and one that makes sure the height is no larger than the maximum

paintcomponent,method,last,call,original,image,smaller,scaling
i wouldn t scale the image every single time in the paintcomponent method but do it once if the width and height have been changed since the last call and in that case recreate a bufferedimage containing the image which you blit every single time before calling the superclass paintcomponent scaled up to the right size use something like image scaling does not work when original image height width is smaller the scaling height width

depth,little
that is the height is more than half the width and depth -- little rule of thumb

frame,greater,picture,pictures,frames
a picture can be put in a frame if the frame width and height is greater than the picture width and height the pictures and frames cannot be rotated

longer,screen,portrait
if the height is longer than the width the screen is in portrait mode otherwise it is landscape

page,format,smaller,a4,paper
if i set the page format with height is smaller than width it is treating it as a4 paper and feed the bottom of the paper

view,greater,able,colorimageview,equal,priority
when the view s width is greater than its height it won t be able to make the colorimageview s width equal to the view s width but that s ok since the priority is 750

portrait,page
is set to portrait if the page width is less than the page height

user,browser,possible,larger,viewport
so its width is the width of the user s browser minus as much as possible without making them larger than 90 height of the viewport

load,square,smaller
so how can i set the image to load as a square and be 100 width if the width is smaller than the height and 100 height if the height is smaller than the width

greater,variables
if the height is greater than the width just reverse the width and height variables

browser,orientation,bigger,round
i m not fully sure how this should work on desktops but i m pretty sure that when you resize the browser the orientation should change provided the height was bigger than the width and after resizing it s the other way round

observation,moment,lower,ssrs,landscape
i ve tried setting this up in the report properties but as per my observation the moment the height becomes lower than the width ssrs will automatically convert it to landscape

images,portrait
above images are portrait but if you calculate height and width you will find that width is more than height

landscape,size,shorter,things
so if an image is in landscape size the width is shorter than the height which throws things off

image,larger,fitstart,fitend
if image height is larger than width then scaletypes fitstart fitend and fitcenter don t work

aspect,ratio
if width is way more than height for the 16 9 aspect ratio it s still scaled appropriately just missing the top bottom part of the video in see-able view

image,values,bigger,scale
i would like somehow to fit the image to scale it normally without setting up fixed values for width and height so if the width is bigger - scale the height and if height is bigger - scale the width

android,fragment1,display,greater,fragment2,getwidth
i am trying to use fragments in android and want to display fragment1 when width of display is greater than height of display and fragment2 when height of display is greater than width of display but when using getwidth and getheight android studio is saying that these methods are depricated

first,lines,dialog,works,uncommented,smaller,content,overflows
the first two commented lines for setting width and height of dialog works but second two uncommented lines does not work displayed height is slightly smaller than it should be and content overflows vertically width is ok

program,larger,computer
once again my question is why is my program crashing if the width is larger than the height when the computer plays

view,greater,able,constraints,colorview,lessthanorequalto
when the view s height is greater than its width it will be able to satisfy all constraints because the colorview s height is lessthanorequalto the view s height

check,window,greater,order,user
i check to see if the window s width is greater than its height in order to determine if the user is holding the device in landscape or portrait mode and i translate the data that the accelerometer provides based on that fact

pdf,output,greater
still my pdf output s height is greater than the width

options,real,bigger,smaller,virtual,sure,best
if you wan to account for all the possible options real height width bigger smaller than virtual height width and to make sure that the best configuration is delivered the rescaling occurs such that the available space is maximised it is not so straightforward

figure,smaller
with this gives you a figure of which the height is 300x smaller than the width

top,image,browser,shorter,content
the top image is 100 width of the browser but shorter than 100 height of the browser so the content peeks up a little bit the tops of the two images below are showing

problem,window,bigger
but with iframe it is a problem - window height is always bigger than width

highcharts,datalabel,bar
i have created a chart using highcharts and i want to disable any datalabel if its width is more than height of its bar bar cannot accomodate the datalabel

phone,screen,narrower,page,full
if i display the app on an android phone and the screen in held vertically width is narrower than height then the rendering the page does not occupy full width stuck at 95 or so

custom,page,higher
i just want to set the custom page width and height page width is higher than page height

greater,orientation,landscape
if width is greater than height you know that the orientation changed to landscape

portrait,images,higher,orientation
note if you are sure that image is portrait if and only if your images height is higher than its width you could measure them to find its orientation

wider
it seems like you re trying to make the width of the video wider than the height

msoshapetrapezoid,coefficient,form
i have been struggling with this problem during a couple of hours and i have found that the adjustment for the msoshapetrapezoid is a coefficient that must be multiplied by the width of the form if the width is less than the height or by the height of the form if the height is less than the width

reverse,row,bigger,number,column
but the measurement is reverse row height shows bigger number than column width

device,sizes,matter,keeps,smaller
when i set it off height width but i d like it to stretch so it supports other device sizes ....i need the height to stretch as well though which does not happen no matter what i tried height keeps turning out smaller than width

monopsace,characters,bigger
to answer your question monopsace characters have often a height two times bigger than their width

greater,device,coordinate,image
so you can get your image coordinates before moving it and you can compute measure of movement in your ontouchlistener class.now if x coordinate of your image plus horizontal movement that you computed be greater than device width or y coordinate of your image plus vertical movement that you computed be greater than device height your image not move

words,image,space,bottom
in other words when the image s width is more than it s height then there will be an space in between the bottom border of the uiimageview and the image itself

condition,image,bigger,equal,smaller,trouble,variables
i need to apply a condition in the case that an image s width is bigger than equal to or smaller than height but i m in trouble when i try to compare the variables

pages,ways,larger,page,rotation
landscape pages can be created in 2 ways set a width larger than the height or set the page rotation to 90 or 270 degrees for a portrait page

minimum,metric,multi-window,mode,smaller
the solution is to choose the minimum metric between width and height since in multi-window mode the height can be smaller than the width

viewport,banner,size
which means if viewport width is more than 970 and viewport height is more than 0 serve banner with size 300x250

larger
if width is larger than height

snippet,previous,smaller,equal
this second snippet is the same as the previous one but now the height is 20 smaller than the width it was equal on the previous example plus have a max-height limit of 100px

code,image,vice
i have tried following code but it distorts the image if height is more than width but looks perfectly if it is vice versa

second,image,greater
this is because the height of the second image is greater than the width

longer,35px,start
as the width gets longer the height increases by the same but i don t want the height to exceed 35px nor start with below 5px

smaller,div,image,position
one way you can do it is to check if the position of the mouse is within the div boundaries if the x position is smaller than the div s width minus the width of the image as you don t want the image to cross the div s border and if the y position is smaller than the height of the div minus the height of the image

last,image,value,higher
create a new class for the last image i called it landscape2 in my jsfiddle as the last image is the only one with width value higher than the height value

scroll,bar,horizontal
you will get a vertical scroll bar when the height increases more than 500px and a horizontal scroll bar if the width increases more than 250px

word,landscaped,greater
for word to recognize it as landscaped the width must be greater than the height

image,class,particular
if the image width is less than the image height i want to add class a to that particular image if not i want to add class b to that particular image

uiscreen,mainscreen,greater,actual,dimensions
if uiscreen mainscreen knows that i really want the height to be greater than the width whether or not i actually do how can i either query the actual dimensions or query whether the device is in portrait mode or landscape

bottle,thumb,bigger,visible
bottle thumb height is much bigger than width are only partly visible

mode,image
for the portrait mode and when image height is less than image width

iframe,scrollbars,offsetwidth,scroll,higher,increase,scrollbar,prolly
you could adjust the height of the iframe if the scrollbars are present just check the iframes scrollwidth against it s offsetwidth and if the scroll width is higher increase the height of the iframe by the height of the scrollbar prolly 5-10px i d have to check to be sure

orientation,window,higher
this demo illustrate the change from landscape to portrait using css orientation when the window height is higher than its width

image,container,bigger,actual
with this code image will be stretched if image container width is bigger then image actual height

greater
now the width is here greater than equals to 42.0 and the height is greater than equals to 21.0

image,higher,lines,output
but when i try to upload an image with a width higher than the height i see that the lines that output vh vw return zero

browser,land,scape
if the width of the browser is more than height it is land scape otherwise it is portrait

image,higher,opposite,value
it should look wheter the image width is higher than its height and the opposite and according to that set a height or width and the other value height width should be set proportionally so it won t get stretched

larger,undefined,behaviour
if width is larger than height you get undefined behaviour probably writing into random memory under which anything can happen

landscape,setting,longer
the webview is in landscape setting width longer than the height

larger,portrait,image,phone,aspect,ratio
if the height is larger than the width a portrait image the image should be scaled to fit the height of the phone and width should then adjust to keep the aspect ratio i ve had a bit of trouble getting this to work here s what i ve done so far though any help would be greatly appreciated

check,greater
1 check if width is greater than height

larger,landscape
you can check wether the width larger is than the height which is landscape

window,bigger,portrait,landscape
if window height is bigger then window width the we have a portrait or in any other case we have a landscape orientation

image,greater,degrees
if the height of the image is greater than the width then i rotate the image by 270 degrees

greater,screen
then i check if the width of the video is greater than the height and rotate the screen

scale,degree,smaller,image,widths,container,proportion,longer
right now i scale by height which works to some degree however as the width gets smaller the image gallery will be cut off as the container has overflow hidden on some smaller widths as it is adjusting by the height of the container to stay in proportion but doesn t consider the width of the container too essentially the width is longer than the container width

bigger,unallocated,arrays
if height is bigger than width then this will result in unallocated arrays for some of the in your code as it stands

device,wider
hover toggles the height width when device width is wider than 768px while a click toggles the height width when device width is less than 768px

spacing,browser,taller
also if you keep a fixed aspect ratio you are going to have very funny spacing if the browser height is taller than the width

size,viewport,greater,display
but a workaround could be to detect the size of the viewport if the width is greater than the height display normally

lower,dimension,higher
most devices seem to recognize the highest dimension as the max-width but some amazon kindle 2 appear to treat lower dimension as the width and higher as the height

cells,exact,new,line,cell,table
my solution was to use a php variable and increment it on each generated then if i have let s say 13 rows it echoes but the cells must have an exact width so it may add a new line of text if i have a longer text on a cell and the table will have more than 1280px height

landscape,screen,greater
and for landscape width of the screen is greater than height

others,larger,fit,properly.that
others because the width is larger than the height doesn t fit properly.that s why i crop them they must be centered in order to make sence

crop,image,greater,dimensions,equal,left,corner
you may need to crop if the image height is greater than the width so i decided to crop with dimensions equal to the width from the to left corner most likely you wont miss the face of the person this way

x,dimensions,greater
only elements and which determine the scaling in the x and y dimensions are calculated differently if width is greater than height

bigger
it works well when height is bigger than width but it does not work when width is bigger than height

but when i select an area where width and height varies in which height is more than width as the cropped image then i am not getting cropped image as height and width as 160px like as shown below

greater
if the height is greater than the width

scale,image,bigger,max
resize scale image only if the width height is bigger than 1000px so that the resulting image s max width height is 1000px or less

100vmax,equal,smaller,unit,larger
if a user s screen had a resolution of 1000x800px 100vmin would be equal to 800px and 100vmax would be equal to 1000px as the height here is the smaller unit and the width is the larger unit

greater
actually it s not even but rather since its width is greater than its height

orientation,portrait,higher,least,javascript
still not managed yet to detect orientation correctly because now for some reason when portrait - width is still higher than height with is 960 at least that what javascript see but in reality it is not going over boundaries which are 768px

larger
if height is larger than width

greater
height is greater than width

bigger,auto
if the width is bigger than the height i want the height to be set to auto

screen,landscape,larger,portrait,mode,css
however if you want to redesign your layout or make adjustments based on wether the screen is in landscape width is larger than height or portrait height is larger than width mode you can definitely use css media queries

image,greater,250px,auto
specifically if an image s width is greater than 250px resize it so the height is 250px and the width auto

longer
in between 768 1024 and only when width is longer than height

smaller,sizes
but now when i scale down the background image is not scaled down to smaller sizes if the height is more than the width

ratio,image,screen
if the width to height ratio of the image is more than the width to height ratio of the screen then you know you ll be using the screen width and calculating the height

pages,landscape,bigger
pages are landscape if their width is bigger than their height

matter,#content,naturalsize,ratio,container,smaller,original,black,bars
check it out it doesn t matter the width you set to the #content because naturalsize checks the ratio and the container s width and sets a smaller height for the video than the original preventing the black bars appearing in original video height with a smaller width

javascript,child,element
the javascript comes in only when width is more than the height and then what it does it sets the width of the child to be the height of the element

your and are static which means and are always they same aswell respectively 5.1785714285714 and 2.55625 so width ratio is always higher then height ratio

imageview,check,image,greater
while setting it to the imageview check if the width of the image is greater than height or not and rotate it to 90 if needed

page
this seems to happen only when the page s height is less than its width

proportions,image,larger,font-size,text
if you dont want to crop the image at all or use javascript i think your only choice is to force the text element to have the same proportions as the image with width approximately being 50 larger than height and then adjust the font-size text elements to fit the container

plots,uniform,taller,others
modify the height and width of the plots so that all four have uniform width one is substantially taller than the others which have uniform height among them

screen,smaller,white,circle,radius
if the screen width is smaller than the height i need the white circle s radius to be width 2 and if the height is smaller than the width i need the circle s radius to be height 2

greater
you are checking whether the width which starts out at 350px is greater than height 325 and whether height 325 is greater than width 350

100wh,bigger,100vh,crop,view,max,youre,browser
if the height of the video with width 100wh is bigger then the height 100vh i want the video to crop so it will be on fullscreen view on the max with and height youre browser

area,points,smaller,well,greater
then we can calculate the width and height of the area for that 4 points and pick the smaller one well sometime width can be greater than height i guess.

longer,src_x,src_y
meaning if s width is longer src_x has to be 0 and if height is longer src_y has to be 0

view,larger,boxes
essentially i detect if the view s width is larger than the height and if so rotate the view that contains the boxes

rotateimg,class,greater

if the images height side is larger than the width resize the image so that the width matches the divs width and hide the height overflow after vertically centering

greater
assuming the width is greater than the height

timagelist,property,greater,constructor,limitations,setters

code,problem,greater,equal
edit this code solves your problem given height is greater than or equal to width

wrap_content,aspect,ratio,fixed
but i can see if i give width as wrap_content then height is less than fixed height because keeping aspect ratio height corresponding to wrap_content width is less fixed height

greater,layout,right
regardless setting height greater than width is needed to get the layout right between browsers

browser,smaller,image,text,centre
i.e if the browser height goes smaller the image will scale down while not overlapping or going under the text and staying centre same goes for width

aspect,ratio,vision,framework,detect,rectangles,bigger
i believe the aspect ratio is defined as width height so does that mean that the vision framework cannot detect rectangles that have a width bigger than height

weird,cause,bigger,value
this is weird cause i would figure that the width should have a bigger value than the height right now

smaller,higher
also if the width is smaller it will start flashing a higher height

bigger
for some of them the width is much more bigger than the height for some of them the height is much more bigger than the width and for some of them height and width are almost the same

issue,image,greater,white,space,right,fine
my issue is if the image height is greater than the width there is a lot of white space left to the right of the image see attached however the height is fine

monitors,desktop,bigger,boxes,smaller
another problem is if use multiple monitors together for viewing desktop the width will be very bigger than the height so the boxes will have smaller height and bigger width

bigger
width is always bigger than height

landscape,longer
landscape and even though the width is given as longer than the height

attribute,images,larger
so if i set height attribute to 40 i might find myself with images larger than 120 width

orientation,picture,greater
according to the exif-information the orientation is 0 so supposedly the picture is not rotated - but since the width is greater than the height the picture is in fact rotated

notes,circumstance,image,minimum,zoomscale,uiscrollview,zoom
now i can see the image and just fit the screen nicely but the image is just at the top of uiscrollview . notes in this circumstance the width of my image after being zoomed to minimum zoomscale equals to the width of uiscrollview the height of my image after being zoom to minimum zoomscale less than the width of uiscrollview

image,larger,lines,code
since the width of your image is larger than the height you need to basically reverse these three lines of code

user,phone
if the height is less than your width it means the user was holding the phone horizontally so you have to rotate it

flag,usable,larger
i suspect ios just sets the landscape flag if the usable width is larger than the usable height

panning,image,larger,screen
i have a code which zooms and pans the imageview matrix it works well but i want the imageview to not be zoomed smaller than my screen and i don t want it to be zoomed very much i want to set a limit for zooming and to the same thing for dragging panning it should pan horizontally if image s width is larger than screen and it should pan vertically if image s height is larger than the screen how can i achieve this result

parent,lower
parent s height is lower than its width

image,larger,solution,space
if your image s width is larger than its height then mark s solution will leave space at the top and bottom of the screen

event,testing
your best bet would be describing to windows.current.sizechanged event and testing if width is more than height

image,longer
now this works when the width of an image is longer than its height but not the other way around

frame,values,larger,ratio,leg
for any frame with width values larger than the height a 1 ratio the leg will begin to stretch unproportionally

check,images,bigger,visa,equal
i m then attempting to use jquery to run a check on whether or not the images height is bigger than it s width visa versa or they are equal

position,larger
left position in fixed worked probably due to the fact that it s width is larger than it s height

and if the bitmap s height is greater than maxheight or the width is greater than maxwidth i d like to proportionally resize the image so that it fits in maxwidth x maxheight

intersection,greater,ball,bottom
if the intersection width is greater than the intersection height the ball has hit in the bottom or vertical sides of the brick

larger
height is usually larger than width

classes,sizes,greater
the mediasize class and all of it s inner classes only have sizes where the height is greater then the width

higher,vice
if this is the case then height will be higher than width or vice versa

knowable,desktop,old
width tends to be more knowable than height so on desktop you could do the old switcharoo to change their positions

scaling,grid,location,smaller
the above scaling assumes that the height of the grid location is always smaller than the width of the grid location

portrait,images,image
few are portrait images where the height of the image is like 3 times more than width

image,view,smaller,screen,inset,larger
essentially what this does is check whether your image view s width height is smaller that the screen s width height and if so create an inset of half the screen s width height you could probably make this larger if you want the image to go out of the screen bounds

possible,icons,smaller,last,next,row
i m wondering if it s possible to automatically arrange the icons so that when the width gets smaller than x the last icon of each row gets pushed to next row so that it grows in height

image,smaller,form,contentpane,screen
in case your image s width height is smaller than form contentpane s width height you might as well do not scale it since the image will fit the screen

image,smaller,displaywidth,scale
also if the image width or height is smaller than displaywidth scale you might want to cap it to be image width instead

auto,grid,content,grid.width,greater,windows
if auto then grid stretches its width and height to fit its content hence why your grid.width is greater than windows width

image
if you have an image that its height is more than its width it will be shown as such

header,window,thes,code
i have a page that hide the header if the window height is less than width thes is my code

however when i run my application the buttons appear to be bigger than the size of the images i m displaying on them- the images are 30x30 but the buttons are rectangular rather than square with their height being greater than their width

solution,swap,lesser,resolution,landscape
as the simplest solution swap width and height if width is lesser than height so you always get the resolution of landscape mode

greater,pixels,scale,original,aspect
for example if width is greater than height then resize width to 500 pixels and scale height accordingly so that original aspect ratio is preserved

larger
solved it will resize only if width is larger than 800px or height is larger than 600px

media screen and height less than width

larger,unexpected
the height is 3 times larger than width which is unexpected

horizontal,image,greater,loads,vertical
i m using gallery located on sd card when i pick the horizontal image width greater than height it loads the image in image view perfectly fine but the problem is with vertical image height greater than width it show the image in image view rotated on the left side or saying -90 degree from original position

i m trying to set the height of a image to 150px if the image width is larger than the height and if the image height is larger than the width the width of the image changes to 150px

distance,smaller,x,collision
you just should separate the x and y axis during distance comparison if the y distance is smaller than the width and the x distance is smaller than the height than there is a collision

words,bigger
in other words to check if the height is bigger then the width

images,looks
images scratch width more than height and does t looks nice.

what is the reason that text s width is smaller than its height

greater,scale
following that if the width is greater than 1000 simply scale both height and width which may already have been scaled due to the height by 1000 width

1x1,ratio,bigger
this xml code works well if the image is a 1x1 ratio or if the height is bigger than the width

higher,value,browser,orientation
if height has a higher value than width the browser will be in orientation portrait

longer,landscape
so that means the width is longer than the height or that it is still in landscape

amount,zoom,greater,overall,image,panning
managed to accomplish it by checking whether the pan tilt amount added to the zoom width height is greater than the overall image width height then stop it from panning tilting

idea,larger,overflow-x,auto
the idea is that the width is 3 times larger than the height and i was thinking to achieve this with overflow-x auto and overflow-y hidden as shown in the example from the second row 6-th column on these website

but uil loads my images correctly when their height is less than or equal to their width

image,correct,bigger,smaller,constraints
the image is placed in a correct height but the width could be bigger or smaller than the height constraints

understandable,conditions,larger,code
the following code is working without any error but my problem is when i create a thumbnail some times thumbnail are non understandable one some conditions such as width is very larger than height i also tried a code for calculate height automatically.but it won t perfectly works

arbitrary,function,fontsize
the width is more arbitrary than the height but i made it a function of the fontsize and the doubling so i could write the shade names in the rectangles

largest,greater
if the largest width is greater than the largest height then a

final,viewport,lower
simple because the viewport has changed due to the keyboard showing and the final viewport has a height lower than width

greater
its height is greater than width

actual,image,250dp,white
then it can happen where the height if the actual image is less than the width see attached so here because the fixed height is 250dp there is a lot of white space below the image

result,square,larger
but the result does not look like a square at all the height seems to be larger than the width

method,image,larger,imageview,new,autolayout
what i did is in the completion block of downloading image method i check if the image width is larger then i change the imageview to the new imageview with new resized height but i can t make it work with autolayout

imagebutton,rectangle,greater
although layout_width and layout_height are set to wrap_content the imagebutton is shown as a rectangle with the height greater than the width

fullscreen,wide,greater,sidebar,left
but if they went fullscreen or wide width is greater than height they would see a sidebar on the left and maybe also the right

landscape,image,greater,portrait,interchange,flag,rotation
it works as as desired for landscape image width greater than height however for portrait it automatically rotates image and interchange width and height without any flag to get if any rotation has been done

image,layout,higher,screen,incomplete
i need to force the width when i am adding the image to the layout i mean that the image must be keep the aspect ratio but the image must be higher than the height of the screen and the image must be shown incomplete if the height of the image is higher than the height of the screen

auto,consistent,grid,vertical,scrollbar
so height auto seems more consistent with the grid based on width and a vertical scrollbar

smaller,normal,verticaladvance,char
i noticed that the horizontaladvance of the chars f w y a is smaller than their normal width and the verticaladvance of the char is smaller than its height

image,new,bigger,screenshots,show,images
however after rotating a rectangular image its new width and height is much bigger as these two screenshots should help clarify during rotation and after rotating then rotating again -- the little handles show where the images x y width height extends to

restriction,greater
in java we have a restriction that width should not greater than height

vertical,layout,bigger
so basically the small and medium sizes are a vertical layout as the height is bigger than the width

uiimage,larger,border
i needed to compare the width and the height of the uiimage when width is larger than height i will add border

image,uiimageview,greater,wrong
my image is then displayed in an uiimageview where the width is greater than the height which makes the image looks wrong

greater,display,none
if the height is greater than the width turn the display to none

camera,pairs,larger,landscape,usual
when requesting the preview sizes from the camera you always get pairs where the width is larger than the height because landscape is the usual orientation when taking a picture

div,greater,screen
i m calculating the width based on the div height if the height is greater than the screen width

svg,larger,1px,change,10px
since the svg s width is much larger than its height every 1px change in the height of the svg is causing the width to change by about 10px

bigger,size,scale,image,holder
assuming width is bigger in size then height scale the image width to the holder width

bigger
that is why width is bigger than height

images,portrait,greater,landscape
so in the case if i upload 2 images i want to check if the images are portrait height is greater the width or landscape and need to show the images accordingly

orientation,landscape,screen,wider
hey so you re last media query is just asking for if the screen is orientation landscape which means the width of the screen is wider than the height of the screen

units,scales,correct,aspect
if the height is less than the width then it leaves the height at 4 units and scales the width to maintain the correct aspect ratio

parent,higher
parent s height is higher than its width

greater,close,proper,proportion
if the width is greater than 320 or the height is greater than 480 it should scale in a way so that it becomes as close to 320x480 as possible but by keeping the proper proportion of width to height

img,carousel
but when the height img is more than 500px or when the img width is more than the width of the carousel the img overflows the carousel

greater,layout,right
setting height greater than width is needed to get the layout right between browsers

images,whos,larger,background
what is the best approach to dealing with images whos height is much much larger than their width in regards to covering the background

checks,content,equal,container
so in code where you perform scaling add condition which checks if the content width or height is less or equal container width or height

centered,circle,blue,div,smaller,image,full
how do i make perfect centered circle always 100 height of blue div until blue div width because smaller than height and image always covering full circle

larger,math
if the video height was larger than its width the math is the same

image,ideal,larger,portrait
such that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300

window,div,smaller,elements,jump
when i resize my browser window and the div s width becomes smaller the elements inside the div jump below expanding the height

columns,vertical,longer,middle,horizontal,side
so i am trying to build a website using bootstrap and i am trying to arrange vertical and horizontal videos in a feed with a design where the first 3 and last 3 columns are occupied by a vertical video thus the height being longer than the width and the middle 6 columns being occupied by the horizontal video where the width is the longer side

check,image,greater
2 for each file check if the image width is greater than the image height

greater
you may want to check if the width is greater than the height

image,greater,class
ok so i m trying to see if an image s width is greater than it s height then apply a class if not apply another class

mode,container,larger
in landscape mode the container s width somehow gets larger than its height as shown below

device,change,smaller,safe,keyboard
if you rotate the device the width becomes the height and we can ignore the change but if the height gets dramatically smaller while the width remains the same it is safe to assume there is a keyboard being shown and we throw a show keyboard event

brute,box,larger
i brute forced it a bit with forcing the height of the box to always be larger than the width

vertical,manner,page,longer,footer,blank
when i try to minimize this page resize it to a size smaller than my screen espicially when it is minimized in a vertical manner where the height of the page is longer than the width the footer becomes blank white and the background-image becomes shorter

larger
the width should be larger than the height

div,greater
is there any way using only css to set a div s height to be never greater than its width

data,flag,greater,certain,distortion
i ve found that if you load an image from the camera roll that is a png pngs have no orientation data flag and the height is greater than the width upon applying certain distortion filters to said image it will rotate and present it self as if it were a landscape image

greater
it only seems to display when the height is greater than the width

check,image,greater,clockwise
check if image width is greater than its height and if so rotate image clockwise

equal,bigger,auto,greater,value
if they are equal or the width is bigger i set those to 100 each and set height as auto whereas if the height is the greater value i set that to 100 and width to auto

bigger
the reason why i m struggling is that sometimes the width is bigger than the height and sometimes the height is bigger than the width

tricky,parent,div,known
height is slightly more tricky for it to work you need to have the parent of the overlay div to have a known width

image,bigger,croppingarea
if the image s width i bigger than its height i want the height of the croppingarea to automatically scale to the height

bigger,portrait
if the height is bigger than the width it is portrait

image,bigger,condition,true
as the image width is always bigger than the height this condition always is true

interested,size,dynamic,larger
i m not interested in the height only the width they won t be the same - the size will be dynamic but i can presume the height will be larger than the width

bin,smaller,bar,large
if the bin width is smaller than zero the bar height might become very large

model,fitting,aspect,ration
but the model is not fitting properly when the canvas width is less than height aspect ration less than 1

mean,web,browser,desktop,pc
does this mean that if or when i resize the width of the web browser on my desktop pc so the width is less than the height of the web browser the portrait.css file will override the current style

window,smaller,orientation,portrait
when the window width is smaller than its height then the orientation would be considered portrait

code,mistake,correct,equal,greater
anyway i checked your code ..your mistake that you always calculate knopafmeting based on width that is correct if height is equal or greater than width

photo,full,image,higher,imageview
i need display photo to fill full width and when image is higher than imageview height it can be scroll up and down

photo,greater
when working with a landscape photo the photo width is greater than the photo height

portrait,landscape,smaller,former,latter
in order to do so you need to find out if the svg is portrait or landscape - meaning if the width is smaller than height former or not latter

image,lower,problem
when i try loading an image whose width is lower than the height there is no problem at all

images,larger,line,error
for images with height larger than width it s the following line that causes error

resolution,size,bigger,vice,images
the images can be of any resolution size and the height sometimes is bigger than the width and vice versa for both images

ratio,limit,bigger,image
there is an image restriction that is not documented or at least i couldn t found anything the aspect ratio limit is 1 3 when the height is bigger than the width on the image

aspect,image
we can assume that max 30 or more upto 100 can be the zooming effect if aspect image height or width is less than the desired height or width

shorter,position,wrong
the width is shorter and the height and position is wrong too

image,rectangle,original
okay so i used one trick pony s solution but tried to modify it to create a square image out of a rectangle if the width is less than the height but not stretch the original image and instead center it

difference,screen,greater
you can tell the difference by seeing if the screen height is greater than the screen width

greater,ratio,new,old,opposite,example
if the height is greater than the width get the ratio by dividing the new height with the old one and finally multiply the width with the ratio to get the new width if the width is greater than the height you do the opposite like in the example code below

default,image,view,port,100vw,page,greater,landscape,orientation,background-size
by default the image width will fill 100 of the view port width 100vw but if the page has a height that is greater than the width or has a landscape orientation the background-size is overridden so that the image height fills 100 of the view port height 100vh

better,image,greater
so my intuition says that it is better to have an image where the height is much greater than the width

uiimage,greater
i have a uiimage with its width much greater than its height

vertical,image,greater,config
my assumption is that the library would take a vertical image see that the height is greater than the width and translate the height width config appropriately so the image remains vertical

max-width,image,greater
i.e max-width kicks in when image width is greater than height and its height will be calculated proportionally

ratios,vmin,window,smaller
this should allow you to solve for your concern about aspect ratios i ve tried using vmin but that does not help as the height of the window is almost always smaller than the width

larger,body,top
if left is larger than body width or top is larger than body height

everytime,image,wider,picture
what i want to do is that everytime the width of the image is wider than the height of the image i want to rotate the picture by 90 degrees clockwise into landscape layout mode save it on app s documents folder and then present it on the screen - this way the picture of the widescreen tv appears 90 degrees rotated but the image aspect ratio is not totally destroyed

margins,image,larger
note what i observed is the margins appears only when image width is larger than height

images,interval,larger,dimension,smaller
the basic idea behind the approach is that you map the coordinates of the images to the interval by dividing by the width assuming the width is the larger dimension but it does not matter if it is smaller than the height

sidebar,content,smaller,full,bellow
as i understand it you need footer to be on the left side of the sidebar when content height is smaller and full width bellow sidebar when content is higher

image,greater,script,px
as you can see if image width is greater than height the script first makes image 128 px height

value,maximum,greater,real,true
its a bool value so if the maximum of width or height is greater than real width then you get true

easy,javascript,greater,signature,portrait
but it s easy enough using javascript to check whether the height is greater than the width a signature of portrait mode

greater,containers,proportions
and if their width or height is greater than their containers width or height then make them automatically shrink while keeping their proportions

window,screen,greater,landscape
so here when you enter multiwindow mode your app s window no longer fits screen - width is greater than height and it is considered as landscape

image,window,previous,experiment
also i am not posting an image but i tried to set the height and width of the window to 96 in a previous experiment and the height was less than width

header,browser,smaller,10vh,tall
even though you ve given your header a fixed height of 10vh if one resizes the browser whereby the header s width gets smaller eventually a height 10vh might not be tall enough to contain all of header s content thus it overflows

jquery,larger,vice
with jquery you can check if height is larger than width and vice versa

gap,greater
in fact the gap doesn t appear at all when width is greater than height only when height is greater than width

happy,class,image,auto
i would be happy applying a class with width 100 to the image and a height auto but the height should not be more than the width

viewer,picture,smaller,eye
i add the detail that opening it only with some software paint picasa viewer ... i see the picture squeezed horizontally of about 50 this way width is smaller than height to my eye too

image,larger,smartphone,screen,proportion
for example if the image width is much larger than the image height than on smartphone the image will use 100 of the width of the screen and in proportion to that will be the height of the image

image,check,smaller
it will look at the image height check whether the height is smaller than the width or if the width is smaller than the height and set either one to the smaller height

image,smaller,vice
i need to resize an image so that if its height is smaller than its width i ll set its height and vice versa

code,smaller,l
but the code does not function correctly if the width is smaller than the height since l ranges only 1 to

larger,keyboard,event
when the height gets dramatically larger while width stays the same we throw a hide keyboard event

small,screen,bigger,go,first,design,second
i can only find adaptivetriggers which take a static minwindowwidth or minwindowheight .but what i need is no matter how big or small the screen is if the height is bigger than the width go with the first design and if the width is bigger go with the second design

window,larger,screen,desktop
if requested width or height of a window is larger than width or height of a screen desktop the function shrinks the values to the screen sizes

content,screen,scroll,container
if your content height and width is less the screen height and width in that case scroll will not appear if content got out of container height and width scroll will come

image,square,bigger
so at first this looks ok but is actually is not all pixels in the image are not square but elongated with their height being bigger than their width

fine,image,larger,landscape,largest,dimension,portrait,600px,size,aspect
the third url works fine when the image width is larger than the height landscape but when the height is the largest dimension portrait it resizes the height correctly but the width dimension does not get padded to fill the 600px width but instead becomes whatever size is calculated to maintain the aspect ratio

smaller,watermark,image,wont
so how can i determine a smaller width and height to which i will resize the watermark image something much less than 150 width 20 height so that it will appear still as a watermark and wont mask the image completely

size,whe,greater,proportions
whenever i resize an image to a desired size there whe width is greater than the height the proportions get screwed

pixel,larger
the pixel height is larger than the pixel width

property,window,greater
it test if window.orientation property is supported if it isn t it checks if window height is greater than window width

screen,larger,useless,landscape
checking if screen width is larger than height is useless in my case because the app always runs in landscape

browser,greater,scrollbar,padding,relative
if you resize the browser so that the height is greater than the width you will notice that the scrollbar goes away which is because the padding is relative to the width

screen,600px
on a 5 screen roughly the width is 400px more or less and the height is 600px or more

larger,ratio,x
if the height is larger than the width the ratio will be y x instad of x y and minimum will be multiplied by ratio for x instead of y

image,greater
updated to handle cases where image width is greater than height

diameter,dot,aggregation,diamond,larger,line
the diameter of the dot shall not exceed half the height of the aggregation diamond and shall be larger than the width of the line

format,larger
and i don t why appears in this format width larger than height

keyboard,large,larger
not only is height of keyboard so large how can height be larger than width

console,window,larger,argumentoutofrangeexception,.net
therefore if console window height or width is larger than buffer height or width argumentoutofrangeexception is thrown in .net there is no argumentoutofbounds exception type

true,bigger,original
if set true then it might increase the width or height if the given width and height are bigger than original width and height

image,narrow,tall,greater
for example my image width is 10mm but in height it is 300mm so i want it to appear reflecting this so in this case i would expect it to appear very narrow but tall because the height is so much greater than the width

widget,panel,greater,map
i think you had situation like map widget get added to a panel having width and height greater than width and height of map widget

stylesheet,browser,smaller,styles,ride
it depends what is your default stylesheet like if you want to tell the browser that when the width is smaller than 700px apply these styles but as soon as the height goes smaller than 600px over ride these styles with these new values

bigger
you would then need your height to be 2 times bigger than your width

image,higher,new,browser,trick
once your image have a width higher than height you need to set only the new width and let the browser do the trick with the new height

videos,greater,players,rotation
but with the videos i m using the width is always greater than the height and players know whether to rotate the video or not based on the rotation exif value

longer,auto
else if the width is longer than the height you set the width to 500px and the height to auto

ratio,longer,left,right
your ratio is a little more than one since your width is longer than your height so your left and right boundaries are essentially something like -1.5 and 1.5 whatever your ratio happens to be

image,pixels,smaller
but the problem is on resizing an image with 1920 x 1200 pixels as the height is much smaller than the width

background,image,bigger
if the background image s width is bigger than it s height it s width must be 100

orientation,portrait,screen,bigger,soft,keyboard,popup
using media screen and orientation portrait means that when is the width of the screen bigger then its height and when the soft keyboard popup the width of the screen become bigger than the height so that happen

getimagesize,function,larger,echo,image,tag,style,else
guys after spending too much time looking around for an easier way to do this i combine the info from research to do it like this simply using the getimagesize function -if the height is larger than the width echo an image tag with a style having a height of 100 else echo the same image tag but with a style having a width of 100

image,zoom,picture,changes,bigger,smaller,iphone,screen
the image renders but then when i try to pinch zoom in and out only the height of the picture changes bigger or smaller with the width stuck at the iphone screen width

div,max,full,image,higher,+1000px,fit
i am using an image in a full screen div max height 500px but when applying the full width to the image the image height is much higher +1000px so is there a solution to let this image fit perfectly in the 100 width div with a max height of 500px

kindle,landscape,smaller,definition,real,true
from my experience every time the kindle fires up my landscape app with a width smaller than the height thus by definition not really giving me a landscape view i just ignore the surface and wait it quickly gives me a a real landscape flipping the height and width so that its a true landscape view

preview,getimagesize,bigger
photoshop opens it and shows it vertical mac preview does too but getimagesize keeps telling me width is bigger than height

aspect,ratio,larger
if the aspect ratio is 1 then the height is larger than the width

landscape,image,larger,phone,scale,aspect,ratio
hi i m working on an application that will be loading images and i m looking to scale each image to it s largest possible size for instance if the image is a landscape image if width is larger than height i would like to stretch the width to fill the width of the phone and scale height to keep it s aspect ratio

current,project,image,number,longer
to put this in perspective the current project i am working on involves comparing the width and height of an image to get a number to determine if the width is longer than the height or the same

thing,new,smaller,imagetoadd.draw,rectanglef,imagetoadd,value,image,x-value
this method works great except for one thing if the new height is smaller than the new width the new height and new width successfully get modified but after the imagetoadd.draw rectanglef the size of the imagetoadd still has the new width value instead of the cropped width that is if i can assume that if i draw an image with -20 as its x-value the width gets modified with -20 as well

img,max-width,smaller,image,auto,aspect,set,bigger
how to set the size of img so that it s max-width is set to 200px if the width is smaller than height the image height is auto in this case to preserve aspect ratio and set max-width to 200px if the width is bigger than height

next means that the ratio of width to height in devices greater than 960px width should be 1 1

longer
in between 768 1024 and only when height is longer than width

greater,field,arithmetic
in the other case when the height is greater than the width then the field at and can be calculated using that arithmetic sum and the rhomboid can be imagined as a rectangle with x-value x and y-value y- w-x-1

wider,target,size
if the width is wider than the height make your target size 500 x 375 otherwise make it 375 x 500

sizetofit,returns,body,text

bigger
one where height is bigger than width and one where width is bigger than height

situation,bigger,parent
this is used in a situation that view s width height is bigger that its parent s width height

dimensions,page,greater
it looks like a page in landscape because the dimensions of the page are created in such a way that the width is greater than the height

mistake,image,greater,portrait,orientation
it seems like it would be a mistake to simply check if the image s width is greater than it s height and to rotate it to portrait orientation based on that

maxsizex,greater,maxsizey
you should first check if maxsizex is greater then the width or the maxsizey is greater than the height

method,display,display.getsize,point,greater,normal,mode
there may be a better way to do this but a quick and dirty method would be to inspect the display s width and height with display.getsize point point - if the width is greater than the height then normal mode is landscape otherwise portrait

aspect,ratio,larger,square,size,smaller,value
if the aspect ratio is 1 then width is larger than height so you then need to assume a square the same size as height as it s the smaller value

storyboard,fine,view
when i run the app the height is more than that i set in my storyboard width is fine but i change the height of the view nowhere

ring,shape,imageview,bigger
so the ring shape will be cropped if the width of the imageview becomes bigger than the height

program,picture,bigger,mouse,x
the program does load a picture its width height always bigger than canvas width height and when i make a mouse click on the canvas it returns a x y - coordinates and color grayscale value but it always a coordinates of canvas not an image ones

x,equal,array,y+1
when x is equal to width and y is less than height you will be writing to the array 0 y+1 cell

icon,greater
icon s height is greater than width

device,smaller,tablet
if the device width is smaller than height so the device is a tablet or a mobile phone in standard position and rotation usually

information,images,greater
i think what you re asking for is how to return the information for all the images where the height is greater than the width

img,tag,wider
i upload expansion code to show photo by android camera on html as normal on some img tag with right rotaion especially for img tag whose width is wider than height

shapes,couple,pixels,larger,value,computations

greater
same for width being greater than height

long,condition,greater
note this holds as long as the condition that the height is always greater than the width is maintained

this algorithm could be optimized if you rotate points or just exchange x-y coordinates so that width of the occupied area is not larger than its height

square,squashed,smaller
i can rotate it to any angle i want but i want to make the rotated square squashed making the height 2 3 smaller than the width

style,thumb,bigger
now pen style thumb width is much bigger than height show correctly

when viewport height is less than width of square

screen,catalog,grid,page,div,unscrollable
when the screen width hits less that 780px the catalog grid page div just loses its height and the page becomes unscrollable

landscape,orientation,bigger
landscape orientation is that one where the width is bigger than the height

â,œportraitâ,greater,œlandscapeâ
turns out â œportraitâ really just means the height is greater than the width and â œlandscapeâ means the width is greater than the height

devices,portrait,bigger
for photos taken on other devices pass successfully when are rotated to portrait height bigger than width

layout,greater
i want to change my layout depending on if the width is greater than the height

wrap_content,greater,parent,wide,content
if a width has been set don t exceed it so if wrap_content is specified and the width is greater than the parent the height will be adjusted else assume you can be as wide as the content

image,bigger
and the height 100 if the image height is bigger than width

mode,view
the only way i found to be sure that the view is in landscape mode is to test that the view height is less than the view width

screen,bigger,monitor,landscape
because the width of the screen is bigger than height on monitor the landscape will scale better

element,explicit,contents
it applies to window objects but also to scrollable frames and elements with the overflow css property set to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less than the height or width of its contents

content,wider,vertical,taller
this will effectively only show scrollbar when needed if horizontal content is wider than width or vertical content is taller than height

image,loads,greater,class,margin
i have this code for when an image loads in our app and then when the height is greater than the width add a class to bump up the margin

machine,firefox,smaller
now this works on my desktop machine in firefox if i make the width smaller than the height

object,smaller,pixel,nested,loop,both.
for example if you know that you have no such object whose width or height is smaller than 50 pixel then you will put 50 as the increment in the nested loop either on width or height or both.

window,longer,correct
however when i resize the window so that the width is less than the height it no longer renders at the correct x location

adjustment,form,max,value
this also explains why this adjustment can be more than 0.5 if the height of the form is less than its width the adjustment can be more than 0.5 the max value is width divided by height but in the other case the max value is 0.5

rectangles,longer
for example detected rectangles should have width which is longer than their height in your case

viewport,nothing
which means if viewport width is more than 970 and viewport height is more than 0 serve nothing

alternatively you can use jquery filter method to filter all the images which have width greater than height and then add the required class at once

bigger
if the height could be bigger than width you can add

page,smaller,portrait
one page is a page of which the width is smaller than the height sounds like it s a page in portrait but as there s a rotate value of 90 added to the page dictionary it is shown in landscape

portrait,viewport,higher
vh for portrait orientation since in portrait the viewport height is higher than its width

variations,lower,depth,variation,highest,lowest
you do this by dismissing all variations where the width is lower than the depth so for each i w i d i and then dismissing the variation where the height is not the highest nor the lowest of the three dimensions because the other two variations can go one on top of the other and this one can t join in

div,body,overflow,auto,padding,larger,scroll,bar
if you want a pure css option i believe an absolute positioned div inside the body with width and height of 100 overflow auto and right padding larger than the width of a scroll bar will replace the normal scrollbar without shifting the content to the left on long pages

position,screen,smaller,820px
i want to add media queries for a div to change position when the screen width is smaller than 820px and or height smaller than 615px so i made this

i am essentially trying to state if an has the class of cboxphoto then run the each function is for detecting the height width and add the class of relative if the image width is greater than it s height

thing,uiimageview,images,server,greater,image
i have one issue regarding uiimageview and uiimage i get confuse on 1 thing ie my uiimageview height 759 and width 748 and i am downloading the images from server that height and width is so so greater such as image height 2048 and width 2500

universal,storyboard,ratio,greater
what i don t understand is the width is 600 on the universal storyboard so how do i then get the ratio of the height being 33 greater than the width

original,image,higher,surprise
the original image height is higher than its width woo no surprise so far

firebase,database,larger,maximum,image,notification,iâ
first if a notification image is displayed from my firebase database and the height is larger than the width and also the height exceeds the maximum image height for the notification iâ m not sure specifically what this is the image is compressed vertically and the aspect ratio is incorrect

images,b,greater
so i am trying to figure out a situation where i would populate an array with the index numbers from another array whose elements meet a certain criteria array b would be index numbers based on array a which is an array of images and would populate b when width is greater than height

image,input.but,bigger,text,box.on,input,size
i tried to add class and added the background image for that input.but the height and width is aligned bigger than the text box.on trying to change the height the input size reduced as the background img is inside the input

ratio,window,greater,image,issues
as long as the ratio of the window s height width is greater than the image s height width you won t have any issues but once the window s ratio is smaller than the image s ratio you ll see that whitespace

screen,size,greater,landscape,mode
we next tried to just look at the actual screen size assuming that when width was greater than height we were in landscape mode

image,greater
if the height of the image is greater than the width of the image clicked then this means that you have taken the image in portrait mode

images,match_parent,wrap_content,results,image,picture,lower,typical
here is how the regular imageview handles resizing of images if you are using match_parent as width and wrap_content as height i tested with both as match_parent and the results were the same it will not scale the image if the height of your picture is lower than the width which is quite typical

smaller,100px,works
width should be smaller than height at about 100px - the all works fine

scales,users,larger
i have a fullscreen image standard 16 9 that scales proportionally unless the users height is larger then the width

rotation,transformation,bigger,scaling
it will also automatically apply a 90 degree rotation transformation if the width is bigger than the height before applying any scaling

red,window
which will paint all the text red when the window width is less than its height

element,big,bigger,image,setting
width and height of the canvas element need to be as big or bigger than the width and height of the image which i wasn t setting when i created the image object

bigger
just check if the height is bigger then the width thus portait

check,image,bigger
check if the image s width is bigger than its height

window,value
if the window width is above 1280 i would like the value for the height to be 515 and if it is below 1280 i would like the height to be 615 and if the width is less than 480 make the height 715

greater,new
height is greater than 200 we need to calculate the new width and

visible,viewport,orientation
since the height width is calculated on the visible viewport the soft keyboard apparently causes the orientation to flip now that the viewport width is less than the height

browser,window,greater,orientation,landscape
this will check if the width of the browser window is greater than the height orientation landscape will do the opposite

rectangle,larger,low-level,graphics
to draw a crossed rectangle of height 2 times larger than its width using the low-level graphics package facilities i call

portrait,greater
it is regarded as portrait if the height is greater than the width

bounds,value,greater
for example when rotating from portrait to landscape the collection view bounds value still has its height greater than the width

image,side,larger,div,overflow
when resizing the image if the width side is larger than the height resize the image so that the image height is the div s height and hide the width overflow after centering

circle,.bublina,smaller,thats,border-radius
in your case in the 3rd circle the height and width of .bublina not same height is smaller than width thats why border-radius 100 is not making it circle

wider,shorter
where the width is wider and the height is shorter than 44

parent,greater,child
so if the parent s height is greater than the width then the child is limited by the parent s width and if the parent s width is greater than the height then the child is limited by the height

ckeditor,200px,300px,user,able,content
suppose if the ckeditor height is 200px and width is 300px then end user should not be able to add more content with height and width

form,small,smaller
when i resize a borderless form to a small width and height it won t get smaller than width 132 height 38

portrait,bigger

in details height is getting larger than expected and event more than width

browser,size
i extracted the solution from media query for browser size where width is less than height

click,event,value,animation,time,delay,equal,bigger
...then using the animate on click event you could give the height a value and animation time the width a delay equal o bigger than the height animation time and then it s value...that should do the trick but it s more stiff than actually using the ui

the button height is higher than it s width go to step 2

onsurfacechanged,greater,orientation,technique
in onsurfacechanged you can check if your width is greater than your height and if it is you can query the orientation using the technique shown here

original,image,greater,camera+...the,exact
what s odd is that usually this doesn t happen - so far i ve only encountered this error when the original image has height greater than width and it has been filtered by another app called camera+...the exact same photo before filtering causes no problems and a filtered landscape photo also seems to be fine

bound,greater,applet,random,example.
basically you need to create a random x position with the an upper bound no greater than the width of the applet and a random y position with an upper bound no greater than the height of the applet for example.

picture,landscape,greater
that will let you know if the picture is landscape because width would be greater than height

screen,greater,md,elements,minimum,420px,magic

image,larger
this is for the case when the height of the image is larger than the width

consequence,images,larger,transpose,original
but since i want a portrait preview i need to rotate the image and as a consequence i get images with an height much larger than the width the transpose of the original image i guess

my ultimate question for this post is can i specify some form of expression in a media query in css that will simply compare the device-width and device-height and display one style when the width is greater than height and vice versa

image,larger,landscape,pixels,scale,appropriate,value
if image width is larger than height landscape then scale the height to 1024 pixels and scale the width to appropriate value to maintain aspect ratio

object,document,percentage
as you can see what s happening here is sometimes the object falling out of the document because the width or height of it + the randomized percentage is more than document width or height

that will also works if the height of the window is larger than the width

absolute,difference,larger,percentage,higher
in this example the absolute difference in width is larger but the percentage difference in height is higher

i ve found some comments and references that seem to indicate that setting the height greater than the width will cause the browser to change the orientation automatically but in my testing that only works in opera used to work in opera but not anymore

window,ls,scrollbar
if the height of window ls less than width 2 scrollbar of window is enabled

sizes,matter,greater,images,100px,different,image

in retrospect what you re trying to do will not get you to make the imageview circular because the default imageview is rectangular the height is always more than the width and so.

sequence,value,depth
in this case i obviously would like to find the height sequence because the value 60 stands out more than the width or the depth

greater,top,position
similarly if width is greater than height the top position of the rotated image is incorrect

phone,portrait,landscape,images,longer
the following works perfectly with my phone in portrait the width fits but when i flip to landscape the width still fits perfectly but the images are longer than the height

if width is greater than height it is landscape

dimension,pixels,bigger
now you should have square cell - as you see those dimension are not pixels and height must be bigger than width

image,greater,landscape
if the width of the image is greater than its height landscape

image,distorted,greater
however when i build the apk and run it on my android phone the image is distorted width greater than height

image,larger,target,aspect
so it needs to downsize the image so that both the width and height are larger than the width and height of the target maintaining aspect ratio

javascript,title,greater,main
then in the javascript you just check to see if the height or width of title is greater than the height or width of main

the problem is that the width is bigger than the height and i want it to be the same 1 1

greater
it is happening when width is greater than height

maxwidth,greater,maxheight,true
in other words if either maxwidth is greater than the width of or maxheight is greater than the height of it will return true

things,state,greater,source,checks
i ve found some things online that state that the height must always be greater than the width and have seen in the java source checks for this with accompanying messages that this is the case but cannot find a reason why

error,parameters,bitmap
after doing this i got error that width and height parameters should be less than width and height of bitmap

bigger,top,bottom
since the height is much bigger than the width there are top and bottom parts that are captured in the image that are not showing up in the live feed naturally

ratio,smaller,500px,700px
of course if the ratio is less than 1 then the width is smaller than height let s say 500px 700px and you will see the white spaces on the left and right of the image

greater
then how to know when width is greater and when height is greater

higher
if height is higher than width then do as you re doing now

little,bit,smaller
and i need the height to always be a little bit smaller than the width

square,rectangle,smaller
scott suggested to remove the transform -50 -50 which makes perfect sense if you wanted the div centered in the first place but if you wanted that in there still and have it centered as a square in a rectangle height is smaller than width then 45 by -290

true,diamonds,greater,equal
edit this would only be true for diamonds where height is greater than or equal to the width

basically you would start with a font height smaller than the height of your textview and then iterate or do a binary search through fonts of varying sizes until you find one that measures to smaller than the width of your textview

minimum,gamepanel,greater,empty,space
i want boardpanel to always be a square with size equal to the minimum of gamepanel s width and height if gamepanel s width is greater than height there should be empty space on the left and right if it s smaller there should be empty space on top and bottom

javascript,code,greater,first,time
i have this doubt i have a menu in which i run a javascript code or another depending on whether its width is greater or less than its height works me well the first time the screen resolution is detected but if there is a change of resolution or a change of orientation does not detect it and despite for example of having changed to portrait orientation still executing the landscape orientation code

right now what this code is producing is the right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the height

mode,pictures,larger
my camera by default is in landscape mode therefore it takes pictures with a width much larger than the height

let s assume that width of the array is bigger than height otherwise we will split in another direction

image
i resize the image if its width is more then 225 and height automatically fix with that width

good,desktop,larger,rare,orientation
but this is no good for desktop because the height may be larger than the width probably quite rare though but the orientation will never change

browser,960p,toolbar,change
when browser width is less than 960p toolbar change it s height to 48p

problems,greater,object,memory
this isn t causing your problems since width is greater than height and you stay within the object s memory when doing normal accesses to it

biggest,bigger
edit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize that

users,browser,smaller,popup,ability,scroll,product
the problem is when a users browser s height is smaller than the popup the overflow css property adds the ability to scroll which is what i want but it also adds its own width inside the popup causing one product to move down to next line

paper,sizes,greater
i m trying to figure out why the java print api can t handle paper sizes where the width is greater than the height

bold,meaning,greater,portrait,landscape
it s a bold meaning that its width is greater than its height which makes its portrait view a landscape

it s because you re using and orientation portrait so once the width of the window has a higher value than the height none of your css will be taken into account because it s considered landscape orientation at that point

degrees,rotation,portrait,picture
so what i need to do is to check if the exif wants to rotate 90 or 270 degrees and if so only perform the rotation if the height is less than the width which would mean the portrait picture isn t already rotated

higher,portrait,landscape
if the height is higher than the width then you can say it s portrait or else landscape

issue is that user may link to an image that is of extremely large height and width which is more than the height and width of the div it is in causing some overflow layout issues

wish,bigger,certain,container
i only want it to fit the width 100 and wish to become bigger than the height but not leave the certain container

devices,480px
480px seemed to be a good as no few devices had more than 480px width or less than 480px height

calculation,images
i don t think you can do what you want with pure css as you will need to make a calculation to see if the images height is less than the width

thumb,text,track
if the thumb text width is less that the height of the track the thumb shape will be scaled down

gallery,image
i have a gallery with different image sizes the custom layout is below for gallery its working correctly if the image width is les than height but if image height is less than width its not working correctly

image,bigger,container
you can check the width of the image and if the width is bigger than height you reduce the image for the width instead reduce from the height to fill the container something like that

so can i change the background image for a div when the device width is smaller than height

540px
so when the width is less than 540px i ll overwrite the height and width

image,site,bigger
i have an image in my site which it s height is bigger than it s width

better,layout,textblock
rather than using fixed width height it is better to create a layout which allows the textblock to adjust its width

moment,479px,rule
the moment i resize the height to less than the width say 479px the rule in the media query ceases to hold and the layout reverts back to the original

1---------------------------------------------------

line,paper,path
the best i could come up with would be to scale the line to fit inside paper based on the width of the path assuming that the width is more than the height

last,iteration,j,line
but in your nested loops the last iteration occurs when i is one less than width and j is one less than height where in the last line of your loop you try to access element which is bigger than the size of your array

other---------------------------------------------------

option,list,item,move,ul,method
tried some option as width is less when we resize then list item move below and increase height of ul so using this method i am able to hide last visible


it s has the same height but has more width

example
here s an example of the width being less than the height and then rotated 90deg.

technique,work,word,wrapping,sentence,wider,text,box
but this technique doesn t work when height is resized extended by word wrapping that is if a sentence is wider than the width of the text box and the textbox creates a new line automatically


width is usually less than height you might want to think about inverting the coordinates ie

body
but if the width is less than the height then the body width is 100


in case height is more than width then you have to resize with height

view,implementation,padding,values,convenient,columnwidth,custom
in your xml you gave and 10dp both vertical and horizontal spacing and then in your custom view implementation you gave 150 as width and height and 8 as padding basically they conflict try to make both values convenient since the columnwidth you gave is way more less than width you gave in your custom view

preferred,actual,pack,frame
then if the preferred width height is less than the actual width height you could manually invoke pack on the frame

timetable
the width of the timetable is more than the height of the timetable


if width is less than height just discarding it and if above allowing it

uibuttons,lastpressedbutton.frame.origin.x
now get the width and height of the uibuttons and compare if the lastpressedbutton.frame.origin.x will be less than width or -width away


3-2 if width is more over than height then

inner,for-loop,possible,fourth
it seems that you are just printing too much and it seems to come from the third inner for-loop and also in other cases when the height is more than the width possible from the fourth for-loop


this often affects width more than height

root,access,code
i cant get the orientation through exif because of my server don t have root access to fix that so i was just going to see if the width is less then the height then rotate them but the code isn t working properly

distance
we get this because our height has more distance than our width so we need to do 3 5 a 16 3 16 a 5 3 16 5 a so a 9.6

perfect,support,bigger,easy,thoughâ
this code is not perfect though because it doesn t support when height is bigger than width easy to fix thoughâ

big,responsive
width must be more big than height and want it responsive

expression,h,w,ternary
rather than that though i am using a calculated expression which tests whether the height h is less than the width w using a ternary operator

videos,transcoded
for videos which are recorded vertically height is more than width the transcoded video generated does shrink vertically


3-1 if height is more over than width then

sum,widths,board,cells
the only problem here sometimes the sum of widths height of board cells are less than the width height of the board


i see that they are squeezed such that the height is more than the width

aspectratio,full,clipping
if height is less than what the aspectratio allows to still utilize full width i m clipping

5- delete all the contours that width is more than its height delete the very small contours the very large ones and the not rectangle contours

cannot
the specified width and height cannot be less than the width and

sets,constraints
if this app can rotate you might need two sets of constraints one for when the width is less than the height the other for when the height is less than the width

statements,important,meaning,user
or you can group these statements by width as i think thats less important than height meaning less scrolling down for the user

fonts,character
most fonts have a character width less than the height so assuming width height will definitely work

portrait-secondary
width is less than height implies the portrait-secondary


verify width is not more than 2x the height and height is not more than 2x the width

thing,document,script,div,min,hover,greater,minimum,sub,menu
first do one thing get the width of the document using java script and your sub div set min width of generating div on hover of sub menu if it is greater than minimum height than animate your sub menu sub div to wherever you want or you can also give style using java script css property

thumbnail,wordpress,moreso
i am trying to change the size of a thumbnail in wordpress but it keeps making it exactly square even though i want to stretch the width moreso than the height

site,pages,greater,equal,pixels,certain,content,different,code,menu
i noticed some very peculiar behaviour of the site which is pages whose height is greater than or equal to the max vertical pixels occupy a certain width while pages whose content does not fill the height have a different width even though the code for the menu is exactly the same.why does this happen and what is the remedy
