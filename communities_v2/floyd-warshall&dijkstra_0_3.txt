algorithm,better,complexity,problem,higher,time
indeed floyd-warshall s algorithm is better than dijkstra s in this case the complexity for dijkstra is o m n 2 and in this problem m is much much higher than n so the o n 3 time complexity of floyd-warshall is better

faster,pair,shortest
no practically floyd-warshall is faster than dijkstra s for all pair shortest path generally

short,answer,efficient,naive,application
short answer floyd-warshall is more efficient in this case than naive application of dijkstra s
