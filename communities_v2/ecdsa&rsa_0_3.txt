faster,private,key,operations,high,efficiency,enough
ecdsa is much faster than rsa for private key operations so it should definitely be preferred over rsa when high efficiency is required unless rsa is still fast enough something that may very well be the case

faster,verification
rsa is much faster then ecdsa at verification

size,cookies,signatures,smaller,equivalent
if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signatures - ecdsa signatures are considerably smaller than rsa signatures of an equivalent security factor
