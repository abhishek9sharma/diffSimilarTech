flexible,allocation,space
getline is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with fgets it is up to you

edit,comments,safer,buffer,size
one more edit if you want to use getline instead which you asked about in the comments - and it s even safer than fgets since it will increase the buffer size as needed you would change to change the code a little bit

use,harder,doubt
if you cannot tolerate that use getline it s harder to use so use fgets if in doubt

example,read,loop,better
since i provided a getline example above your read loop can be much better written with fgets as follows
