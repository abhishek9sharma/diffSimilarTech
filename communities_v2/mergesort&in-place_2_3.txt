difficult,out-of-place,version
mergesort is more difficult to implement in-place but the out-of-place version is very cache-friendly - i suspect real-world implementations accept the o n space overhead - ram is cheap but memory bandwidth is a major bottleneck so trading memory for cache-efficiency and speed is often a good deal

memory,hard,sort
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort

sort,list,space,standard
1 in-place merge sort is used when you want to sort a list in o nlogn time while using less space than standard mergesort
