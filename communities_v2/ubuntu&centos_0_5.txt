consistent,reliable,enterprise,desktops,personal
centos is more consistent and reliable because it is enterprise while ubuntu is geared towards desktops and personal computers

this is because your ubuntu system has newer system libraries than your centos one

in this respect ubuntu is less desirable on a server than rhel or centos which stick to more mature versions
