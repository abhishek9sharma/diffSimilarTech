framespace,smaller,view,uinavigationbar
the framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in size


the app uses a uinavigationcontroller that never has more than 1 uiviewcontroller on it s stack

behind-the-scenes,organizer
the uinavigationcontroller is more of a behind-the-scenes organizer for holding and displaying other uiviewcontroller s

the uinavigationcontroller class seems to handle better rotations than uiviewcontroller
