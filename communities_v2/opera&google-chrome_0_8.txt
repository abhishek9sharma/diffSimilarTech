green,painting
especially in opera there is much more green in the painting than in google-chrome

fine,safari,assitional,settings,firefox,ribbon,div,higher
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

browsers,helpful,mode,powerful
since you noted thoughts on other browsers would be helpful opera s kiosk mode seems more powerful than google-chrome s

complete,problem,finger
opera probably is more complete to manage canvas than google-chrome but the problem is always to exclude the finger touch if i m using the pen

note,faster,memory,leaks
note i recommend using opera - it is much faster than google-chrome as it doesn t have memory leaks and comes with a built-in ad blocker

latest,version,longer,userscripts,box
also nice to know is the fact that the latest version of google-chrome and also opera don t know since when but longer than google-chrome supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-ons

usage,outdated,release,popular,previous,versions,penultimate,version
for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

image,longer
as you can see in the image google-chrome is running a lot longer than opera
