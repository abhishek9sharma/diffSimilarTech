elements,slower,thousands
if almost all elements fail the filtering then it s considerably slower than just sorting everything since you ll end up selecting thousands of times

range,faster,least
you d still have to filtering to get a range though it ought to be faster than sorting at least

hand,stable,contexts,stable_sort,approach,straightforward,numbers,sign
on the other hand you may want stable sorting in other contexts as well and so if you have the stable_sort function defined this approach would still be more straightforward than filtering out the numbers with each sign and recombining them

field,selective,cheaper
if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering

step,longer
but right now the sorting step is taking way longer than the filtering step so i would like to combine them in some way

important,target,representation,data
sorting is more important to me than filtering so if i have to have both sorting and filtering target the same representation of the data i ll just give up on filtering working

query,pseudomedian,faster
in terms of your speed query i d propose that your pseudomedian filtering is faster because it doesn t involve sorting

complicated,summation,median,longer,time
considering sorting is more complicated than summation median filtering will cost longer time

expensive
filtering is a lot less expensive than sorting
