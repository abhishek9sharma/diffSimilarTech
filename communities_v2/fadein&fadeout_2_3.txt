issues,time,delay,shorter
otherwise you will run into issues of trying to fadein and fadeout at the same time if your delay is shorter than your fadein

time,animation,delay,longer
more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time

smooth,animations,visibility,slower,animation,enteractions
i want smooth fadeout fadein animations instead setting visibility where fadeout is slower than fadein animation so i ve used enteractions and exitaction of datatrigger
