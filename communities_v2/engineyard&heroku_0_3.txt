great,company,hand,little
engineyard also seems like a great company but i think they hold your hand a little less than heroku

application-level,support,bit,better
engineyard does provide application-level support too which is a fair bit better than what heroku does

full-service,traditional,service
in choosing heroku is more full-service whereas engineyard is a more traditional service giving you access to boxes but needing sysadmin skills
