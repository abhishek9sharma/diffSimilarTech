extraction,faster,words,regex,content,longer,time
i have noticed that content extraction is faster in itext but searching words using regex in the content extracted by itext takes longer time than pdfbox

downside,mature,features,documentation
on the downside pdfbox is less mature than itext so it has less features and documentation available

start with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext s
