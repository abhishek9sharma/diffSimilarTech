secure
firstly post can seem more secure than get

method,safer,data,datas
get method is not safer than post data never trust datas coming from the client side

worse,performance
post has worse performance than get

params,name,variable,only.because,higher,priority
if you have both post and get params with same name and if you using then it will take post variable only.because post has the higher priority than get

serialization,http,requests,restful,simpler,huge
this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http get requests to restful urls is much simpler than http post requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about

secure,quick,example
post is more secure than get this is just a quick example

safety,answer,safer
regarding your question about safety -- the answer is post is absolutely no safer than get

help,information,table
to get more help with that post information about your table structures and content

task,details,request,suitable
actually if you would like to retrieve specific task with all its details get request would be more suitable than post

better,large,unsafer,secure,requests
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

secure,false,premise
you can feel like post is more secure than get all you want but it s a false premise

data,alot,safer,large
when you use post data is a alot more safer than get and you can send large no

request,server,light,weight,requests
other than that accepting a get request might be - depending on the server side rest framework - slightly more light weight than post requests

method,better,form
is get method is better than post method if you use a form

details,charles,proxy
this post goes into more details how to get charles proxy work with android 7 nougat

request,secure,harder
for example post request are considered more secure than get request as creating a post request is relatively harder than creating a get request

secure,itâ,unencrypted
post is not more secure than get as itâ s also send unencrypted

security,details,secure,comments,details.
after that is done you can go into security details where get is slightly less secure than post - see the comments for details.

better
when post is better than get

minor,easier,ways,request
another reason but rather a minor one is that get is easier to exploit that post as there are more ways to trigger get request than to trigger post request

better,data
yes generally post is a better way of submitting data than get

method,forms,safe,least
while the post method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the get

method,lenght,limit,data
post get method doesn t have the same lenght limit you can use post to send more data than with get

broader,application,data,server,purpose
a post has broader application and is generally used to send persistent data to a server in fact prescriptively get should not be used for this purpose

safer
is post safer than get

request,safety,half-decent,debugging,tool,requests
a post request would not provide any more safety than a get request any half-decent web debugging tool can forge post requests

supply,data
supply more data upon post and receive less data upon get

data,get.if,form,secure
data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post

pictures,related,data,first
if the post has more than 9 pictures related to it i only get data from the first 9

method,secure,data
post method are generally consume more secure than get because when we use get method than it can display the data in url bar.if the data is more sensitive data like password then it can be inggeris

user,thing,textfiled,server,method,safer,difference
both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url

better,anyways
in this case post may be better than get anyways

compact,requests,url-encoded
is post more compact than get since get requests have to be url-encoded

better
get is better for some cases but it seems to me you should use post instead

blog,access,token
this blog post explains more on how to get an access token on android

rest,method,better
1 reading other questions about the rest method for this proposes i think that i should use get better than post

plugin,defaults,request,logout,convenient,secure,requests
the plugin defaults to requiring a post request to logout but using the config setting you reference you can make your application more convenient to use but less secure by allowing get or post requests

characters,robust,secure
characters post is more robust and secure than get

better
and i think post is better than get

use,method,login,api,safer
i just want to know if i use post method for login api then is it safer than get method

last,answers,data,secure
last to address other answers while you should use post data when modifying something it is in no way more secure than get

length,parameter,longer,bytes,g-wan
i noticed once the length of a get parameter is longer than 400 bytes or 2000 bytes for a post parameter g-wan returns 400 error

method,faster
i have seen other people asking the same question why get method is faster than post

indirect,payload,safer
post makes it more indirect to intercept and read the payload than get but not safer

common,mis-conception,secure,obvious,browser,variable
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable

problem,lax,security
the post get may fix the problem - get is much more lax with security than post

faster,values,header,request
get is slightly faster because the values are sent in the header unlike the post the values are sent in the request body in the format that the content type specifies

effect,secure
in effect post is no more secure than get

initial,request,page,subsequent
an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

request,safer,invulnerable
post request are safer than get but that does not mean are invulnerable

requests,smaller,limits,specs
get requests have smaller limits than post in the specs

thread,method,faster
you should check this thread why get method is faster than post

https,better
using post over https is better than using get and http

friendship,method,suits,better
so for creating a friendship post method suits better than get

ajax,method,faster,proccessing,fields,information
usually in ajax get method is faster as it doesn t involve proccessing post fields and as you are only getting information i would stick it

data,server,privileges
param should be params and therefore your data is not being serialized which would explain why the server is rejecting your post since post requires more privileges than get presumably

better,info
however i ve searched for a couple days and am not getting a definitive answer and i need a better understand of this so i know no better way to get more info than to post here

better,formatting,specific
i ll get better with formatting and being more specific with the post

secure,sticking
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking

outputs,normal,request
also it seems that my view gets called more than once according to the log outputs and that is normal except it should be a post then redirect to a get but it seems to have more than one post request

method,secure
using the post method isn t necessarily more secure than get

comments,data,appropriate
as suggested in the comments since you are saving data post is more appropriate than get

data,secure
post data isn t inherently more secure than get data

blog,info
this blog post provides more info to get started

faster,list,element
i used get because is faster than post if you need it just to get a list of element for suggestions

note,safer
however note that post is not much safer than get

request,longer,bytes,requests
so if your get request is longer than 255 bytes it s advised to use post requests instead

default,limit,method,2mb,higher
there is a default limit of post method which is 2mb which is way higher than get

secure
post is not any more secure than get

brute,force,method,urlroutingmodule,combres.axd
i also found a post that suggests a less brute force method to get the urlroutingmodule to catch the combres.axd route

misleading,information,safer
and apart from common misleading information where post is safer than get it is not

requests,insecure
get requests are no less insecure than post requests

security,better,data,behind-the-scenes
as far as security goes post is much better than get as the data is sent behind-the-scenes rather than embedded in the url making it the typical protocol for login info

standard,request,secure
standard post request is not more secure than get one

asynchronous,request,better,user,perception,long
as it s widely known that an asynchronous post request is better since the user won t get a perception that the app has crashed while it s loading the long process

blog,detailed,product,key
this blog post is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to get the product key

data,new,reddit,limitation
i have been trying get data out of new reddit post but theres limitation where you cant get data from more than 100 post

body,request,different,fields,problem
here i don t like that the body of the post request contains more different fields then the body returned from the get request - but maybe this is not a problem

call,secure
i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get

particular,attack,secure
using post prevents this particular attack but is this actually any more secure than using get

amount,data,query,string,method
this means the amount of data you could pass by using post verb is much more than by using a query string and a get method

method,data,secure
please always try to use post method for submitting data as it is more secure than get method

better,data,proxy
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

request,guidelines,restful,api,purpose,data
i don t want to use the get request since it says in the guidelines of a restful api that it should use post for this purpose plus i might want to send more data than get can handle

anyone,problem
anyone knows how to bypass this problem and get more than 100 post

data,method,better
but i believe sending data using curl with post method is better than get method

request,secure
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

slower,bigger,size,request
but generally post is slower and would be bigger in size than a get request

pragmatist,simpler
as a pragmatist i m inclined to use get because implementing it is way simpler than post

better
when get is better than post

details,master-master,replication
another post outlines some more details on this how to get master-master replication with subversion

secure
first off get is no less secure than post

comment,original,information
following my comment on your original post here s some more information that will help you get through this

data,body,cookies,urls,length,secure,part
get is basically for just getting retrieving data a get should not have a body so aside from cookies the only place to pass info is in the url and urls are limited in length get is less secure compared to post because data sent is part of the url

ajax,performant
ajax calls using get are more performant than post according to yahoo

performant,idempotent,message,body
get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does

letter,compact
post has one more letter in it than get so it s less compact

requests,better,problems,little,unsure,code
i was taught from him that using get requests was better than post but after reading up i would like to switch to post my only problems is i am a little unsure how to modify my code to switch over from get

secure,middle,attacks
post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks

secure,ssl,present
although post is more secure as compared to get when ssl is present

example,scenario,secure,good,idea,attack
it is just an example that shows a scenario in which get is more secure than post but i don t think it would be a good idea to choose get over post from this attack reason

requests,safer
post requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than get requests

work,emails,alternative,easier,hacks
i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around

response,request,uri,sensitive,information,better
this response thus assumes that a request using the post verb would not use the uri to transfer sensitive information or it would be no better than get

input,url,used.is,situation,useful
when taking input we can use either get or post.the input is shown in the url when using get but not when post is used.is there a situation where get is more useful than post

data,server,good,idea,lower,limit
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post

comparative,table,secure
however in the comparative table i linked get is listed as less secure than post

little,safer,parameters,browser
post is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url

best,method,database,cat
i m searching for the best method to get result with database contain more than 100000 post and more than 100000 cat

size,limit,smaller
you ll hit problems with larger submissions and file-uploads as the size limit for a get is much smaller than a post

requests,lightweight,high,load
more over it seems that get requests are more lightweight than post under high load

non-url,input,method,appropriate
i can t help with the coding side of your question but if you re passing in a non-url input then the post method would be more appropriate than get

better
post is not better than get

speaking,request,types,requests,better
speaking of get request types you should also know that get requests tend to perform better than post

request,smaller,websockets,accurate
a get request will be slightly smaller than a post although using websockets would give a more accurate figure

form,_server,cleaner,url,parameter
also you can determine if someone is submitting a form or getting the form by checking if _server request_method post which is cleaner than using a get url parameter though i guess there s nothing wrong with the other approach...

type,faster,cause,curious
is type get faster than type post cause i am curious how both work

worse,security,default,parameters
one reason post is worse for security is that get is logged by default parameters and all data is almost universally logged by your webserver

khan,answer,secure,riggsfolly
edit taking into account what was said in the comments though it looks more secure and is recommended by w3 see touheed khan s answer post isn t more secure than get and as riggsfolly said

bullet,proof,better
instead i m using post which isn t exactly bullet proof but still a better choice than get in this case

request,efficient,bear,mind
however a post request is less efficient as a get request - bear that in mind and only use post if you really need to

right,complex,type,better
i d question whether get is the right verb here considering you need to pass a complex type it sounds like it would be better served as a post

stick,action,data,xss-issues
stick with post on any action that does more than get data avoid xss-issues

information,access,token
the post at has more information on how to get that access token

secure,data,transfer
post is more secure then get and data transfer size limits are also there

capacity,data
post has more capacity it can transfer more data than get

simpler,faster
get is simpler and faster than post and can be used in most cases

data,values,url
using post allows for more data to be transferred since get will append the values to the url itself

method,faster
why get method is faster than post

data,safer
however post data are not much safer than get data anyway

method,capacity,response,better
because post method storing capacity of response is better than get response

parameters,url,better,safer,form,method
i don t recommend sending such parameters via url get it is better and safer if you use post form method

several,results,faster,lighter
i run the ab test several times with same results post is faster but get is lighter

secure
post isn t more secure than get

better,method
get is a better method in this case than post

data,method,little,harder,simple
although putting data with post method little harder than simple get

powelljf3,secure
as powelljf3 said post is more secure then get though it can still be gotten to

request,little,safer,parameters,browser
post request is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs

better,ajax,string
also post is generally considered better than get for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too

limit
so is it enough only to use limit to get more than 50 post

steps,blog,details,output
these steps were taken from this blog post which contains more details about how to investigate and what output you ll get

everybody,secure,https
why everybody here is saying post is more secure than get when used over https

unencrypted,connection,secure
on an unencrypted connection post is no more secure than get

secure
hence post is more secure than get

request,better,json
also a post request would be better than a get if you re sending json

ideas,problem
this post is more to get advises and ideas rather than solving a problem

method,preferred
is this why post method is more preferred than get or does it really matter in any case if it internally uses post or get

opinion,requests,secure,data
in my opinion post requests are not more secure than get requests and the data can be easily intercepted

character,doubt,performance
other than the fact that get has one character less than post i doubt there is any performance difference

faster
get is faster than post

better
i believe post is better than get

secure,information
post is more secure than get because you aren t showing information anywhere

secure,sense,data,url,request
using post is more secure than get in the sense that data shown into the url in get request but not in post

delegate,methods,request,earlier,key
i am using custom delegate methods but when i run this the get request is performed earlier than the post so i cannot get the key before the get is done

faster,encapsulation,character,limit,body
the get is usually faster because it has no encapsulation sends data via url usually with a 255 character limit as post exists encapsulation by being sent by the body of the http request

edit2,wrong,secure
edit2 seems as if i m wrong re post being more secure than get

aware,better,kind,thing,request
i am aware that a post is better for this kind of thing but my question is is this expected from a get request

requests,larger,maximum
post requests can be much larger than get requests as get requests are limited by the maximum length of a url

secure,request,parameters
also note that using post is absolutely not more secure than get because the request parameters aren t immediately visible in url

use,safer,rest
use post its safer than get if you use rest

vulnerable
get is more vulnerable than post as it can be transmitted and stored

secure,information,url
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

secure,http,protocol
post is no more secure than get over the http protocol

communicative,intent,request,payload
if you use post when get is more semantically correct it is less communicative of the intent of your request since post usually means you are sending a payload

shorter
generaly get is shorter than post

quicker,ajax,scenario
a get is a bit quicker and than a post in an ajax scenario

thing,guys,safer,user,data
one more thing some guys would misunderstand that post is safer than get as user can not see the sent data

data,secure,details,query
using post data is more secure than get because with get the details would be in the query string portion of the url

better,passwords,part,url,request,bad
i think whoever said post is better than get when using passwords meant that the passwords would be part of the url in the get request which would obviously be bad

faster
get is always faster than post

project,security,secure
i am asked to apply to all the actions of one mvc project for security reason says post is more secure than get which i disagree with

method,faster
it is said that get method is faster than post but i don t know why is it

1---------------------------------------------------

sandbox,user
you can t get more than 20 post if you are a sandbox user

user,value,easier
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post

user,value,easier,suitable,checks
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post so suitable checks for existance and ownership of the record would be important

safe,history
however post is a bit more safe than get because get could be stored in the history

users
i want to get all the users that has more than one post but

sandbox,mode,last
first of all if your instagram client is in sandbox mode then you can t get more than 20 post more clearly last 20 post

users,easier
while users can manipulate post it s far easier to manipulate get

base,appropriate
on that base a get is more appropriate then a post

page,users,info
what i m trying to get is a page that displays 20 users per page will have pagination with the fallowing info it should show only users that have more than 2 post published

note,user,logical
note that i am assuming a user can get invited to more than one post which seems logical

safe,seasoned,user
some people say get can be less safe than post -- but to the seasoned user this doesn t make any significant difference because they can intercept and modify headers of the request

appropiate,idempotent,queries,action
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

appropriate,queries,safe
get is more appropriate than post for queries because of its safe semantics

higher,overhead,user,shoulder
post has a higher overhead marginally if we re honest but it all adds up but it doesn t become part of the url so can t be seen by say a casual observer over the user s shoulder - whereas get can

easier,developers
using get is much easier than using post for most of developers

look,easier,radio,button
have a look at this post it is probably easier to get the selected radio button by changing your itemscontrol to use a listbox with the existing datatemplate

2---------------------------------------------------

category
i get somehow category repeated if it has more than 1 post eg

categories,ones
i try it and i get all the categories and not just the ones with more than 1 post in them

3---------------------------------------------------

point,view,forgery,easier,first,link,second
from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

opinion,second,thats,ecure,opinion.it,easier
in my opinion the second way to achieve this is better because using get is not thats ecure in my opinion.it s easier than using post

4---------------------------------------------------

unsecure,type,datatransactions,searchform,secure,things
get is more often used on unsecure type of datatransactions like for example a searchform and post is used when you want to make more secure things like a login form

sorry,information...,type,given--,helpful,things,comments
sorry that this post is more of the and for further information... type than a direct answer which i think has now been given-- i just thought it was helpful not to get things lost inside comments

5---------------------------------------------------

instagram,api
how to get more than 20 post from instagram using their api

tumblr,api,time
however it isn t clear how much the value can be for the standard tumblr api you can t get more than 50 post at a time

other---------------------------------------------------

patent,prior,art
you can t get a patent any more because with this post i will claim prior art -

list,cannot,busy,blog
i need to create a menu based on that list but cannot simply list all post and get it because it is a busy blog and has more than 2000 post

options,dosn,string,length,negative,slower,couple
post gives you more options and dosn t have a limit on parameter query string length like get the only negative is post is slower by a couple of milliseconds to create the request

commands,older,code,log,req.body
curl commands seem to work as do some other post commands from older code but when i log out req.body all i get is

complex
post is a little more complex than get though

able,single,rest
not able to get more than 100 post in single rest api call for the linkedin company updates

solution,variables,trickier,users
here s the solution for post variables as well which is probably trickier for more users than the get solution

request,appropriate,good,practice,bookmarkable,page-to-page
but do also remember that in your case get request looks more appropriate and as balusc says its not good practice to use post for bookmarkable page-to-page navigation


you can also chose to get more than 25 post at once

note,values,var,wich,sense,form
note that doing this will get the values via post var instead get wich makes more sense since you are sending via post your form

query,results,stackexchange,reputation,users,body,user
i need a query to get results from stackexchange dataset in such a way that it returns me 100 top reputation users with not more than 3 post body of post for each user

support,resources,faster,response,third,party
we provide a number of support resources which may get faster response than post on third party sites including the virtuoso users mailing list public support forums and confidential support cases

error
when i want to get more than 54 post i receive this error

tidy,refreshing,issues,method,thing
maybe i would mostly always choose post over get it s more tidy and refreshing and going back issues with post method are a thing from the past in any major browser they just ask you if you want to resend the data don t they

better,option,richer,sort,warnings
sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings

eps,situation,script,readable,transformations,object,size
for eps is the same situation the post script is more readable but you should apply all necessery transformations on object before get its size

hope,clarification
hope you get the more clarification by this post

date,count
so it is considerably less then what facebook states in their documentation at least looking by the date however by count it seems you get more than 50 post

problem,jquery,result,earlier,.js,file,error
the problem i have noticed is that sometimes the jquery post result is retrieved earlier than the load of the .js file has been completed so i get an error and of course the jquery plugin doesn t work

level,protection,token
but using post instead of get presumably adds one more level of protection for xsrf types of attack it does not you need some form of explicit xsrf protection token with post or with get

idea,cookie,set,fast,cache,able
i had the idea to switch automatically between get and post for example if cookie set because get is more fast and cache able and post is more save

size,restrictions,least,configurable,higher,end,request
gets have a size restrictions post do not or at least it s a configurable setting on the server and has a larger higher end than a get request would

thing
however there s one thing we haven t considered yet - what if you never get more than 5 post

deeper,pre,incrementors
i m trying to get deeper with post and pre incrementors but am a bit stuck with the following expression

content,blog,test,posts...,height,widgets,larger
for example on the blog page of my current project i have two widgets in the sidebar one for latest tweets and one for latest music news however as you can see on this page the content of the blog post all test posts... are much longer than the height of the two widgets and would of course get larger as more post are added

able,database,result,author,objects,ones
i m able to query my database below to get the result that i want but i don t want to have to iterate through all of the author objects just the ones that have more than one post

functions,important
however if you want to get more than one post rather use functions mentioned above i think the most important thing is to grab them in one db query and not in ineffective way one-by-one

posts_per_page,nothing,query
i know there can be problems with posts_per_page but nothing is working i ve searched a lot to get the query to display more than one post

system,box,larger
so i have a post system and i want the box to get larger as more post come in

wait,time,long,larger,issue
the usual wait time of the post is not too long not too larger than get so i don t think that should be an issue and post always gets back with a 200

second,.net,larger,maxrequestlength,http,module,portion
to answer part of your second question with .net if the post is larger than maxrequestlength part of the .net configuration but smaller than maxallowedcontentlength part of the iis configuration you can create a custom http module to get at the portion of the post that came through

scenario,susceptible,websites,attacker,arbitrary,request,ways,arbitary,automatic
the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that arenâ t under the attackerâ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual

advantages
post has a lot more advantages than get

usual,tagging,objects,tag,tags,applications
usual way with tagging is to get objects by tag but if tags are used by few applications it may give more than post

frequent
get and head being much more frequent than post

shorter,basic,problem,test,workouthandler
i have simplified the app so the post is shorter but the basic problem is that if i get test in workouthandler - it cannot recognize methods in wardenstrategies or loginhelper unless i also include those files in the handler they are already included in app.rb

logical
but a get seems more logical than a post anyway


i get far more than 50 post

elegant,options,development
i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get

num_post,count,.filter,tags
i normally use something like this tag.object.annotate num_post count post .filter num_post__gt 2 to get tags with more than 2 post

cloudinary,direct,accepts_nested_attributes_for,images
i m trying to get cloudinary direct uploads working on a rails app using carrierwave and accepts_nested_attributes_for to submit one or more images with a post


when i try to get more than 100 post it returns

recent,reply,replies,created_on,value,post_id,subject
if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject

book,blog,better,simple,example,horse,mouth
if you are curious though rather than just trusting a book or a blog post it is better to make a simple example and take it apart - you get it straight from the horse s mouth and you learn a whole lot more

options,timeout,short,time,possible,dialog,annoying,flash
additional options are to show this via a timeout so it s only shown when the post takes more than a short time and to use some form of fadein not sure if possible with a dialog then you don t get the annoying flash on the times it s very quick

problem,shipping,longer,call,alert,session
the problem is that the post shipping takes longer than the call get alert then shows me the session variable not updated

pinoyyd,neater,straight,point
the pinoyyd post is neater and get straight to the point how do i authorise a background web app without user intervention
