little,bit,slower
memcpy is still a little bit slower than memmove

slower,hand,copy
why is memcpy so much slower than memmove or hand rolled copy on the server

2x,faster,server
edit memmove is 2x faster than memcpy on the server

platform,faster
the question is about is there really any platform where memcpy is faster than memmove

asmlib,version,slower,glibc
bad news is that the asmlib version of memmove is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of memcpy

slower,system
why does memcpy perform slower than memmove on my system

slower,assumptions
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions

impression,faster
from reading other so questions such as this or this gives the impression that memcpy should work faster than memmove and intuitively this should be so

slower
and it said memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy

std,slower,emphasis,first
std memmove may be very slightly slower than std memcpy emphasis added because it has to first check whether the source and target ranges overlap

1---------------------------------------------------

platform,faster,none,similiar,functions,bug
so in what platform and how memcpy can be significantly faster than memmove if there is none why providing two similiar functions instead of just memmove and lead to a lots of bug

platform,im,faster,short,unalligned
on some arm platform im working on memmove was 3 times faster than memcpy for short unalligned load

2---------------------------------------------------

c++,rusty,efficient,memory
as an aside my c c++ is rusty but is not memcpy more efficient than memmove if you know you don t have overlapping memory

answers,sophisticated,memory
as already pointed out in other answers memmove is more sophisticated than memcpy such that it accounts for memory overlaps

other---------------------------------------------------

laptop,slower,enough,runs,speed,server
memmove on the laptop runs slower than memcpy but oddly enough runs at the same speed as the memmove on the server

implementations,cost,function,call,greater,scenario,behavior
it is entirely possible that in most implementations the cost of a memmove function call will not be significantly greater than memcpy in any scenario in which the behavior of both is defined

note,overhead,direction,copying
note that memmove has more overhead than memcpy because it has to determine which direction of copying is safe

buffers,overlap,fine,use,optimizations,faster
if you know buffers cannot overlap memcpy is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than memmove

mats,petersson,cache,friendlier
in addition as mats petersson said memmove is cache friendlier than memcpy

slower,assumptions,source,destination,superior,standard
while memmove will be only slightly slower than memcpy due to the assumptions it needs to make about the source and destination in memcpy they cannot overlap it should still be far superior to any standard loop

efficient,memmove.,use
memcpy is more efficient than memmove. in general use memmove only if you have to
