drawback,vertices,intuitive,area,proportional
the one drawback is that distance between vertices might be slightly less intuitive than polygons area but the two are proportional

new,segment,x,last,point.
plenty of others don t use a delimiter at all and require you to start a new segment polygons if you re more than x distance away from the last point. furthermore these things often wind up being multi-gb ascii files so reading the entire thing into memory can be impractical

radius,circle
if that distance is less than the radius of the circle then you know that the polygons intersects the circle

actual,minimum,list,maximum,greater
calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found so far
