solution,faster,clauses
the next solution is faster than using in and except clauses

else,statement,digit,greater,max1,first,digits
for such numbers as 54321 the else statement will be executed never because any next digit is greater than max1 except the first two digits

example,oop,perspective
the next example does more or less the same except from an oop perspective

start,previous,block,invariant,blocks,size,last,slack
in both cases you may also have to shift one or two elements off the start end of some blocks to the end start of the previous next block again at most o n 1 2 times to maintain an invariant that no two blocks differ in size by more than 1 except for the last which is used to take up slack

purpose,complexity,accordion,better,easier,section,tabs
for me they serve pretty same purpose to hide complexity except accordion is imho better for continuous-reading it s easier to quickly go to next section while tabs seems to be more random-access

ceiling,number,amount,greater,lower,integer
now i would like to take the ceiling of this number except in cases where the amount it is greater than the next lower integer is smaller than some epsilon
