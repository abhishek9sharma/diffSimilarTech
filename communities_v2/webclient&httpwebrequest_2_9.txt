code,httpwebresponse
i d rather use webclient because it requires less code than httpwebrequest httpwebresponse

better,option
so simply httpwebrequest is better option then webclient

order,milliseconds,slower
using webclient is potentially slightly on the order of a few milliseconds slower than using httpwebrequest directly

simpler,order,cookiecontainer,protected,getwebrequest
you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but in order to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and override the protected getwebrequest method

class,idiomatic,hand,rolling
also i think the webclient class is more idiomatic these days than hand rolling httpwebrequest

higher,class,slower
because webclient is higher class of httpwebrequest and its slower

httpwebresponse,little,bit,lower,level
httpwebresponse and httpwebrequest are a little bit lower level than webclient

easier,powerful,control
webclient is easier but httpwebrequest is more powerful and allows for more control

simpler,interface,care,reading
webclient has a much simpler interface than httpwebrequest and takes care of reading and writing from the streams for you
