better,performance
is calayer better than uiview in terms of performance

documentation,lighter,hundreds
i am using calayer s because as suggested in documentation calayer s are lighter than uiview and i have hundreds of them

worse,performance
i noticed calayer had worse performance than uiview

view,larger,lighter,frame,myview
this is better than using a second view a bit larger as a calayer is lighter than a uiview and you don t have do modify the frame of myview which is good for instance if myview is a uiimageview

smaller
i want to add a calayer inside an uiview and this calayer will be smaller than the uiview

fancy,wrapper,â,uiresponder
a uiview is no more than a fancy wrapper for a calayer â bringing uiresponder events animation conveniences among many other things

wrapper
a uiview is no more than a wrapper for an underlying calayer

corresponding
in fact each uiview has even more than 1 corresponding calayer

controller,multiple
does that mean the the view controller has multiple uiview or that the uiview has more than one calayer
