addition,division
the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

operations,addition,harder,division,slower
for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

1---------------------------------------------------

operator,second,higher,precedence
this subtraction operator occurs within the second brackets and so has a higher precedence than the multiplication

unary,priority,lower
in t-sql unary minus is made to be the same priority as subtraction which is lower than multiplication

higher,precedence,digit,character
since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

other---------------------------------------------------

slower

title,faster,example
as in title why is multiplication much faster than subtraction in this example

addition,rectangular,calculation,cheaper
addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication
