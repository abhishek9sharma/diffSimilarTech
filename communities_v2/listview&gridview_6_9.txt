2---------------------------------------------------

better,dataview,clean
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

better,situation
i think the listview is better than gridview in this situation

other---------------------------------------------------

error
the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview

note,view,property,designer
note that i do not want to bind a gridview directly to the view property from a resourcedictionary where the datatemplates x shared attribute is set to false as this leads to problems in the xaml designer view can t be shared by more than one listview

comparison,experience,lightweight
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview
