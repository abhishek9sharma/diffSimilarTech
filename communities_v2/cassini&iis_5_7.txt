from this question i found out that iis server is better than cassini for my purpose but i don t know how to check the default server of my website

web,server,better,problem
iis express is a web server albeit better than cassini iis express is not your problem

cassini was much better than iis express but doesn t properly support the integrated pipeline

slower
what could be the reason that makes iis slower than cassini

better,performance,able,f5
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio

studio,sp1,upgrade,real,project,exception
what i would suggest is to make sure you are using visual studio 2010 sp1 then install iis express which is an upgrade to cassini and is much more like real iis and then switch your project to use iis express and see if you get the same exception
