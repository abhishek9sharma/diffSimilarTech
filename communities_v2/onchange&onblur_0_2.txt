better,focusout,blur
onchange is a better choice than onblur or focusout because blur and focusout also fire when the contents of the text field hasn t changed

focus,imo,event,appropriate,onblure
edit you probably only want to validate when the value changes and field loses focus that s why imo the onchange event would be more appropriate than onblur not onblure
