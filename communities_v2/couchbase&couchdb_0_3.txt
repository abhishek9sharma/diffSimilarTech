btw,binary,mechanism,efficient,protocol,bidirectional
couchbase btw also uses binary replication mechanism which will be more efficient than couchdb as long as the couchdb protocol is not utilized for bidirectional data exchange and conflict resolution

faster,scalable,option,version,views,membase,server,sophisticated
i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level it s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together

memcache,server,persistence,layer,needs
couchbase looks more like a memcache server with a persistence layer powered by couchdb and maybe it does not fit your needs
