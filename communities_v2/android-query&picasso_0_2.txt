better,offline,mode,internet,connectivity,record,form,server,cache
android-query is better than picasso because while in offline mode no internet connectivity picasso tries to fetch record form server whereas android-query maintains its cache form where it fetched the images

images,rules
if picasso doesn t satisfy you for any reason you can also try android-query which does much more than picasso it s not only for images but the same rules apply
