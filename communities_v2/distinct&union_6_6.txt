tables,huge,faster
however the tables are huge and the union all i read its faster than distinct takes forever to execute even with just two tables let alone 6

outer,query,faster,uniqueness,data
i am currently using union all and a distinct in the outer query as this proved much faster than using union s for the uniqueness of data

slower,de-dupping.
union distinct is slower than union all but you may need it for de-dupping.

note,rows,faster,duplicates
a side note since you want all rows using union all is faster since it does not need to perform a distinct to eliminate duplicates

list,duplicates,slower
keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union all which will not remove duplicates

other---------------------------------------------------

faster
union all is generally faster than using distinct or grouping
