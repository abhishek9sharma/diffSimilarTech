fp,smaller,operand,mantissa,operands,certain,magic
since fp addition shifts the smaller operand s mantissa until both operands have the same exponent you can add a certain magic number to force it

in addition for doing powers of two bitshifting is usually a little clearer than doing exponent though choose whatever works for you
