radical,concept,slower,shortcuts
this is a radical concept i know but the mouse is slower than keyboard shortcuts


for example do you use keyboard more than mouse

dropdown,menu,accessible
i need to change my dropdown menu which works well with a mouse but i would like to make it more accessible with keyboard

slower
doing it with mouse is much more slower than it can be done with keyboard

input,essential,important,interaction
also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction

fallback,snail,red,close,window,button,movements,slower,shortcut
the last fallback is to go the snail way - to mouse over to click on the red close window button but any mouse movements are slower than a keyboard shortcut

ctr,cmd,better,right,thing
it recommends using ctr cmd + 1 to use the keyboard this is much better than having to use the mouse but i m still looking for a just do the right thing most of the time automatic solution

faster
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse

name,completion,faster
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

images,screenshots,events,similar,activities,real
this approach using purely images screenshots and generating mouse and keyboard events is more similar to manual testing activities performed by real people which have just monitor mouse and keyboard
