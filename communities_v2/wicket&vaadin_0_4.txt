performance,testing,better
this is only a guess and is not based on actual performance testing probably wicket will be doing better than vaadin

mind,css,easier,simple,markup
with this in mind customizing the css of a wicket app is significantly easier than vaadin for the simple reason that you control the markup

resources
wicket probably has more resources than vaadin

easier,default,ui
i would say vaadin would be easier over wicket as the default ui elements look really good
