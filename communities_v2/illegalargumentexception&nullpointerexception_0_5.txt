disclaimer,idiomatic
disclaimer all this would be needed just to throw an illegalargumentexception which is less idiomatic than a nullpointerexception

mind,specific,problem,argument
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method

sense,string,blank
also throwing illegalargumentexception makes more sense instead of nullpointerexception when string has blank empty or null values

longer,filepath
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever

abstraction,level,better
since it s an exported method clients should get an exception on their abstraction level so illegalargumentexception is better than nullpointerexception
