better,nashorn
in this case jackson performs better than nashorn which performs much better than org.json

takeaway,benchmark,better,gson
quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson

p.s. my recommendation would be to remove jsonobject conversion and instead return an object of actual class as internally spring uses jackson which is more powerful json framework then org.json
