improvements,features,vanilla,suggestion,c++,http
due to many improvements to couchdb and that cloudant has more features than vanilla couchdb my suggestion would be to use a c++ http library to communicate with cloudant

libraries,wiki
regarding cloudant it s more or less just couchdb so to connect you can use these libraries from the couchdb wiki
