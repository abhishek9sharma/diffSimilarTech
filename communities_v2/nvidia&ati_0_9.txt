glsl,compiler,picky,shader,code
for example i ve noticed nvidia s glsl compiler is a little more picky than ati s and rejects some shader code that otherwise works fine

better,faster,sure
ati might be a better between nvidia and ati since it was reportedly faster in 2009 but i m not sure if those stats are still correct


ati seems to tell more than nvidia

hpc,system,builders,systems,huge,push,computing,amd
another reason to choose nvidia is because that s what the hpc system builders have been building systems with since nvidia made a huge push for gpgpu computing where as it s less backed by amd ati

architectures,certain,bitcoin,mining,better
nvidia and ati architectures differ enough so that for certain tasks such as bitcoin mining ati is vastly better than nvidia

wont,modern,hardware,identical,older,laptop,card
i m having an issue where my glsl 130 code wont run properly on my somewhat modern ati 5850 hardware while the identical code runs perfectly fine on an older laptop with a nvidia card i have

cuda,technology,easier,flexible,brook+,language
4 is nvidia cuda technology is easier more flexible than ati brook+ language

driver,issue,better,opengl,directx,implementation,amd,versions
there is almost always some driver issue between them but in general nvidia is better for opengl has bugs in directx implementation and ati amd versions only is better for directx has bugs in opengl implementation

better,tools,rendermonkey
the reason i ask is that it seems like nvidia has way better tools and ati seems to have cancelled rendermonkey
