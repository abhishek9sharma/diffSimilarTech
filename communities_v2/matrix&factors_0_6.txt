vector,rows,object,slower,normal,distance
i measured the time it takes to calculate the distance between a vector and the rows of a matrix when they are in the object and it work slower by a factors of 3 then the normal distance function

model,nonlinear,terms,smaller
consider a model with lots of factors or nonlinear terms like bs ns or poly the model frame is much smaller compared with model matrix

multiplication,code,ten,old
in the code below i use block multiplication to speed up your code for a 1024x1204 matrix by more than a factors of ten 7.1 s with old code and 0.6s with new using only a single thread without using sse avx

worse,size
however it still performs worse by initially a factors of 3 but as the matrix size increases asymptotically worse by a factors of exactly 2

advance,number,complicated,mistaken,two-dimensional
eta to answer your question in more general terms let s say we had the number of subjects and levels set up in advance increasing the number of factors is more complicated unless i m mistaken because then it would no longer be a two-dimensional matrix

triangle,input,lower,triangular
finally note that by default ichol references the lower triangle of the input matrix and returns a lower triangular factors
