part
when you then calculate the integer part is 1 less that you might expect while the fractions part is slightly less than one

bits,mantissa,larger,number,type,precision
if the number of bits in the mantissa or fractions is larger than the number of bits in your integer type then you ll possibly lose precision when someone types in a number such as

bits,part,bigger,hard,data-type,non,trouble
i know there are not that many mantissa bits for fractions part for bigger numbers but you did not specify which floating data-type you are using if 32 64 80 128 256 bits or more so hard to say and if the integer part is bigger then your integral data-type used to cut off the non fractions part then you would be in trouble with f-long f

text,size,part,bigger
the label s text size of an integer part is bigger than text size of a fractions part

python,limited,float,bigger,results,sense
as python integer is less limited than the float you may get bigger results with the fractions if it makes sense at all
