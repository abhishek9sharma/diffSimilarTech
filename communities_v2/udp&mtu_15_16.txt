datagram,larger,fragmented
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented

datagram,larger,size,last,fragment,destination
when send a udp datagram larger than the mtu size only the last fragment of the udp datagram is putted out to the destination

note,packets,bigger,hope,hosts
note that udp packets bigger than the mtu s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip

real,life,packets,size,equal
in real life udp packets size usually is equal or less than mtu size

lwip,packets,pc,larger
my lwip can send udp packets to pc but my pc would fail to reassemble when the udp packets are larger than mtu

packets,larger,ip,fragmentation
basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it

frames,smaller,architecture,bytes
ideally your udp frames are smaller than the mtu for your architecture say 1500 bytes so the messages won t get chopped up in transit

packets,greater,size,network
udp packets greater than the mtu size of the network that carries them will be automatically split up into multiple packets and then reassembled by the recipient

ip,datagram,larger,segment
ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a udp datagram is larger than the mtu for the segment allows

datagrams,chunks,size,bigger,different,story
udp uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story

datagram,bigger
they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu

traffic,profiling,message,size,larger
if there is network congestion rate limiting or traffic profiling or if the udp message size is larger than the mtu

blocks,data,pieces,smaller,network,segment
to send large blocks of data via udp you need to chop them up into pieces smaller than the mtu for the network segment across which you re transmitting them

payload,size,bigger,segment,packet
if udp payload size is bigger than mtu size udp will silently segment the packet

socket,programming,application,data,value
i am working on udp socket programming and i have to stop the transmission in application if requested data is more than mtu value

package,larger
what would happen if my udp package is larger than mtu
