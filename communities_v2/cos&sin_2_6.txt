machine,faster
or maybe flip them on my machine sin seems faster than cos

cheaper,sqrt,1-sin
if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

performance,std,slower
after reading a question related with the performance of sin cos why is std sin and std cos slower than sin and cos

smaller,pi,bigger,little
3.14 is pretty close but a little smaller than pi and sin 3.14 is thus pretty close but a little bigger than 0 cos 3.14 is thus pretty close but a little smaller in absolute terms than -1 so tan 3.14 is a little less than 0

tick,better,distinction,sign
cos itself seems to be consistently a tick 0 01 better than sin but the case distinction to reconstruct the sign has an extra test

component-wise,function,faster,vvsincos,pipeline,calculations,entries,vector
so if we have a vector and want to calculate a component-wise function over it say sin and cos it is faster to use vvsincos from accelerate because it will pipeline the calculations of sin and cos for all the entries in the vector which is faster than using a for-loop over the vector
