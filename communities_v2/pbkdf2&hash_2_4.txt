secure,simple,salt
pbkdf2 is more secure than a simple hash or even a salt hash

key-stretching,algorithm,quicker,sha512,thousands,generation,second
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

techniques,bcrypt,better,plain,resources
key strengthening techniques such as bcrypt or pbkdf2 are generally considered better than plain hash since cracking them requires more resources

algorithms,bcrypt,aka,rfc2898derivebytes,slower,standard
key derivation algorithms such as bcrypt and pbkdf2 aka rfc2898derivebytes are much slower than standard hash algorithms
