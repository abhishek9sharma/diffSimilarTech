architectures,arm,easier,instruction,set
do any of the other common architectures like arm mips sparc etc have an easier than x86 instruction set

assembly,easier,b,data
if you have not programmed assembly before i suggest you choose mips since it is easier than x86 and then b looking at how to transfer data with the serial port to begin with since this illustrates memory-mapped i o that is used

1---------------------------------------------------

assembly,architecture,complicated
i have studied the x86 assembly and architecture and it appears to be a lot more complicated than mips

care,output,complex
the wording in your question seems to suggest you don t care as much that the output is mips but rather you want the output to be less complex than x86

complex,instructions
x86 have more complex instructions than mips

other---------------------------------------------------

bet,spim,assembly,straightforward,anyways
a better bet might be to install spim and to learn mips assembly which is more straightforward than x86 anyways

orthogonal
mips is much more orthogonal than x86 could ever dream of being
