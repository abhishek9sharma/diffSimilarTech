rest,better,general,string,comparisons
rest assured though that strcmp is better equipped in the general case for string comparisons than memcmp is

strings,lengths,faster
if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp

simpler,places,strings
memcmp is simpler than strcmp and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned
