popular,date,new,release,webforms,useful,good,support
phpunit is more popular and up to date as simpletest hasn t had a new release for some time though for testing webforms it s still very useful as phpunit does not have good support for that

easier
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

easier,best,opinion
simpletest is slightly easier to grasp but phpunit is the best in my opinion at least so if you want to start learning and using a framework start with the one you re going to use when you ll be a master in tdd

subjective,nicer,code,coverage,reports
subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest
