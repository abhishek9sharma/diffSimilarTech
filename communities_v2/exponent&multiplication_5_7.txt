0---------------------------------------------------

analogous,successive,faster
this is analogous to the way you can compute exponent using successive squaring much faster than by repeated multiplication

int,larger,powers,faster
as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

misunderstanding,faster
the misunderstanding is that incrementing the exponent is not faster than doing a multiplication

small,parameter,faster
however with really very small parameter 2 in your case exponent is faster than multiplication

other---------------------------------------------------

naive,slower,increases
however naive multiplication will get slower and slower as the exponent increases

easier,decimal,significant,digits
multiplication is even easier as you dont have to line up the decimal points you just do the math on the significant digits and simply add the exponent

note,operator,higher,precedence,division,mathematics
note that the exponent operator has a higher precedence than multiplication and division just like in mathematics
