memory,free,pair
that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

datasets,users,program,slows,programs,data
but if it works with large datasets the users will notice that using the malloc -only program slows down other programs much more than the realloc -using program with the same data

worse,old,new,pointers,valid
realloc is worse than malloc in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during the realloc

overflow,free,pair,costs,internal,hidden
in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

smarter
i mean i think realloc is way smarter so why do we even need malloc

memory,stores,special,location,later,time
malloc often gives you more memory that you ask and stores the actual value in a special location that realloc can access at a later time

faster,memcpy,free
a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

justification,faster,2nd,manual,copy
the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free
