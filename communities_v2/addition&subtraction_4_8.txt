mess,things,slower,unlikely
it s possible though that software could mess things up by making subtraction slower than addition - but that s unlikely

chip,architecture,slower
this is a hold over from older compilers and interpreters on old chip architecture that would do addition slightly slower than subtraction

1---------------------------------------------------

bignum,little,slower
but i d think bignum subtraction is a little slower than bignum addition

conceivable,slower
here it is conceivable that subtraction is slower than addition

other---------------------------------------------------

issue,result,bigger,bits,negative,number
i was thinking that there could be an issue if the result from the addition is bigger than what 15 bits can represent 32767 or if i get a negative number in the subtraction

higher,precedence,multiplication
the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does

a111,equal,better
a111 addition is equal or better than subtraction

work,code
the subtraction case is going to require a little more work than addition in this code
