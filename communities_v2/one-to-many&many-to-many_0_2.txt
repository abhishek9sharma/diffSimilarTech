associations,better,relations
using two one-to-many associations is always better than relying on many-to-many relations

certain,tags,appropriate,convenient,efficient,single,order
iâ ve read a so questionâ s comment where inserting order# 68 as pictured wouldnâ t cause any trouble but if i wanted to query orders by certain tags a many-to-many is more appropriate convenient efficient since otherwise in a one-to-many every single order will have to be checked to know how its tags is this true
