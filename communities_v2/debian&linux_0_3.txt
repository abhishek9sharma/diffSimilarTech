-alpine,alpine,smaller,base-image,image
it is widely used to have a separated tag with the postfix -alpine in it to indicate that alpine linux is used which is a much smaller base-image than the debian image

system,older,wheezy,glibc
if your system linux is older like debian wheezy for example your glibc version will be older than the required one

windows,scrapyd,package,scrapy,worse,box,target
personally i develop on the windows but deploy on debian where couldn t find the scrapyd package at all at the time i was working on it and noticed that performance of scrapy is considerably worse than on linux box so you might reconsider your target
