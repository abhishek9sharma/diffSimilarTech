better,long-time,market,torch
tensorflow is better at marketing itself than long-time players of the open-source market like torch and theano

better,computational,graph,visualizations,torch
tensorflow has better computational graph visualizations than theano and torch

other---------------------------------------------------

faster
it theano runs much faster than tensorflow

testing,slow-down,ranges,slower,performance,application
in my testing the slow-down from using tensorflow ranges from about 1.5-3.0 times slower than using theano but its performance will depend on your application

faster,respects,wider
theano is still faster than tensorflow in many respects and supports a wider range of operations
