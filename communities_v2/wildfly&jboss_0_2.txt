request,response,kind,lightweight
is it because request response handling on wildfly is kind of more lightweight than the jboss 4.2.3

server,port,eap,standalone.xml,evoluated,stable
everything is set as default for sure the server is up and listening to port 9990 trying to compare both wildfly and jboss eap standalone.xml but they aren t exactly the same wildfly is more evoluated compared to jboss eap which is more stable
