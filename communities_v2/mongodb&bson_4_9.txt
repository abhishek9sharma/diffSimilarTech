the distinction between int64 and int32 in mongodb is more about bson storage size

stores,memory,based,system,flexible,objects
mongodb stores everything in memory anyway and works in a similar vein being a key-value based system however i believe mongodb is more flexible as it allows for storing bson objects within themselves

document,larger,mb,exception
so if your document bson is larger than 16 mb mongodb throws exception

document,json,structure,specific
a document in mongodb is more or less like a json structure bson to be specific

annoying,data,back,office,pain,binary,different,platforms,representation
the bson becomes even more annoying to work with when exporting data from mongo to another db platform this is the case when dealing with big data that is collected and you want to merge it with some properties from the back office mongodb this means a lot of pain you need to transform the binary objectid to a string in order to join with the id in different platforms that do not use bson representation
