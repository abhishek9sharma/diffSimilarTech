maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it

the repeater is still faster than the gridview but the difference shouldn t be big if you code it right

words,performance,better
in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview

each button raises the correct event but the events never reach the gridview because they are handled at a lower level by the repeater
