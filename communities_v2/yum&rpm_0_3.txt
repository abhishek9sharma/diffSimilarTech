easier,groups,machines
yum makes it easier to maintain groups of machines without having to manually update each one using rpm

latter,option,transactions
i strongly suggest either of the first two options over the latter option as the latter option does not always play nicely with the way rpm and yum handle transactions when more than one rpm are involved

commands,difference,list,output,bigger,-qa,package,dependencies
both commands works in the same way only difference is yum list installed output maybe bigger than rpm -qa because yum will show package dependencies also in its output
