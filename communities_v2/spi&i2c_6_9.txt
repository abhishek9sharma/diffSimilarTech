faster
i wanted to know that what makes spi faster than i2c

post,faster
post explaining why spi is faster than i2c

1---------------------------------------------------

complex,slow,uart,etc.
i know i2c is more complex slow than spi uart etc. but it s a constrain

communication,complex,uart,solution
communication via i2c is more complex that with uart or spi solution

other---------------------------------------------------

limited
spi is not less limited than i2c in this case

better,temperatures
how is spi better than i2c at these temperatures

research,faster,last,control
i have done some research about them and it seems to be that spi is faster than i2c but the last one ensures more control and error detection over the first one

bit,banging,complicated
first bit banging i2c is way more complicated than bit banging spi

top,bus,slower,control,data
on top of that the i2c bus is slower than spi because there are control data exchanged
