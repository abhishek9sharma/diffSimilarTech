experience,functionality,syntax,cleaner,template,engine
either way i intend to use smarty partly because i have lots of experience with it and partly because its much more well documented and has much more functionality than blade and to me the syntax is slightly cleaner than twig although the template engine is not the point of this question really

better,self-restraint+plain,php
if you use twig which i like better than smarty - although i still prefer self-restraint+plain php most ide s that support django templating should work with it since the syntax is nearly the same

market,engine,new,symfony,better,imho
if your in the market for a templating engine twig a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than smarty imho
