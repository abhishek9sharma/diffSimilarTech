jquery,better,customisation
it turns out jquery datatables is better suited for customisation and we have adopted this instead of using jqgrid

someone,better
if you don t have someone around to help with jqgrid you are better off with datatables

better,customizations,bells,whistles,little,harder
datatables has better customizations as far as clientside bells and whistles where as jqgrid is a little harder to make look as pretty but can do some pretty good serverside interaction from what i understand
