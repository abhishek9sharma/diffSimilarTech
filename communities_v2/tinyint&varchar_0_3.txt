spaces,main,table
as varchar n takes spaces much more than tinyint and your main table is table2 so the second scenario is more optimize

better
i think tinyint is better than varchar in this case

efficient,aju,john
using varchar is less efficient than using tinyint like aju john suggested in his comment but unless i m dealing with a really performance-critical or a huge table - i find it easier to deal with
