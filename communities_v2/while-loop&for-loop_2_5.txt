cleaner
edit just realized a while-loop may well be a lot cleaner than a for-loop for this

faster
and now we know that for-loop is faster than while-loop

faster
i have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop

greater,cost,compiler
also it seems like a for-loop is of greater cost to the compiler than a while-loop

slower,data,cheaper,equivalent,iterations
the reason for the second case much slower on sorted data is that a while-loop is cheaper than the equivalent for-loop when there are zero iterations
