easier,precompiled,apt,r-cran-rgl,appropriate,cran
even if you re on linux it s much easier to get a precompiled version sudo apt install r-cran-rgl on ubuntu if you have the appropriate cran repositories set up

dual,boot,easier,opencl,cli,fashion
also i would recommend doing a dual boot to ubuntu it s much easier to work with opencl in a linux cli fashion

distro,shortcut,instructions,simpler,shortcuts
see but if you are using a linux distro there may be shortcut instructions that make it simpler under ubuntu for example there are shortcuts in

forgiving,filesystem,least,dev,version,default
linux however is less forgiving and has a filesystem that is case sensitive at least my dev ubuntu version does but i guess it is the default for linux

calculations,win7,timings,wonder,faster
i m testing some simple benchmarking calculations on win7 and linux ubuntu 16 to compare the timings and being wonder win appears to be much faster than linux

project,amazon,ami,server,familiar,difference
i am new at a firm and i was given a project that was on amazon linux ami now we need to transfer project on another server and because i am more familiar with ubuntu than with amazon linux ami i was wondering if there much difference and will project work perfectly

adobe,cs,distro,easier,quiet
although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution

closer,numerous,things,grandmothers,world
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

fuser,-n,process,distro,centos
one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it

arch,slower,machine
i don t know why arch linux is slower than ubuntu on your machine

alpine,docker,image,light,better,centos
you can use alpine linux docker image it is very light and is better than both ubuntu and centos image to be used as the docker

distribution,operating,single,name,line,system,kernel,standard,kde,environments,gray
sometimes a linux distribution contains far more than an operating system but is informally referred to by a single name such as ubuntu and so the line between what the operating system is the linux kernel and standard libraries perhaps and the applications that merely ship with that operating system the gnome and kde environments on linux is pretty gray

centos,amazon,things,worse,long
also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long
