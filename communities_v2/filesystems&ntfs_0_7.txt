unix,better,ext3,bits,corruption,design,choices
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

prior,experience,simpler,ones,xfs,ext2
although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job

well-defined,fat,tricky,bytes,space,code,data,file
if you need to load from a well-defined filesystems fat or ntfs this is more tricky you have only 450 bytes of space because 60 of the 512 bytes are used by the filesystems internally for code that interprets the data of the filesystems finds the file containing the code and loads it into memory

performance,hard,better,traditional,unix
generally the performance of hard filesystems like ntfs is better than that of traditional unix filesystems

actual,trickier,business,fat,ext3
actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

problem,windows,slower,typical,linux,lookups
the problem is that windows ntfs is slower than typical linux filesystems for these lookups

complex,time,nature
ntfs is much more complex and time consuming due to the more complex nature of this filesystems
