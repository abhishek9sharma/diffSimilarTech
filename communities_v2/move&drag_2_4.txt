mouse,press,release,order,able,bigger,parent,drop
i reimplemented the mouse move press and release events for the inner widget in order to be able to move it inside its bigger parent with drag drop

confusion...you,cannot,table,bigger,smaller,mouse,size
it ends up in a state of confusion...you basically cannot release the drag of the table it keeps getting bigger and smaller as you move your mouse - but you can never let go and release it to get the size you want

items,buttons,loop,item,difficult,reordering
this is easy to implement with buttons select items click up or down buttons to move - just loop through and apply the move to each selected item but much more difficult with drag reordering

jquery,ui,slower,mouse
i got a draggable object done with jquery ui and when i drag it it s way slower than i move my mouse
