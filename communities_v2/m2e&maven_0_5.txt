longer,works,builder,things
with 0.13 m2e this no longer works as the maven builder appears to put things in target your-artificat-version-snapshot web-inf classes

plugin,eclipse,compatibility,plugins,likely
moreover i m using m2e the maven plugin for eclipse so it seems that the compatibility of any maven plugins that might work by themselves is even less likely with m2e

words,friendly
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way

platform,others,integration,additional,plugins,web
m2e is also a platform that let others provide better integration with additional maven plugins android web development etc.

steeper,learning,projects,integration,iam
maven 2 has a steeper learning curve but provides a much richer set of functionality for building your projects and eclipse integration through m2e or iam
