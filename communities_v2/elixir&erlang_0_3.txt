steeper,learning,curve
erlang has a steeper learning curve compared to elixir

comparison,haskell,es6,farmiliar,languages,good,code
i m doing a comparison of erlang haskell elixir and es6 and i m less farmiliar with erlang and elixir but i want to represent all of these languages fairly so is this good erlang code

mechanisms,verbose,function,definitions
i agree some mechanisms in elixir are slightly more verbose than erlang function definitions being my personal pet peeve and vice-versa
