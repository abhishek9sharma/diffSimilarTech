mdpi,resolution
so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

ldpi,mdpi,resolutions,table
even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio

50px,mdpi,larger
if in java code the values would be in pixels so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screens

other---------------------------------------------------

image,smaller,greater,dpi
edit - now that i think about it i m not sure why your image would appear smaller unless your screens had a greater dpi than hdpi

device,api,density,lower
i am not aware of any device that can use api 14 with a screens density lower than hdpi
