x,better,.__init__,multiple,inheritance
i think a.__init__ self x is better then super .__init__ x because it supports multiple inheritance and i didn t find a way to do it with super

martijn,pieters,.__str__,better
also as stated by martijn pieters using super super .__str__ is better than doing it the way i did deck.__str__ self
