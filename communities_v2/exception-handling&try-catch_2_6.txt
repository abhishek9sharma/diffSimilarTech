robust,exact,block,info
in general try-catch is more robust does not require you to define an exact position of where to test could be a block and provides info about the exception-handling

heavier,simple,good,practice,allocation
will hide the exception-handling and since dealing with exception-handling is heavier compared to a simple if t why isn t the normal new t not considered less good practice considering we will have to use try-catch to check if a simple allocation succeeded and if we don t just watch the program die

slower
try-catch is actually slower if there really is an exception-handling thrown

part,better,catch,block,end
when you call input.nextline as part of your exception-handling catching is it better to place it into every catch block or just inside a finally block at the end of the try-catch

unchecked,better,order,ugly,block,clause,method
so here the unchecked exception-handling is better to use in order not to copy and paste all that ugly try-catch block rethrowing an exception-handling and add the throws clause to the method

rsources,fine,old,better,block
try-catch rsources is fine for some cases but this is the old way and works better when you have more than 1 exception-handling in a block
