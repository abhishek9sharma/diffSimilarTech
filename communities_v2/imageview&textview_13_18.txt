0---------------------------------------------------

lower
make textview lower than imageview

higher
i try to align my imageview and my textview but the imageview is higher than my textview

1---------------------------------------------------

spacing,smaller,wrong
i also tried to do spacing from imageview to textview but then if the textview is smaller than the imageview the spacing will be wrong again

bigger,drive,parent
assuming the imageview is always bigger than the textview it ll drive the parent height

larger,dimensions
this should work as long as the imageview is larger than the textview in all dimensions

line,linearlayout,higher
i want to set imageview and textview on same line in linearlayout but the imageview is always higher than the textview

alignment,margin,greater
for api 18 and earlier the margin is being applied after the alignment so if the margin in the imageview is greater than 0 you will get your textview moved

bigger,top
i have an imageview that is bigger than a textview and i want to center the textview on top of the imageview both vertically and horizontally

constraints,spacing,xdp,higher
i tried constraints spacing each imageview with xdp it is ok if all textview are not higher than the imageview but if a textview is higher than a imageview it will overlap

fixed,size,rectangle,line,smaller,height,multiline,larger
in the image the square represents a fixed size imageview the rectangle is a textview which can 1 line smaller height than imageview or multiline height is larger than imageview

smaller,width
however the imageview has a smaller width than the textview

2---------------------------------------------------

taller,padding,margins,bottom,horizontal,centers
the imageview is bit taller than the textview and so what i do is add padding margins to the bottom of textview to get it align and look like the imageview and textview horizontal centers are aligned

bottom,top,subtitle,subtitletextview,taller
i have a button that is bottom constrained to the bottom of the imageview however should be top constrained to the bottom of the subtitle textview if subtitletextview is taller than imageview

other---------------------------------------------------

higher,aspect,ratio,width,possible,maximal,parent,height
in this case if textview is higher then imageview imageview aspect ratio should be intact with max width possible and if imageview i higher then textview again width should be maximal and parent should have height as imageview

problem,length
i want to have another textview underneath these two but i am having a problem when the textview length is less than the imageview

priority
how could i make the imageview have more priority than textview

text,longer,cardview,length
when the textview text is longer than cardview length it shows against the imageview and i don t want that

views,well.assign,bigger,3times,imagevies,space
add layout_weight properties to sub views as well.assign 3 to imaveview and 1 for textview now imageview always will be bigger than textview 3times and textview can not invade imagevies s space
