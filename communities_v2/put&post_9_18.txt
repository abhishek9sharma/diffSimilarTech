new,customer,restful,resource
side note if you are attempting to create a new customer you may want to use post instead as it may be considered more restful as put s are generally for updating an existing resource but this is up to you

better,restful,resource,use
post is better but if you want it to be truly restful you should ensure that the uri uniquely identifies the resource and use put

new,resource,blog,safer,article-uri,http
typically you would not allow a http client to determine the uri of a new resource so a post to blog would be safer than a put to blog article-uri although http does cater for appropriate responses should the server be unable to honour the intended uri

1---------------------------------------------------

appropriate
more importantly in this case i think post is more appropriate than put

appropriate,new
i think that in that case the put verb is more appropriate because post really means i want to create something new

2---------------------------------------------------

file,moreso,multipart,upload
put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement

file,api,request,simpler,multipart,data
to receive a file in your api i would use a put request simpler than post multipart and fetch the data from the stream php input

3---------------------------------------------------

docs,link,request,simpler,file,advantages,disadvanatges
on the php docs link above they say a put request is much simpler than a post request when uploading file along with this advantage what other advantages disadvanatges do the put has got compared to the post

side,note,form,file,docs,complex
side note it looks like you re using the post form of file upload which as the docs say is considerably more complex than put

other---------------------------------------------------

partial,updates,full,new
post is also more commonly used for partial updates as put generally implies sending a full new representation of the resource

http,secure,uploaded,files
http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server

http,backend,method,x-http-method-override,header,standard,rest
anyway http 405 is telling you that your backend does not support the put method and probably it s expecting a post method with the x-http-method-override put http header since post is more standard method in rest than put

noop,sense,second,connection
if noop a put may make more sense than a post which would imply creating a second connection

q1.i,better,name-value,pair,parameters,url
q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t

client,scores,highscore,code,simple
the client post scores and fetches highscore lists from the server and everything seemed to be working perfectly we had been testing it for a month with no problems and the code is really simple with not much more than a put get

processing,safe,secure
words like arbitrary processing and neither not safe make post sounds less secure than put when there is a choice

long,several,convenient,place
i m very sorry for the long question but i thought instead of dividing the question into several post it is more convenient if they are put into one place

insert
put does not mean update any more than post means insert
