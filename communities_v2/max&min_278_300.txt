adjacent,numbers
and then filter to limit only rows where adjacent numbers min is less between 4 and 7 and max is between 6 an 12

item,smaller
and i need to check for every item if min is always smaller than max

value,greater,attribute
if not we test whether the entered value is less than the min value if it is then we set the value to the min value and if not implying that the value must be greater than the max we set the value to the max attribute

urbg,largest,operator,greater
urbg max returns the largest urbg result_type that operator could return strictly greater than min

note,greater,equal
note this works as long as the min is less than the max and the max is greater than equal to nomin+ 2 noincrement

value,greater
otherwise once max has replaced min once a value can never be both greater than max and less than min

sliders,greater
do note that sliders won t render if max is not greater than min

dimension,box,coordinate,lesser
that is that for some dimension box s max coordinate is lesser than min coordinate

larger
since max is larger than min one of the two will always happen

greater,purpose,condition
you need min less than max or max greater than min both serves the same purpose in condition then it ll work fine

engine,rows,search,result,greater
the engine will find all rows where min is less than x then search within those result to find the rows where max is greater then y

parameter,least,c,haracters
im trying to write a method that returns the number of words from the words parameter that have at least the min but no more than the max c haracters

zone,greater
i want to assign it a zone if it is greater than the min but less than the max

salary,user
and how to make that the salary max is never less than the salary min that a user entered

l,omitting,lower,ditto,r
when l max 1 omitting l min means the lower bound is 0 or 1 ditto for r max r min

possible,xml-schema,attribute,greater
is it possible to use xml-schema to require the max attribute to be greater than the min attribute

lesser,current,greater
all we are doing here is comparing if min is lesser than the current and max is greater than the current

check,lower,higher
for each new number after the first check if it is lower than min or higher than max and in that case save that instead

u,field,error,moment
so if u change the field min as 0.8 the error shows up as min should be less than max till that moment the field will be shown as red border since it is wrong

bigger,gc,workers
max is much bigger than min maybe i can minus the gc workers

code,value
my code below however sometimes gives out a value more that my max and less than my min

equal,larger,smaller
let s check if the first which is equal or larger than min is smaller or equal than max so

number,value,greater
represents a number less than min value or greater than max value

user,value,negative,greater
ask the user for a max value also may be negative must be greater than min though

cloud,points,greater,x,direction
in a given point cloud i want to remove all the points which are less than min and greater than max for all x y and z direction

true,luckynumber
replacing this with an will only return true if the luckynumber is more than min and less than max

value,larger,pop-up
if the value of min is larger than max a pop-up will occur

greater,zero
if a and b are opposite sign they cannot overflow - the one greater than zero would need to be greater than max or the one less than zero would need to be less than min

bin,values,last,greater,multiple
the first bin is for values less than min and the last for greater than max and it is implemented efficiently due to multiple dispatch

bounds,inclusive,example
the bounds are inclusive ie 2 5 and min must be less than max in the above example

lower,increment,positive
min should be lower than max increment should be positive and max-min should be divisible by increment

syntax,positive,integer,number,matches,equal,greater,maximum
the syntax is where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

window,smaller,width,content,page,horizontal
if the window is smaller than max width the content fills 100 of the page unless it s smaller than min width which would make the horizontal scrollbar appear

value,greater,lower,limits
make sure any of the chart s value is not beyond greater than the max or lower than the min the limits you are setting

optimal,variable2,parameter,variable1,greater
if there s a chance that it will be optimal to set variable2 to something strictly less than min parameter variable1 strictly greater than max parameter variable1 then you will also in addition to the constraints above need to introduce a new binary variable that equals 1 if

value,cyclic,values,hue,bigger
because the hue value is cyclic i need to process min max values where the min hue might be bigger than the max hue value

dis,part,range,values,distribution,value,bigger,smaller
the dis min max part sets a range of min and max values this distribution can come up with which means it will never generate a value bigger than max or smaller than min

number,lower,higher,equal,variable
no variable will give a number that is lower than min or higher than max and there is always an equal number of variable such that for all n between min and max inclusively

number,occurences
since you are equally distributing the max number of occurences can t be more than the min + 1

lower
but i can t get this to work when the max is actually lower than the min

greater
your are printing min should be greater than max and you are checking the same

greater,lower,input,valid
if min is greater then max or max is lower than min then the input shouldn t be valid

element,larger,lower
than for each element if it s larger than max update max if it s lower than min update min

attributeerror,larger,range,parameter
but continuing i always got attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

textbox,greater,control,invalid
if i change the min textbox to be greater than max the control would be correctly marked as invalid

sure,equal
also make sure that min is always less than or equal to max

string,higher,lower
note that i do not need the number of characters in the string only if it higher than min and lower than max

inclusive,false
inclusive or false if max is less than min

higher,lower
it s higher than the min and lower than the max

greater
you might want to ensure that max is greater than min

value,int,larger
negating the min value of int would mathematically give us 2147483648 but since that is one larger than the max value

range,slider
it looks like the default calulation of the range slider is min + max - min 2 or min if max is less than min

value,first,second,last
so if min is zero it will have one more than max value first possition will be 0 second will be 1 etc last one will be max

empty,array
you may apply it to an empty array and it works as well if max is less than min

value,greater
e. not an input meaning end of execution check whether the value is greater than max or less than min

elements,greater
so min will work incorrectly if all elements greater than zero max - when all elements less than zero

value,greater
there are algorithms that will never predict a value greater than the max or less than the min

larger,category
if min is larger than zero then it belongs to complete category max is naturally larger than zero then

inputvalue,larger,smaller
is_valid will be true if inputvalue is larger than min or of it is smaller than max

value,smaller,predictions,larger,data
however i do not get a 2 2 matrix if i select any value that is smaller than min predictions or larger than max predictions since the data won t have either a false or true occurrence

number,smaller,text,box
if the max number is smaller than the min number the number in the max text box will be automatically changed to the same number as the min number in the min text box

time,stamp,status,timestamp,greater
i get the max time stamp for status 1 then i get the min timestamp for status 0 and if the min timestamp for status 0 is greater than max timestamp for status 1 then i include it in the result set

element,value,greater
then for each element update the min or max value if that element is less than or greater than the min or max value respectively

range,values,greather,equal
age can be in the range of 0..100 but i want also to validate crossing values i mean that max is greather than or equal to min

value,greater,test,true
you re comparing every value from min with every value from max until you hit a value of min that is greater than a value in max and 55 from min is greater than 22 from max so test will be set to true

i am simply preventing a user to select max value which is less than min value

check,position
while the user is dragging a node check if its position exceeds either max or is less than either min

parameter,equal
parameter such that min is less than or equal to max

nothing,smaller,larger
you are doing the opposite causing your loop to do nothing since z is never smaller than min or larger than max

languages,exception,value,complement,representation,integers,absolute,range,negative
it may look odd but it is common for number-to-string functions in many programming languages to make an exception for the min value in this way because with two s complement representation of integers the max value is 1 less than the absolute of the min value range of -2 147 483 648 to +2 147 483 647 which means the min value is the only negative value you can t flip to positive and then process using the same shared loop code as for the positive values.

clause,values,higher,range
the whenever clause is required in this case to prevent min values being higher than the max values and to ensure that the range size does not exceed the capacity of an int

number,edges,greater
what is the best algorithm to generate a random simple no parallel edges or self-loops undirected graph with a given number of nodes where each node has a number of edges that is no less than min and no greater than max

frequency,occurances,values,greater
main problem why i cant adopt those solution is that every of my random values has different range and i need the values to be uniformly distributed withing the range no frequency occurances at min max for example which happens if i cut off the values which are less greater than min max

last,rule,price,greater
in my code every condition is satisfying but the last rule means max price will be always greater than min price is not working

value,higher,lower
each value entered after would then get checked to see if higher than max or lower than min

the jquery way in which the clicking of the check button compares the two values and alerts if the max is less than the min

value,higher,lower,values,keys
if given value is higher than max or lower than min values then keys holding max and min are given respectively

the code will also record the edge cases so if the the function produces a value greater than the max or less than the min you.will.know.about.it

number,smaller
if min is not a number fail if max is not a number fail if min is smaller than max fail

value,greater,left,subtree,right
the idea is to work through the nodes in the tree from the leaves upward checking whether each node s value is greater than the max of its left subtree and less than the min of its right subtree then checking whether its left and right subtrees are bsts

type,bigger,value,inverse,inf
2 also i notice that the inverse of the maximum value of a double precision type is bigger than its min value and inverse of its min value is inf way bigger than its max value

first,iteration,heap,larger,part
in the first iteration the min heap holds the larger part and the max heap

bigger,random,character
if min is bigger than max i just return a random character from the entire range

false,value,greater
the function return false if the value is less than the min bound or greater than the max bound

non-silence,greater,ms,silence
during the playback of the file audio is monitored in the receive direction and if a period of non-silence which is greater than min ms yet less than max ms is followed by silence for at least sil ms which occurs during the first analysistime ms then the audio playback is aborted and processing jumps to the talk extension if available

chances,value,low
so once more the chances of generating a min value that is exactly 10 less than the max value are so low that the test will give up trying to find values that satisfy this condition

dropdownlist,age,higher
i have these two dropdownlist that are supposed to be for age and i want to make it so that you cant make min age higher than max age

node,smaller,nodes.
i am trying to understand what would happen if the max node is somehow smaller than some of the min nodes.

schedule_time,greater,value,column
another idea was after im done all the inserts then just delete the rows where the schedule_time is greater than the min value in the schedule_time column and the schedule_time is less than the max value in the schedule_time column

look,larger,smaller,arrays
you can do the whole job in a single for-loop reading from stdin look if it is larger than the max smaller than the min and so you do not need the arrays

constraints,bigger,lesser
but he has some constraints like min must be bigger than max and neither of them should be bigger than 100 or lesser than 0

points,greater
probably the line drawer was a bresenham modified to skip the points drawn unless they were greater than max or less than min

error,deepend,greater,code
this will only return error if the deepend is less than the min and greater than the max which could never really happen testing your code -

calenders,dates.i,dates,dateselect,event,date,greater,.my
i have two primeface calenders which are used to select from and to dates.i have set the max and min dates for the two calenders which are updated using the ajax dateselect event so that the max date of from is never after the min date of to and the min date of to is never greater than the max date of from .my code is something similar to this

values,greater,b
to find the average of values between a given a and b in a list we ll need to filter the list as you said eliminating values greater than max a b and less than min a b

pointer,lower,greater,heap,region,unlikely
a pointer lower than min or greater than max is probably not in the heap and this min and max delimited region is unlikely to intersect with any static area ever

the question i have is i would like the calendar to only display the min and max date range for the from date and to date any thing greater than the max and anything less than the min should be greyed out

urbg,smallest,result_type,operator
urbg min returns the smallest urbg result_type that operator could return strictly less than max

warning mt_rand max -1 is smaller than min 1 in

element,array
then when you are creating each element of the array also check whether it is less than the min or more than the max

provinces,larger,size,smaller
until all your provinces are larger than min size and smaller than max size

signal,previous,higher,next,lower
this would be simple to implement but the problem is that if i would just draw individual vertical lines there is the possibility to have gaps in the signal namely if the previous min is higher than the next max or the next max is lower than the previous min

user,zero,value,equal,range,values
i want to make sure that the user does not enter a zero for the max value and also that the min value is less than the max value not equal to but less than - i need the range of values max - min

sure,user,value,greater,smaller,code
my code should make sure the user doesn t select a min value greater than the max value or a max value smaller than the min value using this code

time,earlier,date,greater
the last bit is there because i needed to limit the time selected to no earlier than the min date and no greater than the max date so i had to check the date selected in the matching datepicker control

smaller,system,size,shmmin,greater,shmmax
looks like either the segment exists and it s smaller than what you asked for or you re trying to create a new one but it s smaller than the system min size shmmin or greater than max shmmax

smaller,nature,formula
notice how max is smaller than min due the nature of your formula

person,target,level,none,function,lower
for example if we consider the table # 2 we see that name 1 belongs to function a and the person s achieved target is below the min then the level attained is none where as for name 2 the attained level for the same function will be level 1 as he has exceeded the min but lower than max

value,current,values-,higher,lower,running
take each value and compare it to your current min and max values- if it is higher than the max or lower than the min replace that and then add the value to a running total for average purposes

list,dates,position
if i have a list of 5 dates the max position should be 4 more than the min position

absolute,value,integer,lower
afaik for integers the first bit is used as a sign that s probably why the absolute value of max integer is lower than the absolute value of min integer isn t it

condition,getnumber,true,greater
change that so your first condition will execute if either getnumber min is true and min is greater than 0 or both are true and min is less than max

value,number,empty

ps,split,size,lesser,mistake
ps i set max split size is lesser than min initially i set by mistake and i realized

equal
1 how would you validate that min is indeed equal or less than max

one option is whenever min is changed if it is greater than max change it to equal max like this

nothing,wrong
for a person who sees this there is also nothing wrong min is less than max

birth,greater,death
if max birth ends up greater than min death then there is no overlap

syntax,positive,integer,number,matches,equal,greater,maximum
the syntax is min max where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

id,faster
then i would add min id to see if its any faster than max id

number,greater
val - min max - min performs this scaling no number will be greater than max - min once min has been subtracted from it and never less than zero once min has been subtracted from it

values,smaller,typing,greater,validator
can achieve somehwat similar results typing values smaller than min will be corrected to min although you are still prevented from typing values greater than max due to the validator

age,greater,row
fail because the min age is greater than the max age in row 1

predictions,greater
the problem using a linear model like lm is that predictions can be greater than the max of the observed cases and less than the min of the observed cases

logic,getter,setter,value,greater,equal
if i just try to use the if compare logic directly within the min getter or setter when min is changed to a value greater than max i just end up with min equal to max

value,lower,higher
after this you can compare if the value is lower than the min or higher than the max

example,values,lower,limit,first,value,upper
as an example if for both values where min 0 is the lower limit for the first value max 0 is the upper limit for the first value etc. then the function should return the following

higher,error
setting min higher than the max or vice-versa will cause a 380 error

validation,rule,field,greater
i d like to set up a validation rule that enforces that the max field is greater than the min

input,value
the input value representing the max value can t be less than the min value

array,lower,side,higher
a variation on pentadecagon you are free to set n arbitrary values on the diagonal in some range min..max containing x and fill the rest of the array with lower than min on one side and higher than max on the other

number,smaller,bigger
you can check whether the new number is smaller than min or bigger than max and change them if needed

target,invocation,distance,greater
the trouble is when i enter an invalid value into the textbox the tooltip that appears says exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation instead of max distance must be greater than min distance

select,value,second,dropdownlist,first
now when i select max value in second dropdownlist less than min value in first dropdownlist the value of first dropdownlist should reset equal to second

greater,textbox,validation,state
if i now change max to be greater than min the min textbox validation state does not get cleared down presumably because min hasn t changed and therefore doesn t get validated again

integers,different,row
this function should check of a series of integers that there are four they are all different and that the min is 3 less than the max - thus that there are four in a row

group,smaller,greater,simple,checks
the checks for the first and last group smaller than min and greater than max is done with simple if checks which doesn t affect the complexity

full,constructor,value,greater
in addition i noticed that you also have a possible exceptional scenario for your full constructor when the min value is greater than the max value

lesser,guess,greater
min is always lesser than guess and max is always greater than guess

least,element,greater,param,script
i m a new bie in es and i want to use script filter to get all match that the array has at least one element less than max and greater than min max and min are param in the script

copy all events from table2 with created_at strictly greater than max created_at in table3 and strictly less than min created_at in table1 into table1

higher,equal,map.lower_bound,first,number,map.upper_bound
to find an interval find the lowest number higher than or equal to the min using map.lower_bound and find the first number higher than the max using map.upper_bound

then you have to check that beta1 - beta2 alpha1 - alpha2 is greater than min x1_line1 x2_line1 and less than max x1_line1 x2_line1

slider,end,value,step,greater
i m seeing is that if you use the slider and move it to either end min or max it appears to display a value which is the step value greater than min or less than max

new,wrongelementvalueexception,greater
throw new wrongelementvalueexception min must be greater than max

greater,message.
if min is greater than max should alert a message.

value,vector,second
also assume that the first value of the vector min is less than that of the vector max the second value as well and so on.

validation,value,larger,error
for example the validation i am looking for is when a min value is larger then a max value there needs to be an error but this error can be corrected from either textbox and the error for the textbox needs to be removed when this happens

range,values,greater,wrap,circle
ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

new,value,larger,slider
keep in mind that if your new min value is larger than either the current slider value or max value it will not render until the remaining two are updated accordingly

than min but shorter than max characters in a text file

3-,heap,elements
3- if min heap has more elements than max heap

value,lower,model
if max s value is lower than min s i don t want to update the model value

value,y-axis,series,chart
when i specify a min and max value for the y-axis if any value in the series is less than the min value it will extend below the chart usually extending into the chart below

string,greater
you can t convert the string min is greater than max

top,heap,k,term
if the top of the max heap has more than k terms pop off the top term and push it into the min heap

least,large,value,column,larger
that having been said your average is guaranteed to be at least as large as the min value in the column and no larger than the max value in the column

original,implementation,maximum,user,higher,vice
i m going to revert to my original implementation of resetting max to no maximum if the user selects a min higher than max and vice versa

number,greater
if the number is greater than max then update max with that number if the number is less than min then update min with

value,digits
but it can happen that the max value has more digits than the min value

value,greater,increment
if that value is greater than max or less than the min we need to reset that value and increment the next index by the step

syntax,positive,integer,number,matches,equal,greater,maximum
the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

value,greater
if the entered value is greater than max the value is set to max and if the value is less than min the value is set to min

jan,dec,value,greater,equal
you will want to set max jan 1 and min dec 31 and then if the value you are currently inspecting is greater than max you set max equal to the value and likewise for min

length,largest
the max length is one more than twice the largest min found above

number,least
note that this will pick any number that is at least min but less than max

caller,method,parameter,equal
you may assume the caller of the method will pass a min and a max parameter such that min is less than or equal to max

program,data,greater
this program takes in the max and min that the data can be and throws out data that is less than the min or greater than the max

mt_rand,function.mt-rand,smaller,users,www
warning mt_rand function.mt-rand max 0 is smaller than min 1 in users avsm www pa-include functions.php on line 332

false,obj,anobject,greater,true
returns false if obj min is less than zero or if anobject max is greater than zero true otherwise

values,bigger,value,td,smaller
your code take all the td s which their values are bigger than the min value and all the td s which their values are smaller than the max value this mean all the td s

value,bigger,smaller
for every insert check if the value is bigger than max or smaller than min if so set them to properly

b,equal,greater
we have to show that b min is always less than or equal to zero and b max is always greater or equal to zero

elements,odd,heap,element
if total number of elements are odd then max heap will have one more element than min heap

nothing,code,forces
eventually max will equal min but nothing in the code forces max to become less than min

larger,â
so while max decremented is larger than min â

maxbetamt,message,bet,amount,greater
but when i change my maxbetamt to 241.55 or 2400.25 this message comes out max bet amount must be greater than min bet amount

date,greater
and also make sure that your current date should be greater than min date and less than max date

query,larger
when i run the above query the min returned is larger than the max

interesting,documentation,larger,empty,null
it s interesting that this works since the documentation states that max must be larger than min but it looks like -1 is treated more like an empty or null value

mid,right,place
when we know that min is actually less than mid we try to put max at the right place in this way

higher,smaller,x-coordinates,polygon,y-coordiantes
by the way you don t need to consider trivial gridpoints outside of your polygon those with x-coordinates higher or smaller than the max min x-coordinates of your polygon and those with y-coordinates higher or smaller than the max min y-coordiantes of your polygon

entire,array,greater,lesser,variables
for finding max and min you can traverse the entire array while checking if the elements are greater or lesser than your max and min variables

index,first,element,greater,last,smaller,minheap
now when you have both max and min you can simply get the index of first element greater than min and last element smaller than max from your minheap

idea,number
the idea is that any number less than min or more than max is removed

value,larger,int32,lower,value...i
it s likely that tm2 is a value that is larger than the max int32 value or lower than the min int32 value...i would add a check something like.

number,loop,lower
get your i as min number and loop until it lower than the max number

tuple,next
please observe that the max of one tuple is less than the min of the next tuple

avg,higher
this seems a good use of geom_pointrange but it will make no sense for your example because your avg is higher than your max and on 6 7 your min is higher than your max

return,badrequest,value,cannot,greater
return badrequest min value cannot be greater than max value

lower,higher
and if it s lower than min set it to min and if it s higher than max set it to max

age,bigger
max age should be bigger than min age

data,greater
and throws out data that is less than the min or greater than the max

number,range,higher,lower
if you want to check that a number is between the min and max of the range you would likely want to check that it is both higher than the min and lower than the max

variable,wrong,smaller
your interval for variable i is probably wrong max is smaller than min

exception,value,lower
you get these exception if max value is lower then the min value

values,bins,value,greater
i ve also added a control check in case your values could be out of your bins can be less than the min value or greater than the max value

last,operation,greater,self,assignment
the last operation in the case where max is greater than min is called self assignment

attributeerror,larger,range,parameter.
however i m getting a attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter. error when i m trying to plot the normalized data

current,limits,measures,time,smaller,new
now you could iterate through the objects to find current limits 9min and max or you could even do it while you calculate the measures each time sth smaller than min happens store new min etc

landing,table1,created_at,table2
once events start landing in table1 again confirm that min created_at in table1 is less than max created_at in table2

interested,point,price,rows,greater
it would still work if p3 was joined to p only but the extra condition prunes out rows we re not interested in there s no point looking for the min price on rows for which the price is greater than the max

value,item,greater
write a for-loop that loops through your arrays taking the integer value of each item and if it s less than min save it to min and if it s greater than max save it to max

check,greater,next,entry
2 check to see if any max is greater than the next entry over s min

function,greater
but this function fails if min is greater than max

area,larger,tile,bytes,smaller
i would like to split the image into tiles so that each tiles area must be larger than a min tile area eg 1024 bytes and smaller than max tile area eg 2048 bytes

rating,higher
4- you then need to loop over max to check if any rating is higher than any min

1---------------------------------------------------

list.remove,first,program,loop,values,list,greater,variables,python
list.remove max is first run your program goes through the while loop again but min and max will keep the same values they had on the first pass through the loop and as nothing remaining in list is greater than max or less than min the variables won t be changed and so python will end up trying to run list.remove min

able,values,real,initial,loop,bigger,file,empty
thus after the loop exits you will be able to tell whether the values of min and max are real or just the initial values that haven t been changed another way to do that would be to test after the loop whether min is bigger than max - if it is then the file was empty

first,query,date,patient,days,greater,patients,statement
my other thought was a recursive cte with the first query pulling the min date for each patient then a union where the table date was at least 30 days greater than the max of each patients cte date but you can t have a max in the join statement

2---------------------------------------------------

minimum,repetitions
which means minimum of min repetitions but not more than max repetitions

template,minimum
- preceeding symbol template is expected to appear exactly minimum min times but not more than max times

other---------------------------------------------------

order,alphabetical,lesser,spring
i think that the actual order is alphabetical max is lesser than min starting from spring 3.0.4

mistake,.you,loop,value,array,.then
you re doing mistake here .you re checking max is less than min or not and above while loop you re setting min value to 0 and max to length of array .then how can max be less than min

definitions
both definitions agree that the min can t be less than max 2

test,output
. script.m file.csv 7 20 the test fails and i get the output min 7 must be less than max 20

v1,v2,review
now do i have to make a query so that tuples v1 v2 are selected where the max review of v2 is strictly less than the min review of v1


if min is less than is and is is less than max

sequential,order,year,record
the the next row of data is in sequential order max year of record 1 is less than the min year of record 2

interval,type
it returns an interval of type min max from min to less than max

red,border
when i go and change my max as 0.9 the red border should automatically disappear since technically now min is less than max

alert
but why when i tested this it s alert max less than min


if min is always less than max then you can also do

statement,version,logical
so by above statement min is more than max version it is not logical so i have changed this to below

invalid,arguments
i know the function does not handle invalid arguments if max is less than min

trials
the trials concur with each other if the max is less than twice the min â the trials concur with each other

comments,runif
as pointed out in comments in runif the min must be less than max

endtime,starttime
you have no overlaps when min endtime is less than max starttime

minute,message,60-90
max is more than 90 minute message med is 60-90 min etc

general
i believe this works for the general case provided min is less than max

arbitrary
max is more or less arbitrary i could have used min as well

set,range,mins,maxes,circular
i know that in general for a set of range if the max of the mins is less than the min of the maxes than they intersect but the circular nature of degrees makes this a bit more complicated

finite,syntaxerror,exception
if max is finite and less than min then throw a syntaxerror exception


if i is less than min and more than max
