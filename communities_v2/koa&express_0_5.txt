ctx.request.get,authorization,req.header,routes
i should also say that i have the token at ctx.request.get authorization koa based i think it s something like req.header authorization with express in all routes

kind,thing,low,level
koa doesn t provide this kind of thing out of the box - it s designed to be a little more low level than express

blog,request,better
see this blog when you have 10000 request koa performs better than express

faster,framework,restify
it shows that koa is faster then other framework but as this question is about express and restify express is faster than restify

middleware,simpler,hacky
koa middleware is much simpler and less hacky than express middleware due to the way middleware flows in a stack-like manner
