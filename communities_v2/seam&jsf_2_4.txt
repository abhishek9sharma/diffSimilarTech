powerful,richfaces,icefaces,html,components
seam is more powerful with jsf but not necessarily richfaces or icefaces for they mostly just extend the component set which is anyway fall down to standard html components when rendered by jsf

better,file,uploads
well for that you ll need jsf that is better integrated with seam and jsf does not handle file uploads that actually everyone use so you have to put also icefaces that actually are better managed by maven that you currenty are not using... neverending story

web,ui,framework,general,application,conversational,contexts
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3

better,plain,link,damo
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above
