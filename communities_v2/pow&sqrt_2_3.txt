fast,implementation,faster,x
my question is is fast implementation of pow x 0.5f faster than fast sqrt x

x,faster,accurate
first of all sqrt x should be faster and more accurate than pow x 0.5 why do you think it s in the library

tom,karzes,better,square,roots
and as tom karzes mentioned sqrt is also better than using pow for calculating square roots
