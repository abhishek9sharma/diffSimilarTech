fast,faster,read.csv,large
fread ... is extremely fast 10 - 100 times faster than read.table ... or read.csv ... for large datasets

faster,errors,data
fread performs faster and more efficiently than read.table but read.table produces less no errors on the same data set

read_csv,data.table,faster,base
for reading large csv files you should either use readr read_csv or data.table fread as both are much faster than base read.table

try,check,function,faster
you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the fread function which is much faster than read.table

version,read.csv,take,time,optimisation,longer
interestingly for 1 million rows per file the optimised version of read.csv and read.table take 422 and 430 more time than fread whilst without optimisation this leaps to around 1500 and 1005 longer
