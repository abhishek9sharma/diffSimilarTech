iteration,slower
it sounds like you need a treemap which has iteration which is not much slower than linkedhashmap and does what you really want

faster,insertion,wonâ,values,ejp
linkedhashmap is faster for insertion because it wonâ t have to unnecessarily compare values while inserting like treemap as stated by ejp

nothing,project
a treemap costs a lot more than a linkedhashmap and adds nothing to your project if you only need to keep original insertion order

faster,log,performance,get,javadocs,each.
however a linkedhashmap is faster as seen here treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each.
