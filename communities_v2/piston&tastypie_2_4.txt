similar,better,luck
- similar to piston but i ve had better luck with tastypie

orm,methods,resource
tastypie is more tightly coupled to the orm than piston but there are methods that you can define in a tastypie resource to specify how to handle create read update delete

query,better
edit i found out that piston was proposing query throttling but everywhere people say that tastypie is better than piston

look,nicer,things,api
i recommend to take a look on tastypie which turned out to work even nicer than piston it helps you also with things like versioning your api and mamange multiple endpoints nicly
