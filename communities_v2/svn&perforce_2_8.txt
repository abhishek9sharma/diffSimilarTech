advanced,capabilities
perforce offers more advanced branching and merging capabilities than svn

better,network,server,checkout
svn works much better when disconnected from the network - with perforce you have to tell the server when you ve done a checkout

easier,intuitive
if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce

ericgorr,right,nicer
if you have the money ericgorr is right perforce is much nicer to work with then svn

system,experience,better,free
make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with perforce and svn and while perforce is better svn is free

faster,check-outs,server
perforce is soooo much faster than svn because all the check-outs are stored on the server so it doesn t have to check every file on an update

support,oses,devs,comfortable
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too

scm,clearcase,maven,integration,community,examples,git
if you want to a little bit further you can imagine use more powerfull scm clearcase perforce ... but maven integration is fewer not well documented and community provide less examples than svn or git
