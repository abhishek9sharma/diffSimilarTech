framerates,slower
for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox

slower,google-chrome,faster
it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera

1---------------------------------------------------

problem,code,worse
the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera

issue,worse,care
only firefox and opera seem to have this issue opera even worse than firefox but i don t care that much about opera

other---------------------------------------------------

linux,gentoo,reneders,larger,fonts,nothing,odd
update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd

div,width,bigger,google-chrome
on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome

share,example,pie,distance,slice,connector
for example in the classic browser share example if the firefox is at 45 i want to be rendered inside the pie distance -40 may be and where the slice is less such as opera at 6 - i want it to be shown outside with a connector

little,bit,lower
in opera it goes little bit lower than in firefox

fewer,none
firefox has even fewer as far as i know and opera has none

don창,launch,창,time,2ms,faster,google-chrome,difference
but if firebug don창 t enabled after launch firefox 창 time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

access,internals,extensions,possible,widgets,google-chrome
firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions
