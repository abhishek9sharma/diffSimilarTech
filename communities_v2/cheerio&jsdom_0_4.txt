problem,switcht,faster,scanning,hundreds
i had the same problem with jsdom and switcht to cheerio which is much faster than jsdom and works even after scanning hundreds of sites

options,module,faster,heavy,weight
if it is unavoidable node.js has good options - try to use the module cheerio which is faster than heavy weight jsdom

html,elements,lightweight,jquery-like,api
if you don t need a full dom available and just want to parse and scrape manipulate html elements there is cheerio which is more lightweight than jsdom and still gives you a jquery-like api

request,easier,tasks
i find request + cheerio to be easier than jsdom for tasks like this
