set,projects,parsing,files,list
once the set of projects has been validated maven now does some more parsing of those pom.xml files to construct the list of build extensions if any and the list of plugins

deeper,normal
when maven is going deeper it falls back to normal pom.xml

clean,magnicompcommon,model,easier,root
you would be able to circumvent this by first running mvn clean install on magnicompcommon s pom.xml then on model pom.xml but this is much easier done by invoking maven directly on the root pom.xml

downsides-,ant,actual,difficult,flexibility,possible
it has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but it does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven

project,file,standard,directory
keep in mind that a maven project is more than just the pom.xml file it also conforms to the maven standard directory layout and more but that should get you started

classifier,construct,artefacts,content,jdk1.6
maven uses the classifier construct for artefacts build from the same pom.xml but differing in there content for example one for jdk1.6 or jdk1.7

work,official,wizard,full,configuration,eclipse
converting to maven requires more work -- afaik there is no official tool or wizard that allows you to generate a full pom.xml configuration from an existing eclipse project
