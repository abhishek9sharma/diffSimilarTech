api,better,usage,limits
the geocoding api works better than geocode normally but has usage limits and the implementation is bigger

problem,ggmap,batch,locations,error,geocodequerycheck,queries,errors
i had a similar problem using ggmap geocode for a batch of locations where roughly 20 of locations gave the over query limit error even though geocodequerycheck would show more than enough geocoding queries remaining and the errors were sporadically spread throughout the locations not just the last 20

gem,support,step
can the geocode gem support more than one geocoding step

location,reverse,reliable,requests,server,call
2 location + reverse geocoding - seems more reliable but requests location services on the device does it work on wifi only tablets and for it to be enabled and requires time to a fetch location b server call to reverse geocode
