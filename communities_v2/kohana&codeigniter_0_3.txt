little,bit,easier,programmers,better
i ve came to kohana from codeigniter which was a little bit bigger documentation and easier to understood but as far as i found out many programmers say that kohana are alot better than codeigniter

overall,flexible,great,base
overall kohana is more flexible than codeigniter and a great base to build a web application and api on

bloat,bloated,fork
but if codeigniter has a bit too much bloat for you maybe you can try kohana which is a bit less bloated than codeigniter started as a fork
