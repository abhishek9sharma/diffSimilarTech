faster
subtract is faster than multiplying

compiler,bitshift,faster
p is sometimes chosen to be 31 because not only is it prime but a compiler resolves it to a bitshift and a subtract which is much faster than a multiplying

first,field,value,greater
subtract first field from the other and if the value is not greater than 0 multiplying by -1

logarithms,factorials,end,reliable
adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly

n-5,time,constant,weaker
similarly if you skip the five first elements your loop takes o n-5 time but that too is the same as o n because adding or subtract a constant is even weaker than multiplying by a constant

logic,whole,number,bigger
the logic is multiplying by 2 whole number 0.1 2 0.2 and if it s bigger than 1 subtract and continue
