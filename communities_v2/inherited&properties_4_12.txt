multiple,easier,classes,functionality,state
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state

easier,classes,things
this should handle all cases of setting the properties makes them easier to implement in your inherited classes and cleans things up

other---------------------------------------------------

counter1,instanceof,verbose,real,private,count
counter1 can be used with instanceof and inherited but is more verbose and doesn t have real private properties eg count properties is exposed

is-a,relationship,model,methods
inherited is more of an is-a relationship for example a usermodel is-a model thus all properties and methods of a model will be part of a usermodel

values,instance,better,nesting,related,operations
less is a css extension that enables reuse and encapsulation of values color values for instance improves inherited allows a better nesting of related properties and operations also

dedicated,methods,clear
using dedicated methods for getting and setting properties is also more clear in inherited

model,better,composition,individual,related,base
potentially you are trying to model something in inherited that is better suited for composition or your base class should be taking in an object instead of individual related properties if the properties aren t related then perhaps your base class is doing too much single responsibility principle

desktop,controls,powerful,old,tag
now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway

paddle,object,player,enemy,composition,better
since the paddle object has properties that are shared by both player and enemy composition is a better choice than inherited

form,code,higher,tree,simpleformcontroller
i don t see any form properties in the code you posted so either the posted code has been modified or the properties is higher in the inherited tree simpleformcontroller

accessible,variable,base,class,classes
if you need a globally accessible variable or properties that s more suited to a base class that your classes inherited from

documentation
however i could not find it the documentation so it may inherited more than properties
