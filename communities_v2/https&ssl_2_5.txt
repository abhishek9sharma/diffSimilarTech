virtual,host,port,ip
there is a limitation on creating virtual hosts for name based virtual host while using ssl 443 port so if you want to have more than one https port enabled you will need ip based virtual hosting

flexible,application,level
https is more flexible than ssl an application can configure the level of security it needs

http,websites,resource,slower,encryption,handshakes
you could always use https that will work both on http and https websites but loading a https resource is slower than loading a http resource because of the encryption and ssl handshakes

load,balancer,proxy,certificate,ip
it could be a sni problem if you use any kind of load balancer https proxy or more than 1 ssl certificate on the same ip

security,issues,safer,switch,registry,http
as last resort resolution i don t suggest this for security issues using ssl is always safer switch your registry to use http instead of https
