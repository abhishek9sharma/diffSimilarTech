aware,suitable,uitextinput,bug,ios
i m aware that uitextview is much more suitable for this as it implements uitextinput protocol which has all the methods i need but due to a bug in ios i m limited to uilabel

padding,right,bigger
i think the problem happened because the padding left right of uitextview is bigger than uilabel

need,information,longer,slower
also consider using uilabel instead of uitextview if you don t need to edit information inside since uitextview take longer to allocate and init and are generally slower than uilabel

problem,complicated
my problem is uitextview is more complicated than uilabel
