easier,text,images
localization it s easier to translation text than images

engmaterial,english,possible,better,.net
is the best solution to add a new column called engmaterial and add the english translation there or is it possible to solve this in a better way with localization in .net


this is where i learned that localization is a lot more than translation

team,responsible,different,countries
i d have one project team responsible for localization which may well involve more than just translation - different countries have different legal requirements currencies payment providers etc. and one team for improving the code base
