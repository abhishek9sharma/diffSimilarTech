edge,convention
personally i d say yii might have the edge as it encourages convention more than codeigniter would

complex,documentation,informative
i am currently looking at yii and while its more complex than codeigniter the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s

structured,basic,mins
2 yii a bit more structured than codeigniter but you have a basic app up within 10 mins and if your familiar with mvc design its a great way to develop portals incredibly quickly

higher,learning,curve,cakephp
yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

latest,better,benchmarks
so latest codeigniter 2.0 is better than yii according to this benchmarks

benchmark,faster
i have found one benchmark in which yii is faster than codeigniter and another benchmark in which codeigniter is faster than yii
