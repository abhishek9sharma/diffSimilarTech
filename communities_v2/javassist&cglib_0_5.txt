similar,answers,asm,better,bcel,old
here in so i found a lot of questions asking something similar and the answers normally said you can use cglib or asm or javassist is better than cglib or bcel is old and is dying or asm is the best because it gives x and y

javadoc,better
the javadoc of javassist is way better than that of cglib

proxetta,slower,methods,reflection
this makes for example javassist or proxetta significantly slower than cglib which simply reads the methods via the reflection api and overrides them

slower
also javassist is recognized to be slower than cglib

note,slower,class,files
note that javassist is significantly slower then for example cglib because it reads in class files directly instead of using reflective access in order to avoid class loading
