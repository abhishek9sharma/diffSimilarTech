higher,target,sdk,previous
i am wondering what happens when i release a upgrade that has a higher target sdk versioning then the previous versioning of my app

msi,c,higher,product,b
also what happens when common msi c s versioning is higher in product b and b upgrade c on install

1---------------------------------------------------

trunk,better,last
you can safely upgrade to trunk its better than last versioning anyway

older
if the versioning is older than 0.10 please upgrade

dimension,piwik,older
also i can not use custom dimension because my piwik versioning is older and i can not upgrade it now

older,better,benefits,c++11
if you re using older versioning it is better to upgrade and avail benefits of c++11 features as much as possible

gradle,plugin,newer,older
also don t forget to upgrade the gradle plugin to 1.5.0 or newer as older versioning are not supported

installshield,files,equal,greater
i am using installshield 2011 and what i want to do is on an upgrade to install all the files that are equal or greater than then versioning that is already installed

older,work
if your versioning is older than that it won t work and you ll need to upgrade

older,run,install,notebook
if your versioning is older than 5.0.0 run pip install --upgrade notebook to upgrade

newer,packages
upgrade actually installs newer versioning of the packages you have

rollback,minor,major,older,files
windows installer rollback will work as you request if you use 1 a minor upgrade or 2 a properly sequenced major upgrade that uninstalls the older versioning after successfully updating all files

requests,older,requests-oauthlib
warning you are using requests versioning which is older than requests-oauthlib expects please upgrade to 2.0.0 or later

greater,first,condition
so just change your versioning to something else which must be greater than the upgrade versioning so that again first condition will be false and system will not check further and will connect without using tls

rule,older,custom,dialog
this way the upgrade rule detects older versioning and shows a custom dialog if it does

server,older,postgres,jsonb
if your server versioning is older it is highly recommended to upgrade postgres anyway to use jsonb efficiently

apt-get,newer
apt-get upgrade actually installs the newer versioning

plone,site,simple,older
to upgrade your plone site from 4.3 to 5.0 you can check this link section upgrading plone 4.x to 5.0 the migration should be more simple than older versioning like 3.x or 2.x

apps,better,idea,wp8,features
if you think that writing two apps for both versioning is a better idea then should i write app on wp8 first and at the end remove special wp8 features to downgrade it for wp7.5 or maybe i should write wp7.5 app and then add some wp8 features to upgrade it to wp8

setup,older,bootstrapper
but during upgrade setup launches the older versioning setup bootstrapper ui

older,vagrant,greater
you used a older versioning of vagrant before 1.5 versioning and made an upgrade to vagrant greater than 1.5 versioning

ruby,older
if your ruby versioning is older than 2.2.4 then please upgrade it

2---------------------------------------------------

php,lower,problem
and my php versioning is lower than 5.3.0 i upgrade that fixed my problem

problem,worse
the problem was the same on both versioning though perhaps a bit worse after the upgrade

xcode,lower,ios,internet
for the case xcode versioning is lower than ios device s image you can either copy the disk image from other already updated xcode or maybe the internet or upgrade your xcode

product3,lower
if product3 is installed and installed versioning is lower then upgrade

setup,time,lower,higher
if i enable this then any setup is ran every time it will be asking for upgrade either it is on lower versioning over higher versioning or higher versioning over lower versioning

higher,steps
if you are running that versioning or higher or after you upgrade follow these steps

3---------------------------------------------------

sequence,simpler,link,latest,apk,donwload
the upgrade sequence is much simpler i have a hard link in the app that points to the latest versioning of the apk the donwload starts and automatically laucnhes the install

painful,better,time,code,latest,older,effort
as painful as it s going to be for both of us to perform the upgrade it s probably better to commit the time now and get the code up to the latest versioning than to try to find an older versioning that reduces the effort

other---------------------------------------------------

consequences,alternate,better,approach,immune,os
upgrading a language or service can often have disastrous or unexpected consequences thus sandboxing alternate versioning seems the better approach plus it makes projects immune from os upgrade

apps,number,bigger,last,installer
if the apps versioning number is bigger it s an upgrade and you now need to save that as the last installer versioning

blackberry,device,higher,os,user,dialog,application
if blackberry device software versioning is higher than os 6 then continue the app otherwise prompt user dialog showing upgrade os first and exit the application

default,psycopg2,libssl,dependency,old,longer
by default psycopg2 uses its own versioning of libssl and it seemed to keep a dependency on an old versioning of the library which no longer existed after my upgrade

latest,one
you do want to upgrade no further than versioning 2.1.6 at the moment as it s the latest one that supports rails 2.3.x

code,users,statement
you want to make sure the code will work when users upgrade more than 1 versioning and that the update statement only runs the one upgrade it is needed

production,mysql,earlier,v5.7.7,criteria,decision
however if you have a current production mysql versioning that is earlier than v5.7.7 then the removal of this restriction on views should only be one of the criteria being assessed while making a decision as to upgrade or not

target,jvm,earlier,latest,â,users,rights
if the code is to be distributed consider compiling that java class with a target jvm versioning that is somewhat earlier than the latest â otherwise some users will be forced to upgrade their jvm to run your software and some of those won t have admin rights to do that.

pear,-v,newer,current,noe,ran,-f,files,installs,install,phpunit
running pear -v gives me versioning 1.7.2 when i run pear upgrade pear it says my versioning is newer than the current noe which is 1.9.0 if ran pear upgrade -f pear to force an upgrade it downloads the files and installs successfully but i still have versioning 1.7.2 and cannot install phpunit

code,require,system,large,cluster,entire
code upgrade require system downtime and if you have a large cluster that cannot run more than one versioning of code at once you ll need to take the entire cluster down at once

least,php,newer,functions,error,message,typo3,extension,ph_nextgenmenu
at least if the php versioning is newer and not including the deprecated functions like the extension in the error message i recommend to upgrade to a newer typo3 versioning and find a way to replace the extension ph_nextgenmenu with a newer one or edit it manually to use the typo3 sql api or the newer php functions directly

current,phpunit,concern,first,issues,php
if the code doesn t run on php 5.2+ then you can t use a current phpunit versioning which is definitely more of a concern and my first general recommendation is to find any issues an php 5 upgrade might bring


if you have six versioning less than 1.10 upgrade it

time,dll,higher,config,files,db,procedure
this will restart the site and when it runs for the first time after that it will see that the dll versioning is higher than the one in the config files and the db and will kick off the upgrade procedure

php
and looks like your php versioning is less then 5.5 so upgrade your php versioning 5.5 and it will work

6-month,old,known,bug,acceptable,answer
and if somebody is running a 6-month old versioning with a known bug upgrade becomes a more acceptable answer if they are 12 versioning behind

beatbox,able,forecastingitem,object,apt-get,error
i heard that i should upgrade beatbox to something more than the versioning 21 to be able to access the forecastingitem object so i tried apt-get update upgrade beatbox but i still get the error

blogs,glassfish,older,jackson,method,jakcson
by looking at various blogs i understand glassfish versioning 4.1 has older jackson library 2.4 which does not have this method and need to upgrade jakcson versioning 2.8

windows,application,newer,browser
these locations will convert when they go to windows 7 perhaps or because the application they use internally is upgrade and needs the newer browser versioning

queryover,intuitive,magic,strings,nh
nevertheless i would recommend sticking to the queryover versioning it s much more intuitive and you avoid magic strings especially that you don t have to upgrade the nh versioning

package,server,part,newer
however if that upgrade includes myself say i have a package named server and part of the upgrade includes a newer versioning of server then the upgrade fails

dbi,likely,source,trouble,good,current
the dbi versioning is less likely to be the source of the trouble but it would still be good to upgrade to the most current versioning

bigger,jumps,site
btw - i went back and did the upgrade again with bigger jumps between versioning actually ran the site after each upgrade and it went perfectly

itext,5.5.x,guess,task,easier,newer
itext versioning is 5.5.x but i guess we can upgrade it if the task would be easier with newer versioning

method,solution,gap,time,years,jump,backend,databases,oracle,r1.
no problem mnt i mentioned possible compatibility between the method tried in 4.25 my solution and 4.00 your versioning but keep in mind the gap in time between these versioning is probably more than two years of upgrade and also a jump between backend databases versioning oracle 10g to oracle 11g r1.

content,authors,slower,previous
since the upgrade the content authors are complaining that the experience editor performance is much slower than previous versioning

kernel
if kernel versioning is less than 2.6 then we recommend to upgrade it

central,point,number,easier,smoothe,safe
using compatibility as the central point in the versioning number makes it easier for users especially if te product is a library to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not

anyone,v8,easier,certain,previous,earlier
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning

make,sure,better,recommended,method
you are using a method to bind click event in your case is live and this has been removed in the latest jquery libraries from 1.9+ onwards so make sure your versioning is less than 1.9 or better to upgrade the library and use the recommended method for it .on to delegate the event event delegation syntax is little different with .on

column,b,branch,number,greater,trunk,script,work
for example if you start with a table and trunk adds column a and the branch adds column b then you merge trunk to branch - you cannot realistically upgrade to the versioning with both unless the branch versioning number is always greater than the trunk s upgrade script and that doesn t work if you subsequently merge trunk to the branch
