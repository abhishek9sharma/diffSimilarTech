size,lower,kb
my question is can we set max stack size lower than the minimum stack size which may be 4 kb for the goroutines

equal,greater,value
all numbers will always be equal to or greater than the minimum value or equal to or less than the max value

group,value,lower,index
for group 1 the minimum value is actually 2 however i need minimum indexed lower than max value index position

data,lower,x,higher
in this example i would want to flag the following records in my data 2 lower than the minimum for x and 4 higher than the max for y

value,larger
how can the max value be larger than the minimum

value,higher,year,data
from here you also need to take into account if the user inputs a value higher than the max year of the data and also less than the minimum

other---------------------------------------------------

query,min,security,id,difference,value
first i run a query to find the min and max for each security id then find the difference between the min and max and finally find a value that is 10 more than the minimum like this

requirement,smaller
the minimum requirement and smaller than the max requirement

little,datas,new
if i is rather little just iterate and keep i minimum datas insert every new data in a binary tree of the i most little datas if it is less than the max of these datas

min-cut,true,flow,network,greater,capacity,s-t
if it were possible to find such a cut then max-flow min-cut would not be true the max flow of the network would be greater than the minimum capacity of an s-t cut

number,array,option
now you are iterating exactly like your example with one change to know what is the next set you are moving to you have to replace every number in the current set with the next number in the array and replace the max option that less than the minimum you are saving

time,first,2-4x,longer
why is the max time which happens on the first iteration of the loop 2-4x longer than the minimum time

value,greater,update,left
4.if minimum value is greater than the current value in array than add difference of than in ans add the difference with current value update max from left

textboxes,user,price
i m simply checking the values of two input textboxes and alerting the user if the max price is less than the minimum price but they re evaluating backwards
