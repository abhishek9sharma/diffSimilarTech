buffer,number,representation,digits
this means the buffer is enough for printing the number in octal and since decimal representation uses no more digits than octal it will be enough for decimal representation too

easier,hexadecimal,convenient
bitshifts just go easier with hexadecimal than decimal and is often more convenient to read than octal

hex,machine,clearer,similar,opcodes
hex or maybe octal depending on the machine being emulated will be clearer than using decimal since similar opcodes tend to vary in bits not digits
