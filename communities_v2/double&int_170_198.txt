0---------------------------------------------------

different,data,type,slower
double is a different data type and generally much slower than int

byte,memory,better,performance,datatypes
byte takes less memory than double and int and provides better performance than bigger datatypes especially better than double

portions,logarithms,different,values.,type,narrower,calculated
the int portions of the logarithms of 31 and 310 use different numbers of bits so there are different numbers of bits left for the significand so they end up being rounded to slightly different values. as long as the int type is substantially narrower than the double type the calculated limit will be much larger than the error in log10

math.round,method,long,larger,type
the math.round double a method returns a long which is a larger type than int

data,type,smaller,precision,function,pow,returns,value,binarychar,on.
the problem is that the precision of the data type int is smaller as the precision of double the function pow returns double therefore the value of binarychar i will be implizit converted to double and so on.

type,unsigned,precision
indeed fact is limited by the range of type unsigned int which is much less than the precision of type long double

general,type
double can in a way be seen as a more general type than int

important,precsion,52-bits,precision,low
this is important because if the int needs more precsion than 52-bits the precision is too low for a double

value,array,position
if a value in the double array is less than the int value at the same position of the two dimensional array then in that part of the boolean array the value would is true

wrinkle,bits,printing,code
there is also the wrinkle that typically a double consists of more bits than an int does - so by printing in this way your code is interpreting random memory to the right of x as data

understanding,error,higher,precedence,cant,value
i have a decent understanding on why there is an error because of how double has a higher precedence than int and how an int cant necessarily store a double value

operations,float,cost
operations on float and especially double cost more than on int

better,precision
double is better than int though as it will help you keep precision

higher
because a double is higher it will merge the int into the 0.0

point,literal,data,type,lower,ranges
if we use float data type in java we have to add f at the end of floating point literal as java assumes it to be double data type and gives an error why not do the same for short and byte as both have lower ranges than int

platforms,range,wider,representable,whole
it is not exact on rare platforms where the range of int is wider than the range of a double s exactly representable whole numbers

promotion,compiler,types,narrower,necessary,function,ditto
but there was this legacy thing dating all the way back to k r c called default argument promotion that essentially says the compiler will implicitly convert all int types narrower than int to int if necessary to match a function signature and all floating point types narrower than double to double ditto

upccode,larger,long,data,type,float
your upccode int is larger than the long data type so i tried it with double which is a float but works

literal,cast,decimal,part
the double literal 99.9999999999999 can be represented as a double which is less than 100 so the cast to int truncates the decimal part and 99 is the result

larger,bytes,original,extra
because a double is larger than an int this accesses the 4 bytes of the original int and an extra 4 bytes on the stack

type,const,lower,rank
num is a of type const int which is of lower rank when compared to the type of z which is double

third,precision,loss,smaller
in the third case double precision loss is much smaller than the int and you get something like

value,c
or a value for int a that is 6 less than double c

infinity,comparison,larger,long,max
if you are not storing infinity nowhere and use it just for comparison you can use double infinity which is larger than int and long max value

precision
double can hold more precision than int

values,printf,numeric,types,shorter
note that when float values are passed to printf they are automatically converted to double just as numeric types shorter than int are promoted to int

range,greater
another reason is that the range of double is far greater than that of int

64-bit,ieee,larger,magnitude,problem
typically a double is 64-bit ieee floating point with roughly 52 bits precision and with range much larger than 64-bit int so magnitude is no problem

result,greater
you really might need to up cast everything into a double and then check to see if the result is greater than or less than an int

number,bigger,maximum,value,curious
i know that there s another way to check if a double number is bigger than maximum int value but i m curious as why it s happening this way

point,arithmetic,precision,complex,modern
as for the last question floating point arithmetic particularly double precision is much more complex than int arithmetic so on a reasonably modern pipelined processor each instruction will take longer to execute

range,64-bit,precision,dues,representation,actual
double has range more than a 64-bit int but its precision is less dues to its representation since double is 64-bit as well it can t fit more actual values

smaller,range
int can hold a smaller range than double

larger,platform
because a double which f expects probably is larger than an int on your platform

float,varargs,smaller
and since float is typically promoted to double with varargs calls if your int is smaller than your double this will break

value,sure,bigger,smaller
you could try to add some value to the double to make sure it s bigger or smaller than an int can be

nummines,calculation,statement,loop
your nummines calculation will always return 0 because when you cast a double that is less than 1 to an int it will be set to 0 which means that the statement in your while loop will only be run a single time hence only a single mine being placed

calculation,result,greater,precision,decimal
and the second calculation 33 5.0 the result is actually promoted to double which has greater precision than int and resulted to decimal

space
int would take up less space than a double

list,first,greater
what i need to do it iterate over a list find the first int which is greater than 3 and is even then just double it and return it

type,result,larger,data-type
you do explicit type casting to get your result in int because double is a larger data-type than int

integer.parseint,string,variables,higher,precision,type,conversion
you can assign the int s returned from integer.parseint string s to your double variables because double s are higher precision than int s and so type conversion happens automatically without the need for an explicit cast

int32,smaller,range
int or int32 has a much smaller range than double

smallest,value,greater
you should be using math.ceiling which will return the smallest int value that is greater than the double passed in

wider,range,return,values
also given that double has a wider range what would one return for those out of range int values

code,value,space,type,res,long,higher,values
to prevent the code from overflowing the int value space you should could change the type of res to double long anything that can hold higher values than int

format,specifier,larger,value,bytes,next,parameter
the undefined behaviour as identified in other answers is explained on my intel platform with vc as that the f format specifier expects a double on the stack which is larger than an int so when it retrieves the value it retrieves more bytes than of an int and now assumes the next parameter at a diferent position on the stack causing z to be printed wrong it is not z that is printed

solution,big,bigger,small,fractions
edit actually my solution does not work because double can be very big much bigger than int and also very small like fractions

range,greater,bit,std,floor
the range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit int which is why std floor returns a double

behaviour,specific,comparison,boolean
this behaviour is due to the fact that int is more specific than double while there is no such comparison between int and boolean

precise,precision
you used the double to calculate an int result the double is more precise than the int so you lost precision

code,i.e,number,real,positive,point
i should point out previously in the code the double is less than 1 i.e 0.987 and is then multiplied by the number of decimal places to make it a real positive int though it s stored as a double still at that point

bigger
this will work as long as the double is not bigger than what can fit in an int

processors,compilers,types,larger,type,name
many processors and or compilers implement long double types larger than any int type regardless of name and there are processors with 32 byte pointers

today,greater,maximum,possible
today i noticed that when i cast a double that is greater than the maximum possible int to an int i get -2147483648

hard,error,better,match,overload
is simply a hard error because f int is a better match than f double even though the f int overload causes a hard error further on

operands,result,multiplication,larger,range
if one of the operands is a double the result of the multiplication would be a double which allows for a much larger range than an int

memory,largest,possible
typically an int will use less memory than a double that is why one doesn t just use the largest possible datatype

outofmemory,memory,space,ints-an,representation
you re getting the outofmemory because if you declare int 1000 the memory is allocated immediately additionally double take up more space than ints-an int representation will also save you space

part,value,larger,smaller,values
another option would be to add a cast not recommended due to the same loss of information the error warns you about - the fractional part will simply be removed from the value and double can hold way larger and smaller values than int

compiler,constructor,better,fit
so your compiler picks the double constructor as a better fit than the int one

non-decimal,number,decimal-number,precision,bytes,float,smaller,logic
since an int is representing by a non-decimal number 1 and a double is represented by a decimal-number with precision 32 bytes more than that of a float 1.0 we can say that int s are less than or smaller than double s and by that logic int s can be promoted to double s and double s can be demoted to int s

normal,test,function,bigger,platforms,reading
a normal 3 will be treated as int but in the test function you are retrieving double which are bigger than an int on most platforms and you might end up reading wrong locations which inturn leads to exc_bad_access run time signal being generated

mantissa,bits,significant,comparisions,precise,regard
since double has more mantissa bits than int can have significant bits comparisions between double and int are precise in that regard

second,overload,better,match
with gcc 4.9 it prints error because the second overload isn t discarded and int is a better match than double

better,join_angle,radians
except that double is much better than int for storing the join_angle in radians

number,bigger,maximum,nil
so if i try to convert a double number bigger than maximum int it crashes instead of returning nil

value,higher,range,undefined,behavior
and if the value of your double is higher than the range of an int then this can produce undefined behavior

need,lf,format,strings,float,smaller
this is the reason for which if you use printf to print floats you don t need to say lf int the format strings and f is enough lf is needed for scanf however because that function stores a result and a float can be smaller than a double

historical,argument,smaller,rank,type,variadic,function
for historical reasons you can not pass an int argument of smaller rank than int or a floating type of smaller rank than double to a variadic function

top,bigger,extra,bytes
if you tell it the top of the stack has a double and double is bigger than int you ve now just told it to take extra bytes off of the stack which is terrible

bits,atom,actual,bit,precision,float
as soon as the int needs more than 29 bits the atom is changed by the vm into a number type which is really represented as a 29 bit pointer to the actual 64 bit double precision float

range,smaller
don t forget that the range of int is much smaller than the range of double

bigger
double is much bigger than int

greater,long
since double is greater that int and long int and long will be turned into double in double long and int double

larger,internal,structure
a double is 1 typically larger than an int and 2 has some internal structure

modulus,use,efficient,arithmetic
if you want the modulus use as it gives an int and would be more efficient than double arithmetic

conversion,float,better,promotions
the conversion from float to long double is no better than the conversion from float to int since they are both not promotions

memory,numbers
int needs less memory comparing to double numbers

bigger,long,part
you could try using double which is bigger than a long and use only the int part

greater,value,range
double has a greater value range than int

result,math.pow,larger,integer.max_value
when the result of math.pow i j a double is larger than integer.max_value and you cast to an int then the result is integer.max_value

work,platforms,bits,64-bit
that wouldn t work on platforms where a double is less than 64 bits but it would work on many platforms without 64-bit int

form,largest,equal
it implicitly converts an int to a double gets the double form of largest int that is less or equal to that double and converts that back to an int

minimum,possible
similarly when i cast a double that is less than the minimum possible int i also get -2147483648

largest,value,larger,long
the largest double value is also larger than the largest int so it would have to be a long

result,pow,arithmetic,exponentiation,value,smaller
this imply that result of pow x y converted to int will be truncated because of double arithmetic and exponentiation that will return double value slightly smaller than int

conversion,byte,specific,implicit,primitive,conversions
an implicit conversion from byte to int is indeed more specific than an implicit conversion from byte to double according to widening primitive conversions rules

range,wider
the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long

sizeof,smaller,horror
since sizeof int is very probably smaller than sizeof double this is going to lead to horror

number,bits,type,larger,precision
you need to use 2 even if the number of bits in your int type is larger than the precision of a double since the number of used bits in the most significant value might only be 1

bigger,mantissa,bits,real
the double has a bigger mantissa the int bits of the real number

note,result,better,years,precision,extract
note how i cast the result to int which is better suited for years than the double precision returned by extract

solution,calculations,quicker,float
a solution using int only calculations should be quicker than float double calculations is

void,mymethod,specific,invocation,first
we could check that void mymethod int i is more specific than void mymethod double a if any invocation handled by the first method can be passed on to the other one without a compile-time type error

diff,ave_diff,constants,faster,contants,version
the versions using diff are especially impacted ave_diff with int constants is about 2.5 times faster than the double contants version

infinite,precision,bigdecimal
double doesn t have infinite precision and you can t gain more precision than a double has by converting a double to a bigdecimal like you can t gain more precision with an int when you do which is 0.0 because it widens an int to a double

object,care,value,bigger
you can convert your object into double and then into int but you should take care as double value is much bigger than int

higher,magnitude
not really considering that a double can be a much higher magnitude than an int

conversion,legal,wider
this conversion is legal because double are wider than int

method,signature,b,adder,interface,wider
so in your smartadder interface the method with signature add double a double b does not override the method add int a int b of your adder interface because double is wider than int

representation,type,larger,system,8-byte,4-byte,common
furthermore the representation of type double is probably larger than that of type int in your system 8-byte double s and 4-byte int s are common

separable,convolution,better,performance,counterpart
i m writing a c# class to perform 2d separable convolution using int to obtain better performance than double counterpart

precise,method
since int is less precise than double i thought i needed to cast it when parsing it into a method

overloadedsingleparam,specific,void,value,argument
so overloadedsingleparam double a is less specific than void overloadedsingleparam int a when an int value is passed as argument

smaller,size,padding
4 + 4 since int is smaller size compared to double padding of double size is done

widths,positive,wider,significand,bits
the widths are positive int not wider than the double significand 53 bits

aware,spacing,values,exact
as far as i m aware so long as the spacing between two double is less than 2 then int values stored as double should be exact - and though 10 14 is pushing it this should be an exact int since 10 14 2 46.507 2 53

data,space,float
1 if your data are int or some data form that takes less space than a double float

problem,aware,inexact
about the inexactness problem you should be aware that double can be more inexact than int

range,wider
the range of double is wider than int

upcast,loss,pow,function,efficient
because all int s can be upcast to a double without loss and the pow function on a double is no less efficient that that on an int

advance,big,point,numbers,bits,precision,number
you can work around this issue if you ll advance to big int floating point numbers that store more bits than a double precision number

space,ram
int takes less space than double on ram

mistake,part,specific
this is java detecting what you are doing and thinking it may be a mistake on your part - int s are less specific than double s

64-bit,long,greater,ieee,52-bit,mantissa,precision
if a 64-bit long is written as an int and is greater than 2 53 ieee double has a 52-bit mantissa then reading it as a double will lose precision

multithread,performance,version,better,precision
well in multithread the performance of the int version is 2.6 times better than the double precision

platforms,larger,false
for platforms where int is larger than double it s obviously false

casting,long,simpler
in general casting from long to int is simpler than from double to int

parameter,printf,size,memory,area,greater
this causes a referencing to a memory area that was not completely initialized with value passed as parameter to the printf because double size memory buffer area is greater than int size

bigger
a double is also probably bigger than an int

types,smaller,floating,point
extra arguments to variatic functions with types smaller than int are promoted to int and passed as such and floating point types smaller than double are promoted to double and passed as such

void,doitagain,specific,subtype,jls
by contrast void doitagain int is more specific than void doitagain double because int is a subtype of double according the the jls

range,greater,type
a double has a range that can be greater than any int type

larger,overflow
double is larger than an int hence the overflow

processor,range,better,issues
it would really depend on the processor and the range of the int which is better and using double would resolve most of the range issues

comparison,64-bit,types,instructions,equivalent
on a 32-bit machine doing addition and comparison on 64-bit int types takes more instructions than doing the equivalent on double s

first,argument,specific
i thought when i pass 1 as the argument java would have picked the first argument because int is more specific than double

functions,printf,smaller
in vararg functions such as printf int smaller than int are promoted to int and floats smaller than double are promoted to double

second,member,short,smaller,sizeof,struct
it doesn t matter if second member would be int short or whatever - as long as it is smaller than double sizeof struct will be 16

long,bigger,multiple
one of long long and double is bigger than 3 int and a multiple of 8

precision,problems
further the precision of double may be less than int introducing other problems

better,results,former,uses
if you use int between -128 and 127 you will get much better results than double from -128 to 127 because the former uses caches values the later does not

higher,value,simple,math
if your resulting double has higher int value then simple int math sometimes stops working

better,match,long
why does f double is a better match than f long int 0 for f long

space
i don t understand how an int 63823 takes up less space than a double 1.0

argument,conversions,type,rank,lower,floating-point,pascal,cuoq
so no arguments after the 1st one get automatically converted except as defined by default argument conversions basically any int type with a rank lower than int to int and any floating-point type with a rank lower than double to double thank you pascal cuoq

systems,smaller,likely,cause
on many systems int is smaller than double so if that s the case on yours this is very likely to be the cause of your crash

larger,numbers
because double can contain larger numbers than int or long

false,range,wider,uncommon,dx
can be false when int range is wider than double uncommon and dx is a rounded value whose next higher representable value to 2 greater

behavior,likely,bigger,overruns,memory
with the cast that bad stuff is undefined behavior most likely double is bigger than int and it overruns the memory for i

precise,type,general,manner
a double is a more precise type than an int in a general manner of speaking

checking,64bit,precision,bits,part
however if you have large enough number the limit checking does not work because 64bit double precision has less bits usually 54 but this is not defined in standard for the fractions part than a 64bit int

float,smaller
that means a float will be a double and anything smaller than an int will be an int

range,smaller,pow
1 int range is much smaller than double and for pow 2 100 that fails

imho,better,task
imho int looks better than double in your task

equal,sizeof,greater,end,d_buffer
alternatively if fieldsize is equal to sizeof double and sizeof double is greater than sizeof int then you are writing off the end of d_buffer and then something is corrupting your data

value,bigger,maximum,function
i wanted to check if a double value is bigger than maximum int value but because converting function does not return an optional value i am not be able to check by using optional binding

function,positive,type,narrower,32-bit,64-bit,log10,routine
i believe the following works as a sort comparison function for positive int provided the int type used is substantially narrower than the double type 32-bit int and 64-bit double and the log10 routine used returns exactly correct results for exact powers of 10 which a good implementation does

conversions,float,smaller,unsigned
these conversions promote float to double and anything smaller than int to int or unsigned int

bear,mind,larger,smaller,program,behaviour
bear in mind that if the double returned is larger or smaller than that which can be held in an int then the program behaviour is undefined

x,trouble,bigger,numbers
clearly calling int x on a double is asking for trouble since double can store bigger numbers than int

variable,larger,values,able,approximation
a double variable can hold larger values than an int and is able to store an approximation of the value 4000000000

bigger
a double is bigger than an int

comparisons,hashes,expensive,number
while both double comparisons and hashes are more expensive than int s the number of comparisons is theta n log n while the number of hashes is o n

1---------------------------------------------------

multiplications,faster
int multiplications however are only 1.5 times faster than double multiplications

division,faster
maybe division between double and int is faster than it between double

performance,pow,faster
this can t help performance either since pow double int is significantly faster than pow double double in general

faster
so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int

benchmark,r,slower,manipulations
also after the first coercion from a side effect of a benchmark as noted above r will operate on double s and that contains slower manipulations than on int s

nub,big,slower
with it is nub on and comparing big int is slower than comparing double

slower
double is much slower than int

slower
even dividing int is slower than multiplying floats or double in some cases

subtractions,faster,machine
int subtractions are 2.5 times faster than double subtractions on my machine

machine,swap,loop,faster
on my machine the double swap loop completes 11 times faster than the int swap loop

possible,machine,slower
incrementing the value might be a special case but it s possible that on your machine incrementing double is slower than incrementing int

pow,returns
you will get 24 if pow 10 2 returns a double that is little less than 100 99.9999999998765 which when cast to int would be truncated resulting in 99 and thus you get

math,faster
often using int math is faster than double

2---------------------------------------------------

math.ceil,closest
or math.ceil double which returns the closest int that is more than the double

math.floor,closest
you can also use math.floor double to get the closest int that is less than the double

other---------------------------------------------------

part
the int part is less than 2 and the double part is less than 3

urgent,one,wider,platform,garbage
the most urgent one that comes to mind is that a double is wider than an int on your platform and garbage memory is read

strong,idiomatic,spreadsheet,values
2 unless you have a strong reason to use int it is more idiomatic to use double for spreadsheet values

higher,maximum,lower,minimum,conversion,necessary,side,effects,need,error
a double has a higher maximum and presumably lower minimum than an int so there s no conversion necessary so you shouldn t experience any side effects of assigning a double an int so there s no need for an error

wall,accurate,exact
i figured out this was happening because i was storing the wall coordinates in double and although double are certainly more accurate than int they still aren t exact

unit,present,faster,hardware,support
if such a hardware unit is present floats double can be faster than int unless there is also hardware int support

problem,positive,next,rounds,closest
the problem is that a positive double very slightly less than an int casts to the next int down but rounds to the closest int

true,general,most-specific,option
but this isn t true because double is more general than int and therefore int is the most-specific option in this case

difference,faster,clock,cycles,arithmetic,operations
the difference is that int are still faster than double because it takes very few clock cycles to do arithmetic operations on int

lines,rectangles,float,decimal,matter,precision,windows,visual
the problem is that i need to draw some simple objects points lines especially rectangles with double float decimal precision it doesn t matter with more precision than an int on a windows form i m using visual studio but i can t find anything

unboxed,vector,hand,easier,csv,readint
here for what it s worth is a pipes-csv variant which just compresses each parsed row into an unboxed vector of int s by hand this easier than finding double which is what this csv is really storing using readint from the bytestring package.

complex,operation
i am guessing this is because modifying a double is a more complex operation than modifying an int

simple,different,new,mql4.56789,et,al
the reason is simple double has different handling than new - mql4.56789 float the more than int et al

specific
for example an int is more specific than a double because 1 can be promoted to 1.0

shouldnt,surprising,strings,time,single
and it shouldnt be too surprising that copying a double 3 strings and an int takes more time than copying a single double

code,abs,narrower,fabs,fabsf,float
code should use abs with int or narrower fabs with double fabsf with float labs x with long etc

linear,programming,troublesome,reals
you are doing linear programming on int which is more troublesome than with reals double

information
you can t convert a double to int because the double has more information than the int

appropriate,numerics,logical
also int are more appropriate than double numerics for this case of logical coercion

time,equality,slower,code,comparisons,amount
using and at the same time to check equality on a int results in slower code because it takes two comparisons instead of one taking the double amount of time

difficult,plain,host,machines
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

real-world,architectures,stricter,alignment,requirements
on some real-world architectures double has stricter alignment requirements than int

longer,w
if they are double it takes much longer until w w 2 is 0 than with int

flexible
it seems to be that double is much more flexible than int

compiler,happy,larger,particular,control
i understand that the compiler isn t happy because a double might be larger than an int can hold but this particular control is guaranteed to be a value from 1 to 10 so i know that it will be okay

note,trickier
note that the double is much trickier than the int s

length
double s length is way more than int that s why you should be checking int first

contrast,bits,in-practice,safe,ub,smaller,equal,size,invalid,bit
in contrast accessing the bits of a double as an int is usually in-practice safe even though it s formally ub because 1 an int is typically smaller or equal in size to double and 2 an int usually does not have any invalid bit patterns
