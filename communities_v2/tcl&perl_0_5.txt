it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

i know that perl performs better for some regex but will the tcl performance really be this bad in comparison

worse,ruby,python
tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

tcl is more verbose than perl here
