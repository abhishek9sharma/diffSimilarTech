afraid,honest,technical,mercurial,windows,sorts
i would not mind changing to for example bazaar or git if needed i am a bit afraid of git to be honest everything i read about git seems 10x more technical than anything i read about mercurial or bazaar and installing it on windows seems to imply installing all sorts of secondary software it seems but that is another matter

note,hg,powerful,stuff
note most recently i have been using bazaar and hg with fully powerful regexps so may be looking for stuff more powerful than git provides

fine,needs,better,problem,usability,user,friendly,explorer,advice,experience,best,similar
it works fine and fits all my needs but recently i found that git works better than bazaar so i decided to use it but i face a problem with git usability because most git s gui not user friendly as bazaar explorer so i want your advice based on a practical experience which best git s gui user friendly or which one is most similar to bazaar explorer
