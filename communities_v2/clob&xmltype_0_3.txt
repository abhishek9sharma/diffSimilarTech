safer,soap,request,data,longer
a clob is a safer way to handle the soap request than an xmltype because the data returned may be longer than 32767 bytes

stricter,validity
xmltype is being stricter about the validity than clob

latter,types,various,varchar,data,specific,type,xml
if you are storing varchar type data you should really be using one of the latter two types clob if you are storing various varchar data and xmltype which is a more specific type of clob anyway if you are storing strictly xml data
