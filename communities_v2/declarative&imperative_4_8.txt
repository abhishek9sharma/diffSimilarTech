programming,simpler
declarative programming is not always simpler than imperative programming

cleaner,programming,business
i know that declarative way is cleaner but sometimes imperative programming makes your business safer

angular,belief,code,better,uis,components
angular is built around the belief that declarative code is better than imperative when it comes to building uis and wiring software components together.

code,easier,bug-free
declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code

sql,simpler,faster,pl
declarative sql is usually simpler and faster than imperative pl sql so it s usually best to do most of the work in sql and just glue it together with pl sql

current,time,machine,interpreter,top,cheaper,faster,true
while it is possible to explore non-imperative computer concepts it doesn t seem to be worth the effort at the current time - building a declarative machine as an interpreter on top of an imperative machine is much cheaper and faster than a true declarative machine

difference,speed,fewer,overheads,modern,compilers,code,top,bigger,python,slower
traditionally there was a huge difference in speed imperative has fewer overheads because it s more directly like the computer works but some more modern compilers of declarative code seem to be in the top few of the speed tables a lot of the time - compiled verses interpreted makes a much bigger difference than imperative vs declarative which is why python etc are often slower even though they re imperative

effects,better,pattern,top,code
using declarative effects is better than thunks for testability but the saga pattern can be implemented on top of imperative or declarative code
