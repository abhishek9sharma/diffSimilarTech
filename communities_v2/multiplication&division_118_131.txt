expensive,smart,compiler,compile-time,constant
usually division is a lot more expensive than multiplication but a smart compiler will often convert division by a compile-time constant to a multiplication anyway

point,fewer,cycles
floating point multiplication usually takes fewer cycles than floating point division

representation,ï,faster
in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 ï because multiplication is so much faster than division

the tostring should be slower than parse since division is generally slower than multiplication

math,part,faster,possible
change the half to 0.5 and you should be golden for the math part also multiplication is faster so use it instead of division when possible

worse
so division is always a bit worse than multiplication

etc.,processor,cheaper,fixed-point,issues

correct,operations,shifts,additions,slower,hardware
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division

slower
and division may be slower than multiplication or may still be fast

arithmetic,expensive,powers,dividion,exponent,range
it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

binary,floating-point,accurate,coincidence,relative
in fact if the intent is to divide by 22 10 or some other real value that isn t necessarily exactly representable in binary floating-point then half the times the multiplication is more accurate than the division because it happens by coincidence that the relative error for 1 x is less than the relative error for x

1---------------------------------------------------

academic,literature,higher,precedence
in some of the academic literature implied multiplication is interpreted as having higher precedence than division

higher,precedence,round
does multiplication has higher precedence over division or it is other way round

i.e,precedence
thus python should interpret this like 12 2 i.e 6 since precedence of multiplication is more than division

higher,precedence
multiplication has higher precedence than division

higher,precedence
since multiplication is of higher precedence than division

higher,presedence
i read that multiplication has has higher presedence than division

2---------------------------------------------------

fast,slow,hardware,div,instruction,slower,modern,cpus
can be fast or it can be awfully slow even if division is done entirely in hardware if it is done using a div instruction this instruction is about 3 to 4 times slower than a multiplication on modern cpus

modern,processors,good,order,slower,float,reciprocal,throughput
on modern processors float division is a good order of magnitude slower than float multiplication when measured by reciprocal throughput

heavier,commenter,reciprocals,fast,modern,cpus
division may be heavier than multiplication but a commenter pointed out that reciprocals are just as fast as multiplication on modern cpus in which case this isn t correct for your case so if you do have 1 x appearing somewhere inside a loop and more than once you can assist by caching the result inside the loop and then using y

other---------------------------------------------------

convenient,programming
or is there something about multiplication that is more convenient than division in programming

possible,polynomial,efficient,table,algorithm,slower,single
i am pretty sure it is not possible to compute polynomial division more efficient than multiplication and as you can see in the following table this algorithm is only 3 times slower than a single multiplication

easiest,nothing,dividend,inverse
easiest way is to simply recognize that division is nothing more than the multiplication of the dividend y and the inverse of the divisor x

iterative,process,thing,log,grade,school,simpler,numerator,long,number,denominator
division though is an iterative process in logic the implementations you see on educational sites verilog vhdl are simply doing the same thing we did with log division in grade school but like multiplication it is much simpler than grade school you pull down bits from the numerator in the long division until the number being checked against the denominator is equal to or larger basically the number can either go in only zero times or one times into the next number under test unlike decimal where it can be between 0 to 9 times

time
multiplication takes less time then division so you can try this

slower,regular,expression,matching,is..
division is slower than multiplication is generally - and definitely using regular expression matching is going to be slower than multiplication is..

division and square roots for huge number of bits are not much more complex than multiplication

longer,pen,paper
division takes a lot longer than multiplication - just do it with pen and paper to see

both operations are done down at the floating point unit fpu level and even in the world of integral alus the division circuit is a far busier place than a multiplication circuit

school,recall,harder,addition
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication

millions,transaction,costlier
well if it is a single calculation you wil hardly notice any difference but if you talk about millions of transaction then definitely division is costlier than multiplication

longer
why does division take so much longer than multiplication

time,line,multiple
i have heard division takes more time then multiplication but beyond that i could not determine whether writing this in one line or multiple assignment lines was more efficient
