anthony,williams,maths,complete,type,faster,target
anthony williams fixed-point maths library provides a complete analogue of the standard maths library for a fixed data type that is typically around 5 times faster than software floating-point on the same target

better,arm,arithmetic,faster,implementations
armv7 is usually better but for arm fixed-point arithmetic is usually a lot faster than floating-point implementations

exact,number,exponents
fixed-point can be much more exact than floating-point as long as the number s exponents remain in range

true,matlab,arithmetic,precision,ieee,types
it s not necessarily true that the matlab fixed-point arithmetic provides less precision it can be used to provide more precision than ieee floating-point types

calculations,expensive,time-wise,popular,microcontrollers
floating-point calculations are more expensive time-wise than fixed-point which is why fixed-point remains popular in microcontrollers and embedded systems
