spacing,decent,mode,graphs,bigger,space,possible
in portrait the spacing is decent but in landscape mode i feel like the graphs should be bigger and take up more space than in portrait mode which is simply not possible with the tab bar and navigation bar

imageview,smaller
your imageview in landscape is smaller than portrait

topbar,height,bigger,iphone
topbar portrait height is bigger than topbar landscape height everywhere except iphone 6 plus

right,uiview,mode,greater,distance,bottom
the amount of spacing to the right of the uiview when in portrait mode is greater than i want for landscape mode and the distance from the bottom is less than i want for landscape mode

height,smaller,value
because in landscape your height is smaller than in portrait you need to have a value smaller than 1.0

width,650px
then you can write separate css for width less than 650px portrait more than 650 landscape

large,area,cell,wider,shorter
the difference between a min and max dimension can be very large as the given area covered by a landscape cell is much wider and shorter than a portrait cell

mode,rows
portrait mode can display more rows than in landscape mode

orientation,lower,right,point,gl
without more detail it s hard to say why your approach doesn t work but my guess is that you are seeing the sprite positioning you describe as a result of the fact that if you don t change orientation the lower left in portrait is the lower right in landscape when rotated left it s the same point in gl space 0 0

content,area,iframe,smaller
obviously i want in portrait view the content area of this iframe to be smaller than in landscape

wider,taller,viceversa,image
as long as landscape means wider than taller and portrait viceversa it means to read the image into memory and check width and height

height,screen,mode
its because the height of the screen in portrait mode is more when compared to height of the screen in landscape mode

uiview,graphics.in,mode,size,viewgraph,larger
i had an outlet of a viewgraph which was a subclass of uiview in which i drew some graphics.in landscape mode the size of the viewgraph is larger than in portrait mode

iphone,compact,mode,status,bar,height
on an iphone compact in landscape mode the status bar is hidden and the navigation bar height is less than in portrait

calculation,fine,mode,switch,distance,button,bigger
my problem with this is that the calculation works fine in the portrait mode but as soon as i switch to landscape mode the distance between bottom and button is bigger than in portrait mode

ipad3,browser,window,switches,mode,choppier
if you switch between portrait and landscape when viewing this on an ipad3 you ll need to refresh the browser window between switches you can see that portrait mode is choppier than landscape

buttons,addition,mode
in landscape it has more buttons in addition to what is there in portrait mode

taller,wider
portrait is taller landscape is wider

issue,height,mode,lower
you have this issue because height in landscape mode is lower then in portrait

doubt,mode,width,itemtemplate,listbox,able,data
now my doubt is when i rotate it to portrait mode from landscape mode since the width of the textblocks present inside the itemtemplate of listbox is already defined when i rotate the it to portrait i am not able to see all the data present it cuts off since the width of the portrait mode is less when compared to landscape mode

width,screen,bigger
you are using the screen size to generate your placeholder image and the width of the screen in landscape is bigger than portrait

1---------------------------------------------------

bottom,photos,narrower,ones,top
as you can see the bottom two photos landscape so have been rotated are narrower than the portrait ones at the top

height,meaning,images,horizontal,space,ones
i want all of the images to fit inside the width of the text area which will change dynamically with the window size and i want them all to be the same height meaning of course that landscape images take up more horizontal space than portrait ones etc

lesser,space,able,top
as landscape has lesser space than portrait you are able to view only top scrollview so only that portion would be scrollable

complete,layout,space,fitting,lesser
i guess you are able to see the complete layout in portrait just because portrait layout is having more space and your complete layout is fitting well but landscape is having lesser space

css,nothing,images,taller,ones,code
i am trying to make all a row of 4 images all have the same height size i already tried to play around with the width and height using css but nothing seems to work the portrait images always end up taller than the landscape ones here s the code

other---------------------------------------------------

orientation,devices,better,phones
currently i m using only the portrait orientation for all devices but the portrait orientation looks better on phones meanwhile landscape orientation looks better on tablets

tableview,view,vertical,room
or the tableview is covering it up because the landscape view has less vertical room than the portrait view

order,cells,webview,higher
you may try to listen to uideviceorientationdidchangenotification within your subclass cell to rotate the webview and within your view controller with the table view and run a -reloaddata on your table view in order to properly resize the cells assuming the landscape webview is way higher than the portrait webview

thing,activity,rectangle,smaller,dimensions,camera
but the only thing i get is that the activity is still in landscape but the rectangle now is smaller with the portrait dimensions and the camera becomes weird because the image is rotated 90 degrees and moves down when i move the phone left and up when moving the phone right
