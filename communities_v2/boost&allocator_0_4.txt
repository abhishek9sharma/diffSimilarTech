able,std,fast_pool_allocator,method,g++,higher
to be able to use std allocate_shared with boost fast_pool_allocator as the allocator method using g++ 4.8 or higher with boost 1.56.0

intrusive_ptr,better,shared_ptr,second,reference,count
boost intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second allocator to hold the reference count

dynamic,memory,faster,std,to_string,karma,benchmarks
the latter doesn t do any dynamic memory allocator and is more than 10 times faster than std to_string on boost karma benchmarks

version,string_ref,faster,due
just to goof off a version using boost string_ref is much faster still due the reduced allocator
