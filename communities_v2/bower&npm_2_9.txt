even if you can handle them with npm it s better to use bower since it s optimized for this purpose no deep dependencies among other things

project,dependencies,available,versions
on the project i m using bower to manage dependencies because i found that it has way more available versions than npm does

wider,user,base
what i meant to ask is it can be argued that npm has a wider user base than bower some even argue that we should stop using bower altogether like here and here

little,reading,sense
my codebase is front-end only so after doing a little reading i thought bower would make more sense than npm

package,little,bit,harder
using npm package is a little bit harder than using bower package

packages,simpler,equivalents,subfolders
bower packages are simpler than npm equivalents and don t have subfolders with module dependencies
