number,prime,factor,larger,solution,problem
i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem

previous,comment,number,prime,factor,larger
and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit

1---------------------------------------------------

mul,imul,faster,32bit
actually on intel sandybridge-family at least mul imul 64bit 64bit 128bit is faster than imul mul 32bit 32bit 64bit

benchmark,test,intrinsic,function,faster
in a benchmark test the 128bit intrinsic function performs faster than the 64bit intrinsic

other---------------------------------------------------

distributed-system,internet-wide,pointers,system,call
perhaps 128bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit

years,architecture,math,faster,today
in a few more years there might be an architecture where 128bit math is faster than 64bit but i don t think any exists today

transactions,faster,bit
128bit transactions tend to be faster than 64bit which tend to be faster than 32 bit

adder,slower
so a 128bit adder will be slower than a 64bit add
