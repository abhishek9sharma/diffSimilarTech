jsf,application,least,documentation,better
i haven t tried any of these in a jsf 2 application but i would recommend using the primefaces one at least the documentation is better than richfaces

developed,rf
richfaces is more developed and tested generally since primefaces came out later than rf

components,combobox,available
primefaces has more components but lack combobox available in richfaces
