benchmark,little,bit,better,bigger,static,contents,good
according to this benchmark nginx is a little bit better than lighttpd for serving bigger static contents so nginx would be a good choice for static flv video contents

cherrypy,fast,memcached,faster
shortly put running some benchmarks on a page doing some database operations and serving static dynamic content has shown that plain cherrypy was twice as fast than nginx and memcached and about half faster than lighttpd

setup,easier,macport,port,install,+ssl,ssl-breaking,bug,suffers
i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here

webserver,majority,able,faster
nginx seems to be the webserver getting the majority of the buzz lately it may be able to serve faster than lighttpd maybe not

simple,lightweight
it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd
