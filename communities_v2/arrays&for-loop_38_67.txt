closure,element,straightforward,transparent,alternative,old-fashioned
in its implementation foreach executes a closure over every element in the arrays this is typically more straightforward and transparent alternative to old-fashioned for-loop

code,c,larger,index
above is a simplified version of my actual code where the c arrays is much larger so i have to use a for-loop to get every index

maximum,index,bigger
it turns out i had a hard coded maximum index in my for-loop which was bigger than the arrays i was trying to assign to

items,smaller,best,solution
as mentioned above as you remove items the arrays gets smaller so a for-loop is probably not the best solution

code,big,faster,solution,old
i tried this code with my the big arrays it is around 10 to 20 times faster than a for-loop solution and around 200 times fast than the old code

good,small,better,amount,code,size
i suppose the first option is good for small arrays but a for-loop is probably better practice as the amount of code would remain the same regardless of arrays size

element,shorter,symbols,big
in this case if any element in arrays is shorter than 11 symbols will become big and for-loop will stop executing

opinion,better,specific,number,item,foreach,straightforward
in my opinion a for-loop is usually better for doing something a specific number of times and if you re just iterating over every item in an arrays foreach is usually more straightforward

index,length,error
when i try to access it with a for-loop where its index is less than the arrays length i get the following error message typeerror function object is unsubscriptable

native,javascript,faster,big,difference,small,items
it is clear without any performance tests that native javascript for-loop is faster but there is no big difference for small arrays like 10-20 small items

1---------------------------------------------------

faster,foreach-loop
the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be

assertion,analysis,faster,lists
i completely failed to check that assertion and just jumped into the analysis of how the enhanced for-loop is faster on arrays than lists

faster,foreach-loop,iteration
the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be accessed once per iteration

faster
would an arrays be faster than a for-loop in this case

faster,foreach-loop
thus the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must

pair-wise,faster,c-style
iterating pair-wise you d normally do something like but iterating over an arrays is faster than using a c-style for-loop

objects,method,faster,equality
when you know both objects are arrays method is a faster way to check equality than for-loop

higher-dimensional,faster,-based,code
this is the reason why working with the higher-dimensional arrays ends up being so much faster than the for-loop -based code

2---------------------------------------------------

better,counter,variable
since it s an arrays it s better to use a for-loop with a counter variable i which starts from 1

better,regular
but when looping through an arrays it s better to use a regular for-loop

use,better,next,saved.length,datalength
the questions should i use for-loop or is it better to do it recursively next insert will be called after previous is done should i check if saved.length datalength and then return the arrays or is there some better way how to do it

method,element,better,traditional
you can use array.prototype.find method to check if the element exists in arrays which is much better than perform a traditional for-loop

normal,better,for-in,object
but then normal for-loop is far better for arrays than using for-in which is actually for object

better
edit using an enhanced for-loop is a lot better than using arrays

scenario,traditional,handy
this is a scenario where a traditional for-loop is more handy than just iterating over the arrays

length,regular,summation
if the length of the arrays is less than 8 a regular for-loop summation is performed

better,alnitak,for-in
but for the arrays it is better to use for-loop as shown by alnitak than for-in

loops,outer,order,better
but you will have loops the outer arrays in order to get it to work which would be better done with a for-loop so you reference both at once

easier
with one arrays one can do which is easier than a for-loop

3---------------------------------------------------

parallel,normal,time,intstream,items
i am just starting to learn about the streams and parallel in java and i was wondering why a normal for-loop takes less time than intstream paralleled at adding items to an arrays

json,entries,request,long,time,entry
but i don t want to use a for-loop as my json arrays has more than 3 entries and if i request a lot of data in short time it takes long time till the for-loop goes through every entry

4---------------------------------------------------

last,part,parent,file,size
but the for-loop is not reading writing the last part of the parent file which is less than the arrays size

user,size,first,program
okay so after telling the user to enter the size of the arrays the arrays was assigned to lets say 5 therefore in the first for-loop the program is checking if i is less than the arrays size so it can only be entered 5 times as that is the size of the arrays

5---------------------------------------------------

longer,iterations
the longer the arrays gets the more iterations your for-loop will need

division,large,longer
note that this is one of those cases where matrix division of large arrays takes longer than a for-loop

hits,longer,numtotalhits,limit
the hits arrays is longer than numtotalhits so your for-loop limit should be numtotalhits instead of hits.length

6---------------------------------------------------

im,second,names,strings,previous
im going to have a second for-loop that makes more arrays and names these arrays as the strings from my previous arrays

first,word,shorter,second
because if the first word in arrays is shorter than second one you need second for-loop

other---------------------------------------------------

javascript,native,quicker
to my knowledge and research so far - javascript s native for-loop is quicker than arrays map for iterating through the arrays

iteration,outer,ndx,array.length,equivalent,bounds
on the last iteration of the outer for-loop ndx is one less than array.length so when you call arrays ndx+1 that is equivalent to arrays array.length which out of bounds since arrays start indexing at 0

column,indices,rows,slower,slow,double
in this case instead of generating two large matrices with the row and column indices you can use a for-loop on the rows of your arrays it s slower but not as slow as a double for-loop

quick,benchmark,4x,faster,time,new,replacements
running a quick benchmark it seems that the for-loop is 4x faster even in the worst case where you have to replace every single time and you construct a new arrays to hold the replacements

logic,greater,length
also change your logic in the for-loop to be not since i will not ever be greater than the arrays length

nothing,basic,iteration
looping with a for-loop is nothing more than a basic iteration of an arrays using a for-loop

work,simple
but modifying the arrays is more work than a simple for-loop again

approach,loads,calls,worse
so then i think to go with that approach i would end up with a for-loop and loads of add calls but surely that is even worse than the arrays copy isn t it

5th,level,statement
next i can use 3rd 4th and 5th level of arrays means more than for-loop statement will be assign

specific,axis,dedicated,method,array.sum,ax,slower
when summing an arrays over a specific axis the dedicated arrays method array.sum ax may actually be slower than a for-loop

better,scope,system,string,output,numbers
also with the for-loop it s considered better to limit the scope of the iterating variable i and to use println you need system.out not just system and you need a string java arrays do not override tostring so something to output the numbers the user entered after loops like

loops,simple,checks,index,stil,smaller,length
to use this in a loops you can write a simple for-loop which always checks if the index stil is smaller than the arrays length

return,statement,fixes,problem,length
i fixed this by adding after the for-loop and before the return statement which fixes the problem but if the for-loop is written to continue while i is less than the arrays length and when the arrays only contains a the length is one and i is 0 shouldn t it also pop a

outer,temp,number,numbers
but the outer for-loop still runs 9 more times pushing temp which is already a set number onto the numbers arrays

simple,memory,usage,foreach,internal,copy
in such a simple arrays you shouldn t be concerned about memory usage but the for-loop consumes less memory than foreach because foreach uses an internal copy of the arrays

suitable
a for-loop is more suitable to iterate through the arrays

top,length,lower,equal,bottom,access,outofrangeexception
so when you go up an arrays 0-9 you want the top of a for-loop to be less than the arrays length when you are going down the arrays 9-0 you want the lower bound to be less than or equal to the bottom of the arrays otherwise you will start out trying to access at 10 the arrays length and get an outofrangeexception

adequate,string
a for-loop is more adequate than a do while for simply iterating an arrays string

efficient,temporary,tuples,zip
the for-loop here is more efficient for 2 reasons a you don t have to construct a temporary arrays of tuples like with zip and b it returns false as soon as a non-match is found

code,line,point,--the,compiler,length,variable,single,chars
in your code on line in the for-loop does no more point to an arrays --the compiler has no information about the length of the variable that it s pointing at whether it is an arrays a single chars or an int or something else-- but it is just a plain pointer presumably a pointer pointing to a default int

convenience,reliable,htmlcollection
i ve used it for convenience a for-loop is much more reliable for converting an htmlcollection to an arrays

fast,variant,things,simple,better,speed
use a for-each loops to go through a range it s not as fast as using a variant arrays but keeps things simple and offers better speed than a for-loop

information,alias,code,search,strength,reduction
an arrays usually offers more information for alias analysis and after some optimizations the same code will be generated anyway search for-loop strength reduction if curious

faster,built-in,methods,browsers
for example sometimes a for-loop is faster than the built-in arrays methods in some browsers

method,plain,better,performance,new,scratch,current
notice that besides using the filter method or not even with a plain for-loop is much better for performance create a new arrays from scratch instead of mutate the current one multiple times

byte,pixels,faster,call,getpixel,nested
it returns a byte arrays of all the pixels which can be iterated much faster than a for-loop with a call to getpixel inside nested inside another for-loop

note,index,bounds,system.arraycopy,efficient,simpler,copying
note that you should check if index is within arrays bounds in such cases and that system.arraycopy is more efficient and arguably simpler than a for-loop for copying arrays

catch,closer,mind,unassigned,values
try catch inside for-loop is probably closer as long as you don t mind the unassigned values left in the arrays

efficient,coding,system.arraycopy
the only way to copy arrays that is more efficient than for-loop coding is system.arraycopy
