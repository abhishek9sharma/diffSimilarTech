0---------------------------------------------------

values,array,faster
if you just have 3 possible values use an array of chars and that will copy 4 times faster than int

indexing,datatype,performance,varchar,datatypes
indexing on int datatype gives you more performance than indexing on chars or varchar datatypes

longer
and int is longer than chars typically 4 vs

time,long,faster,computation,strings
there are many options for you like visser suggested you could convert the date time into a long int which allows faster computation or you can keep them as strings or even convert them into chars like what you have done with chars array2

size,larger
the size of an int is certainly larger than the size of a chars

possible,string,longer,length,mix,numbers,original
so my question is is it possible to convert the int to string which is longer than 10-12 chars fixed length if possible mix of chars and numbers which can be reversed to the original int

bigger,result,operation
int is bigger than chars but the result of your operation is typed int which you re then storing in a chars

exceptions,small,strings,special,length,singletons,id
but there are some exceptions for small int between -5 and 256 and small strings interned strings with a special length usually less than 20 chars which are singletons and have same id actually one object with multiple pointer

higher,datatype,lower,datatype.
here int is higher datatype and chars is lower datatype.

advice,excellent,faster
zim s advice is excellent and searching on int will always be faster than chars

lower,rank,zero-,sign-extended
as chars has a lower rank than int it is promoted to int zero- or sign-extended

long,string,value,byte,utf-8
this means that as long as you verify that every java chars in your string is less than 128 int value you are going to get one byte per chars with utf-8

bits,wide,bigger,pointer,fourth,reverse,string
since an int is 32 bits wide four times bigger than a chars when the pointer is being decremented it is printing out every fourth chars in the reverse of the string

sizeof,unsigned,larger
both of them are wrong because they will cause out-of-range access if sizeof unsigned int is larger than sizeof chars

value,greater,values
so for example the value of the chars 3 is 3 greater than the value of 0 so when you subtract these two values you get the int 3

space,address
for example an int might occupy more space than a chars or it might be that the chars lives at an address where no int can ever live.

smaller,fit
weren t the case a chars is always smaller than an int and will thus always fit inside an int so it can safely be promoted

value,expression,result,larger
before this happens the value of a in this expression is promoted in int so the result can be larger than a chars

larger
in most cases int is a lot larger than chars

computer,bytes,ascii,values,c,compiler,fewer
if you want to convert an int to a chars you ll need to instruct the computer to interpret the bytes of an int as ascii values - and it s been a while since i ve done c but i believe the compiler will complain since chars holds fewer bytes than int

code,single-character,string,ones,type,error
i can write code that successfully returns the int of a single-character string however when it comes to ones that contain more than one chars i can t because of this type error

answer,reference,larger,assertion,discussion
we have the following stackoverflow answer for reference which describes the case where chars can be larger than int which backs up the assertion in the discussion above

memory,things,space,size,type,text
if the file is in text format you may be able to fit it in memory just by converting things to int as you read them in since an int stored as chars may take more space than an int stored as an int depending on the size of the int and the type of text file

digit,double,efficient,uid,string
if so is there some correlation such as 40 digit double int is 50 more efficient as a uid than using 20 chars string

computations,domain,short,type,smaller
c language never performs arithmetic computations withing the domain of chars short or any other type that is smaller than int

size,smaller
and size of chars is smaller than size of int

access,key,accesses,faster,bit
but for 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors data alignment and bulk data access is key int accesses are frequently much faster than chars accesses and long long 64 bit may be faster still for some systems

smaller,rank,overload,unsigned,better,match,conversion,promotion
basically every chars has always a smaller rank than int and they can all be represented in an int and so the overload with unsigned chars is not a better match because it would involve a conversion from chars to unsigned chars instead of a promotion

size,conversion
do note that the size of a chars is less than an int so the conversion from a chars to int doesn t make you lose anything

larger,eof,space,numbers,expressible,set
since int is larger than chars this allows eof to be somewhere inside the space of numbers expressible as int while being outside the set of chars

string,class,array
another problem what does the arduino string class do if the int is less than 1000 or less than 100 and doesn t require 3 or 4 chars to convert to a chars array

string,comparison,longer,boolean,alternative
for example for your case a string chars comparison takes longer to carry out in general considering the int boolean alternative

texts,slower,ids
so 250 chars long texts are certainly much slower than int ids

sizeof,greater,compiler,padding,member,variable
and sizeof int is greater than one and the compiler adds padding for the chars member variable - is the compiler-generated code allowed to change the values of the padding bytes

sizeof,strings,greater,needs,null
also assuming sizeof int 4 your strings must not be greater than 4 chars as you have now and 1 of those needs to be a null termination

sizeof,larger
int is sizeof int times larger than chars

key,smaller,size,field
an int key is smaller in size then a chars field for holding 100 chars

key,greater
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be greater than a int one

array,smaller,sure
if you want to point to more than one int you would need to define an int array which is four times smaller than your chars array - make sure your sizes are correct

range,greater,unsigned
this will work if the range of int is greater than that of unsigned chars

small,sense,appropriate,type,space
if all your int are small it might make sense to store all 5 values in a more appropriate type a chars which will use less space than an int

standard,unsigned,rank,type,switch,condition
it s stated in the standard that unsigned chars has less rank than int and with this the type of the switch condition will be int which further means

obscurity,aware,varchar,columns,larger,space,byte
i understand you re after the security by obscurity but be aware that chars varchar columns larger than 4 chars take more space than int does 1 byte

comparison,easier,strings,literature
i assume this is because comparison between int is much easier than between chars strings but i was looking for some literature to back this assessment ideally some database structure book

surrogate,key,faster,staments,names,longer
far better to use a surrogate key and yes a join on an int is often faster and you can join in delete staments in many databases not use the slower subquery especially since names tend to be longer than a few chars

note,safe,larger
although note it s not safe since an int is larger than a chars

larger,byte,problem
i ve always been taught that if an int is larger than a chars you must solve the byte ordering problem

rank,unsigned,promotion
in which case the rank of unsigned chars woudl not be less than int and therefore the promotion would be to unsigned int

type,unsigned,wider
in order for this to work reliably c should have type and unsigned int should be strictly wider than unsigned chars

ascii,keys,incorrect,result
when i try converting ascii int to keys that have more than one chars i always get an incorrect result

everyone,aroud,memory
everyone know int needs aroud 4 times more memory than chars

order,declarations,variable,memory,address,greater,array
my question is how come when the order of declarations are reversed as seen below the int variable i is still at a memory address greater than the chars array

minute,unsigned,larger
let s assume for a minute you re using unsigned chars same applies to larger int of course

potential,information,smaller
however an explicit cast is required in your second case where there is potential to lose information since a chars is smaller than an int

memory,space,faster,indexing
an int will use less memory space and give faster indexing than a chars

conversion,rank,higher
but it is a narrowing conversion because the rank of int is higher than rank of chars

smaller,sizeof,stricter,alignment,requirements,reasonable,thing
it s theoretically possible that an has a smaller sizeof than a for example if int has stricter alignment requirements than chars this could be a reasonable thing to do

rank,unsigned
the rank of unsigned chars is less than that of int

string,length,sting,greater,white,space
your string has 12 chars if you give 10s the length of the sting is greater than the int so there is no white space

smaller
chars is guaranteed to be smaller than int

smaller,4-byte,register,comparison
so even as a chars is smaller than a 4-byte int you have to move them one-by-one into the register to do a comparison

wider,range
putting chars into int is ok - both are int and int has wider range and chars will fit

format,value,larger
when you re printing using the default x format the value to be printed is interpreted as being an int much larger than the chars

table,full,smaller,varchars
you should probably always use an id number that way if you change the type name you don t need to update the user table it also allows you to keep your datasize down as a table full of int is much smaller than one full of 45 chars varchars

larger
is there memset that accepts int larger than chars

memory,trade-off,faster
it s going to be a performance memory trade-off anyway because writing one int is generally faster than three chars separately

outer,foo,better,match,inner,program,prints
although outer foo chars is a better match for the call foo c name lookup stops after finding outer inner foo int outer foo chars is hidden and so the program prints inner

long,strings,smaller
i tried getsubstring long int but it only works for strings smaller than 4000 chars

integer-type,lower,rank,meaning,practice
answering your question a chars is an integer-type of lower rank than int meaning potentially and in practice nearly guaranteed smaller size and value-range and thus pointers to either are different types too

better,paradigm,value,guid,front
i know that using int is a better paradigm here but the value is a guid with a few chars appended to the front

implicit,cast,wider,greater,range,values
an implicit cast is disallowed as an int is wider has a greater range of values than a chars

probability,garbage,value,ascii
while using chars there is probability of getting garbage value as it directly stores the chars but using int there is less probability of it as it stores the ascii value of the chars

system,bits,intermediate,sums
depending on what chars and int on your system are to not assume that int has more bits than chars your intermediate sums may be overflowing

follows.,loophole,types,wider,narrower,range
warning language-lawyering follows. there might be a loophole that allows for extended int types with a wider range than _bool but a narrower range than chars

higher,data,precedence,var,types
in this case to int as int has a higher data type precedence than n var chars data types

platforms,larger
on some platforms an int might be no larger than a chars

numeric,types,smaller,safe,nutshell
int and chars are numeric types and chars is guaranteed smaller than int therefore supplying a chars where an int is expected is safe so in a nutshell yes you can do that

larger,memory
as int is larger than a chars the memory gets corrupted

integral,types,signedness,wider,implicit,conversion
even if it returned chars since both chars and int are integral types of the same signedness and int is wider than chars an int can always store a chars using an implicit conversion sometimes it s called an upcast but it s not really a cast since it s implicit

easier,bytes
reading it into a chars buffer makes it easier to access those four bytes in the int

array,pid,larger,variable
the stack array must be an int as the pid can be larger than a chars variable can fit my pid was 25689

smaller
since chars is smaller than int it would be the same

program,float,smaller
original response in the first program you are trying to print a float but you pass an int chars is a smaller int

wider,flags,gonna
moreover int must be wider than chars hence it can accommodate more than 8 flags which you re not gonna need

memory,overflow,size,larger
finally you wrote an int into the memory of the chars object chars n which causes an overflow because the size of an int is always larger than size of a chars

basis,larger,chance,loss
the basis being that an int is larger than a chars and as such there is no chance of loss of information in the conversion

bigger,4-bytes
int is bigger than chars typically 4-bytes vs

note,larger,range,values,value,myint
note that int has a larger range values than a chars so you should check that the value stored in myint will fit into a chars

space
chars 1 takes substantially less space than an int

faster,queries
int is faster for where queries from chars

exercise,different
i guess that the original exercise would ask you to get two different int of probably more than 1 chars each

imho,code,better,employee,types
imho a chars 1 code is better than an int for employee types

values,overhead
int values have less overhead than chars values

value,sign,complex
if your int value uses more than one chars and includes the sign as you mention then it is more complex

larger,domain
java will allow you to assign chars s to int s since int has a larger domain than chars

smaller
since chars is smaller than int it has to be converted to an int

larger,short,long
if you copy int larger than chars like short or long you have to make sure to correct the byte order depending on your cpu architecture

wider,value
since int is normally wider than chars truncates the value of int being assigned

bigger,safe
yes it is because int is bigger than chars but using chars instead of int would not be safe for the same reason

result,expression,promotions,larger,unsigned
if i remove the operator then the warning is always emitted and that is probably good as the result of the expression after int promotions is larger than unsigned chars

smaller,string,empty,reference,length,code
an int is smaller than a string even if the string is empty because an int is smaller than a reference to chars plus more int for the offset length and hash code

greater,long,short
long long int is greater than long int which is greater than int which is greater than short int which is greater than signed chars

space,str,array,bigger,memory,overwritten
dr printf uses the stack overwriting some of the space pointed by str but since the int array is bigger in memory than the chars array it is far ahead in the stack and doesn t get overwritten

condition,p,pointer,lengths,start
so that is a condition saying that p pretending to be a chars pointer needs to be less than 5 int lengths past the start of a pretending to be a chars pointer

possible,operation,data,faster
so i recommend use numbers whenever possible as operation of int data is faster than chars data

value,terser
they are the same they both cast the value to an int one is just terser by four chars

need,unsigned,array,smaller,uint16_t
similarly if the score values don t need to be unsigned int make the array smaller by using chars or uint16_t

decltype,+,conversion,rank,call
in our case then we have decltype chars + chars is int because chars s conversion rank less than int so both are promoted to int before the call to operator+

utdc_samples,type,larger,assignment,fine
assuming that utdc_samples is also an int type but larger than a chars then the assignment is fine

failures,sum,higher,maximum,value,available
note you can encounter failures if the sum between the two int is higher than the maximum chars value available

br.read,larger,storage,capacity
br.read returns a int which has a larger storage capacity than a chars

note,narrower,rare,systems,width
note that chars is typically narrower than int but on rare systems chars and int may be the same width

strings,possible,values,log
with strings of 6 chars you already have more possible strings than int values log 2 32 log 69 5.23

0x8,string,variable,obvious,plain,integral,types
why did you get 0x38 instead of 0x8 because here 8 is a string not a chars variable a bit less obvious than int is the other of the plain integral types the chars

closer,string
a chars is closer to an int than to a string

varchar,slower,integer-integer,comparison
chars chars varchar is slower then int because integer-integer comparison is easy

unsigned,type,narrower,fewer,bytes,implicit,variable,c,time,compilation
because unsigned chars type is narrower than as it requires fewer bytes int type - implicit type promotion performed by abstract machine compiler and value of variable c is promoted to int at the time of compilation before application of the complement operation

string
how can i convert it into an int if the string has more than one chars

equal,smaller
however chars 36 and int 10 are far away from being equal because a int 10 is much smaller than chars 36

knowledge,size,higher,variable,pointer,first,byte,cc
so as per my knowledge the size of the int remains higher than chars so when i am assigning the int variable to chars pointer it must point only first byte of the int variable because cc is a chars pointer

data,form,reliable,string
storing data in the int form is always more reliable than the chars or string

completeness,unsigned,rank,section,conversion
for completeness to see that unsigned chars rank is less than the rank of int we can go to section 4.13 int conversion rank which says

types,larger,endianness,recipient
first of all never send int s and other types larger than chars like that - you will ignore endianness and the recipient might be unable to interpret the data properly

bit,type,input,hex,representation
since you take 32 bit int type input the hex representation is not more than 8 chars

i.e,string
i.e string chars allocate more than two int allocate we can use

slots,byte
well the int uses more slots since chars are usually only one byte

integral,conversion,lower,rank,floating-integral
1 this time involves an integral conversion since chars has lower rank than int and 2 still involves a floating-integral conversion both of which have the same rank conversion

long,faster,short
however int and long were 1.21x faster than chars and short

larger,types,smaller,short,involved
when smaller types are involved in an expression with larger types for example chars is smaller than short which mostly is smaller than int which may be smaller than long the involved types are promoted to the larger tyoes

max,size,larger,cast,value
the max size of an int is much larger than a chars so your cast may truncate the value

no-op,range,larger,32-bit,unsigned.
the only way it could fail to be a no-op is if the range of chars is larger than the range of int for example if chars and int are both 32-bit but chars is unsigned.

higher,type,precedence,var,types,strings
int has a higher type precedence than any of the n var chars types and so it tries to convert all of the strings to int s to see if they re 0

smaller,size
i understand that a chars is a smaller size than an int

getbit,type,bigger,values,array
you could also get interesting results from getbit if the type of a is an int type bigger than chars and the values in the array have bits set outside the last least significant 8 bits of the number

code,negative,values,random.nextint,command,longer
the code could probably be improved a bit by preventing expected being incremented with negative int values coming from random.nextint 1024 by using random.nextint 1024 instead of random.nextint 1024 but i assume no one ever ran into issues because no one uses a shutdown command longer than 1024 chars

wchar_t,type,larger
wchar_t is just an int type which may be larger than chars

sizeof,unsigned,greater
this likely means that scanf is overwriting adjacent array elements since sizeof unsigned int is most likely greater than sizeof chars

data,user,string
so before calling this method you should verify that all data that come from a user are as they should be if you store an int then that the data passed is an int the string is less than 255 chars ...

types,lower,precedence,query
since chars types have lower precedence than int types the query is basically the same as

nothing,value,encoding
a chars is basically nothing more than an int whose value is the encoding of the chars

output,width,vector,bigger
it should at least output that the the preferred width of chars vector is bigger than the int vector

type,usable,size,storage,room
sometimes chars type is more usable than int - fixed size chars doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated values directly in database fields

data,xs,value,range,string,dozens,possibilities
once that is done you can go in and tweak the data types to better fit your needs if desired and you can add your own restrictions to the data such as requiring that an xs int value be in a range of 0 and 50 or an xs string value be less than 10 chars long - there are dozens of other possibilities but that should give you the idea

single,byte,definition,practice,bits,value,representation,pedantic,formal,higher,type
since a chars is a single byte by definition and since int can t be less than one byte and since in practice all bits of an int are value representation bits it s at best only in the most pedantic formal that a chars can be converted up to a higher type than int

compilers,warning,wider,bits
that s why even picky compilers do not issue a warning if you shift a chars wider than 7 bits try it - you ll get the warning only if you shift wider than an int allows

bytes,varchar
an int is usually 4 bytes i m thinking i don t really need more than 10 chars so a varchar 10 would do.

micro-optimising,storage,memory
the only reason i can think of is the objective-c designers micro-optimising storage because the chars will use less memory than the int

8b,smaller,value,32b
since 8b chars is smaller than 32b int the value is extended to 32b but the sign is preserved when calling printf

byte,faster,4-byte
if i had to assume a 1 byte chars is compared faster than a 4-byte int

unsigned,value,greater,sizeof
i would either cast the chars to an unsigned int if the unsigned int s value is greater than sizeof chars

hlp,type,larger
continuing the int_least8_t example hlp will be promoted to type int which is larger than chars

memory,larger,value
typically int take up more memory than chars so i will end up with a larger value than c after they are both incremented

upper,minimums,bits,limits,sizes,shorter
if you are talking about compiler implementation yes i think the c standard doesn t impose any upper bound only minimums like chars is 8 bits or more and limits on relative sizes like long can t be shorter than int

long,greater,rank,short
the rank of long long int is greater than the rank of long int which is greater than the rank of int which is greater than the rank of short int which is greater than the rank of signed chars

thing,space,bytes,bit,long
another thing is that chars 32 consumes much more space 32 bytes 256 bit where an int 10 only is 32 bit long

number,bits,problem
regarding the last portion of your question the number of bits of int is always more than chars so it won t cause a problem

rank,equal
the rank of a chars is less than or equal to that of an int so chars is included in here

sizeof,larger,system
sizeof int is larger than chars on your system

length,big,gmp,openssl,strings,longer,guaranteed,range
note that if you want to do this with strings of arbitrary length you ll need to work with a big int library like gmp or openssl s bignum - the longest type in standard c long long cannot be mapped one-to-one onto the set of c strings that include strings longer than 8 chars because its guaranteed range includes only 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 unique values

x,type,better,conversion
x is of type chars chars to int is a better conversion than chars to

unicode,21-bit,smaller,long,16-bit,quantity
since unicode is a 21-bit chars set it cannot return anything smaller than an int and it can be argued that technically it should be a long since an int could be a 16-bit quantity

realloc,array,larger
realloc allocates chars but your array is int which are almost certainly larger than chars

distinct,types,precision
chars and int are two distinct types but this works because an int has more precision than a chars

answer,clear,smaller,objective-c,bytes
that answer is pretty clear a chars is smaller than an int and when objective-c was designed back in the 80s shaving off a few bytes was always good

bool,synonym,similar,type,size,larger
the following assumes that bool is a synonym for chars or a similar type of size 1 and int is larger than chars

sizeof,greater
sizeof chars is not greater than sizeof int

loophole,horrible,short,range,unsigned,greater
that does leave one loophole though it s one that would generally be quite horrible that chars and short have the same range size_type is the same as unsigned short and int has a greater range than chars short

thing,length,single,conversion,problem
for one thing an int can easily be more than 1 chars in length which would stop single chars conversion from solving my problem

computers,work,faster,unsigned
on all of the computers i work with int is faster than unsigned significantly faster than signed chars

array,greater,bytes,64-bit
first the chars array is greater than 8 bytes so we can t use it directly as a 64-bit int

types,unsigned,rank,integral,promotion
for types for example chars or unsigned chars that have rank less than int the integral promotion will be performed

type,bits,least,unsigned,representable
usually the chars type has no more than 8 bits while int must have at least 16 bits so every unsigned chars will be representable as an int

requirements,encoding,max,xor,bits
as per you requirements your int will have no more than 6 chars 999999 and the encoding should be max 7 chars so a xor of 24 bits will do it

bytes
even half as many int are bound to require more than 3000 chars or bytes

data,faster,strings,longer
you will get your data faster comparing chars strings is much longer than comparing two int

sizeof,bytes,memory,scanf,longer
you are allocating sizeof int bytes of memory for your strings which is most likely 4 your input strings read by scanf must not be longer than 3 chars

mainstream,platforms,wider,size,least
on mainstream platforms int is wider than chars it has a size of at least 2

faster
working with int is faster than chars

key,shorter
if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be shorter than a int one

abbreviations,longer,xxxl,size,smaller,database,engines,bytes
primary keys should be short but typical size abbreviations are rarely longer than 4 chars -- xxxl --- which is the same size or smaller than an int on most database engines int typically being 4 or 8 bytes

workings,mysql,fields,faster,feeling
i m not an expert in the inner workings of mysql but it intuitively feels that retrieving and sorting int fields is faster than chars fields i just get a feeling that a z is more work that 0 1 and seems to feel much more familiar from a computing perspective in which 0s and 1s are the standard on off flags

search,numbers,faster,mysql,database
is a search through numbers int faster than chars in an mysql database

issue,inputs
but still iâ m facing issue when the inputs given are showing as #### if the int exceeds more than 4 chars

large,clojure,number,bigger,thanks
because int can become arbitrarily large in clojure the resulting number becomes bigger with every chars thanks to the

description,possibility,type,wider,single,padding
this description does not exclude the possibility that for example an int type wider than chars might have a single padding bit that must always be 1

bytes,memory,full,-memory,-variables
if int is 4 bytes and represents 2 bytes the int consumes more memory than the chars -array so you are not initialising the full int -memory to 0 by setting all chars -variables

memory,sufficient,realloc,pointer,sizeof,equal
if you allocate a chunk of memory sufficient to store an int and then realloc for a chars you will always get back the same pointer because sizeof chars is less than or equal to the sizeof int

type,wider,range,data
a int type as a wider range than a chars type see this data type range table

static,disk,memory
how come static chars allocates more disk memory than static int

higher,rank,unsigned
and int has higher rank than unsigned chars

limit,unsigned,tokens,practice,larger,whitespace
your limit is in fact less than that since even if the int are unsigned most tokens in practice would be larger than one chars and many tokens require whitespace separation between them

narrowing,conversion,larger,range,implementation-defined
a narrowing conversion like int to chars if int has a larger range than chars yields some implementation-defined conversion

types,wider
while shifting the types are automatically promoted to int which is wider than chars most often

least,sort,smaller,range,conversion,value
this does implicitly at least sort of assume that chars has a smaller range than int so the conversion to int allows at least one value to be represented that couldn t have come from the file

usual,machine,arithmetic,operation
formally they re promoted to int on a usual machine where chars is less than int and then the arithmetic operation is performed

larger,capacity,conversion
an int has larger capacity than a chars so the conversion is not guaranteed to work

unique,index,column,faster
does a unique index on an int column perform faster than a chars 5

simpler,member,operators
for or int which sounds a simpler case and chars could have been both implemented as member operators or as non-member free operators

note,fgetc,larger,customary,return,addition,values
please note that fgetc requires an int well something larger than a chars -- int is customary for its return value eof is a possible return value in addition to any of the values that chars might take

place,single,starters,larger,byte-wise,entire,fit
you can t really concat an int and place it inside a single chars for starters the int itself is larger byte-wise than your entire chars so obviously it can t fit in there

wider,range,value
int has wider range than chars and you should check if your int value is in chars range before converting back

memory,occupies,conversion
int needs more memory than what chars occupies and the conversion cannot be done in a safe manner

data,bytes,bigger,use
i know int can hold data up to 4 bytes much bigger than chars but what s the use of providing data types in c if we can use any of them

c,true,value,printf,calls,first
in c an int is considered true if it is any value other than 0 and all three of those printf calls print more than 0 chars so it will run the first one which returns a value logically equivalent to true so it will stop execution of that line and go onto the next

value,digit,single
if your int value is more than one digit you can never expect a single chars to hold it

short,smaller,current,platform,major,source
if chars or short happen to be smaller than int on the current platform they are implicitly promoted to int which is a major source of bugs

smaller
a chars is commonly smaller than an int

byte
as long as the int is less than 127 then the chars is stored in one byte

better,time,latin1_general_bin,transformation
int is better because with chars n you ll be comparing one chars at a time and unless you collate latin1_general_bin then you ll also be doing a transformation when comparing chars

values,smaller,strings,page,nvarchar,mathematics
int values are smaller than chars strings you can fit much more per page than you can with nvarchar and mathematics are more easily done on int

unsigned,smaller,fscanf,memory
unsigned chars is smaller than int which means that fscanf overrides destroys some memory you don t own

bytes,byte,reasonable,map,item,key,faster,array,index
int are 4 bytes while chars are only 1 byte so it seems reasonable to believe that accessing a map item at a given chars key is faster than accessing a normal array item at a given int index

size,unsigned,positive,range
chars and int could be the same size and chars is unsigned with a positive range more than int

objects,type,smaller,values,operation
thus when you use it with objects of type chars which is smaller than int these values are automatically converted to int before the operation happens

smaller,structure,mystructv1
if chars is smaller then int usually it is so the structure mystructv1 can be smaller than mystructv2

bigger,pointer,information
since int is bigger than chars an pointer could require less information to indicate what it points to

file,requirement,range,smaller,equal
in fact quite a bit of i o depends on eof having a value that couldn t originate from the file which basically translates to a requirement that chars have a range that s smaller than int not just smaller than or equal to as the standard directly requires

c,extension,faster,collections.default
i ve written chars counter c extension to python looks like 300x faster than collections.counter and 150x faster than collections.default int

ascii,control,greater,utf-8,locale
if there are any ascii control chars or values greater than 127 and it doesn t think its in a utf-8 locale then it will just print int

bigger,unsigned,original,value
since an int is bigger than a chars casting unsigned chars to signed int still retains the chars s original value

union,space,bigger,size,last
i.e if we use int and chars then union will allocate space for chars which has the bigger size and the int too ll be stored in the same space overriding the last one

ascii,values,lower,value
so b would not be less than c as the ascii values for the chars in 2000 would be significantly lower than the int value 1055

type,wider,possible,values
the type int is an int which is usually wider and so can keep all the possible values a chars can keep

larger,single,state
the real sha1 algorithm uses blocks larger than a single chars and state larger than an int but basically that s how it goes

machines,faster,short
on most machines int is faster than short chars so there s not much to think about there

changes,base,better,match,promotion,standard
to base and the meaning of main changes - it calls base f because int is a better match for chars - it s an int promotion rather than a standard conversion

value,listofstrings,shorter,listofintegers,string,byte,amount,space
100 strings of value x00 take 24 bytes per value too -- but notice that listofstrings is one chars shorter than listofintegers so the 1-byte string takes up 1 byte more than the int 0 and the same amount of space as the int 255

arrays,irrelevant,endianness,property,types,bigger
if you re only dealing with arrays of chars or only dealing with arrays of int it s irrelevant because endianness is a property of int and other types bigger than chars

range,wider
normally range of int is much wider than that of chars

values,faster
this is largely due to the fact that comparing int values is much faster that comparing chars values

data,members,types,larger,contents,network
the specific reason that you have to pay close attention to byte-order when handling ipv4 address and port numbers is that the structures sockaddr_in and in_addr have data members with int types larger than chars and whose contents are required to be in network byte order

faster,values
the reason it happens is to enable you to work with int which is faster than working with chars values

feed,end,sequence,input,smaller,n-1
second problem is that every time a new line feed is allocated to the end of chars sequence when the input is smaller than the int n-1

loss,precision,larger,value,smaller,fit
loss of precision means that int has a larger value and chars is smaller so you can t fit something which is to large for that space

higher,address,standard
we know that chars will have a higher address than the int because once again the standard says so

pdp,machines,larger
i believe it was one of the early pdp machines in which a chars was larger than an int

types,rank,type
now the three chars types have the same rank and a signed type has a rank always less than int

algorithm,comparisons,faster
the damerau-levenshtein algorithm includes many comparisons and int compare much faster than chars

value8,conversion,rank,unsigned,lower,platforms
value8 is promoted to int assuming the conversion rank of unsigned chars is lower than the conversion rank of int usually the case on most platforms

smaller,space,usual
by allowing an instance of enum to be smaller it takes up less space much like a chars may be smaller than int as is usual

variable,larger,sizeof
shouldn t a chars 3 variable be larger than sizeof int

single,pointer,invalid,systems,bigger,bytes,end
however accessing a single chars via a pointer to int is also invalid because on most systems int is bigger than chars so you read or write bytes beyond the end of the object

confusing,names,size,dependent
this is made more confusing because of the the names of chars and wchar_t you shouldn t see wchar_t as a chars but more as a int which size isn t dependent on the architecture but on the size of the biggest locale and on the value of weof

array,byte,60mb,ascii,larger,binary
the raw storage of your array assuming a 4 byte int should only be 60mb but since each chars of an int in ascii is 1 byte any int with more than 4 chars are going to be larger than the binary storage hence your 130mb file

instance,architecture,bytes,byte,pointer,bits,smaller,void
for instance on an architecture where the int are 4 bytes and must be 4 byte aligned an int pointer could be two bits smaller than a chars or void pointer

space,different,keys
this does not only mean that int consumes less space it also means that chars 36 has about 4 times more different keys

safe,useful,bigger,inverse,memory
but safe does not mean useful as int is bigger than chars usually we do the inverse to save some memory

varchar,key,space
so if most are just a few chars a varchar 20 key will occupy more space than an int key

warning,greater,range,loss-of-information
this warning comes up because int typically has a greater range than chars and so some loss-of-information may occur

larger,value,random
your int is larger than your chars - you get the a value + some random data following it in memory

original,file,buffer,larger,length
however if i call the function once with a file call it again with a nonexistent file then call it one more time with the original file the chars string buffer is larger than the int length

lower,rank
2 chars has a lower rank than int

least,large,hard,system,work,larger
the rest are at least as large as chars and it s hard to imagine how you d make the i o system work correctly if int wasn t larger than chars

multi-character-constant,literal,character-literal-syntax,implementation-defined,value
a multi-character-constant is a literal int uses the character-literal-syntax with more than one chars and has an implementation-defined value

smaller,zeroes,longer
a chars is smaller than an int so you can return it and it will prepend zeroes to make a longer number

memory,assembly
for example if i declare and only use it in a way that it could have and should have been declared since chars uses less memory than int will gcc optimize that or does it not even matter since it will be converted to assembly

longer,string,larger,order
a longer string of int is larger otherwise compare chars in order

variables,operands,conversion,rank,unsigned,equivalent
then the multiplication part is the same for both variables the operands get promoted to int because the conversion rank of unsigned chars is less than the conversion rank of int and we end up with the equivalent of

specific,type
in java chars is a more specific type of int

internal,representation,machine,little,endian,smaller
like other said it happens to work because the internal representation of an int on your machine is little endian and your chars is smaller than an int

conversion,sizeof,greater
the compiler may generate warning messages for such conversion as sizeof int is greater than sizeof chars

platform,bigger,end,array
on your platform a int is bigger than a chars so you are walking off the end of the array and undefined read really bad things are allowed to happen when you do that

arithmetic,overflow,strings,longer,32-bit,wide
it would probably be more consistent to use the bits from the lowest value to the highest value and 1 must be cast to uint64_t to avoid arithmetic overflow on int for strings longer than 31 chars if int is 32-bit wide

old,c-array,smaller,factor,enumeration
for instance a plain old c-array of 100 000 chars is smaller than the same 100 000 int by a factor of four but if during an enumeration reading out each index involves a cast boxing unboxing of sorts will we see overall lower performance despite the saved memory overhead

wrong,smaller
it s wrong because chars is smaller than int

restrictive,type
thus int is a more restrictive type than chars

unsigned,narrower
if chars as in is a signed chars or an unsigned chars narrower than int 1 of these 2 is almost always the case will be promoted to int

lower,rank
given 4.13 says chars has lower rank than int this means chars can be converted to int if needed but why is it needed

bigger,data,type,result,a.k.a
in you are adding a chars to an int an int can be much bigger than a chars so it chooses the bigger data type int to be the result a.k.a

size,larger,memory,thing
i am guessing that it happens because the size of int is larger than that of chars as such the memory controller the thing which controls memory in c -i don t know the technical term has to move a larger distance

guess,bits,code,point
so my guess would be that that chars requires more than 16 bits so it would need to be treated as an int code point

smaller,input,variables
since chars is smaller than int the input will overwrite the variables which is why x has the wrong value

indices,conversion,harder,index,number,3rd,sentence
the indices to int conversion is harder i need to split the index 4.5 get the number of chars in the 3rd sentence and add up 5

bigger,space
int is bigger has more space than chars

link,comparison,faster,yield
as the so link in your question suggests int comparison is faster than chars comparison and yield faster fetch

systems,size,greater
the firs one is more common and works on all systems where the size of an int is greater than the size of a chars

bigger,memory,area,pick,values,random,value
an int is a bigger memory area than a chars and when you read you ll pick up other values beside the chars and end up with an effectively random value

php,maximum,value,bits,mine
php int maximum value is about 32 bits mine is no more than 5 chars

version,string,zero,end,max,zeroes
if the int turns out to be 38 i need the version string to come out as 380 only one zero was added to the end of the int because i wanted a max of three chars and if the int is less than three chars zeroes will be added to make it three

symbol,word,different,string,number,higher
if an symbol along with a random word is detected while being read i want to drop the symbol and replace the word with the int 16 and if a different string of chars is being used along with the symbol i want to set the number 1 higher than int 16

sequencenumber,type,likely,larger,values
as mentioned in other posts senderid and sequencenumber are both of type int which is likely to be larger than chars so these values will be truncated

array,lower,memory,address,variable
the chars array has a lower memory address than the int i variable

number,space,odd
an even number of chars s followed by an int may well therefore take up less space than a chars followed by an int followed by an odd number of chars s

type,smaller,values
the chars type is smaller than int and hence can represent less values than int can

alphabet,number,greater,length,string
when i add any alphabet in the int number or int number is greater than 4 chars in length the string match should fail but it is not failing

narrower,lower-order,bits
converting to chars assuming a chars is narrower than an int will keep the lower-order bits and lower-order bits are lower-order bits no matter how they are stored in memory

higher,precedence,sql,server,cast
int has a higher precedence than chars so sql server cast - to int implicitly here

bigger,suitable,calculations
int is usually bigger than chars â more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation

value,sizeof
the value sizeof chars is less than sizeof int

string,values,correct,text,greater
it allows string and int values which is correct but i want to require my text to be greater than 4 chars long

c,nothing,alias,no-op
you should consider that in c a chars is nothing more than an alias of an int so casting a chars to int is a no-op

senderid,sequencenumber,sizeof,bytes,architectures
senderid and sequencenumber are both int and will take up more than sizeof chars bytes on most architectures

least,8-bit,higher,precision
1 at least for 8-bit chars s signed chars s or int s with higher precision than chars so virtually always

comparisons,efficient,simpler,unicode
because int comparisons are more efficient and simpler than unicode chars comparisons

possibility,system,bits,wide,wider,constant,notations,values
this creates the possibility that even on a system where chars is only 8 bits wide and so int is wider than chars chars constant notations can exist which provide int values wider than chars

system,bigger,range,compiler
on my system int is bigger than chars and chars is -128 to 128 so assigning a chars with an int outside that range gives a compiler warning

bigger,domain
5 is an int which represents a bigger domain than chars

1---------------------------------------------------

storage
if i remember correctly int take up less storage than chars so you should go with int

num,better,first,overload
this means that num to chars is now better than num to int so the first overload is now a better match and should be selected

field,storage
a chars 3 field also uses less storage than an int

const,version,better,surprising
it seems that the const int version is better optimized than the and the even more surprising const chars version

field,better,bet
well then an int field may just be a better bet than a chars 50

designers,c,main,argv,better
the designers of c thought int main int argv chars argv looked better than main int argv chars argv int

function,valid,better,match
the sfinae protected function will be preferred if it is valid because int is a better match than chars for 0

first,second,digit
that means that first chars will be 0 if there wouldn t be anything there int is less then 10 and second chars is digit

problem,const,struct,productname-string,annoying
though i m having a problem where a const int within the struct basically is cutting off the productname-string if it has more than 32 chars which is quite annoying

2---------------------------------------------------

im,issue,program,lenght
however im encountering an issue were if the int entered is more than 10 chars long the program will still say that the lenght is 10

program,name,arrays
this program is designed to take an int and a name of less than 15 chars and store them in arrays

other---------------------------------------------------

int_max
it s an int and you cannot print more than int_max chars that way

use,else
if the int s can be more than 1 chars use this else see below simplification

operations
naturally using chars would result in more operations than int

smaller,true,rare,c1,c2,difference,range,type
if chars is smaller than int which is true on all but some rare embedded systems this difference can be computed with a simple subtraction both c1 and c2 being promoted to int and this difference is guaranteed to fit in the range of type int

volume,rows,code,primary,key,room,performance,difference
for lookup tables with a low volume of rows you can use a 3 chars code as the primary key as this takes less room than an int but the performance difference is negligible

conversion,builtin,types,binary-and,likely,faster,python,c
i think the conversion to builtin int types for the binary-and operation is likely to make it much faster than working chars by chars because python s int is written in c rather than python

hardware,platforms,types,faster,selection,trade-off,range,sufficient,sense
on some hardware platforms it might turn out that int types work faster than chars types so the selection of the specific type becomes a speed-vs-memory trade-off but once again in many cases when the range of chars is naturally sufficient it might make more sense to use chars instead of int

setter,script,space,.c,file
this data setter script is generated automatically i chose to do it int by int to take less space than chars by chars in my .c file

support,constants,descriptive,procedure,views
since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants

work,short,numbers,possibility,overflow,integral,promotion,smaller,sizes,expressions,truncation
update the reason why int doesn t work in oppose to chars and short is because that when both numbers are added there is a possibility of overflow regardless of being int short or chars while not forgetting integral promotion but because short and chars are with smaller sizes than int and because they are promoted to int in expressions they are represented again without truncation in this line

chat,works,unicode,backend,smaller,version
now why chat to int works because every chars is represented as unicode in java so you can think of it as at backend chars is a smaller version of int


so int that are less than 12 chars are just written normally

naive,deal,hash,base
my original solution was naive - it didn t deal with the case when the int hash is less than 100 base 36 - meaning it would print less than 3 chars

buffer,cv,mat,unsigned,elements,values,fourth,element,larger,machine
you are using int buffer to initialize cv mat with unsigned chars elements that explains why values are written at each fourth element int seems to be 4 times larger than unsigned chars on your machine

auto,longer,lexer,work
auto is one chars longer than int so the lexer definitely has to do more work

set,strings,larger,number,hashcode,calculation,collisions,short
the set of strings of 1 or 2 chars is therefore larger than the number of int and any hashcode calculation methodology will produce collisions for strings that are 1 or 2 chars long which qualify as short strings i suppose

data,overflow,implementation,-128
however an int can hold a lot more data than a chars can this is going to give you a warning about overflow and you should listen to it depending on the implementation chars holds -128 to 127 where as int holds âˆ 2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647

decimal-formatted,32-bit
for example if the string is going to store a decimal-formatted 32-bit int you know that you do not need more than 11 chars to do so

main,shorter,non,white-space,concise,valid
i see absolutely no reason to write it like this since int main is shorter 9 non white-space chars vs 15 concise and perfectly valid code

unspecified,signed-ness,value,size,operations,plain,unsigned,others,natural
plain chars having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extends a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain chars unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain chars gets implements as signed

ipv6,address,small,positive,network,interface,reality,bigger
as indicated a standard ipv6 address is at most 45 chars but an ipv6 address can also include an ending followed by a scope or zone string which has no fixed length but is generally a small positive int or a network interface name so in reality it can be bigger than 45 chars

better,tinyint,others,store,male,female
some suggests storing it in int is better but other suggests tinyint and enum but some others suggests store it in a chars 1 m for male and f for female

paragraph,stricter,alignment,round,trip
5.2.10 paragraph 7 says that assuming int has a stricter alignment than chars then the round trip of to to generates an unspecified value for the resulting

second,thing,capable,full,range,unsigned,values,implementation
the second case does the same thing since a signed int is more than capable of holding the full range of unsigned chars values in this implementation

problem,numbers,easier,goal,users,large,digits
this package and my answer here may not solve your problem because reading the numbers directly as chars is an easier way to achieve your goal but i thought i might post this anyway as an information for users who may need to use large int with more than 22 digits

modulo
and to prevent having int with more than 7 chars modulo can be used like this

precedence
as int is having more precedence over chars will be converted to int

linux,gcc,similar,faster,difference,pronounced
running the same test on linux with gcc similarly pegs int and long as similar and both faster than chars although the difference is less pronounced

pathname,arbitrary,id,lower,bits,unique,key_t
it takes a pathname and an arbitrary int id uses only lower 8 bits so a chars is usually used and generates a probably unique key_t

32-bit,decimal,optional,particular,example
for example a 32-bit int won t take up more than 11 chars to represent in decimal with an optional sign so your particular example won t need more than 44 chars unless i miscounted

counter,map,frequency
if the same chars appears more than once i put a counter on it and place it back into the map incrementing the int frequency

computational,steps,value,digit,memory,values,place,string,number,variables,whole
it will take more lines of code but it will likely still work out faster than tostring ing each number as that requires more computational steps to determine the chars value for each digit and put them together and less memory as int values can be operated on more or less in place so instead of needing a string for every number you need three int variables for the whole loop

silly,16-bit,instructions,8-bit
it seems pretty silly that your presumably 16-bit int takes more than twice as many instructions as an 8-bit chars

startindex,length,chunks
string.substring int startindex int length might help if you need to split into chunks of more than one chars

drawback,divider,line,shorter,longest
it has one drawback but i believe it s ok with the question as it compute an int divider to make line shorter than 80 chars the longest line is shorter than 80 chars not exactly 80 chars

last,thing,equivalent,actual,value,unimportant
the last thing that you need to know is that whatever the int equivalent of the chars 1 is the actual value is unimportant it is 1 more than the int equivalent for 0

mean,id
i thought does that mean id can be any int between -128 and 127 no more than 4 chars

meaning,necessary,codes,ascii,length,code,smaller,id,column,bytes,bigint
you always have to consider that the id column has any meaning or is it really necessary if you have chars codes using only ascii chars with less than 4 chars length the code will be smaller than the int id column int is stored on 4 bytes bigint on 8 bytes

first,part,fine,easier,need,string
it worked in this case in my first part with chars i tried to look at my first part which works fine and i noticed that chars is easier to convert to int basically i don t need to convert it but with string it doesn t work this way i tried to google it but i can t find proper solution


writes should be a int which can only contain 0 to 9 and be less than 10 chars


this assumes that your int will never be more than 10 chars long

program,aware,unsigned,loss,information,narrower,type,implementations
make this change and your program will run but be aware that casting an int to an unsigned chars might lead to loss of information as the unsigned chars is a narrower type than the int in most implementations


an int can be more than one chars

certain,sense,abstract,data,type,short,sure
in a certain sense int is a more abstract data type than chars short long or long long as you cannot be sure about the bitwidth
