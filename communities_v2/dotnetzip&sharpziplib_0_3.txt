easier,example,files
dotnetzip is much easier to use than sharpziplib example of zipping all files in folder

extraction,smaller,kb,permissive
i used it because it is small 6 kb compiled with just the extraction making it far smaller than dotnetzip which is more than 150 kb and is more permissive than sharpziplib

native,support,opinion,flexible
dotnetzip offers native support and has a quite friendly api and is my opinion more flexible than sharpziplib
