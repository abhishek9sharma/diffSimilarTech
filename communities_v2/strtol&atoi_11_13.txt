better,error
strtol is better than atoi with better error handling

instance,better,time,strtok
for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null

use,better,error,reporting
use strtol it does better error reporting than atoi

checking,errno,better
all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case so avoid using atoi

better,error,handling,sscanf
i would recommend strtol which provides better error handling than atoi or sscanf

better,option,failures
besides strtol is a better option than atoi as strtol can handle failures better

c,function,better,habit
the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi

better,error,checking
you can also look into strtol which is better than using atoi in terms of error checking

digit,number,better,failures
if you want to accept a number rather than a digit and only a number strtol works much better than atoi as it allows you to check for failures

error,check,better,errors
you need to error check strtol and ensure there are as many passed before using them -- strtol is better than atoi as helps detect errors

other---------------------------------------------------

better
you can also use strtol which is obviously better than atoi

buffer,human-readable,text,value,note,powerful,long,int
i start off calling gets to fill the buffer then using strtol to convert the human-readable text in buffer to an actual computer int value - note that strtol is more powerful than atoi and uses long int instead of int as its declared type

strtof,atof,former,errors,flexible,non-base-10
i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10
