structure,algorithm,susceptible,attacks,properties
the structure of the hmac algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying hash algorithm

faster,better,term,security,function,sha1
after looking it s seems that hmac is much faster and better in term of security even if the underlying hash function sha1 is broken which is not the case when using rsa-sha1

platforms,fast,function,available,efficient
in some cases on embedded platforms where a fast hash function may not be available these may be more efficient than hmac

better,plain,vulnerable,length,extension
hmac is better than a plain hash because it is not vulnerable to hash length extension attacks
