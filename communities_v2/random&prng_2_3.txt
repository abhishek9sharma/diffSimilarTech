seed,good,non-cryptographic,output,structure
then you use it as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and its output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker

large,period,memory,internal,state,time,number,complex
but a large period prng takes up more memory for maintaining the internal state and also takes more time for generating a random number due to complex transitions and post processing

non-random,behaviour,reflection,quality,rand,good
the non-random random behaviour is more a reflection on the quality of the rand prng Ã¢ it is often not very good
