better,methodology,multiple,guess
also note that keydown is better for this methodology as keyup will fire multiple times though i guess this will too.

stick,example,better
they have their differences better stick to one i prefer for this example to use keydown just plays better with me you can use keyup

1---------------------------------------------------

right,events,value,field
then the right events to do it is keyup more than keydown since the value isn t yet in the field at this moment or on change

events,numpad5,numpad6,earlier,event
as you can see the keyup events of numpad5 and numpad6 occured earlier than their keydown event

2---------------------------------------------------

little,better,element,key
edit keydown is a little better than keyup for the element bind now enter key fails silently-ish

event,better,opinion,button,code
also if you notice i ve changed the keyup event to keydown which is better in my opinion cause when the user holds their finger down on a button the code wouldn t be fired if it is on the keyup event

other---------------------------------------------------

preferable,multiple,user
keyup is more preferable than keydown because keydown may occur multiple times if user keeps it pressed

test,smoother,transition
in my test keyup gives a smoother transition as compared to keydown

rules,second,earlier,first,timer,multiple
the events seem to not follow strict sequential rules second keydown comes earlier than first keyup so the timer gets initialized multiple times

input,sense,previous,value
also note that using keyup or input makes far more sense than keydown otherwise the previous value will only be evaluated on the next event occurrence
