json,fields,json-encodable,pairs,faster,compact
json jsonb fields support any json-encodable data type not just key value pairs but also tend to be faster and for jsonb more compact than hstore

gin,index,expensive,equivalent,faster,seq,use
i admit that gin index on hstore is much more expensive than its equivalent for jsonb but even then it is faster to just do seq scan on hstore than use index on jsonb
