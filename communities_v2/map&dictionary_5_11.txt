std,operations,slower,size,large
std map though is actually implemented in a way that many operations are slower than dictionary as its size gets large

python,std,worse,algorithmic,optimisations,user
i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations andâ in at least some implementationsâ leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has

1---------------------------------------------------

reverse,functionality,key,common,value
data structure to implement reverse functionality of a dictionary that is more than one key map to a common value using python

difference,vector,array,key,value
the difference between a map and vector is a like an array while a map is more a dictionary of key value pairs

other---------------------------------------------------

immutable,implementation,faster,pure,usage
the immutable dictionary implementation is faster but no less pure in usage than the map implementation

c++,std,python,defaultdict
c++ std map behaves more like a python defaultdict than dictionary

better,shared,entries,inconsistent
map is slightly better because the shared dictionary has around 480 entries instead of around 450 but it s still inconsistent and not all 500 as expected

data,structure,similar,c#
i know this question is a bit older but in es2015 there is a new data structure called map that is much more similar to a dictionary that you would use in c#

large,examples,constant,factor,slower,std,operations,lookup
for suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which it s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc

word,better
if what you are making is a map from one word to another you might be better off with a dictionary

hint,fixmap,data,type,c#,key-value,pairs
using this hint we can try to guess that a fixmap must correspond to a dictionary data type in c# since a map is more or less like a dictionary of key-value pairs
