simpler,format,xml,options,nested
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested

spring,powerful,shiro,users,full
because spring s xml config is slightly more powerful than shiro s ini spring users are encouraged to use full spring config instead of shiro ini

similar,simpler,plain,text
it is similar to incron however config uses a simpler to read ini file instead of a plain text file

manual,better
if you intend manual config it s probably better to choose something else for example ini

purposes,todays,json,logical,mind
i like that ini is more for config purposes but with todays interest in json it seems more logical for the config be designed with json in mind

arrays,complex,faster,files
since json can store arrays i can create quite complex config with it and it parses faster than ini files
