function,portable,ifnull
the coalesce function is used here because it is more portable than nvl or ifnull

efficient,second,argument,first,null,arguments,time
coalesce is more efficient than nvl as it only evaluates the second argument if the first is null whereas nvl evaluates both arguments every time

standard,function,simpler
the ansi standard function coalesce is simpler than using nvl and decode which should be obsoleted anyway

arguments,data,type,stricter,implicit,conversion
2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion
