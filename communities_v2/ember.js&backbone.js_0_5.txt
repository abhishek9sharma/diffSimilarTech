heavy,weight,approach,contrast
i already know that ember.js is a more heavy weight approach in contrast to backbone.js

hand,new,package,complete,imo
but on the other hand although new the ember.js package is actually more complete imo than backbone.js

things,simpler
ember.js would make things even simpler than backbone.js

ways,confusing,code,standard,important,prototyping,wealth,examples,available
both give you the ability to implement things in a variety of ways which can be confusing but ember.js provides more of the code that you would have to write yourself in backbone.js as standard which for me personally is more important for rapid prototyping than the wealth of backbone.js examples available

larger,thanks,cache-control
ember.js is larger than backbone.js but thanks to expires cache-control this only matters on the the first load
