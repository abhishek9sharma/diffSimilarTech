experiments,discussion,slower,batched,2d
in the experiments and discussion below i find that cufft is slower than fftw for batched 2d ffts

problem,sizes,slower,openmp
however for a variety of fft problem sizes i ve found that cufft is slower than fftw with openmp

time,efficient,purpose,fft,slower,cpu,line
i am working on a code which needs to be time efficient and thus using cufft for this purpose but when i try to compute fft of a very large data in parallel it is slower than cpu fftw and the reason i find after finding the time for every line of code using high precision timing code is that cudamalloc taking around 0.983 sec while the time for rest of the lines of code is around 0.00xx sec which is expected ..
