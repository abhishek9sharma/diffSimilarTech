efficient,space,waste
use a dawg which is more efficient than a trie in terms of space waste

better,memory,expensive,difficult
a dawg has better memory performance if the strings have many common suffixes but they are more expensive and difficult to build and update so start with a trie

similar,space-efficient,efficient,prefixes
it is a structure similar to but twice as space-efficient as the dawg that is more efficient than the trie which only compresses prefixes
