testdriven.net,instrumentation,faster
the best testdriven.net disables all instrumentation that mstest does so it makes mstest blazing fast - much faster than nunit for example

faster
nunit is faster as compared to mstest

experience,slower
from my experience mstest is much slower than nunit

1---------------------------------------------------

suspect,faster,loading,delays
thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar

test,speeds,faster
nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases nunit is faster and in other cases mstest is faster

other---------------------------------------------------

edition,inbuilt,better,cruise,control
if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest

better,support,parameterized,tests
nunit has better support for parameterized tests than mstest

methods
for example nunit offers more assert methods than mstest

various,better,idea,good
various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using

sriwantha,simpler,framework
sriwantha mstest is a simpler framework than nunit
