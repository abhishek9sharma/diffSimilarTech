quicker,slower,deserializing
the serializable seems quicker but deserialization much slower and the app is doing more deserializing than serializing

code,counterpart
i ve reworked it slightly so that the deserialization code looks more like its serializable counterpart

externalizable,control,process
you ll need to implement serializable to have java handle the serializable or externalizable if you need more control over the deserialization process

check-out,json.net,options,better,control,process
side note check-out the json.net serializable which gives more options and better control over the deserialization process

attribute,property,faster
if the taskproperty class is decorated with datacontract attribute and with datamember attribute for each property the deserialization is much faster than when it is decorated with serializable attribute

harder
deserialization is harder than serializable

issue,c#,.net,stream,multiple,longer,equal
i have an issue with serializable in c# .net where if i serializable in one stream multiple references to a same object these references are no longer equal after deserialization
