sensor,accurate
so after googling this i found that using gyroscope sensor is more accurate than the accelerometer

sensor,accurate,function
also i have tried the accelerometer sensor and it worked but i m asking to check whether the gyroscope is more accurate to this function or the accelerometer

better,option
i want to use accelerometer but i learnt that gyroscope is better option to calculate the accelerometer

power,analysis,higher
gyroscope consumes more power than accelerometer based on my analysis its 4-6 times higher
