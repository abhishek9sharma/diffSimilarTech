good,options,libc++,static,features,compatible,gnu,stl,issue,optimizer,segfault
good options are llvm libc++ static library fewer features more compatible with clang and gnu stl static library more features i had an issue that required me to turn the clang optimizer to -oz to prevent a segfault

code,faster,frontend,accurate
llvm compiles code faster than gcc may create code that runs faster and the clang frontend provides more accurate error messages than gcc Ã¢ so there are definitely reasons for switching

fiber,apple,use,thread_local,better,standard,abi
first fiber won t compile with apple clang because of the use of thread_local which apple does not support according to what i found online they think they can implement it better than standard llvm and don t want to introduce it only to break abi later
