lower,learning,curve
codeigniter has the lower learning curve overall so i would recommend it over cakephp

view,lighter,judge
in my view cakephp seems much more lighter then codeigniter but i never used either one so i can t judge

suspect,flexible,structure,smaller,lighter,quick,look,manual,behaviors
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

harder,new,mvc
why do people say cakephp is somewhat harder than codeigniter for people new to mvc

complicated
i have been reading about cakephp but it seems a bit more complicated than codeigniter

newer,feature,rich,heavier,smaller,footprint,likely,functionality,cake
cakephp is newer more feature rich and heavier than codeigniter codeigniter is designed to have a much smaller footprint so you will most likely find yourself creating functionality in codeigniter to match cake s

opinion,easier,someone,experienced,wrong
in my opinion it will probably be easier to integrate with codeigniter although someone more experienced with cakephp might prove me wrong

slower,speed
cakephp is considered slower than codeigniter but you can tweak it to enhance speed

heavy,framework,least,lighter,zend
i personally use codeigniter which probably falls in to the heavy framework category but is at least much lighter than cakephp and lighter than zend too i think
