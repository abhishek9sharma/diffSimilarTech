values,folder
as mdpi is less than hdpi so it will take the values from the folder which is least below it in you case it is values which is applicable to all

version,button,bigger,baseline
ideally the hdpi version of your button should be 1.5 times bigger than the mdpi baseline version

image,folder,larger
and you know your image at hdpi folder so its 1.5 larger than the mdpi

computer,monitor,resources,larger
for example mdpi is basically 72dpi as your computer monitor hdpi resources should be around 1.5 times larger than mdpi resources and so forth

dp,unit,device,larger
example if using dp unit hdpi device will have 1.5 240 160 times larger than mdpi

layout-sw320dp-land,drawable,folder,layout-sw720dp-land,device,drawables,smaller
layout-sw320dp-land will pick up drawable from hdpi folder whereas layout-sw720dp-land is mdpi device so it will pick up drawables from mdpi folder which will be smaller than hdpi

images,folder,appearance,smaller,ldpi
when you put images into hdpi folder their appearance is smaller than from mdpi and ldpi

screens,smaller
ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

pixel,sizes,smaller,images
images in these different folders should have different physical pixel sizes mdpi has smaller images than hdpi but the images pixel densities aren t used

other---------------------------------------------------

graphic,ldpi,size
first of all if you anyhow provide a hdpi graphic adding an mdpi and ldpi graphic which both are less than the hdpi graphic in size there is approximately 3 4 6 scaling ratio will increase the size but far from triple it more close to double

closest,match,closer
the system will pick the closest match and mdpi is closer to hdpi than to xxhdpi
