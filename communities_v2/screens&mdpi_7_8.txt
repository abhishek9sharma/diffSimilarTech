drawable,ldpi,xhdpi,image,shorter,width
i have used this link to generate nine-patch images however even if i add the files to the drawable ldpi mdpi ldpi xhdpi and xxhdpi folders the image is still shorter than the screens width

issue,phone,smaller,layout,res
addressing issue #2 if your mdpi phone has a smaller screens than 600dp it will use the layout in res layout folder

high,density,smaller,hdpi
ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

hdpi,taller
proportionally the hdpi screens is slightly taller than the mdpi screens

density,xhdpi,ldpi,48x48,72x72,hdpi
if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

1---------------------------------------------------

scales,images,resolution,bigger
i read in some tutorials that android automatically scales up the images when the screens resolution is bigger than mdpi

size,larger,common,sizes,text
since the screens size is larger than the common mdpi screens sizes 320x480 the text size looks smaller in this emulator

device,destiny,default,values
if device screens destiny is more than mdpi - use default values folder
