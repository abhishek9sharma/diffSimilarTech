part,equation,segment,numbers,larger,smaller,medians..
so the t 7n 10 is the part of continuing the equation with the max segment of numbers that is larger smaller than the median of medians..

first,k,heap,min,greater,pointers,heapify
so after calculating median of first k elements delete the first element directly from heap min or max according to whether it is greater or less than median using pointers and then use heapify at that position

number,elements,greater
therefore the max number of elements you could have that are greater than or less than the median of median is 3 10 + 2 10 + 2 10 7 10
