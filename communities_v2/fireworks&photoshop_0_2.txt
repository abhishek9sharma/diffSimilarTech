easier,time,class,objects,combination,vector
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill

cs3,windows,familiar
i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks
