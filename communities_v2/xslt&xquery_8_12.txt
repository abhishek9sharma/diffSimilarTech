class,problems,better
i hate to answer a request for a solution in language a by suggesting a solution in language b but what you are doing here falls into the class of problems which xslt handles much better than xquery

proof,pudding,better,queries
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries

xml,documents,streaming,better
saxon-ee supports streaming of large xml documents using xslt or xquery streaming is better supported in xslt than in xquery

1---------------------------------------------------

kind,processing,expressive
this kind of processing is most easily done with xslt which is more expressive than xquery

appropriate,kind,tasks
xslt is significantly more appropriate to use than xquery for such kind of tasks

2---------------------------------------------------

amenable,static,analysis,dynamic,template
xquery is more amenable to static analysis than xslt because it lacks the very dynamic template despatch mechanism

better,amenable,static,analysis,polymorphism,template,rules
xquery works better than xslt for this because it s more amenable to static analysis as it lacks the polymorphism of xslt s template rules

other---------------------------------------------------

dimitre,better,class,problem
as dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquery

typing,feature
unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

small,changes,solution,simpler
if your output is going to be similar to your input with small changes then the xslt solution is often a lot simpler than the xquery solution

banal,better,transformation,source,document,query
generally i know it sounds banal xslt is better at transformation generating a new document from each source document while xquery is better at query extracting a small amount of information from each source document

usual,rule-of-thumb,better,simple,tasks,complex
my usual rule-of-thumb is that xquery is better than xslt for simple tasks whereas xslt is better for complex tasks
