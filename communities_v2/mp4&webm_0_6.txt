faster,standard,familiar,format
probably webm will load faster than standard mp4 but i am not so familiar with webm format

implementation,fallback,browsers
the mp4 implementation is more widely used and wouldn t require a webm fallback in most browsers

robust,place
webm is usually more robust than mp4 which can be all over the place

little,better
the ogv version of the video seems to run a little better than the webm which itself seems to run better than the mp4

file,size,smaller,larger,original
i tried mp4 and webm and sometimes the file size after i convert to mp4 is smaller than webm but it is also sometimes larger than the original file size

faster
also it looks like when i transcode webm to mp4 2.7 is 30 faster than webm
