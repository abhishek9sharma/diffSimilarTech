margin-left,smaller,16px,effect
you can remove the transform s and the margin-left and add a width set as 0 here smaller than the font-size 16px here to the get the effect

query,screen,h2,item,class,3rem,red
the first media query says that if the screen width is less than 992px the h2 in the item class should have a font-size of 3rem should be red and should have an underline

value,increment,string,wider,element
i initialize the loop with this value and increment the font-size with 1 until the string is wider than the width of the containing element

fittext,time,greater,exact
when you are using fittext at that time if the font-size is greater than 100px than you have to set the exact width as per your font-size

part,string,line,wider,increases
from there on the width slowly increases again as the part of the string still on line 1 linearly gets wider as the font-size increases

text,larger,noisy,lines
as you can see the font-size of the text is bit larger than the width of the noisy lines
