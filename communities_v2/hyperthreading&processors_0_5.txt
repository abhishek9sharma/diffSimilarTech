modern,better,older
more modern processors handle hyperthreading better than older processors

code,large,amounts,memory
you may find that hyperthreading helps more on code that is using large amounts of memory so that the processors is regularly blocked on fetching from memory

first,step,simultaneous,multithreading,poorer,performances,technology
first step would be to investigate why a processors with hyperthreading simultaneous multithreading could lead to poorer performances than a processors without this technology

intel,cpu,physical,cores,logical
a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

number,total,virtual,physical,â,greater
in computer 1 the eigen3 performance is worse because the number of total processors virtual + physical - â due to hyperthreading is greater than the number of physical processors
