language,familiar,heavy,complex
to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py

focus,simple,better,complex,explicit
web2py has more focus on simple is better than complex but django has more focus on explicit is better than implicit

conveniences,environment,newer,hindsight,easier
i prefer web2py because there are more conveniences built into the environment than offered by django but web2py is much newer than django and hindsight always makes it easier make new implementations better

lower,initial,learning,curve,tool
having said that web2py has a lower initial learning curve than django as it was specifically designed as a learning tool

anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails
