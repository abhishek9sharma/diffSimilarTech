0---------------------------------------------------

dependencies,easier,conifrtable
i think updating dependencies with maven is pretty easier than dealing with ant but of course you could select the other way if you feel more conifrtable

ivy,better,difficult
i also find ant with ivy to be better documented than maven although that s not too difficult

internal,dependencies,jar,earlier
can maven examine and resolve internal dependencies of non-mavenized jar library defined earlier by ant

things,better,plugin,difficult
however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven

similar,nature,better,c#
this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java

system,architect,better,projects
trust me i did this before for another job where the system architect decided that maven was better than ant and all of our projects must be converted from ant to maven

modern,tools,gradle,feature
ant pre-dates more modern tools like maven and gradle that have this feature baked in

better,alternative,system
maven is a better alternative as build system compared to ant

better,big,projects
maven is definitely better than ant and well used for big projects

gradle,freedom,easier
you can take a look on gradle which for me could provide more freedom than maven but is easier to use than ant

better,dependencies,ant+ivy,build
maven is better for managing dependencies but ant is ok with them too if you use ant+ivy and build artefacts

better,job,dependencies,build.xml,files
and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

solution,better,dependencies
while you can munge together a solution with ant maven is a better solution for managing dependencies than ant

better,tool,long,run
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2

size,jar,bigger
the size of maven jar is bigger then ant jar i don t know why help me please

better,integration,flex
maven definitely has better integration with flex than ant

file,operations,better,bet
if you want to stick to lower level basic file operations ant is better bet than maven

1---------------------------------------------------

script
maven can t be compared with ant as in maven vs ant maven is more than a build script than ant is

script,.class,files
1 - why ant script generates more .class files than maven

2---------------------------------------------------

p2,repository,simpler,tycho,projects
so i suggest you build a p2 repository can be done in ant but seems simpler in maven tycho and split the projects to several repositories

simpler,older,default,project,newer,powerful
ant is simpler and older and the default just called a java project maven is newer more powerful and flexible

projects,different,directory,structure,spring,source
also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial

3---------------------------------------------------

older,number,projects,ground
ant is older and while it is still used in a number of projects it is rapidly losing ground to maven

number,dependencies,similar,tool,sophisticated
a hood technique is to tag milestone releases of your projects giving then a version number and then manage dependencies with maven or a similar tool a bit more sophisticated than ant

other---------------------------------------------------

scripting,tool,structure,lifecycle
since ant is more of a scripting tool and doesn t impose structure or lifecycle like maven and gradle you simply manually invoke ant when you want to use it

alternate,tools,configuration,gradle,conventions,verbose
alternate build tools ant lots of configuration gradle conventions again less verbose than maven

complex
does this make ant more complex than maven

guess,version
i guess that the maven version contains much more than the ant version

quotation,fair
the quotation you brought up just claim that maven does more than ant so that it s not fair to compare the two

different,real,point,dependency,management
but maven and ant are so different that there is no real point at comparing them and maven is still much more than ant + dependency management

concept
maven is more or less an update concept of ant

older,core,support
first of all ant is older than maven and therefore does not include core support for dependency management

powerful,respects,excels,dependency
ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment

clearer
i find the ant one much clearer than the maven one

source,repo,preferred,powerful
but as i checked-out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant

jacoco,tasks,freedom,plugin,specification
in jacoco 0.7.9 there are jacoco ant tasks and in 0.8.0 there will be jacoco command line interface - both provide more freedom than jacoco maven plugin in specification of what should be included into report in particular can be used for arbitrary third-party jar files

alive
did maven has achieved more then ant or ant is still alive

usage,lower
maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known

higher,level,c++,tool,build.xml
maven is higher level than make makefile the classic c c++ build tool or ant build.xml

preference,flexible,development,style
i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well

reliable,non-core,plugins
troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins

slower,multi-module,projects,sort,project,ide,faster,builds
also note that while maven is no slower than ant for multi-module projects of this sort importing your maven project into an ide will generally result in far faster builds than maven can perform itself

powerful
i know maven is more powerful than ant

replacement,gnu,primary,buildout
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application

meta-program,scripts,junit
maven is more of a meta-program that can use ant scripts and run your junit tests

younger,tool,time,maturity
first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications

replacement
maven is more like a replacement for ant
