methodology,training,optimizers,faster
more than this methodology i would suggest to you to do the training directly in keras as it claimed that keras optimizers are 5-10 times faster than tensorflow s optimizers

faster,slower,training
is keras faster slower than tensorflow during training

other---------------------------------------------------

gpu,memory,equivalent,model,training
is keras consumes more gpu memory than equivalent tensorflow model training

simpler,quicker,models,performance,cost,engine
keras provides a simpler quicker way to build and train models in tensorflow at no performance cost since the models are still being run by the same tensorflow engine
