smaller
jpg or png should get you smaller than tiff

â,bit,better
tiff â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than png

today,popular,files,data,store,common,need
today png is much more popular than tiff so if you re writing files outside of your own data store png would be a more common choice and you d need to work through nsimagerep to get there

compression,file,size,larger
the resulting png compression may produce a file size larger than your tiff compression

file,approach,smaller,size,guess
the resulting file from this png approach is smaller in size than a tiff file and i guess may rescale better
