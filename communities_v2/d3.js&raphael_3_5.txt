older,browsers,brother
this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at raphael which is snaps older brother d3.js is very well established as well

older,versions,current,web
raphael supports older versions of ie whereas d3.js is based on current web standards

other---------------------------------------------------

place,fallback,older,versions,current,web
the only place where raphael defeats d3.js is fallback raphael supports older versions of ie where as d3.js is based on current web standards ie 9

better,processing,viable
as it stands d3.js is not just better than raphael and processing in many cases but is also a viable replacement for jquery underscore.js and other frameworks

harder,svg,able
d3.js is much harder to learn than raphael but in both cases you will also have to learn svg to be able to create better animations
