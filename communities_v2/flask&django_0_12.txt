application,bottle,comfortable,batteries
i m building an application in both bottle and flask to see which i am more comfortable with as django is too much batteries included

great,smaller,community,extensions
flask has a really great albeit smaller than django community and there are a lot of extensions available for common web-app extensions in the extensions directory

beginner,better,educational,time,oscar
i read that flask for beginner is better than django because educational reasons at the same time django have django oscar

use,mongodb,first,place,better,integration,mongoengine
but if the use of mongodb is a must then i suggest that you reconsider using django in the first place because mongodb has a better integration with flask through mongoengine

simplicity,functionality
flask is more focused on simplicity instead of functionality while django has more functionality

bottle,preference,faster,lightweight
either will do the trick but bottle or in my preference flask will be faster as it is much more lightweight than django

friend,simpler,complicated
but a friend told me to begin with flask as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning django as django is more complicated than flask

frameworks,easy,easier,imo,authentication,layer
both frameworks are fairly easy to implement flask is much easier than django imo although django has a built in authentication layer that you can use albeit more difficult to implement in a client server scenario like you need

latter,micro,framework,smaller
if you are looking for the latter then flask is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than django

current,task,smaller,simplier
current task looks like flask is ok for it since it is smaller and simplier than django

batteries,meaning,out-of-the-box,large,part
django is very batteries included meaning that it comes with much more out-of-the-box than say flask and to me a large part of that the user auth system

team,use,frame,light,template.
our team use django as our frame before but now we use flask as our frame because it is more light than django but we still use django template.
