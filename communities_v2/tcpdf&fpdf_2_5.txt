past,better
i ve used tcpdf in the past and found it a lot better than fpdf

good,news,better,utf8,modern
somewhat good news you could move to tcpdf which is much better at handling utf8 and is more modern in general than fpdf

slower
tcpdf was always slower than fpdf

look,better
i suggest you to give a look to tcpdf which is far better than fpdf also because it is actively developed

problem,things,faster,confirmation,slower
if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf
