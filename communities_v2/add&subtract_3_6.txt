root,set,sum,cubes
to find all the pairs of integers x and y that sum to n when cubed set x to the largest integer less than the cube root of n set y to 0 then repeatedly add 1 to y if the sum of the cubes is less than n subtract 1 from x if the sum of the cubes is greater than n and output the pair otherwise stopping when x and y cross

other---------------------------------------------------

x,greater
look at it this way based on your logic while x is greater than 100 add 5 while it s greater than 500 subtract 5 .

difference,negative,2pi,greater
just take the difference and if it s negative add 2pi and then if it s greater than 2pi subtract 2pi

nodes,score,closer
we observe that for 7 nodes 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 we are getting further by 1 add 7 9-2 to the score for other 2 4 7 we are getting closer by 1 subtract 2

string,int,value,method,result,greater
provided a string i want to convert the chars from the string to an int add a value from another method getkey to this number and if the result is greater than 26 subtract 26
