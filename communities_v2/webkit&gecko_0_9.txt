memory,browser
gecko is often considered to consume less memory than webkit but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented

better,html5,single-page
somehow webkit seems to do better than gecko on the html5 single-page spec scripts and i can t figure out why at this point

browsers,operations,quicker
i m developing with canvas too and have found that webkit based browsers in general handle canvas operations quicker than gecko in most cases

understanding,good,smaller
my understanding is webkit is pretty good smaller than gecko

api,draft,prefixes,little
it s called web audio api and is currently a draft but is well supported by webkit you ll need to use prefixes and a little less by gecko

stricter
webkit is stricter than gecko

anti-aliasing
gecko seems to like anti-aliasing more than webkit

slower
anyway i just prefer not to use it because gecko is slower then webkit

easiest,better,svg,days,package
so the easiest way is to use one either webkit or gecko webkit has probably better support for svg these days plus i can t find package of gecko right now
