reg,virtual,processors,things,multiple,cores,features,higher,layers,present,today
vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s

num_threads,programme,resources,best,rare,outlier
i tried using schedule static num_threads 4 and noticed that my programme always completes in 11.5s to 11.7s always below 12s at about 320 cpu runs more consistently and uses less resources even if the best run is half a second slower than the rare outlier with hyperthreading

new,core
almost any new cpu has more than one core or if it has just one it might support hyperthreading and thus pretending it has more than one
