overall,common,uniform,radical,language
overall common lisp is much more uniform than scheme and more radical language experiments if done at all are usually embedded as a portable library rather than defining a whole new language dialect

good,language,simpler,smaller
scheme is also a good language for that purpose and it is simpler smaller than lisp

solution,better,common,interpreter,work
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work

ides,user-friendly,good
i ve also found scheme ides much more user-friendly than lisp s plt scheme is a good one

programming,environment,simpler,better,common
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp

sbcl,fast,simpler,language,common
i don t see why sbcl should be so fast - scheme is a far simpler language than common lisp

1---------------------------------------------------

gambit,smoother,access,libraries,common
however gambit scheme has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common lisp s libraries

compact,common,language
scheme is intentionally more compact than common lisp and you ll find that you can learn the language very quickly

common,approach,conservative
i ve noticed that the common lisp approach is more conservative than the approach scheme has

alphanumberics,common,characters,least
i noted that while in languages like c variable identifiers can only be alphanumberics and underscores common lisp allows many more characters to be used like and at least scheme does

older,common
scheme is older than common lisp

fewer,batteries,common
that said it is a scheme which has fewer batteries included as compared to common lisp

fewer,libraries,common
scheme has fewer libraries than common lisp

other---------------------------------------------------

series,papers,basis,practical,power,implementations,better,systems,bliss,efficient,conventional,machine
t s purpose is to test the thesis developed by steele and sussman in their series of papers about scheme that scheme may be used as the basis for a practical programming language of exceptional expressive power and that implementations of scheme could perform better than other lisp systems and competitively with implementations of programming languages such as c and bliss which are usually considered to be inherently more efficient than lisp on conventional machine architectures

counterexample,programs,faster,memory
for a counterexample i think scheme programs ran faster and used less memory than the lisp programs that preceded them mdash

common,separate,namespace,operation,verbose
common lisp has a separate namespace for functions which makes operation like this more verbose than with scheme

impression,common,stuff,education,fun
my impression common lisp is more for getting stuff done scheme is more for education and fun
