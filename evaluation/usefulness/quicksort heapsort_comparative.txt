asymptotic analysis reveals order of growth of heapsort in the worst case is big-o n logn which is better than quicksort s big-o n 2 as a worst case

however heapsort is somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quick sort

the reason heapsort is slower in practice than quicksort is due to the better locality of reference in quicksort where data elements are within relatively close storage locations
