quicksort is heapsort

heapsort has the benefit of having a worst running case of o n log n so in cases where quicksort is likely to be performing poorly mostly sorted data sets generally heapsort is much preferred

for situations where you do want max speed in most cases quicksort may be preferred over heapsort but neither may be the right answer

heapsort is o n log n guaranted what is much better than worst case in quicksort

asymptotic analysis reveals order of growth of heapsort in the worst case is big-o n logn which is better than quicksort s big-o n 2 as a worst case

the reason heapsort is slower in practice than quicksort is due to the better locality of reference in quicksort where data elements are within relatively close storage locations

to me there is a very fundamental difference between heapsort and quicksort the latter uses a recursion
