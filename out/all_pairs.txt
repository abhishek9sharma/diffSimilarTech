quicksort	mergesort	89
one can implement a version of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implement and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists

in most cases quicksort will run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer

previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort

for instance quicksort can outperform mergesort although mergesort is provably better than quicksort in the worst case

i have read that quicksort is much faster than mergesort in practise and the reason for this is the hidden constant

as for me i prefer mergesort and heapsort because i forget how actually quicksort works

to be specific the quicksort runs faster than mergesort in the first test case and loses badly in the following 9 tests

for example locality of references has influence on cache hits or misses which is the reason why quicksort performs better than mergesort

you can also see that for smaller collections quicksort is faster but then mergesort takes the lead but all of this is case specific so take your time to study all 4 algorithms

quicksort is generally regarded as mutable and may therefore be less useful in a functional setting but mergesort is generally better suited for a functional setting

be aware of the real-world impact of the so-called hidden constants too - for instance the classic quicksort algorithm is o n 2 in the worst case and o n log n on average whereas mergesort is o n log n in the worst case but quicksort will outperform mergesort in practice

it might be helpful to see why quicksort is usually faster than mergesort since if you understand the reasons you can pretty quickly find some cases where mergesort is a clear winner

i know mergesort is better since it is stable and doesn t have n 2 as worst case but i required to implement quicksort

mergesort is slightly slower than quicksort but it does not have quicksort s susceptibility to pathological cases

furthermore you ll have no clue which size it is above which mergesort will perform better on quicksort s worst case arrays as this depends on implementation issues for example one compiler may compile your code in a way that the delete operation in sort4 is very costly in terms of time and so for most reasonably sized arrays sort3 might turn out to be always faster

this is a weirdly modified mergesort where rather than recursing all the way until you get 1-length sub-arrays and only then starting to merge you recurse until the sub-array length is 1 4 of the original array length sort that with whatever sorting algo you d prefer quicksort

it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort

quicksort generally runs faster than mergesort but under some circumstances it can degrade to quadratic running time

quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.

quicksort is approximately 40 faster than mergesort on random data because of fewer data movements

it turns out that if comparisons are cheap mergesort tends to run a little faster because quicksort spends more time fiddling with pointers

mergesort - in general mergesort is consistently faster than quicksort however quicksort is done in place and doesn t require allocating memory unlike mergesort

this works just fine but i ve read native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort that there are faster options especially if your requirements meet certain conditions

compared with quicksort mergesort has less number of comparisons but larger number of moving elements

on the other hand if comparison is not a callback my experience is that quicksort outperforms mergesort by up to 25

when comparison function is a callback function like in quicksort libc implementation quicksort is slower than mergesort by 15 on random input and 30 for already sorted array for 64 bit integers

i ve looked at the question at why is quicksort better than mergesort

i would say that the quicksort is simpler for parallelizing than the mergesort

binary tree sort in particular is likely to be slower than mergesort or quicksort because of the tree-balancing overhead as well as cache access patterns.

interestingly quicksort performs more comparisons on average than mergesort - 1.44 n lg n expected for quicksort versus n lg n for mergesort

mergesort may use more space than quicksort i m not entirely sure and merge may be better for linkedlists

as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort

for the 10 tests on the same list the results should be quite the same at least all showing that quicksort is faster than mergesort or vice vesa

also note that quicksort is generally more optimal than mergesort see this as well which explains why it s taken advantage of when sorting primitives

the quicksort algorithm is faster than mergesort which is what sorted will get you when called on a sequence of objects via java.util.arrays.sort

native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort

for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort

i ran the two and while the quicksort was faster for smaller data sets 100 elements and i did verify that it works the mergesort became the quicker algorithm fairly quickly

purely in terms of the number of comparisons performed is mergesort always more efficient than quicksort

mergesort uses about 30 less comparisons than quicksort

i have been testing the practicality of openmp gnu parallel sort algorithms in the c++ standard library and have found the parallel quicksort algorithm to be significantly slower than the mergesort algorithm

the benefit of mergesort is the guaranteed o n log n run time where as quicksort can be much worse in the event of poor pivot point sampling

quicksort and mergesort is longer and seems more complicated but it is o n log n

of course you just asked for advice about sorting on stack overflow so i feel compelled to ask you if you need an in-place sort what kind of big-o performance you re looking for and then ask you to choose between quicksort introsort heapsort mergesort and stoogesort for what will work best for you

the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great

worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n

in practice it ll take longer than quicksort which is why quicksort variants are favored over mergesort in the real world

an interesting answer about this can be found at why is quicksort better than mergesort

typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

technically mergesort has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than quicksort î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case

it s not a question of is map reduce better than mergesort or quicksort because map reduce is just a tool for implementing a sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort in a parallel way

when comparing my quicksort implementation with std sort on my compiler and my implementation of mergesort i noticed an odd pattern on large data sets when operating on 64 bit integers quicksort is consistently faster than mergesort

quicksort is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than mergesort

parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place

you can pick between quicksort mergesort or heapsort

quicksort and mergesort are faster in terms of sorting and should be always used before a bubble sort

mergesort is more natural to implement for linked lists but you can do quicksort very nicely

scenarios when quicksort is worse than mergesort

however on smaller int sizes quicksort gets slower and mergesort gets faster

this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

from what i ve read i was expecting quicksort to be faster than mergesort but on my code it is not so i assume there must be a problem with my quicksort algorithm

but the test results in mac os show that quicksort always outperforms mergesort when size is big enough which makes sense to me

but it would be silly to compare quicksort and mergesort on the basis of the depth of recursion of the mergesort vs

so it is quite possible to find inputs for which mergesort outperforms quicksort

that way quicksort can reach recursive base case more quicker than mergesort

quicksort is not better than mergesort

also depending on radix sort s radix size its constant factor may be larger than quicksort s mergesort s log factor

quicksort usually is better than mergesort for two reasons

i actually just wrote a linked-list comparative sort demo program in c and arrived at a similar conclusion that mergesort will beat quicksort for most uses altho i have been told that quicksort is generally not used for linked lists anyway

quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

quicksort consistently has less recursive calls than mergesort

1- use a sorting algotithm like mergesort or quicksort has better performance with small inputs

is quicksort always better than mergesort

i do know though that quicksort has more compares but less swaps than mergesort which i learned from another stackoverflow discussion quicksort vs merge sort

quicksort is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or

that s hard to say.the worst of mergesort is n log2n -n+1 which is accurate if n equals 2 k i have already proved this .and for any n it s between n lg n - n + 1 and n lg n + n + o lg n .but for quicksort its best is nlog2n also n equals 2 k .if you divide mergesort by quicksort it equals one when n is infinite.so it s as if the worst case of mergesort is better than the best case of quicksort why do we use quicksort

i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this

quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

why is quicksort better than mergesort

quicksort has a bad worst case while mergesort is always o n log n guaranteed but typical quicksort implementations are faster than mergesort in practice

quicksort has better locality of reference than mergesort which means that the accesses performed in quicksort are usually faster than the corresponding accesses in mergesort

normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort

insertion sort for example has an average time-complexity of o n 2 worse than quicksort or mergesort but as an online algorithm it can efficiently sort a list of values as they are received as user input where most other algorithms can only efficiently operate on a complete list of values

depending on where i look people say quicksort is faster than mergesort due to its locality of reference cache hits etc

although quicksort runs in quadratic time as compared to mergesort which runs in linear-log time quicksort is usually faster in practice

given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort

i ve seen plenty of questions asking whether quicksort or mergesort is better and when to use each of them but what i d like to see is some input on when to use them with regard to the size of the data being sorted


jdom	dom4j	9
it compares jdom dom4j exml xpp crimson and xerces

there are libraries that build on the xml apis jdom dom4j or xom which are easier to use than the raw apis

you might find that other tree apis like jdom xom and dom4j are more to your liking

for heavy due xml processing vtd-xml is the most efficient option available it is far more efficent than jdom dom4j or dom.

in addition there are third-party libraries for xml manipulation which you may find more convenient such as dom4j suggested by duffymo or jdom

there are at least 3 different ways to implement the xml-wrapping part sax xslt and xml libraries like jdom dom4j and xom--i prefer xom but any of them will work

try vtd-xml it is much faster than jdom upto 10x and dom4j or dom and also memory efficient

i prefer dom4j personally but i don t mind other apis such as jdom or even xpp3 which has xpath support

there are many tree representations of xml available in the java world jdom xom dom4j that are vastly more usable than dom


box-sizing	border-box	21
i would find this very useful if not more useful than box-sizing border-box

the key to it all is that box-sizing border-box is less susceptible to browser differences in padding and border calculations on form inputs

i recommend using box-sizing border-box

my question is when we declare box-sizing border-box and the total width of content and padding and border are larger than the width that is declared for the element how does the browser solve this case

but the button in your example is less than 15px wide so even with box-sizing border-box the button s width is pushed larger than your percentage

input has box-sizing set to content-box while select has box-sizing set to border-box

also if you re going to use percentages for widths i d recommend using box-sizing border-box to account for the padding in your width calculations

everything in bootstrap gets box-sizing border-box making for easier sizing options and an enhanced grid system

i also recommend box-sizing border-box

if you need to have both fill the screen when the child is less than the width of the screen then both need min-width 100 and box-sizing border-box and you can remove the display-inline-block from the parent

if all you want is to include a padding then you can achieve the same thing with the box-sizing attribute set to border-box that has far better browser support

read up on box-sizing border-box to learn more

as an aside i would also recommend using box-sizing border-box to make width calculations easier

in the above code #header seems to overflow out of #header_wrapper because of and which adds up to more than the height of #header_wrapper and even though box-sizing border-box has been applied its still overflowing

btw i d recommend box-sizing border-box for a more intuitive behaviour of widths and height for elements compare padding behaviour

i recommend using box-sizing border-box because it will not break the layout when you add padding to the element

there is one more solution besides setting box-sizing border-box and using a lower width value

jeff kaufman has a good demonstration of how box-sizing works and why border-box makes more sense

adjust the padding and use box-sizing border-box to have better control of the height

also i would advise you to use box-sizing border-box see more about border box model

as i said on most projects i d heavily recommend box-sizing border-box


instances	transient	1
manual and basic scaling instances also allow much longer deadlines 24 hours but very long-running requests may fail occasionally due to transient issues or upgrades


udp	tcp-ip	1
network cards and routers have a tendency to prefer tcp-ip packages above udp


des	aes	25
this shows that the timings are sensitive to buffering and that aes is faster than des

des is usually substantially slower than aes on modern hardware and has keys that are far too short for modern use

note that the effective key size of aes is larger than triple des

the original des designers were genius but one could say that the aggregate effort of cryptographers for the aes has been far greater

using des assuming it s a little faster than aes and requires a smaller key and

personally i would recommend using aes as its very easy to implement and with it being sensitive personal data would provide enough encryption to keep people out unlike something like des

you re using des in your example which is a flawed and obsolete algorithm alternatively use 3des so i suggest moving to aes which provides better encryption

how ever if you insist to use some api in java i have to say that des is really old way to encrypted text 3des desede or aes will be better and safer both of them have already been supported since java6

according to this analysis aes rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as des 3des with a bigger key size more secure

i ve read that aes encryption is more secure than the triple des encryption ms is using in their example above

aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni

aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des

turns out this was a hardware failure the aes commands need more power than the des crypto1 ones 50 more which the antenna failed to deliver at the reading range i was testing with

des turned out to be even slower than aes but for my current requirements a much simpler algorythm rc4 is sufficient

triple des or aes are much better options

if you are free to choose the algorithm you might want to choose aes over triple des it s a lot faster and generally considered a more modern cipher

though it s unrelated to your actual question des is generally slower than aes at least in software so unless you really need to keep the key small aes is almost certainly a better choice

des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes

if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications

if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations

also see why aes is more secure than des

i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method

which steps of aes encryption makes it less vulnerable than des

based on chris comment des is very weak so choose aes if possible

edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times


mp3	ogg	21
first of all i recommend you to use ogg instead of mp3 has better performance

however after attempting multiple times i m actually getting worse results with ogg files than i am with mp3 s - but the problem is the opposite ie when the loop is supposed to go back to the start of the ogg file it actually seems to start again but from about 2 or 3 seconds into it ie no gap it just doesn t loop correctly

mp3 files were of higher bitrate and when converted to ogg ended up in the loss of quality which resulted in the noise

it is likely that wav is using a more compressive codec such as mp3 or ogg internally

if you want to cover the largest audience possible set up a streaming server like icecast and broadcast over mp3 and or ogg both is better

firefox doesn t support mp3 on html5 they support ogg which is better anyway

if mp3 ogg is better try different compression ratios and sample rates to see which goes faster

i originally had the all sounds in mp3 format but after reading that ogg may be more reliable i converted them all to ogg but the errors appeared just the same

i think there are some devices that could have issues with mp3 files has they haven t the mp3 chip decoder so the best option it s ogg files also ogg usually compress better

bass is an audio library to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

in general ogg achieves better compression than mp3 which is a plus for things like download size bandwidth resource usage etc

if you ask people to compare between mp3 aac m4a mp4 and ogg - they will give you different answers

it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc

i have done it by using ogg files instead of using mp3 files in my application ogg files consumes less amount of memory

stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via

for the songs i recommend ogg format with maximum compression over mp3 since it s usually taking about 50 less space and the quality is indistinguishable

ogg vorbis is better quality per meg than mp3 plus no licensing legal issues

its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via os codecs and add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

of those three ogg would usually be smaller than mp3

its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

moreover ogg vorbis is better then mp3 at all bitrates


jxtable	jtable	4
use swing-x components there is a jxtable which is more powerful than jtable

also is jxtable better than jtable for such an application

i have a jtable or a jxtable to be more precise with 3 sections of grouped columns i want to divide

note i know the jxtable variant of jtable has some more options for filtering and highlighting rows but i did not find a solution yet.


httpconnection	downloading	1
since the buffer size of inputstream depends on the byte size i assigned when i use httpconnection the downloading speed is faster since it spends less time at writing the buffer data to file

when scrolltop is less than 300 show the div otherwise hide it

the scroll function hide the cart button if scrolltop is less than the height of the navigation bar


ffmpeg	handbrake	3
i would recommend handbrake cli for this or ffmpeg

you may also use handbrake which is a simpler encoder than ffmpeg

occasionally ffmpeg or libav might be better suited but for most cases go with handbrake


uiswitch	uibutton	1
i have a scroll view which has numerous textfields and then some uiswitch and uibutton followed by more textfields


charat	indexof	1
i ve found that using a simple for-loop iterating over all elements in the string and comparing using charat performs faster than indexof or regex


qwindow	qwidget	1
qwindow is more low level than qwidget


jhat	jvisualvm	1
another way to do the same thing is to use jvisualvm which is much more user friendly but also more memory consuming than jhat


textmate	sublimetext	6
i would recommend textmate if your hopefully on a mac if not get sublimetext 2 beta

i am trying to choose between textmate 1.5 and sublimetext 2 for ruby on rails development

if you re a mac user i recommend textmate it s free but sublimetext is not

but i ve found that sublimetext 2 has some features i like more than textmate and also tm v2 which is in beta

macvim sublimetext is much thicker whereas textmate is slicker and sophisticated

textmate isn t known to perform well on large files but sublimetext supposedly performs better than vim on large files and yet supports legacy textmate syntax parsers


mp4	h.264	8
h.264 is more often encapsulated in mp4 container and vp8 in mkv

- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4

but i don t know why the size of mp4 video with h.264 codec is bigger than the size of the image set in the only implementation i found so i made my own archive format that is basically the imageset merged together in 1 file and compressed with snappy plus the info for split them again

when i demux an mp4 with ffmpeg the provided sps at the beginning of the raw h.264 stream is richer than mine

both formats flv vs mp4 can contain exact same data h.264 video with mp3 or aac audio but mp4 is supported in more devices software

again i d highly recommend h.264 in an mkv or mp4 container rather than anything in an avi container

it doesn t support avi at the moment but imho mp4 format is better suited for h.264 anyway

for full hd video i would recommend using h.264 video mp4 or f4v


uisegmentedcontrol	uitabbarcontroller	1
if you want a different look than what is provided by the uisegmentedcontrol using the uitabbarcontroller is the better option


strtol	atoi	24
you can also use strtol which is obviously better than atoi

instead of atoi using a better function like strtol which allows error checking

the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi

i would recommend strtol which provides better error handling than atoi or sscanf

i used atoi to convert the string to int but for a more robust solution it s better to use strtol but for your example atoi is more than enough

i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10

i start off calling gets to fill the buffer then using strtol to convert the human-readable text in buffer to an actual computer int value - note that strtol is more powerful than atoi and uses long int instead of int as its declared type

besides strtol is a better option than atoi as strtol can handle failures better

strings to integers hint prefer strtol over atoi

to convert to integer a string passed as argument to your program use atoi or strtol which does better error checking

also instead of using atoi use the safer counterpart strtol

you need to error check strtol and ensure there are as many passed before using them -- strtol is better than atoi as helps detect errors

all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case so avoid using atoi

for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null

you can also look into strtol which is better than using atoi in terms of error checking

so when trying to make things more reliable as atoi and easier to use as strtol solutions like kirilenko s would be used

note that i tend to prefer using strtol to atoi as you ve a little more control over the inputs and the error handling - but not much

if you want to accept a number rather than a digit and only a number strtol works much better than atoi as it allows you to check for failures

also atoi doesn t provide any way to detect errors so prefer strtol and similar functions

strtol can be a better atoi specifically w.r.t

once you ve done that you can use strcmp to see if the string is equal to stop and if not then call atoi or better yet strtol which has better error checking to get the numerical value

strtol is better than atoi with better error handling

use strtol it does better error reporting than atoi

prefer strtol over atoi


rtp	sdp	1
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.


ssl	socks	2
anyevent http resolved several issues i had with my program locking up and also offered better control over ssl cert validation and use of proxies including socks proxies

since socks proxy is in theory nothing more than a ssl tunnel i thought i could give that property another try


asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink	2
i am using asp.net-mvc 2 and i see more than one html.actionlink method that takes an idictionary as a parameter for the html attributes

in asp.net asp.net-mvc for linking standard pages the ones that does not need special parameters or query string is there any situation where i should prefer html.actionlink to a standard tag


spaces	linefeed	6
then the rogue linefeed or maybe in future spaces will be more obvious

it seems like the linux method just using linefeed makes a lot more sense saves spaces and is easier to parse

it makes minimal change to the text in particular it never splits a word doesn t change wc -w and for text with no more than single spaces in a row and no cr it doesn t change wc -c because it replaces spaces with linefeed rather than inserting linefeed

as you say the perl character class v matches linefeed vertical tab form feed and carriage-return although i would dispute that cr is vertical white spaces in addition to the non-ascii code points line separator and paragraph separator

this regex does replace by a single spaces all contiguous spaces 2 or more followed by a linefeed or individual tabs

s will match more than just spaces because it also matches vertical whitespaces like linefeed carriage returns.


range	infinity	4
in the default to-nearest rounding mode the mathematical result of the addition would have to be above the middle point between double.maxvalue and the next floating-point value that could be represented if the exponent range was wider for the floating-point result to round up to infinity

splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomial interpolation if you fit a polynomial it must inevitably head off to + - infinity outside your data range

this conversion can lose precision but also lose range resulting in a float zero from a nonzero double and a float infinity from a finite double

in python3 range can go much higher though not to infinity


vectorwise	infobright	1
but as well as infobright if you re going commercial then checkout vectorwise it s quicker and similar priced


hbase	hypertable	1
so i thought of using hbase but i googled up and known that hypertable is faster


justmock	typemock	2
other profiler based mocking frameworks like typemock isolator or justmock are probably easier to work with but they are commercial solutions

justmock less expensive than typemock but still expensive


fread	read.table	7
instead of the conventional read.table i feel fread is a faster function

fread ... is extremely fast 10 - 100 times faster than read.table ... or read.csv ... for large datasets

interestingly for 1 million rows per file the optimised version of read.csv and read.table take 422 and 430 more time than fread whilst without optimisation this leaps to around 1500 and 1005 longer

for this data.table fread would be better than the standard read.table

for reading large csv files you should either use readr read_csv or data.table fread as both are much faster than base read.table

fread performs faster and more efficiently than read.table but read.table produces less no errors on the same data set

you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the fread function which is much faster than read.table


scala	typesafe	1
scala does not provide an alternative and any alternative that was provided would likely be less reliable as typesafe does not have the resources that sun oracle ibm etc


highcharts	dygraphs	1
i prefer dygraphs over highcharts graphs as interative javascript graphs so i was wondering is there a dygraphs equivalent for the highcharts area range graphs as is suggested in the link


vsts	tfs	4
however if you are looking to migrate to vsts things are much more complicated and you will need to upgrade to tfs 2017 rtm at a minimum

however we don t want to interrupt developers for whom using vsts will be better choice then tfs

unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro version of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions

other features in vsts and tfs will be harder to use when your work is spread across multiple projects and or collections


glut	fltk	1
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implemented than glut itself


ember.js	sproutcore	2
i have seen a lot of post where they are claiming that ember.js is much better than sproutcore but looking at the differences i have seen that the widget support is not there in ember.js

i have seen some other post for differnces also between the two like here but i am still not getting it when to prefer sproutcore and when ember.js


equals	icomparable	4
icomparable is an interface that defines that two instances of the implementing class can be seen as greater than less than or equals to one another

no - icomparable is for seeing if one object is greater than equals to or less than another

implementing icomparable is a more fine-grain way of comparison as it provides the compareto method which is a greater-than less-than comparison as opposed to equals which is simply a is-equal-or-not comparison

icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type


osx	yosemite	3
on my vanilla osx yosemite it yields more precise results than file -i

i would recommend sticking with osx - mavericks for this as i have notice issues with el capitan and yosemite

it s true that the yosemite compatibility exists but i ve found that earlier mac machines does not have the propper hardware and you experience some lacks in memory and graphics when upgrading more than one osx


direct3d	direct2d	6
if you re using windows and are ok to use direct2d or direct3d there are much easier ways to do this by drawing shapes with a customised brush for filling

direct2d is more or less dead nowadays and one would use direct3d also to render 2d

as mentioned direct2d is an option also--it is functionally a layer on top of direct3d that supports more 2d specific functionality as well as excellent text support

direct3d appears in principal to be easier than direct2d but has poor text font handling in the latest version

i ve flirted with the idea of converting my direct3d engine to direct2d to have better rdp vm support however since d3dimage fundamentally requires a direct3d9ex device my interoperability between direct2d and direct3d is once again tied to a need for an hal device type

if you are willing to limit yourself to vista or later then direct2d would be a little simpler than direct3d


background-repeat	background-position	1
i would recommend using background-size cover background-position center and background-repeat no-repeat to accomplish this


jtable	jlabel	2
why don t you do a simple test that tries to read and display an image in a jlabel first since using a jtable is more complicated than using a jlabel

i want to use a jpanel and then put jlabel if using jtable is easier then i will use that please tell me which will display the data


mapr	cloudera	2
i am working with massive data my input data is about 100 gb.i want to choose one of the hadoop distributions but i don t know to choose mapr cluster or cloudera cluster

mapr has clearly cheaper tco and technologically superior platform cloudera is a bit more polished hortonworks for pure open source don t read this as free or cheap as most companies end up spending more money on hw to get any value


division	subtraction	58
typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

i am trying to make a simple calculator using radio buttons to select addition subtraction multiplication or division

division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

so for a class assignment we are using html and php to make a form that asks a user to input two 2 numbers and to choose between addition subtraction multiplication or division form using radio buttons then to input a guess as to what the answer is

remember multiplication division and remainder operators are all higher precedence than subtraction

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

this platform is probably not representative of your microcontroller but the test shows that on this platform the subtraction is considerably slower than the division

that s because the division operator has a higher precedence than the subtraction operator -

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

a floating point subtraction should be faster than converting to a string and back which involves a lot of division

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations

it may not be the most elegant method but when you just need to convert something ad-hoc thinking of it as comparison and subtraction may be easier than division

indicates that multiplication and division have more precedence than sum and subtraction

the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

the division operation binds tighter than i.e is evaluated ahead of the subtraction so you are taking a square root of a negative number

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

subtraction operations and usually significantly faster than multiplication and division

this is much faster than the division by repeated subtraction method since it converges to the result quadratically instead of linearly

this is called a strength reduction operation because subtraction is a weaker and cheaper operation than division

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

division has higher precedence than subtraction

when you allow division and subtraction things become much more complicated somewhat in contrast to what was suggested by another answer

it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

this is because division operator has higher preference than the subtraction operator - in the first example you use are not using brackets therefore division takes place first you can change your code to

because the division operator has higher precedence than subtraction

this is called a strength reduction optimization because division is stronger slower more expensive than subtraction

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

division has higher precedence than subtraction so in the first two examples only the second number is being divided

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

i choose subtraction bc it can be reproduced and works better programmatically instead of creating an attack sequence by division and storing it as an array and indexing the array each time you need to determine a persons turn

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

doesn t get evaluated the way you are expecting the division operator has higher precedence than the subtraction operator

knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction

the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

in this since division has greater precedence than subtraction therefore x 10 will execute first and here we are dividing two int irrespective of the fact that the variable where final answer is stored is a double so answer will be an int i.e 5 10 0 and then subtraction of an int and double will be done here int will be promoted to a double

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

subtraction and maybe negative numbers and division are more complicated so i m omitting them for now

pencil and paper division in base 2 32 or 2 64 would be a lot more efficient than division by subtraction and i believe that gmp employs a better algorithm than that

in this case division has higher precedence than subtraction parenthesis around the division or not

without parentheses math.exp c b is executed first as division has higher precedence than subtraction -

division has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction so it s really this

put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division


wordpress	vbulletin	1
i searched a lot about a tutorial or even a documentation describing how to add custom settings fields to general settings page in vbulletin admin panel but no way unlike the wordpress which is much easier to get tutorials to


namenode	checkpoint	1
for efficiency secondary name node periodically does a checkpoint to update the fsimage so that the namenode recovery is faster


cucumber	concordion	2
i ve not tried them but common opinion is they re less mature than cucumber jbehave concordion rspec etc

assuming you are working in java i would recommend cucumber if the audience is only developers or concordion if the audience for the specs may also include non-developers


range	max	111
to create equal bins you can simply first define a min and max value which is slightly smaller than both range

the dis min max part sets a range of min and max values this distribution can come up with which means it will never generate a value bigger than max or smaller than min

if min is bigger than max i just return a random character from the entire range

i want to validate a number as decimal up to two decimal and minimum range is greater than 0.00 and max range is up to 99.99

i tried to select min and max serial number after that group by datetime but still cant get correct range because each users will have multiple range

but i also need two highlight line sliders to allow the user to select range of values min and max values on the chart

since your container is sorted you can use std max_element on a range ending with the first element greater than your max use std find_if with a lambda or std lower_bound to get this range

i m working on slider that updates 2 text boxes with values the slider is in a limited range so it doesn t give values lower higher than min max

main problem why i cant adopt those solution is that every of my random values has different range and i need the values to be uniformly distributed withing the range no frequency occurances at min max for example which happens if i cut off the values which are less greater than min max

doing sort_heap on a max_heap with the max at the front initially will repeatedly pop the front to the back and sort the range according to less which is the default comparison operator

i am trying to create a figure in which the colorbar will extend beyond the data range go higher than the max value of data

take a look at your picture - all the range you want have ending time greater than min and starting time less than max

the problem is when i select max range and slide it to min all items somewhere has gone

and this number is larger than max so it doesn t fit into the range

so you can either pick a date range run a select max and select min against your db or execute your query and then add the missing dates

it may look odd but it is common for number-to-string functions in many programming languages to make an exception for the min value in this way because with two s complement representation of integers the max value is 1 less than the absolute of the min value range of -2 147 483 648 to +2 147 483 647 which means the min value is the only negative value you can t flip to positive and then process using the same shared loop code as for the positive values.

update having does not work with between because it already selects a result set with a range where the max is less than the result of count

i am trying to give user a popup msg if cell value is less than max value of certain range and then go back to previous value of same cell

if you have larger numbers you ll need to declare an array for your lookup table with a size equal to one more than the max integer value in the range you re using which is why i only recommended this approach for a relatively small range

match max len a2 a2000 len a2 a2000 0 finds index of first cell with max len in range a2 a2000

the recursive cte is troublesome because it is limited to a max size of 32 767 much smaller than potential range sizes and has the very real possibility of being very slow

the problem is it is overflowing therefore it works fine when the result returned is in int_max range 10 9 but negative value is show in case of value returned from function is greater than int max range

avoiding variables and functions cross join the table against some other table s to generate a range of rows where the range is greater than the max value of quantity

in general you want to have a range slightly larger than x max - x min and then divide the range into the desired number of bins

if max z1 z2 range is less than or equal to table2 max value2 where table1.type table2.type

an automatically adjusted range will always be the next power of 10 greater than max value

let s say i want to select max value in column a in range 100

the question i have is i would like the calendar to only display the min and max date range for the from date and to date any thing greater than the max and anything less than the min should be greyed out

here is a dynamic solution that works for any range of numbers where min is less than max

if the product ids are a consecutive range of integers and there is a non-trivial number of rows then it will much better to select max id from products generate a number of random integers between 1 and the result in php and do as a second query

so my question is - can we rewrite the below query without using max to be faster on large data sets in the 100+ million range

i have this grid each coordinate in the grid can be either closed or open i m tying to using an open coordinate find all the open coordinates around the first that are valid and the walk range between then is equal or lower than the max walk range

2 that the min range is not greater or equal to the max range.

ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

a larger range means a greater max value and a smaller min value than decimal

take your large function and compare it to the max from your source range if it is less than max display none if otherwise have it display the max

the python built-in range will make a series of values for you starting with adding k each time and stopping with the last multiple of k that is less than max x

as you have mentioned in your statement to search for ha in range 1 5 and giving you the greedy match max till 5

you match the found maximum in that range exactly match max 2 2 2 2 0

age can be in the range of 0..100 but i want also to validate crossing values i mean that max is greather than or equal to min

a variation on pentadecagon you are free to set n arbitrary values on the diagonal in some range min..max containing x and fill the rest of the array with lower than min on one side and higher than max on the other

if max and min are independent variables the extra subtraction for max-min will waste time but if that expression can be precomputed at compile time or if it can be computed once at run-time to test many numbers against the same range the above expression may be computed efficiently even in the case where the value is within range if a large fraction of values will be below the valid range it may be faster to use because it will exit early if value is less than min

i can never remember which is the best temp table mechanism for sql server sorry - it may be better to go with a table variable and may need to add indexes + keys either way. you can then select max totalallocated from that for a given date range

produces the same error attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

i ve got a constant defined data_out range and cnt is incremented on clock and never reaches value greater than max range of data_out

your value 6131231234 is greater than int max value 6131231234 is not accommodated into int range which results into exception

we needed to display at least 15 minutes of data per chart with option to pick range of max two hours

for ease of debugging i pass the value of to reactive values and print the first date range s value to the console rendered to check whether the it is smaller or bigger than the min and max of the corresponding date column as i did in the lapply function

if range is greater then or less then the min and max then it should throw error

if you want to check that a number is between the min and max of the range you would likely want to check that it is both higher than the min and lower than the max

consider using long type as your number is greater than integer max range 2 147 483 647

if the volume is larger than max range the formula will give error which is captured in the iferror part

check the maximum values of any attribute columns that don t work select max data from norms see if that data is valid and also within the range of a 32-bit unsigned integer

if requestedsize bigger than max size of the range

a sample of visual inspections suggests that the max length is more likely in the 200 to 300 character range

the range function produces a list of integers from 0 less than the max len s by step 3

so if you re getting a step exceeds the specified range error i d guess that the default step value 1 is larger than the max of the range the result of .

if you look how floating point numbers are implemented they can t represent all numbers between their max and min as the number of real numbers in a range is bigger than infinite

i want to select min min_serving_time max max_serving_time from a date range group by weekday like this

in my highstock bar graph x-axis displays numbers if the category length is less than the max range

a taylor series expansion is a good starting point for the coefficients but you usually want to minimize the max-absolute-error or relative error over that specific range and taylor series coefficients likely leave have a lower or higher outlier over that range rather than having the max positive error nearly matching the max negative error

it looks like the default calulation of the range slider is min + max - min 2 or min if max is less than min

to do this i suggest to bind to keyup event for range input and store value to internal field i used lastvalue within input itself then bind to change event to compare lastvalue with min max value

query the table once to get the highest imprints column value to use for your maximum random value range like so select max imprints as max from my_table

but continuing i always got attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

while using md-slider from angular-material if the range of max and min is less then the slider is looking fine

issue here is i need to submit myform but because of min max attribute i get this tip value must be less than or equal to 20 or value must be greater than or equal to 10 for the inputs submitted lesser or greater than the range provided in min and max attributes respectively because of this my form does not get submitted

when i select max datecolumn i get a value roughly half way across the range of dates

i know that in general for a set of range if the max of the mins is less than the min of the maxes than they intersect but the circular nature of degrees makes this a bit more complicated

therefore if you are trying to create a byte out of an int and it is larger than the max range of the byte it will divide by the max value of byte and give you the remainder as the byte s value

if you want a range use select min user_id as min max user_id as max ..

retrieve the unique range whose max value is greater than an ip

figuring out the necessary exponent range is much more straightforward if you can describe the max and min possible absolute values of your input you can easily find suitable corresponding binary minimum and maximum exponent

if you disable elastic axis and make sure you specify a range that is higher than the max value you can select the point

if you date range is larger than the two years displayed just drag the formulas down to expand the max range

if 1 line does not have 326 characters i see the incorrectlinelengthexception line is shorter than max range 326

3 is it filtered to a narrower than max time range or not crank it up to last 90 days or maybe an even bigger custom range

i ll leave the rest up to you ov checking for error conditions such as more than 1 column passed in the range or range of unequal size or a max # of items returned being larger than the range size

this picks max + 1 unique random values from range max+1

i need to select max record of users that date_to does not falls within the selected date range

and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0

my solution to the range part feels clunky over complicated and doesn t check if the max range value is bigger than the min range value doesn t check if 10 2

the max value of a range must be greater than or equal to the min

at first i tried a solution using a where i would select every coordinate in range check if they were valid if they were i would call a from them to the center position and count the number of steps if they were higher than my max range i would just remove the coordinate from my list

i want to make sure that the user does not enter a zero for the max value and also that the min value is less than the max value not equal to but less than - i need the range of values max - min

maybe you can decompose your ui in datepicker and timepicker and then choose max and min for conforming your time range

it works like range so i need to pass it a number one greater than the max number in the current index

problem is when you input a large number such as 9999 result will be a negative or some weird number because sum is integer and it can t handle more than its max range so you know that a 32 bit binary will have 32 digits so is it too big for any number type in c++

add on if you have no match try range for min max and avg

the whenever clause is required in this case to prevent min values being higher than the max values and to ensure that the range size does not exceed the capacity of an int

to return a random integer equal or greater than min smaller or equal to max with chance probability of the result to equal x and 100-chance probability spread uniformly among all other results in the given range

now it s a simple select with min and max to turn it back into range

keep in mind that the cast int d will not throw an exception if the value of d is outside the range of an int - if which is greater than the max value of an int the resultant cast will be -2147483648

however i m getting a attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter. error when i m trying to plot the normalized data

i would like to know if there is a way to access the range of said shader properties so that i can set a max and min value to my sliders

here i am inserting values min and max id s in a temporary table from another table so that i can then use those values to retrieve my data in the final query.but in the final query where i am specifying the range i.e the line containing select max from rangee and select min from rangee is giving this error.how can i solve it.the values of min and max are returning fine

if you want to exlude a number 4 that means the range is smaller by 1 so use r.nextint 5 and if the result is the excluded number then return the max allowed which is 5 because it will never be generated because you used max - 1

the new randomint takes min and max which defines the range the parameters are exclusive so the range is covered better

but with this the last range is larger than the max value

in your query if the data range params are same then you can write a single select statement with min and max fields on value

do note that this can result in duplicate key constraints since the primary key will still be unique so if you do get duplicate key constraints simply reset the sequence to a range that isn t in use yet select max colname +1 from tablename should give you a correct startpoint

currently i m joining a range of dates that covers the full range of possible dates select min start date max end date

that occasional max threshold is actually bigger than the range of small instance

i can select min and max values and cut the range but if the pks are not distributed quite evenly it may give me some range of seriously different sizes

figure the max values yourself and use integer range min to max to ensure no bigger than necessary usage

a signed 64-bit integer range from âˆ 2 63 to 2 63 âˆ 1 the absolute value of 0x8000000000000000 or âˆ 2 63 is 2 63 is bigger than the max 64-bit integer

third you initialised end to len lis2 this will give indexerror list index out of range if you are trying to search for an element which is not present in the list and is greater than the max element in the list say 23

then you can compare min and max to see if the given numeric type covers the range of another numeric type

basically if you know that your events are never larger than a given duration you can search for a bounded range that s larger than the max duration then add restrictions to get rid of the extra stuff that matched

hi all i m trying to find a way to select min or max from a range of data based on these conditions

beware that an input string longer than the max number of digits once transformed will not be truncated and will be longer than for values in the correct range

elementtree	beautifulsoup	1
beautifulsoup is more forgiving in terms of well-formed xml structure see i had to edit the xml a bit to make things work for elementtree and it s actually much easier to work with


boost	stl	22
maybe this would have all been better with boost but i m still learning stl and didn t go that way

.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost

c++ s stl is getting better and better yet it s not nearly as huge as boost and is not intended to

i would really recommend using stl vector or boost multi_array containers for this

i am developing this using c++ so solutions using stl or boost would be even better

realised that templates are incredibly powerful and don t need to be slow and use of the stl and boost is much more widespread than 10 years ago

too bad that find calls often end up verbose â it s even worse with stl than with boost ranges

is there any construct in stl boost to write it more or less like this

as for not reinventing the wheel like many have said already make sure to first explore the possibilities in the standard template library stl which is much richer than you might think and then look at boost www.boost.org which has libraries for a lot of diverse purposes and they are extremely high quality and some are just works of art like spirit proto lambda and mpl

for example using classes and class methods and function overloading which are usually easy for even c diehards to cope with but not the stl stream operators and boost which are harder to learn and can have bad memory characteristics

i would recommend boost filesystem because it is planned to be added to stl c++14

the boost pool library provides stl allocator that are more efficient when allocator objects of the same type as opposed to std allocator which simply uses new and delete

most people recommend using boost or stl but there are cases where this is not possible on operating system development embedded systems with limited resources etc.

i am a c++ programmer and over the years have been subjected to hearing the notion that stl is not good for use in embedded environments and hence usually prohibited in usage for embedded environment based projects.i believe stl libraries like boost are far more powerful and provide a much more faster less error prone means of development ofcourse the syntax is little intimidating but once past that i think it s a real treasure .also i find the claims that stl is heavy and increases final footprint of code absurd because since it is templatized one is only going to get compilable code which he asked for and not the entire stl

boost libraries are generally less mature and less standard than stl

once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost

boost s io stream might be a better solution than stl s own stream

i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions

qset and other qt containers are less versatile than stl or boost containers

the moment you add the baggage of stl and boost you are slower than

i don t want to use boost because that s a library i haven t used extensively yet and i m doing this partly as an exercise to gain greater mastery over the stl

while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly

if vim seems too much by the moment i think that kate is better than gedit

there is an official raspbian cross-toolchain though you may want to read that tutorial but imho you should forget about eclipse it s overkill any text editor like kate or gedit will be much less confusing for small projects

you can customize kate and i think you will like it better than gedit


vmware	esx	3
we have experimented successfully with vmware esx to get better usage out of our data center

edit we use vmware here and the reason we can t use real keys is that our esx servers are running more vms than they have real usb ports and sharing is not acceptible

because of compatibility with vmware infrastructure esx i would prefer vmware for headless server operations and virtualbox for anything that requires user interaction photoshop gui etc


rank	percentile	4
you can rank records and then select max value with the rank before percentile cutoff

since ntile might put the same number in more than one percentile i use a query to calculate the percentile using rank

i m thinking that this is just happening at a larger scale with your percentile since you re basically condensing their rank into a 1 to 100 scale

percentile rank is much more complicated than simply dividing it up by n

lasagne	tensorflow	1
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features


xlib	xcb	6
xcb is lower level than xlib and allows you to minimise the number of round-trips to the x server leading to lower latency

the xcb library is alternative to xlib which is much better all around and supports a non-blocking interface but it doesn t play well with opengl

xcb is simpler to use has a better response to a multithread environment but lacks documentation while xlib is a more dated complex tool better documented and fully implemented

on xlib vs xcb - i would recommend xlib over xcb if you re first starting out

xcb presents a more direct view of the protocol than xlib does so you often have to look at either the protocol specs or xlib source code to find out what the underlying protocol request is to find an equivalent

you might use a low level x11 library like xcb -or the older xlib - it is used by graphical toolkits like qt or gtk or fox etc.. which are both free software toolkits so you could study their source code and xlib xcb are also free software


jpm	add-on	1
for sdk add-on i would recommend using jpm watchpost + extension auto installer instead


post	put	113
i resorted to split the two in swagger list-without-search as get and list+search as post just to put the page in the swagger documentation also if the latter actually works also as get

also you can send a text only to given client determined by the url it can be post but put looks nicer

use ef to create json object and use web api controller to get select put update post insert delete delete data

bowler is pretty much scalatra + scalate with some enforcing nudging of the developer towards good restful practices such as proper use of content-type and accept http headers for responding and emitting html and json and dealing with get post delete and put in appropriate ways and making bad uses of get and delete harder

in the post page google strongly recommends using put unless dealing with form data

but that post is currently put on hold as my post question is more technically-oriented rather than just a general-purpose question

i think to safely use put on a public website requires even more effort than using post and is less commonly done due to potential security issues

i m trying to unit-test my controllers every test that uses the get request works fine but the tests where i use other calls delete in destroy post in create and put in update fail with a

data-size xml very verbose but usually not an issue when using compression and thinking that the write access case through post or put is much more rare as read-access in many cases it is 3 of all traffic

frameworks like firebase angular-fire lib have handy built in auto-sync functionality alternatively the rest post put request is a more traditional design pattern

if the model being presented to the user was of a file system having the user supply the resource name makes a huge amount of sense and put becomes the main creation operation and post becomes delegated to less common things like making an empty directory and so on

words like arbitrary processing and neither not safe make post sounds less secure than put when there is a choice

at first i thought i need to put an id to the radio buttons but later when i went through other post i got more and more confused

you could put the text into an invisible span and read that spans width but basicly this looks like someone trying to sabotage your site and therefore i would recommend banning post with words longer than a certain lenth for example 30 characters without spaces allowing links to be longer

true fifo message ordering longer delays and so on but sadly smaller message sizes. push queue allow you to set up push subscribers which then receive an http post any time a new message is put onto the queue

where 404 may be suitable for get and put update but less suitable for post inserts

get and post are relatively common put is less common so may not be covered in your server implementation

post oauth token doesn t match put logout 2017-10-26 11 15 07.869

allowed http methods ensure that you select get head options put post patch delete

put to the api a message describing the outcome of the game post is acceptable put is better for idempotency

on closer inspection the docs at actually recommend using 100-continue only when describing post yet at the same time recommend using put for uploads whenever possible

as you can see from some reason the method rails choose is post instead of put

i found sikhttprequest but i cannot find inside demo to choose between get post and put

better is to choose between put and post based on idempotence of the action

in my fiddle you can see that there is two div newdiv and newdiv2 they conduct identical element which have same class and id but i want some amd same shopping cart so my problem is that if i pick post 3 then post1 element also blink and same things for post2 and post4 so how can i code that allows only parent element to put and blink at particular place

without wanting to self-promote i ve also put together a blog post that goes into more detail on the aforementioned answer that should be of some use

i basically know zilch of java but i m hoping someone can help me put something into that .parse function that would get me post that have dateupdated newer than 5 days

in our case this one matches get word - this header could use get post put or delete words

i m very sorry for the long question but i thought instead of dividing the question into several post it is more convenient if they are put into one place

using perl s dancer module if you have an any method which will match get post put delete how can you determine which actual method the browser used

you can change the http verb near the url parameter to get post put delete or more

on the php docs link above they say a put request is much simpler than a post request when uploading file along with this advantage what other advantages disadvanatges do the put has got compared to the post

if you want to follow the spec then put says that the body is a representation of the url you put to while post is more general purpose

put is used for updating a record and so unless you are specifically storing the fact that a user is not following another user post would be more correct

post is usually intended for creating content put is more modifications

there are a lots of reasons to choose between post get put and delete methods or http verbs

please edit your distribution and under the behaviors tab please select get head options put post patch delete for allowed http methods

i put the prior code in this post to make it easier for you to visualize it

you d probably be better off in this case to put a currenttextid on your post table to avoid having to figure out which revision is current an alternative would be a flag on revision but i think a currenttextid on the post will give you easier queries

put does not mean update any more than post means insert

if noop a put may make more sense than a post which would imply creating a second connection

i am trying to submit a form but if i just put form_for classroom i get a no route matches post error

while this means that a post can create a new resource and is certainly the best way to do so when it is the server that will give that new resource its uri with put being the more appropriate method when the client dictates the new uri it is can also be used for cases that delete objects though again if it s a deletion of a single resource identifiable by a uri then delete is far more appropriate both create and delete objects change multiple objects it can mean that your kitchen light turns on but that the response is the same whether that worked or failed because the communication from the webserver to the kitchen light doesn t allow for feedback about success

to send binary data put will be faster than post based on the same logic and because post will use multipart form-data encoding headers but browser support is more limited for put requests

to receive a file in your api i would use a put request simpler than post multipart and fetch the data from the stream php input

i put in postman my url with the addproduct at the end then i choose post

from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

i would really like to put some place holders in the text for images - you know to make the blog post look better some interspersed images that relate to the content

typically you would not allow a http client to determine the uri of a new resource so a post to blog would be safer than a put to blog article-uri although http does cater for appropriate responses should the server be unable to honour the intended uri

do your post put probably is more appropriate here upon leaving the input field

if so is it best practice to prefer put over post when possible

after few word i put a read more button when i click read more it s show full message it s ok but it s show all my post s full message

bad gateway error in shopify is often caused when doing large post or put that take longer than 90 seconds

1 put in the url input box and choose post from the dropdown

anyway http 405 is telling you that your backend does not support the put method and probably it s expecting a post method with the x-http-method-override put http header since post is more standard method in rest than put

if you perform a destructive operation like post put delete against more than one resource and the operations against each individual resource did not share a common outcome then you can go for 207

side note it looks like you re using the post form of file upload which as the docs say is considerably more complex than put

you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever

i think you forgot to put closing braces better you post your code

i decide to put the gps location recording answer into a new post to make things cleaner

removing this from the url get list post create delete destroy put update i get this error

put and delete are often not used leaving get and post to map to select get and create update and delete post

restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit

q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t

first get request shouldn t be used to alter states on the server so for your vote service i would recommend post put

put is preferred for database updates and post to create new entities so post is better on this case

more importantly in this case i think post is more appropriate than put

ironjs has undergone a radical rewrite since my first post so i have put notices on those post directing to newer updates

you could manage more than get or post like put delete...

grab post and put it into a array

wrap your update button in a and make it post to your backend in fact put would be more appropriate here as you are updating existing data

put requests are much simpler than a file upload using post requests and they look something like this

the app.all means that the route will match get put and post request

if you are trying to send a post or put then you add it into the payload though that will show up once you select post or put

you have mentioned that we can t use actions more than get post put delete which is not true

i think that in that case the put verb is more appropriate because post really means i want to create something new

the difference between post and put is less about creating vs

for postman make sure you choose post from the dropdown and that you click on x-www-form-urlencoded and put your parameters in the key and value fields respectively

will create standard default restful routes for post and pages get post post get put destroy post 1 get pages 1 edit and etc

post or put might be more appropriate

put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement

apart from this you should also make sure to implement the four verbs correctly so that they match the sql commands get select post insert put update delete delete handle encoding negotiation correctly return proper http response codes and all the other things that are expected of a restful api

the client post scores and fetches highscore lists from the server and everything seemed to be working perfectly we had been testing it for a month with no problems and the code is really simple with not much more than a put get

on post and put it is always better to return the modified resource including its id

i looked at the angular-django-rest library highly unsupported and couldn t get puts to work for the life of me b c there s only a save method which somehow automagically selects post put

but if the action is aimed to handle crud request post or put it s more convenient way to use forms

post is also more commonly used for partial updates as put generally implies sending a full new representation of the resource

http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server

the first thing i recommend is put this on proguard file extracted from the post i ve linked

the requests library can handle post put delete and all other http methods and is significantly less scary than urllib httplib and their variants

type book why do we need anything more than http get put post

prefer put over post

given http supports various methods like get put post delete and more like patch head options etc

this method also allows you to put the url within the action parameter of the form and uses post which is more secured for transferring password information

data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post

network latency is ruled out because get requests take more or less same time as local machine whereas time taken to first byte is more for post and put requests

both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url

how can i get rid of the post put data getting exponentially bigger

now this test tests more things than one post put delete which breaks the idea of a single unit of work..

to be specific under the composer tab you need to select post as your request type and put the jira s url there keep http 1.1 selected

i was digging through the flask pluggable views documentation and while i find the methodview to be very helpful for making restful crud endpoints usually i end up wanting more than just get post put delete methods under a base route with common decorators and so forth

i have a website with html css js php mysql i have jquery code i put it for the post i mean i change the css property and animation for the post read more date..... on hover mouse the problem is the code work only in the first post if i create a new post it will work only in this latest post and when i hover on an other post the code work in the first code thanx in advance and excuse me for my english am not good

once you have determined that you re in a better position to choose between put and post for your method

put seems like socket to socket connection such as telnet mail server so using post may provide more of an underlying framework to uploading multiple files in a single batch as you already have the boundaries built in my the post method

side note if you are attempting to create a new customer you may want to use post instead as it may be considered more restful as put s are generally for updating an existing resource but this is up to you

and then select post put delete .

i d like to limit the content that is shown to a certain number of characters and then put a read more link to go to the show page for that individual blog post

class cplayer has a lot more fields than i put here but they are not relevant to this post

get select put update post create and delete delete

this will give the form something to pass that you can grab with post elsewhere hope that helps just put your variable where the .

post is better but if you want it to be truly restful you should ensure that the uri uniquely identifies the resource and use put

what about the question how many items to put on the screen you can give a solution like this for each post give fixed x height and if it requires more space put read more link on the bottom of the post which will reveal missing part when user clicks

so select post instead of get in postman and put your body to the post body instead of address line


vim	jedit	1
personally i would recommend jedit rather than vim


caliburn.micro	prism	1
imho any modern mvvm-framework like catel caliburn.micro mvvmlight reactiveui is much better than prism


atlassian	assembla	1
of course i choose atlassian jira in features specified jira project name same as gitlab project name saved changes and in project services tab saw assembla atlassian bamboo and others but didn t see jira


restkit	asihttprequest	1
i have been using asihttprequest but it seems to be deprecated and i read that restkit is the newer library


rtsp	rtmp	3
the chance of receiving video streams over http is higher than rtsp rtp rtmp and so on

all the solution works but videoview rtsp take more than 10 seconds to stat streaming from the server when rtmp take 2 seconds

what no one seems to mention is the awful latency that hls brings to the table with is chunk video it can be 30 seconds if you are doing real-time streaming like video surveylance the rtmp and rtsp are the better solutions


cpython	ironpython	18
cpython probably has better ide support at present than ironpython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other

my understanding was it was written in vanilla python cpython but if you are more comfortable with ironpython it shouldn t be hard to translate

also on implementations like jython or ironpython could be a lot slower than with cpython

it seems ironpython is just slower than cpython for reading text files

ironpython and jython are also jit-compiled although using the more generic jvm and .net jits so they tend to be faster than cpython for this kind of work as well

i prefer using cpython since it s pre-installed on many systems but if you need access to .net libraries from python or need faster code i guess ironpython or pypy would make sense to use

it s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as they are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and .net clr

i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython

for me ironpython has been the more robust choice and much of what i ve written in cpython ports without changes

performance measurements of jython ironpython and cpython show that both jython and ironpython outperform cpython for some cases with large datasets

one of the largest benefits of ironpython is that it has effectively no gil - meaning that if you are both writing python code and it is multi-threaded - you can often get performance that is better than cpython without having to spawn multiple process and pickle objects across the boundaries

consequently ironpython is potentially faster than cpython is especially for multithreading scenarios

ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython

for example cpython beats ironpython hands down start up time

so if you want to use django or something like that it s probably not smart to use ironpython because it isn t really cross-platform doesn t work with some frameworks and it performs worse than cpython

if there s any heavy application logic as opposed to all of the work being networking files database ironpython is much faster than cpython at a few things and much slower at a few others so you probably need to profile and perf-test before you go too far down either path

i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home

ironpython should make it easier via .net approaches but cpython is not that far via com implementation in win32all


pycrypto	m2crypto	2
i chose to rely only on pycrypto and pyopenssl since m2crypto is less popular and not well-maintained which is a hazard from both compatibility pypy and security perspectives

what little i ve used pycrypto i ve found m2crypto to be a better library overall -- you might want to try it out


uuid	mac-address	1
in fact v1 uuid is more fit than v4 if you use the uuid just as a table id - because it uses mac-address and time stamp to prevent clashes


tooltip	scrollbar	1
tooltip text is more scrollbar is displayed to scroll through to


illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception	1
if you prefer unchecked-exception then you could throw illegalargumentexception


strlen	strncpy	4
this is the case here because strlen hello is greater than 3 your last strncpy argument

furthermore all this strlen +1 -1 stuff is unnecessary and confusing prefer strncpy over memcpy and strcpy for strings and you don t need to deal with that

however if strlen source is greater than n then strncpy will simply copy the first n bytes and will not terminate the string dest with a null byte because there is no space for it

but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively


wildfly	weblogic	1
shortly what you need is an application server with java ee 6 full profile support - i would recommend glassfish or wildfly or weblogic from commercial end


javassist	cglib	6
the javadoc of javassist is way better than that of cglib

another similar example is hibernate that lets you choose between cglib and javassist in hibernate-core in the same way

note that javassist is significantly slower then for example cglib because it reads in class files directly instead of using reflective access in order to avoid class loading

this makes for example javassist or proxetta significantly slower than cglib which simply reads the methods via the reflection api and overrides them

also javassist is recognized to be slower than cglib

here in so i found a lot of questions asking something similar and the answers normally said you can use cglib or asm or javassist is better than cglib or bcel is old and is dying or asm is the best because it gives x and y


hmac	pbkdf2	4
use either bcrypt on its own or pbkdf2 in combination with your sha-512 although sha-1 hmac is more than enough

pbkdf2 also uses a more complex construction in particular hmac over direct digest to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt

an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function


verilog	vhdl	20
pacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdl

it used to be that vhdl had more non-synthesizable language features that aided verification that old-school verilog

3 - find a book on vhdl read the chapter on delta delays assignments and your verilog will be much better

my experience is that designers can use whichever they prefer usually and most agree that verilog is easier to use and the code is shorter fact than equivalent vhdl

in certain respects systemc deliberately mimics the hardware description languages vhdl and verilog but is more aptly described as a system-level modeling language

vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us

by these numbers and only these numbers vhdl seems to be more widely-used than verilog

yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

do i wish vhdl and verilog took more from functional languages

hardware design with vhdl or verilog is more like programming nowadays

once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first

you seem to be compiling more than one hdl probably vhdl and verilog

i have more experience with vhdl and verilog

in the same way that english is a better language to write a novel than fortran vhdl and verilog are better languages to describe logic circuits than c

the choice of language is somewhat arbitrary - i code in vhdl syntactically similar to ada most of the time but some of my colleagues prefer verilog syntactically similar to c

first let me say that i m more experienced with verilog but have been plugging away with vhdl for awhile trying to fix this issue

division though is an iterative process in logic the implementations you see on educational sites verilog vhdl are simply doing the same thing we did with log division in grade school but like multiplication it is much simpler than grade school you pull down bits from the numerator in the long division until the number being checked against the denominator is equal to or larger basically the number can either go in only zero times or one times into the next number under test unlike decimal where it can be between 0 to 9 times

verilog and vhdl allows for more optimization

although vhdl and verilog are much harder to learn i suggest you start right away

do you prefer vhdl or verilog and why


cakephp	zend-framework	1
since cakephp seems to be much lighter than zend-framework i would suggest that you take a look at cakephp


caffe	torch	2
don t know whether you prefer tensorflow keras torch caffe whatever

tensorflow is slower than caffe torch etc on gpu because of


fish	zsh	1
gnu bash zsh fish have more features so are more complex


strtok	malloc	1
i ve also tried malloc -ing more memory after every call to strtok but nothing seems to fix the seg fault


asterisk	freeswitch	2
if you want to run an independent and standalone service i would recommend freeswitch instead of asterisk

i suspect asterisk and freeswitch will be closer to what you want


jqvmap	jvectormap	1
jvectormap comes with more pre-generated maps than jqvmap


exponent	addition	8
so ideally i want to have approximate relative times of elementary operations execution like multiplication typically takes 5 times more time than addition exponent is about 100 multiplication

in addition since all my coefficients are positive and i only want the x qth one is there a way to get mathematica to discard all exponent that are larger than that and not do all the multiplication with those

in addition for doing powers of two bitshifting is usually a little clearer than doing exponent though choose whatever works for you

since fp addition shifts the smaller operand s mantissa until both operands have the same exponent you can add a certain magic number to force it

in the default to-nearest rounding mode the mathematical result of the addition would have to be above the middle point between double.maxvalue and the next floating-point value that could be represented if the exponent range was wider for the floating-point result to round up to infinity

if the exponent are more different than the size of the mantissa then addition or subtraction you get the number with the larger exponent as the result all the bits of the smaller number have shifted off into the bit bucket n + 0 n - 0

for instance to achieve addition you would scale the larger value to have the same exponent as the smaller one by multiplying it by 10 largerexp-smallerexp then adding the two values and rescaling

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division


onkeyup	onfocus	1
i know you mentioned onchange and onfocus though personally i tend to prefer onkeyup so that values will change as the user is typing


skype	hangout	1
whilst somewhat similar to skype facetime and facebook video chat google hangout focuses more on face-to-face-to-face group interaction as opposed to one-on-one video chats and utilizes sophisticated technology to seamlessly switch the focus to the person currently chatting


entity-relationship-model	relational-model	1
while relational-model can express any finite set of facts since it s equivalent to first-order logic the entity-relationship-model is more limited


actionscript	haxe	1
i really prefer haxe for development but actionscript 3 is also fine


clojure.test	midje	1
i used midje for a while but found clojure.test felt purer but that was down to taste


nsdatecomponents	nscalendar	3
nscalendar and nsdatecomponents provide more powerful and precise methods to do that

read about nsdate nsdatecomponents and nscalendar to learn more

you have two options compare nscalendar datefromcomponents vs nsdatecomponents date


add-on	xpcom	2
mozilla has stated that they plan to deprecate add-on that depend on xul xpcom and xbl. while not all bootstrapped add-on depend on these technologies there is a tendency for for bootstrapped add-on to operate at a lower level than add-on sdk and webextension add-on

you could try using c-types with ff which is a regular dll being called by javascript in your add-on this is way better approach that using xpcom because if the interfaces you use in there can change in each ff version indeed you will have to do multiple dlls each for your add-on supported ff versions


cypher	gremlin	8
neo4j and cypher is still faster and obviously this has no effect on the gremlin queries on neo4j but that might be just a issue with the gremlin implementation for neo4j

also i have already writed this query with some help in gremlin 3 but i would like to compare performance with cypher

but i read in this post that group by on union are not possible yet it mean that cypher is less powerful than gremlin

recently we noticed that cypher queries run faster than gremlin so we decided to convert our queries

in this case a traversal-oriented approach is best maybe gremlin is better since cypher doesn t allow you to specify traversal order

cypher seems much more clear to me than gremlin and in general it seems that the guys in neo4j are going with cypher

translating this to gremlin is a tad bit tedious pattern matching in cypher is more natural but lmk if this is in the right direction and i ll do it

the closest i ve found is heliosjs though that uses gremlin whereas i d prefer cypher


vbo	vao	5
i have been toying with opengl for about 2 weeks creating hardcoded vbos and making rotating triangles but the question that has been lingering in my head is how the heck do i create more than one vbo vao in real-time so i can handle multiple objects

then sort entities by shader mapping and render using offsets in the main vbo thus minimizing shader and vao switches

i have issue with drawing big vbo with vao because the vbo has more than 65536 vertices and my vao is just uint that has maximum 65536

is it possible to use the same vbo with more than one vao like this

in regard to vao and vbo performance i disagree that vbo is faster i suggest to see this link


matlabpool	parfor	3
if you want to batch and parfor at the same time open one less worker with matlabpool than you otherwise would

in general parfor with matlabpool is an easier combination to use than dfeval

also when you open a matlabpool the workers are launched and ready so the overhead of parfor is much less but still not zero as the body of the loop needs to be sent to the workers


ramaze	camping	1
i would like to use a lighter framework than ruby-on-rails sinatra ramaze camping but am concerned that by doing so i will not be able to use a lot of shared libraries that have been tailored to ruby-on-rails in the form of plugins


quad	uniform	1
then either use a shader with a uniform to select which corner of the texture to display or else make a quad for each corner with pre baked uvs to select which part of the video to display


firefox	safari	150
whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it

because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

on these devices he has different browsers so we have to distinct os x safari os x google-chrome os x firefox win safari win google-chrome win firefox etc

i ve tested this on mac win google-chrome firefox safari android devices iphone4 5 and ipad ios6

firefox for example has a lot in common with google-chrome and safari and google-chrome and safari are even more so closely related

basically the way google-chrome renders text looks ugly and i want it to look like or almost like firefox or safari which looks thinner and better

small in firefox is smaller then small in safari so never ever use them

in particular a font may be rendered quite differently between the various browsers and operating systems in current use - safari and macos use more anti-alisaing than firefox or ie but ie9 has a new feature called cleartype which also affects font rendering

the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

it displays ok in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it has more space between the text and the bottom border than between the text and the top border

since the upgrade or mac clients can no longer connect through safari and firefox is no longer accepting the about config setting of network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris

i did one design which works for opera win firefox win + mac ie9 safari win mac ipad google-chrome win

i have this working fine in google-chrome osx win firefox osx win safari opera osx

i ve checked the site on two machines vista with firefox ie6 ie7 ie8 safari win opera win

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

also i m guessing that firefox ignores this issue and just and compensates for it while safari may be more strict in its implementation of the code so it doesn t compensate

firefox renders the video correctly and it matches the background and in safari it s always brighter whether you add the filter or not

i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

to me it looks like safari gets it more right than firefox text is generally more around a middle line

fwiw i was able to solve my problem with greensock using tweenmax to animate individual paths inside and this worked in firefox gecko and webkit browsers safari google-chrome it does a better job of calculating the origin not exactly sure how but it worked for me

apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

using proprietary extensions from firefox is almost as myopic -- you ll have a hard time convincing all visitors to switch to firefox for your site from ie safari or whatever else they prefer and although the range of devices on which you can install firefox is broader than those on which you can install ie you re still cutting off devices such as iphones and android a segment of the market that s growing much faster than traditional pcs

the points of data in firefox and safari are much smoother in google-chrome they don t go past the dots

i am using franklin gothic font for website and font looks good on google-chrome and safari but on internet explorer and mozilla firefox it looks darker

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

the downside is that you cannot use it for browsers older than ie11 firefox 31 esr safari 7.1 ios 7 konqueror all versions and opera all versions

if it isn t then firefox and safari might be smarter to select a replacement font than ie 7

for example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari takes 5+ seconds firefox takes less than 1 second

i m having a problem styling a select box with google-chrome and safari on firefox works fine

compare safari or google-chrome and firefox click the tabs

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

let s say you wanted a table border-radius of 50 on google-chrome and safari but firefox is adding more padding by default so you d like to tone it down for that browser alone to 45

works in at least ie7 and later firefox 4.0 and later safari 4.0 and later win google-chrome 14.0 and later

as you can see here a friend of mine did some testing and it seems that google-chrome and ie work a lot faster with the dot syntax while firefox and safari are more keen on the key syntax

use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari

you may prefer firefox opera safari because it s safer technologically superior or whatever but you may lose several users that way remember firefox has only recently reached 20 of usage share

but do keep in mind you re optimizing for a particular js engine when you re doing that v8-optimized code might generate cleaner memory in google-chrome and safari but for all you know ie might make a complete hash of things or some of the tricks you ve used cause firefox to slow down more than a fairly large array would have done in the first place

so to specify firefox greater than 20 safari greater than 9.1 and ie greater than 9

not really any more than safari having cookies and firefox having cookies are somehow tied

firefox google-chrome safari all have prioritized faster javascript execution in recent versions whereas ie may show performance in ie9 i hope they do myself. also realize this slideshow will run slow in mobile devices etc

to my surprise firefox 6 and safari 5 are faster just adding a bunch of strings together than using .join

safari 4.0.3 was 2.5x faster than tracemonky in firefox 3.5.3 on win xp

at least in firefox and safari it looks much better

we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

prefer firefox or safari

after updating joomla to 3.8.1 today most of the admin tabbing and navigation functions stopped working in google-chrome firefox win safari and ie 11

the height of the blue bar in safari and google-chrome matches but in firefox it is smaller

i see this problem across the board on safari ie firefox and google-chrome -- so any of these would be fine to use though i prefer firefox because the problem seems to be most defined there

it worked perfectly with google-chrome but safari 5 and firefox implement a more recent version of the websocket protocol and cramp does not so i couldn t get it to work there

safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

on safari everything is slower than on firefox still the object property access is more than two times faster

i m using dinnextltpro-medium font on this site and noticed quite a difference on the rendering between safari 6 google-chrome mac and the rest of the world safari 5 mac win google-chrome win firefox win opera win...

browsers firefox win osx google-chrome win osx ie win safari osx ios opera osx

in safari it renders significantly brighter than in firefox or google-chrome

if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do

instead we recommend firefox internet explorer and safari as longer-term options

when i try the demo in google-chrome or safari it is indeed much faster but when i ve tested it in firefox it s consistently slower

pc google-chrome and safari are fine ie shows the links like in the picture firefox shows more revealed urls

in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

in ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears closer to the bottom than in safari and google-chrome

i have used some css hacks to get the position pixel perfect on firefox ie 7 8 9 and 10 win google-chrome opera and safari however on mac google-chrome and mac safari it is a few pixels out

i d support both ie still has a big chunk of the user space with firefox and others opera safari etc.. occupying a smaller percentage of the browser market

fast clicking on ie has slower response than firefox google-chrome and safari

i had created the website www.suezre.com and when viewed in google-chrome or firefox figcaption on the pictures looks good but on safari it takes much more space

this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on

now i recognized that safari make more problems then the other browsers like google-chrome or firefox

recommend firefox internet explorer and safari as longer-term

my problem is appearing in google-chrome windows not win firefox ubuntu firefox google-chrome mac firefox safari were the text height is being swashed

this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

safari behaves better than firefox but an error message â œone error in opening the pageâ â shows up in the status bar if you remove the iframe during the load event

i already tested it and it doesn t match with opera google-chrome firefox or safari mobile

in ie java-script load slower than firefox safari and google-chrome

browsers devices desktop browsers ie8+ google-chrome firefox safari ipad s browser mobile safari mobile devices browsers android mobile safari

that s tolerable for us as we are allowed to limit our users to firefox ie7+ but annoys me on a mac as i much prefer safari to firefox

i just tested geolocation on firefox 3.6 and iphone safari os 3.1.3 the result is interesting firefox is more accurate than safari

we recommend google-chrome however the latest versions of safari firefox and internet explorer work great too

in safari we found that the dom level 0 took twice the time off the dom level 2 but was still four times faster than either firefox case

firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie

it looks like while google-chrome and safari are trying to do the right thing with 0px firefox is sticking closer to the standard

unfortunately unless you re happy with supporting only specific browsers ie7 win safari firefox 3.5 there s no pure css solution to your problem

your links are all held within a table missing its starting tag but tables are not supported in all document types and perhaps firefox and safari are guessing better

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

seems to be mac google-chrome related problem works fine on win google-chrome mac safari mac firefox

firefox 4+ and safari 5+ have much stronger html5 support and don t require the above css.

open up the fiddle in both firefox google-chrome to see what i m talking about - in firefox the positioning of the background image is much lower than in google-chrome safari

so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit

therefore code should be written and tested around firefox google-chrome safari which are much closer to proper standards support than ie8 then conditional tags should be used in ie to work around its bugs

the compatibility table link shows google-chrome firefox edge and safari are more compatible than babel now

it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox

i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome

firefox recognizes this attribute but webkit google-chrome safari etc don t more info on caniuse.com

browsers like firefox and safari are better at line numbers but they are generally pointless due to minification of the files

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

i am currently testing using various versions of firefox ie opera safari for win google-chrome on winxp and winvista

but for firefox and safari things become more complex

incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox

in the above sentence i want to match firefox safari i and and but not background

after that ie slows down at exponential rate when firefox google-chrome and safari are doing much better

firefox internet explorer and safari have better options though

is it possible to adjust rendering of svg content on safari and google-chrome to resemble more firefox rendering

everything works correctly for me in safari 6.0.2 firefox 18.0.2 mac firefox 10.0.1 win opera 12.12 mac and ie 9

the only thing is that flexbox is not supported by older browser support by ie10+ google-chrome 20+ safari 3.1+ firefox 2+ read more about support so i probably would need to add the flexie polyfill to support this on older browser

it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

i saw that the discrepancy was because in safari the text element is taller than in firefox and includes a slight amount of whitespace on top that doesn t show up in firefox in firefox the top of the text element is exactly when the text starts

i m noticing huge performance issues in google-chrome firefox and safari when adding more nested lists programmatically too many reflows maybe

in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari

in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox

but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery

overflow-x and overflow-y are supported by ie5+ win firefox 1.5+ mozilla 1.8+ and safari 3+

this jsfiddle demonstrates the problem compare safari google-chrome to firefox

so far i got it working in updated versions of safari mac google-chrome win firefox win and ie11

in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari

lastly a native app can in fact be a web browser like safari for example however i doubt you re building a web browser unless you re trying to compete with firefox google-chrome safari etc

secondly the browsers above ie7 and other browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari have a better rendering engine and intuitively handle buggy markup

all major desktop browsers win ie mac win safari mac win google-chrome win opera mac win firefox

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it

this actually works fine on mac win firefox safari but on ie6 and ie8 only the first element grabbed by the selector displays the desired behavior

solved the problem came from css specificity.bootstrap s css was judged more specific by google-chrome regarding my menu s selector but not by firefox and safari

this happens in firefox and also in google-chrome cells shrink less in google-chrome but not in safari

with firefox google-chrome and safari it s less of an issue because those started auto-updating years ago and more than two years ago they stopped blocking methods other than get and post

third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox

i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better

as others have encountered it looks great in mac win firefox mac win google-chrome safari and even win ie 8 9

the service is still in beta trial and firefox conversion is working better than safari one

firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall

the html tables on my site look nice and the way i intend them to in safari firefox google-chrome but look far wider than the set pixel size in ie

i have the problem in firefox 3.6.13 and have tested against current versions of safari win google-chrome opera and ie where the code all works perfectly

while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903

then ie seems to be reasonable but cant be faster than firefox or safari

i test on win google-chrome and don t know how it works on safari firefox ie opera

it looks like at least on safari and firefox prototype runs significantly faster edit not 20x as stated earlier

please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome

i think it s simply because google-chrome firefox safari etc. are faster browsers

it seems that ie and firefox are less strict than safari

in my opinion you re already testing far over the top - ie firefox google-chrome safari already corner more than 99 of the market in pc mac form

found an easy way which works with all browsers i have google-chrome 49 edge 25 firefox 44 ie11 safari 5 win safari 8 macos

just go into safari open preferences then select firefox as the default browser at the top of the first tab

firefox and safari follow an older flexbox specification and look best when the lists have a balanced number of items

firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

i think it doesn t work entirely correctly in ie6 but it is fine in ie7-8 firefox safari win opera google-chrome

tested in win firefox ipad safari android 4.1 google-chrome environments

this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome


ord	unpack	1
unpack will be more efficient than split and ord because it doesn t have to make a bunch of temporary 1-character strings


openmpi	mpich	3
while openmpi supports more connection protocols there is an infiniband-enabled version of mpich called mvapich

which benchmark program should i pick to compare between mpich and openmpi implementations

it seems openmpi has better support for assigning ranks than mpich but setting up slurm and mpich wasn t trivial due to the cluster setup so i m hesitant to start over with openmpi


teamcity	nant	4
if you can foresee that you re only going to have a small team and a limited number of builds i would recommend teamcity with nant

i would recommend teamcity - free for up to three agents 20 projects and 20 users runs a variety of builders nant included and can parse nunit results hudson can do all this too i believe however i have no used it so i can t speak from experience

you could use nant to send email but teamcity is more appropriate as it can provide a centralized place for notifications including emails

if you are taking a more open source approach such as teamcity cruisecontrol then nant may be better


ng-app	ng-controller	1
a ng-app can have more than 1 ng-controller


swing	windowbuilder	3
go new - other and select windowbuilder - swing designer - jdialog

for eclipse i recommend windowbuilder you can build swt and swing applications with wb

in my opinion swing is easier to start because there are tools like the eclipse windowbuilder which enables you to create your application in a graphical interface but javafx is more likely to be used in the future because it has some great improvements over swing like css skins etc.


imagemagick	magick++	1
now i m trying to do the same thing with imagemagick to be more correct with magick++


ng-include	ng-controller	2
will replacing directives withe a combination of ng-include ng-controller make it better

the priority level of ng-controller is lower than that of ng-include


performselector	delegation	1
note that this is nothing new even in obj-c the new apis prefer using blocks over performselector compare uialertview which uses respondstoselector and performselector to call delegation methods with the new uialertcontroller


reentrantlock	reentrantreadwritelock	1
the difference between reentrantlock and reentrantreadwritelock is a more fine granular control on the throughput


highcharts	nvd3.js	1
for something more robust check out highcharts or d3.js or something built on top of d3.js like nvd3.js


springlayout	grouplayout	1
in it developers seem to agree that grouplayout is a more effective replacement of springlayout


heapsort	shellsort	1
at the end of the report shellsort outperforms heapsort


background-repeat	background-size	1
i would recommend using background-size cover background-position center and background-repeat no-repeat to accomplish this


lxml.html	beautifulsoup	7
if beautifulsoup can t do it i can recommend lxml.html 0

using an html parser like beautifulsoup or lxml.html is a better idea

i do like beautifulsoup but i personally prefer lxml.html for not too wacky html because of the ability to utilise xpath

you can do this with beautifulsoup s html parser though the lxml.html package is somewhat more straightforward

i prefer lxml.html than beautifulsoup that support xpath and cssselector

but if you are allowed to store whole tree into memory you can use lxml.html which is faster than beautifulsoup

lxml.html deals with badly formed html better than beautifulsoup is actively maintained beautifulsoup isn t and is a lot faster since it uses libxml2 internally


heroku	engineyard	5
engineyard are more like heroku in that they aren t just providing you with servers they are providing you with a service and set up stuff for you

engineyard also seems like a great company but i think they hold your hand a little less than heroku

for a step up from heroku i d recommend engineyard instead

engineyard does provide application-level support too which is a fair bit better than what heroku does

in choosing heroku is more full-service whereas engineyard is a more traditional service giving you access to boxes but needing sysadmin skills


jerkson	jackson	1
this is not to say this is more official than jerkson just that there are many useful jackson extension modules that many developers are not familiar with


qtoolbutton	qpushbutton	2
qtoolbutton has smaller default internal margins than qpushbutton

qtoolbutton is much more complex under the hood than qpushbutton


vxworks	qnx	2
in the non open-source world choices are wider such as qnx neutrino and vxworks

get a real-time linux distro or grab vxworks or qnx - something purpose-built for io intensive requirements


primefaces	icefaces	3
i ve used both icefaces and primefaces and prefer primefaces for two main reasons development efficiency and ui performance responsiveness

i did my part of the research and found out that either richfaces or primefaces would be better but most of my applications were developed using icefaces

for the view layer we have to choose between primefaces icefaces 2 since we definitely want jsf2 and richfaces


width	border-box	6
my question is when we declare box-sizing border-box and the total width of content and padding and border are larger than the width that is declared for the element how does the browser solve this case

but the button in your example is less than 15px wide so even with box-sizing border-box the button s width is pushed larger than your percentage

also if you re going to use percentages for widths i d recommend using box-sizing border-box to account for the padding in your width calculations

as an aside i would also recommend using box-sizing border-box to make width calculations easier

there is one more solution besides setting box-sizing border-box and using a lower width value

if you need to have both fill the screen when the child is less than the width of the screen then both need min-width 100 and box-sizing border-box and you can remove the display-inline-block from the parent


nlb	iis	1
i ve got arr in front of a client s ssrs setup right now no difficulties reported and it s 100 modern iis rather than legacy nlb which is less flexible when it comes to web-centric activities


feedparser	beautifulsoup	1
you could use beautifulsoup - but feedparser is much better geared towards rss handing


nsurl	nsfilemanager	1
generally for path related operations you should prefer nsurl over nsstring because the path information can be stored more efficiently in nsurl according to the class reference for nsfilemanager


xna	libgdx	4
unfortunately xna is not going to be supported anymore but i still see people that recommend it over libgdx

i have never used c# or xna but i can definitely recommend libgdx

xna + monogame --- monogame s performance seems only slightly lower than libgdx can build to most platforms

xna is more popular and has more tutorials then libgdx


libevent	epoll	6
gevent intentionally depends on and is coupled to libev libevent previously while eventlet defines independent reactor interface and implements particular adapters using select epoll and twisted reactor behind it

create some sort of event loop using select epoll or event framework like libevent libev and get a callback whenever a user hits a key

event-loop libraries like libevent maintain the timers in a min-heap and pass the timeout till the next timer expiry to select epoll

i need to use epoll not poll select libevent libev or libuv

why don t you just use select epoll or something like libevent with 1.5 second timeout

but not yet test on epoll libevent mode actually we are working on it anybody think it is select epoll related


filesystems	hfs+	1
hfs+ supports much larger files than hfs block addresses are 32-bit length instead of 16-bit and uses unicode utf-16 encoding to name files folders and other filesystems objects


ironruby	ironpython	7
it can be done but i really prefer using ironruby or ironpython over this approach

since developing in ironruby ironpython is faster you can use it to write pocs and later implement the real application in c# or whatever you re using

ironpython has had more time to focus on performance improvements but ironruby has made significant performance improvements as of late

specifically besides letting me know whether you agree with my two points above i d like to know if ironruby and ironpython are much easier to use for a user not developer than powershell and if in your experience using the dlr is as easy as just passing an object to a powershell runspace

i also suspect that a dynamic language like ironruby or ironpython might offer a more elegant way to solve these problems but it could be a little longer before i look into that possibility

however as things stand right now ironpython is much more mature and has much better performance than ironruby so you may prefer to use that

also i believe the ironruby team is smaller than the ironpython team


arp	dhcp	1
i would like to simulate multiple dhcp client using dhtest.however the below script is not working as expected.can someone help to fix the problem or provide any script which can simulate dhcp clients and also bind to respond for arp requests


centroid	threshold	3
i want to know if there is way in matlab so that i can find number of points in each grid so that i can classify it as a dense cell or sparse cell.if the number of points in a grid is more than a threshold it can be said to be dense .i need to find distance between each point in a sparse grid and centroid of each cluster to find which point is the outlier.if min distances between a test object o in a sparse grid and cenroid of each cluster threshold value it is outlier.can you suggest a method to implement this in matlab

the answer was actually pretty easy and not matlab-related if you divide your domain equidistantly and choose these values as the representative value of the corresponding quantization level and pick threshold at the centroid of each of these intervals endpoints you get the threshold that matlab uses

precision parameter if centroid amount of change is less than a threshold delta stop the algorithm


mechanize	anemone	1
if you re attempting trying to crawl the site may i recommend mechanize or anemone instead


pygobject	gio	1
pygobject is nothing more than a thin layer of glue making gobject gio .


grouplayout	miglayout	2
these days we can choose only between grouplayout miglayout or formlayout

you could also use grouplayout which i like better but which is harder for some to wrap their heads around...but if you re not opposed to adding a 3rd party library i m using miglayout for most everything these days


ganglia	metrics	1
however i wonder if this is the best way of doing this if you want to observe specific behaviour you might be better off isolating a specific input file and debugging against a local pseudo-cluster and if you want system metrics you could do worse than give ganglia a lookm as it is pretty mauch already built into hadoop


macports	homebrew	34
i recommend installing homebrew to manage installing nix tools on os x i d stay away from macports fink

overriding choice for me is macports as it has many more packages than homebrew and it puts its stuff in opt local to stay out of the way of other programs

you can use macports or others as well i prefer homebrew

i recommend macports or homebrew which custom builds ghostscript and imagemagick in your environment

version - this is the main reason i prefer macports over homebrew you

there comes macports or i personally prefer homebrew

homebrew is generally a bit nicer than macports as it doesn t require lots of sudo action

install nodejs via your preferred package manager homebrew macports then install less and less-plugin-clean-css

homebrew has less of a stranglehold on your machine doesn t require as much reading as macports

i m guessing sphinx didn t correctly link up with mysql when you installed it via macports i generally would recommend homebrew over macports these days

i m using homebrew as it s newer than macports and i don t know enough to choose between them

usually you use homebrew or macports to install a newer version

note that conda provided prerequisite libraries are difficult to work with i recommend using macports or homebrew

you can use homebrew or macports to install multiple versions of python on the same machine without necesarrily overriding the default python interpreter based on my personal experience i recommend homebrew

most people i know use homebrew or macports i prefer macports because of its clean cut of what is a default mac os x environment and my development setup

if you have never installed fink or homebrew or macports i recommend choosing macports because it interferes less with other tools

most people working in the mac world will recommend homebrew or macports i think

it seems my version which i guess was snow leopard s default version as i d never heard of it til today was an older version so i had to use homebrew to install a more up-to-date version i also used macports to uninstall the old version - not sure it s appropriate having macports and homebrew installed on the same computer but...

macports or fink may have something similar but i prefer homebrew

install newer emacs by homebrew or macports

con you can encounter issues related to library versions and dependencies macports has more software than homebrew

i would recommend using macports or homebrew to get the native libraries

using macports or homebrew this is rather simpler

it may be that macports doesn t help i have been luckier with homebrew than macports when installing cgal

i am not experienced using macports and would rather prefer homebrew over it at the moment

i recommend homebrew over macports for package installing

i strongly prefer homebrew over macports for installing software from source

i would recommend using macports fink or homebrew to install python 2.7

i use macports including installing python via port to create a very linux-ish command line environment although lots of python devs seem to prefer homebrew

the reason i prefer macports over homebrew is that it s centrally managed frequently updated and at least for my programming interests already have many of the modules i m looking for as ports so 9 times out of 10 i don t need to worry about installing with pip

currently macports has many more packages 18.6 k than there are homebrew formulae 3.1k owing to its maturity

i d strongly recommend uninstalling macports and switching to homebrew

the answer here also recommends using homebrew instead of macports for installing boost but i already said earlier that i used homebrew for installing boost

if you don t i would recommend getting homebrew or something like it apt-get on linux is built in or an alternative on os x would be macports


sse	avx	34
as expected the performance got better with both and avx 2 faster than sse 4.2 but when i profiled the code with papi i found out that the total number of misses mainly l1 and l2 increased a lot

when i can use sse3 or avx are then older sse versions as sse2 or mmx available -

so the avx version does indeed appear to faster than the sse version both for the original implementations and the optimised implementations

the underlying reason for this and various other avx limitations is that architecturally avx is little more than two sse execution units side by side - you will notice that virtually no avx instructions operate horizontally across the boundary between the two 128 bit halves of a vector which is particularly annoying in the case of vpalignr

for small buffers hot in l1d cache avx can copy significantly faster than sse on cpus like haswell where 256b loads stores really do use a 256b data path to l1d cache instead of splitting into two 128b operations

i m going to compare avx and sse instructions so using time_t is not really an option

at the level of individual instructions it is comparable in speed to the simd units operating on scalar values. otherwise you prefer sse sse2 and later simd extensions to the instruction set like avx etc. and of course when i say you i don t just mean assembly-language programmers

the question is avx scalar is 2.7x faster than sse when i vectorized it the speed up is 3x matrix size is 128x128 for this question

after a few weeks of effort it should not be too difficult to beat eigen with avx and openmp eigen only supports sse but it s highly unlikely you will beat mkl

vector instructions such as sse and avx have stronger alignment requirements 16-byte aligned for 128-bit access and 32-byte aligned for 256-bit access than that provided by the standard c++ allocation functions

now for sse is clearly faster and for the smaller values it s nearlly as fast as avx

microbenchmarks can make sse avx copy-loops look better than they are because doing a copy with the same size and alignment every time avoids branch mispredicts in the startup cleanup code

sse has precision more comparable to gpu you need float4 or float8 in your kernel such that compiler can produce sse avx which has closer precision to gpu

they re good for code-size but often slower than sse avx loops

also note that the fact that the avx are a newer than sse doesn t make the avx faster whatever you are planning to use the number of cycles taken by an function is probably more important than the avx vs sse argument for example see this answer

and simd math libraries for sse and avx however they seem to be more sse than avx2

in the code below i use block multiplication to speed up your code for a 1024x1204 matrix by more than a factors of ten 7.1 s with old code and 0.6s with new using only a single thread without using sse avx

_mm_popcnt_u64 outperforms sse and avx considerably especially when you use a compiler which prevents the intel popcount bug discovered in my question

i expected avx to be about 1.5x faster than sse

ironically ancient x86 instruction rep stosq performs much better than sse and avx in terms of memory copy

i think you re saying that avx was less of a speedup over sse on your ivb

simd registers like avx and sse could be wider than the processor-l1 interface

perhaps a highly optimized and tuned implementation with sse avx multithreading is better for me

if you have a newer processor with sse or avx extensions then ensure that the compiler is compiling to use these features usually this is done automatically when you set optimizations

single threaded sse operations are faster than single threaded avx operations

i have code that does the same thing but the avx version is considerably slower than the sse version

in that case it s faster to take the transpose first and use vertical add with sse avx you do something more complicated you transpose strips with the sse avx width

before the avx routine runs all the tests are around 80-130 faster then fpu math as can be seen here after the avx routine runs the sse routines are much slower

i know this does not answer your core question why avx is slower but since your ultimate goal is fast popcount the avx - sse comparison is irrelevant as both are inferior to the builtin popcount

as one example they utilize floating point extensions sse avx and do better loop unrolling

you should look into avx the new instruction set extension that evolves sse to support wider vector units

hardware-specific optimizations makes the code even more complex such as sse avx optimizations for x86 x64

so congratulations - you can pat yourself on the back your avx routine is indeed about a third faster than the sse routine tested on haswell i7 here

buf1 buf2 and buf3 is small enough to located in l1 cache and l2 cache l2 cache 1mb .both of sse and avx is band width limited but with the datalen increase why do the avx need more time than sse


slider	jcarousel	3
i prefer jcarousel and jssor slider

i am using jcarousel to display more slider at once as it can be seen in the skeleton example

i have a div for displaying images placed at the center of a page and below that div i ve added slider displaying image thumbnails using jcarousel clicking on thumbnail images from the slider displays the bigger image inside a div positioned just above the slider and this is done using ajax i mean i m just changing the content of div to display selected image but whenever i click on thumbnail in slider for loading image the page gets scrolled and image is displayed what could be the problem pls suggest


memcpy	strncpy	14
i recommend memcpy as that is often fastest for long strings and lest error prone than strncpy blastfurnace

furthermore all this strlen +1 -1 stuff is unnecessary and confusing prefer strncpy over memcpy and strcpy for strings and you don t need to deal with that

memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster

even if underlying implementation is not so different memcpy is much faster because it does not have to check what it s copying strncpy will stop when it ll copy the end of string character null

the memcpy version is not more complex or more dangerous than the strncpy version

btw prefer memcpy to strncpy

memcpy will always be faster than strncpy for any real world situation even in the corner case i spoke before look page_copy_fwd_maybe

which is more efficient is up for debate but based on cpu bulk instructions which can copy an entire block of memory in one instruction memcpy is probably faster as strncpy would check each copied byte for a nul character

memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object

in this particular case it would just copy the 3 bytes as expected but why use strncpy when memcpy is a simpler solution

strncpy - memcpy is faster but you need to know the size of the input string

if you compute the length of the string for unrelated reasons or have the length of the string from other resources it s unclear to me whether memcpy is better or worse than strncpy

hence memcpy and strncpy work almost the same here and memcpy is more efficient and less prone to error

but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively


mxmlc	compc	3
compilers but it compiles faster than the mxmlc and compc

it works similarly to mxmlc and compc but compiles faster

the flex compiler shell fcsh compiles code faster than mxmlc and compc by keeping all the partial build objects in memory


eloquent	ardent	1
however i started using ardent to make validation easier and noticed that it has a useful feature for defining eloquent relationships


pseudo-class	visited	3
the link to detailed information is dead but the apparent reason for using such a pseudo-class is the odd design of css as regards to links link matches unvisited links only whereas visited matches visited links

as ruirize mentioned in comments on this answer the link pseudo-class selector also selects visited links on google chrome

active pseudo-class should go after hover otherwise the hover overwrites the order for the link-relates pseudo-clasess is link | visited | hover | active .

class-method	delegation	1
however often it s better to delegation use cases like these to other class-method which are more explicit about what they do for example foo.relating_to bar


openfire	ejabberd	4
we are currently using ejabberd but prosody or openfire are perhaps better alternatives

this server side product was openfire but you could use ejabberd for even better performance - openfire is easier to set up and maintain though

blazemeter has tested and verified that the new jmeter plugin works with the most common xmpp servers like smack ejabberd openfire and hipchat

on server side install ejabberd of openfire i will recommend ejabberd


cat	tee	1
tee then writes more data t and tries to read from the pipe then goes to sleep until cat writes more data


fold	combinators	1
i m also looking for more examples and explanations of complex combinators more complex than fold in common programming languages


fgetc	getline	2
the fact that using getline with iostreams is faster than fgetc at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away

i confirmed that in debug mode the getline version is slower about 130 âµs vs 60 âµs for the fgetc version


hlsl	glsl	2
opengl is better for playing around and experimenting because you can easily draw triangle without messing with hardware buffers available on larger selection of platforms plus glsl is better than hlsl because it doesn t compile into assembly

generally speaking passes in higher-level shader material systems yes higher than glsl cg hlsl like this one are a way of setting up states necessary for multi-pass rendering


for-loop	if-statement	1
this is little strange to me why if-statement is in this aspect treated worse than for-loop


fseek	ftell	6
still i would prefer fseek ftell instead of os-specific api calls

but i think using fseek and ftell is better and easier

if you are looking for the size of the file the fseek ftell solution seems less syscall expensive

unless there is specific reason to do it fopen fseek ftell is a better idea portable staying within the c standard library

instead of reading the complete file content with fgetc to get the character count i recommend using fseek ftell see answer from this thread

it could be the fseek you read is greater than the current ftell which would indicate the file is smaller than it was but that would not cover all eventualities


cakephp	kohana	1
little bit slow thing is we can t compare kohana hello world application and cakephp hello world application if u tried to write hello world application cakephp automatically loaded orm support validations etc


markermanager	markerclusterer	1
the markermanager has a more involved setup than the markerclusterer but it does allow for more customization of what and where it displays


vtune	perf	1
i can recommend perf or intel vtune


formview	detailsview	1
the same as for detailsview but keep in mind that with formview you are more free of how to present your data out of the box detailsview need some tweaks to behave the same


quicksort	timsort	9
timsort seems to beat quicksort by 5 or so

possibly timsort beat quicksort waaay back in 2011 when the question was asked but the times have changed

if that is so you might find that timsort runs faster than quicksort

i ve read that timsort is better than quicksort both in the best and the worst case although it uses a bit more memory

if it is true then timsort will always take less comparison than quicksort because on real life data there is some pattern except data is truly random

it beats timsort in memory and it beats quicksort in both worst-case performance and memory

you can take a look at timsort which for non completely random data performs better than quicksort they have the same asymptotic complexity but timsort has lower constants

java s array .sort is from about java 6 actually timsort the fastest general purpose #sort out there much better than quicksort in many situations

this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so


excel	listobject	1
if you are using excel 2007+ i recommend using listobject listcolumns and listrows study the object model


qsort	bsearch	2
one of the reasons i argued so strongly above that bsearch would be faster is because it cheats relative to other associative data structures by doing the work of the sort via qsort up front

i ll add that if this is the first time you use bsearch and qsort it s better you look at the samples you can find around

in dependently-typed languages like idris it s probably more useful than in haskell


ciimage	uiimage	1
it seems like if the uiimage is slightly larger the ciimage is double the size whereas if the uiimage is slightly smaller this isn t the case


qtableview	qtablewidget	5
the qtablewidget is slightly easier to implement than the qtableview which also needs a qtablemodel as backend but it has less capabilities

the first question is qtablewidget or qtableview which is more suitable for this job

qtablewidget or qtableview which is more proper to make a downloading task list

after managing to get my connection and pull data from the database i read that using qtableview as opposed to qtablewidget would be better for what i am trying to achieve

qtableview was more faster about 30 sec than qtablewidget about 1.5 min but solution with qtablewidget was easer


mouseleave	mouseenter	48
what s weirder after mouseleave and mouseenter again the second time it scales up by only a total of 0.81

i ve tried to set it to other value and it works - mouseenter and mouseleave events are fired earlier

i prefer using mouseleave and mouseenter then mouseover and mouseout

lastly the hover creates two events of which the mouseleave isn t needed for your code so you can use just mouseenter to make it more efficient

firstly i think you will find that mouseenter and mouseleave are better events for this kind of thing

as kaveman suggested mouseenter and mouseleave would be much better events to put the code in

while i prefer using mouseenter and mouseleave helps me understand whats going on in the code with .on it is just the same as writing the following with hover

hover wraps around mouseenter and mouseleave to provide even better handling

ie provides mouseenter and mouseleave which are much easier to work with because they don t bubble but of course ie-specific

instead hover i would prefer mouseenter and mouseleave

if you to bind events and use the benefits of a normalized event system you ll use the first version for regular blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error or your custom events

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

maybe mouseenter and mouseleave are more appropriate for your use case

i would also recommend using mouseenter and mouseleave rather than mouseover and mouseout since you will have child elements with your menu

the available events are blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

edit2 you may have better results with mouseenter and mouseleave too i think

in my opinion it gives a nicer solution than the mouseenter and mouseleave event

you can simulate an anchor using css cursor pointer and events like mouseenter and mouseleave which is more work but does not break the expected behavior of an anchor tag

bind works with almost every event you need possible event values blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

mouseleave div becomes thicker which will cause an almost automatic mouseenter

the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup and error

i don t think that this kind of javascript library exist you could easily build one with jquery just listen to all the event blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

i think mouseenter mouseleave is better than hover

you can unbind the blur function on select mouseenter and bind it again on mouseleave

some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

i thought about aborting the request if the interval between mouseenter and mouseleave is lower than a threshold but it does not help

this answer covers the more difficult case with mouseenter and mouseleave

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

and the second problem is that i want to use hover or hoverintent method better than mouseenter and mouseleave but im not sure how to use fadeto to get the same effect

i d prefer using mouseenter mouseleave

i prefer mouseenter docs and mouseleave docs in this situation as it behaves better when hovering over children

take a look at mouseenter and mouseleave events they are better than mousemove and mouseenter combinations

also if you want a hover effect you re better off with mouseenter and mouseleave which jquery provides for browsers that don t already support it

i suggest using hover this instead of binding to mouseenter and mouseleave looks cleaner to me

finally if you want to optimize your program to number of lines - trading off engineering practices - you ll have a shorter program with mouseenter and mouseleave events

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

mouseenter and mouseleave are much more stable

i find using mouseenter and mouseleave to be better than hover

i tried changing the event but sagepay overrides all these events blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu

val css html text data width height offset blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

i m also aware that mouseenter and mouseleave would be far better than hover in this situation i just typed it up as hover for speed


distance	polygons	15
then i would simply check the edges of all blue polygons whose lower bound of distance is lower than the upper bound of minimal distance against all the edges of the red polygons

- for example if you call avgd the average distance beetween points you could add the constraint that no segment of your outer polygons should be longer than 1.2 avgd or better alpha avgd and you try your algorithm with different alpha

root punto is a valid geojson point i checked it with the st_isvalid function and also if i use the function st_distance checking if the distance between the point and the polygons is greater than zero the data retrieved is correct but i don t know if this approach is correct

testing the distance between rectangles is easier than testing the distance between polygons and you can immediately eliminate any polygons that are more than nearest_rect + its_diagonal away possibly you can refine that even more

if that distance is less than the radius of the circle then you know that the polygons intersects the circle

if the magnitude of the distance between the center of the circle and the center of the polygons is less than the radius of the circle the polygons intersects

does the polygons encompass the circle this is that special case where the distance from all of the sides of the polygons would be greater than the circle s radius but the circle and polygons still obviously intersect

the one drawback is that distance between vertices might be slightly less intuitive than polygons area but the two are proportional

plenty of others don t use a delimiter at all and require you to start a new segment polygons if you re more than x distance away from the last point. furthermore these things often wind up being multi-gb ascii files so reading the entire thing into memory can be impractical

create a buffer with a negative distance to get a smaller polygons with the shape of the original

that the distance when the route is confined to the polygons should be greater in this case 5.00

notes the width of the polygons cannot be fixed as you realize because at articulation points the distance will be larger

calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found so far

for each vertex in the red polygons compute the distance to each vertex in the blue polygons and find the closest hint compare distance 2 so you don t need the sqrt

to answer your original question as to how to generate the smaller polygons you can find the centroid of each polygons and offset each vertex by a percentage of the distance to that centroid point of the polygons to get the smaller polygons


wav	caf	2
2 caf seems a little better than wav but not much

and as justin said i do believe that wav will be the better option as you can have more support for wav than the caf format


vlan	packets	1
udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500


dateadd	openquery	1
set open_query select dateadd d 0 datediff d 0 getdate from openquery


icomparable	compareto	2
implementing icomparable is a more fine-grain way of comparison as it provides the compareto method which is a greater-than less-than comparison as opposed to equals which is simply a is-equal-or-not comparison

icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type


matlab	freemat	1
i also found this interesting article that compares matlab octave freemat and scilab


jobs	cron	40
if you ever need to scale up your cron jobs adding more nodes then you ll need a distributed queue lock solution as ken cochrane described

cron jobs are much more reliable approach

check out the quartz scheduler it does what cron does and more is easily integrated in a web app and allows you to call jobs written in java without any complicated plumbing

a task runner i recommend configuring cron jobs with django-kronos

edit btw the idea using cron for checking for new jobs to execute is better but only if you have a small website and you don t need to do load balancing for the jobs

btw for cron at jobs is better to use absolute directory pathes not relative

then run a cron job that kills pending jobs that have been running for a certain amount of time or try to reprocess them

find out how to allow cron jobs to use more memory

usually task runner cron jobs are run much more frequent than once an hour

secondly if you want to schedule a re-boot of the machine i would recommend using cron jobs for it

when you need to scale out cron jobs you are better off using a job manager like gearman

apache airflow is a good option if you need something more full featured than cron jobs

after all the cron jobs add one more cron to execute a script that can trigger your node js task

also you might fill the que really easy with the cron which might lead to jobs being executed longer

please you a job queue that is more efficient than cron jobs

scroll towards the bottom of the page second last panel labelled advanced select cron jobs

google cron jobs to find more about it and here s an answer that could help you

cron doesn t kill jobs once it has started them

they serve a number of roles from managing state that multiple activities rely upon to serving as cron jobs to handling longer app widget updates

and it will prevent overlapping cron jobs if the cron interval is shorter than the job duration

google app engine does not allow us to schedule more than 20 cron jobs

go to your cpanel select cron jobs and use the following command to create it

if it works from the command line but not from cron test.py might have some dependency on environment variables cron jobs run with fewer environment variables set than interactive commands typically do

cron jobs works well with wordpress even if a server cron is better

- running my own cron jobs which do sync more often

i read one of your comments that said you did not prefer cron jobs so consider perhaps what i term a poor mans cron which is a misnomer because the only cost of a cron job is well server access.

please read trough it for a better grip over cron jobs in laravel

that said however we are trying to wean ourselves off cron jobs and move more toward using either aws lambdas we run multi cloud or cloud functions

but the preferred way would be to use cron jobs find more here about cron

i recommend using cron jobs for this kind of work

doing these calculations by hand seems too hard especially when the cron jobs become more complex

if you can predict more than one cron job to be executed you can try or any other library like this where you can config jobs scheduler in php

cron doesn t kill jobs it only creates them

cron jobs often made easier via a custom management command

i would suggest scheduling your jobs using something more sophisticated than cron

cron jobs are more robust than daemons

but this is a personal decision if you prefer cron jobs use them

however when it comes to error reporting on failed cron jobs that takes some more advanced know-how in the nix space which maybe you aren t interested in tackling at this time

i would prefer cron jobs

i have taken on someones project that has automation using task scheduler while i am more familiar with cron jobs


datatrigger	eventtrigger	1
i think datatrigger instead of eventtrigger is more suitable and you need to use x type to specify the bound data to the item


flatmap	concatmap	1
in this case i would recommend replacing flatmap in your test function with concatmap which preserves order

richfaces	trinidad	2
i think richfaces has a more mature ajax integration and their ajax components and events are more easy to use for me than trinidad ones

regarding skinning i feel trinidad default skinning to be more basic than richfaces one but i think both have ways to make them as beautiful as your css skills allow you


express	everyauth	1
note that mongoose-auth is built on everyauth and they will work fine but i like the flexibility of the strategies concept from passport and the express integration is better


bower	npm	23
i ve been using bower info package and npm view package to see which package manager has more versions of numerous packages and have found that bower goes much farther back to older versions of the packages

after trying npm install one more time with the same result i tried bower install

however it does say on the paper.js npm page that they recommend using bower to download the browser version of the library perhaps there s some node-specific code in the npm package

if you don t want to use bower and if you prefer npm then have a look at broccoli family

however i really dislike the idea of sharing the same global modules for both the server and the client what if i want to use different versions and also i d rather keep my client dependencies flat rather than the way npm does it so i prefer bower to manage my modules.

bower packages are simpler than npm equivalents and don t have subfolders with module dependencies

i recommend getting bower too so say npm install -g bower

instead of using nuget for content files i recommend using bower which is based on npm the node package manager

on the project i m using bower to manage dependencies because i found that it has way more available versions than npm does

what i meant to ask is it can be argued that npm has a wider user base than bower some even argue that we should stop using bower altogether like here and here

i don t think there s a jasmine-browserify package yet and it doesn t really match bower npm s way of doing things avoid global exports

like npm bower is slower than component at installing has an unnecessary publish step does not support multiple versions of dependencies and does not cache installations

i recommend checking out bower and npm and particularly npm

perhaps write a config file for them bower.json for bower and package.json for npm that makes things cleaner and you can ensure installation by running npm install

bower is more similar to npm than to component

even if you can handle them with npm it s better to use bower since it s optimized for this purpose no deep dependencies among other things

i would recommend using bower to install this instead of npm as bower is made for front-end package management

is bower a better fit than npm for asp .net 5 projects with separation of source and build files and if not what s the recommended way of doing it purely with npm

i prefer npm packaging manifests or bower manifests as they provide a valid entry point for each module

using npm package is a little bit harder than using bower package

bower is more focused on browser libraries and css while npm is more for server-sided stuff using node.js

my codebase is front-end only so after doing a little reading i thought bower would make more sense than npm

how do you compare npm bower and volo


autoresetevent	manualresetevent	5
when comparing options for synchronization between threads we might compare autoresetevent to manualresetevent

autoresetevent manualresetevent might have slightly more overhead since these can be shared by different processes whereas a monitor belongs to a single process

to wait effectively without spending any more resources cf 3.5 provides manualresetevent autoresetevent manualresetevent provides more control over the reset event and hence most recommended to be used

edit this is why autoresetevent does not have a slim version - basically it s because the wait times of autoresetevent are typically longer than manualresetevent so it isn t appropriate to use busy spinning

when things get complex an autoresetevent or manualresetevent is usually more sensible as they are less time critical you get through the gate regardless of ordering


filewriter	bufferedwriter	3
so using filewriter wrapped in a bufferedwriter to make it easier to write a new line

the other surprise that i have found when writing these types of systems is that in later versions of java using bufferedwriter can be slower than just using filewriter directly or randomaccessfile

i have coded a routine to compute the cartesian product of different tables as in a database with the only exception that the tables are stored as files in my case and for computing the cartesian product i am using file i o for reading files i am using filereader coupled with bufferedreader and for writing files i am using filewriter coupled with bufferedwriter now as i am performing every computation externally in files i.e i compute the product as follows i take a row from file-1 which is table-1 in my case and concatenate it with every other row in file-2 which is table-2 in my case and write it to an external file which holds the result


starttls	smtps	1
you can still have an encrypted connection with the smtps server by using the smtp_ssl class without needing the starttls call shorter


punctuation	words	65
my first option seems to be charlist that select words that are surrounded by space tab point comma punctuation etc

if you need it to match punctuation as part of words such as in. then w won t be adequate and you can use s anything but a space

mc donald s to match words with different punctuation mc-donald engineering company inc.

also should stopwords and punctuation be removed from the training dataset and should all words be converted to lower case

-- old will not be match with words with punctuation in it 20-year-old

disadvantage is that it doesn t match punctuation so words lorem will be found but lorem won t

the b gives words boundaries then it matches words separated but an optional punctuation character and then a space

for example english text has a particular kind of redundancy with some characters repeated more than others words that are repeated and more common than others certain words that are more likely to follow certain other words grammar punctuation structure etc

is there an expression that matches words with punctuation but not punctuation alone

i have a string array containing strings words with no punctuation marks all lower case

note there are some cases you will have to handle here you may have to split at punctuation characters and hyphens and you may have to cope with a single words that is longer than the formatting width

entries with words that are longer than x characters in this case 25 with no punctuation or spaces will cause the html on a printed a4 page to not wrap properly and therefore not to confrom to certain sizes correctly pushing the margins off

i need to replace all words with 3 or more letters with the words thing while retaining capitalization and punctuation

depending on how you want to treat the data you might also want to strip punctuation or go for more advanced words isolation with a break iterator - see the java.text package or the icu project

c++ regex to match words without punctuation

i m using the xregexp library for javascript to generate a regular expression that matches any words in any alphabet and does not match words with numbers punctuation or special characters

is there a better way to match words that contain punctuation

the first part of alternation is supposed to match words including words with hyphen and the second is to match any punctuation sign but for hyphen

you might also want to consider sripping punctuation from words and calling lower if you consider cameroon and cameroon to be the same

the pattern in scanner is supposed to be a regular expression that describes all the characters you don t want included in a token repeated one or more times this last part is because the words may be delimiter by more than one spaces punctuation etc.

did pre-processing of the train data using nltk punctuation stop words removal lower case stemming etc.

also matches words that come right after punctuation

tonight i m attempting to parse words from a file and i d like to remove all punctuation while preserving lower and upper case words as well as white spaces

parse the code that you don t want the abbreviations using your second regex first and then use the first regex selects words and punctuation

i ve done some processing removing stopwords punctuation etc. and have been able to barplot words occurring more than 200 times as well as create a frequent term list by rank and can also run words associations with selected words

alternatively you could accept a-za-z0-9 0 4000 note the space which should get you more than one words but probably not anything after the first punctuation

w can be used to match words characters a-za-z0-9_ so that punctuation is removed from the results

i put an arbitary limit of 10 because i don t know of any words or abbreviations that contain punctuation and are more than a few characters

you were using to match the text which matches words characters and whitespace but fails to match punctuation and other characters

using instead of will also match words surrounded by punctuation or the beginning end of the string

now i have it so that the line is split into an array of strings using the .split method however it splits on white space and punctuation meaning that cities with names longer than one words won t work

it will match words that come directly after punctuation and spaces or appear at the beginning of the string.

the problem i have with the move function is that it selects punctuation s as a words as well

of course this will also match punctuation but i m assuming that we re only looking at words in an unpunctuated list

in text files for example it is much more probable to have a small letter after a letter than a whitespace or punctuation after a letter since words typically are longer than 2 characters

b matches words boundary characters such as spaces and punctuation

words boundaries occur at punctuation not just spaces so if you use and or the perl-ish b and b which are more recent additions to gnu grep then you will also match words at the end of a sentence followed by a dot instead of a space

i need to match words from a string that potentially have symbols both in a words also as a punctuation

the was removed stopword cat is now singular stemming punctuation is gone and the words are lower cased

this matches words digits and a number of punctuation characters though by no means all

2 exact match words before or after punctuation

this matches words breaks which includes spaces start end of string punctuation etc

s+ represents one or more non-whitespace characters to match words including non-alphabetic characters like or punctuation

i would match words between words boundaries with a regex to avoid affecting punctuation or whitespace

for matching and # tags i d suggest using the w metapattern matches words characters - so it ll match digits and letters but not whitespace punctuation

allow various punctuation symbols between words change the + to something like means space - are allowed between words -- add more to your liking but don t put . in to prevent the bold-ing from going over full stops

i have a working macro already the only problem is that it selects punctuation as the next words

the only difference is b which matches words boundary such as whitespace punctuation

note that in case your words are separated with more than whitespace punctuation for example use w+

i m trying to match words using a for-loop however if i try to match the words sentence it doesn t match because when i .split on whitespace it makes it sentence. instead of sentence and won t match because of the punctuation

this match words in text with spaces or punctuation around

and i need to be able to remove all of the punctuation convert to lower cases remove numbers stop words whitespaces from the data frame tweets without having to convert it into a corpus or something

i am attempting to read a text file strip the punctuation make everything lower case then print the total number of words the total number of unique words meaning that a for instance if it is in the text 20 times will only be counted once then print the most frequently occuring words along with their frequency a 20

array 3 is array of words which include punctuation and looks like this i try to compare words with this array to get rid off of the punctuation in this case dots but later i planned rest of the punctuation to take care of

1 exact words match with punctuation inside words like 20-year-old

given the relatively simple decomposition words separated by white-space or punctuation i think a more prosaic solution may be necessary

it also won t match words directly before or after punctuation

you don t need as will match between words and punctuation

i m one of those who prefers words to punctuation -- it s one of the reasons i ve picked python over perl for example

b matches words and punctuation is considered words delimiters

b is perl-regex for words boundary and so will match things with punctuation or spaces although it s not strictly equivalent to what you re doing there s a whole bunch more punctuation that ll work

if you prefer words to punctuation you can also spell it push

use regex with w+ pattern to match words and exclude punctuation

b will match words boundaries a space a newline character punctuation character or end of string

and if you want to match words poker should be preceded and followed by a word-boundary for example a space a punctuation or an end-of-file you should enclose your matching group with b .


uialertview	uialertcontroller	4
note that this is nothing new even in obj-c the new apis prefer using blocks over performselector compare uialertview which uses respondstoselector and performselector to call delegation methods with the new uialertcontroller

i d like the uitextfield in a uialertcontroller look like the old uialertview rounded corners lighter gray

however take some time to consider how you re currently using uialertview and whether you are able to give ios 8 users a better experience by supporting uialertcontroller

but in your case alertview is displayed above alertcontroller ie why it feels like uialertview is whitier than uialertcontroller


apache-fop	xhtml	2
xhtml has a stronger syntax than html and is easier to convert to apache-fop this way

given that xhtml is an extension from xml i d recommend using apache-fop


joptionpane	jdialog	4
i m trying to make a jdialog with the size of the joptionpane that contains but function getsize is returning something a little bit smaller than the joptionpane and the button of accept is not seen

as part of the processing joptionpane invokes getwindowforcomponent on the argument before passing it through to the underlying jdialog which is slightly more general

usually when people want more flexibility than joptionpane offers it s basically a bunch of static factories for a few dialogs they write their own dialogs using jdialog

using jdialog instead of joptionpane is better to put number of data


springsource	grails	4
i also choose grails over simplicity and there are lots of java lib such as jasper report jawr etc and i am glad that now they join with springsource which makes their base solid

then in springsource tool suite right-click your project and select grails tools - refresh dependencies

from the top navigation bar select springsource tool suite select preferences ... in the type filter text field type in grails click and highlight grails you can then manually add the paths of all installed grails versions so sts knows their existence

the community is smaller than grails but the project is supported by springsource who is quite active in the community


pbkdf2	salt	14
nist recommend pbkdf2 with a unique salt your passwords are secure

since pbkdf2 s standard recommends salt of at least 64 bits it s a waste to generate keys smaller than your input so use at least 8 bytes

although because pbkdf2 applies your hash function a large number of times a long salt is less important than in traditional straight hashing applications. for my application i use a 32 byte random salt unique for each users account where i m hashing their password with pbkdf2

just use pbkdf2 to make your hash directly make a 64 bit 8 byte random salt use a higher iteration count 4000-10000

you should add a salt and use a slower hashing method such as pbkdf2 and bcrypt

as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people

then pick scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 determine the iteration count work factor that takes the amount of time you expect to have available during peak load use a cryptographically random salt of 8 to 16 bytes or so and store the salt plaintext the iteration count work factor plaintext so it can be increased trivially and the resulting hash in the database storage medium

it should be in my opinion more strongly noted that password hashing with salt is no longer secure and should not be used as others noted use pbkdf2 or bcrypt

why do people suggest using key stretching algorithms like bcrypt pbkdf2 which take longer to calculate on purpose rather than using faster algorithms which are also secure like salt sha-256 or sha-512 and using a throttling mechanism to limit brute-force attacks

pbkdf2 is more secure than a simple hash or even a salt hash

an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

i recommend using pbkdf2 rather than just salt sha2 since it includes stretching as well as salting

a randomly salt one way hashing algorithm would be ideal and sha1 and above should be fine though pbkdf2 would be better

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt


chr	toupper	1
i tried solving it using the chr and ord functions but ord s signature is chars - int and not chars - int so it doesn t match with toupper and tolower s


nsviewcontroller	nssplitview	1
i ve tried a great deal of configuration changes i ve tried using an nssplitviewcontroller vs just dropping an nssplitview into an nsviewcontroller to adjust more parameters programmatically but i m not having any luck


mergesort	heapsort	12
normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort

as for me i prefer mergesort and heapsort because i forget how actually quicksort works

heapsort tends to be slower than mergesort for the same reason.

it s common for it to outperform heapsort and mergesort worst case o n log n sorts in practice despite its higher worst case

2-3 times faster than mergesort or heapsort

what baffles me is that my mergesort seems to be slower than heapsort in both of the languages

you can pick between quicksort mergesort or heapsort

for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

of course you just asked for advice about sorting on stack overflow so i feel compelled to ask you if you need an in-place sort what kind of big-o performance you re looking for and then ask you to choose between quicksort introsort heapsort mergesort and stoogesort for what will work best for you

so based on that i would choose heapsort in preference to mergesort if i didn t care about the stability of the sort so as to minimise memory usage

typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average


rspec	minitest	6
minitest has much more than most people know for example minitest spec has bdd matchers akin to rspec minitest mock is a mocking system and minitest benchmarking is for performance profiling

since im using fixtures would this maybe be a db cleaner issue im not using it right now as im only using pre-created fixtures currently i ve never used db cleaner with minitest as im only familiar with using it with rspec and factory girl

you can write a simple test script to verify this but using test unit rspec or minitest is even better

minitest or rspec is more or less global to your test suite in that all of your specs will be written using that same framework

in minitest i could add this check for each class with 1 line include diameterizableinterfacetest. in rspec it takes 4 more lines

i prefer minitest over rspec


fgets	fgetc	6
fgetc is a function to read a single char simpler than using fgets

i used fleshgrinder s filter class to replace r with n in the stream see accepted answer and replaced fgets with fgetc to get more realtime access to contents of stdout

fgets or fgetc is a better approach

fgets or fgetc are faster as they don t need to drag the whole formatting variable argument list ballet of fscanf into the program

i ll agree with seth however that fgets or fgetc would be more appropriate for the first loop

if not multiple fgets calls will still be faster than multiple fgetc calls because the overhead of the latter will be greater


onclick	onchange	14
i would also recommend changing the select onclick event to onchange so that it only gets called when the user actually changes he value

the button has onclick event while the select has onchange event

maybe using the event onchange instead of onclick would be more elegant

here s something that should get you started - this is all based on the assumption that there are only 3 checkboxes on your whole page and that you re interested in all of them - you ll want to make a method like this respond to your checkbox elements onclick events - i ve found that to be more reliable than onchange

note that onclick is better supported with checkbox and radio button than is onchange

however i found that the onchange will run first compare with onclick

i think you should use onchange event for whole select rather than onclick for its options

select onclick onchange not working

in this case what i d do is try to bind a handler to the select onchange event onclick on the select element might work too...

add onchange to your select rather than onclick to each option

checkbox onchange should be more meaningful than onclick

in the example the javascript is called with a select onchange event i can call the javascript from a button onclick event

or here select onclick onchange not working

however even though i have tried the javascript and jquery events onclick onchange select keyup i can t make it work


d3.js	canvasjs	1
canvasjs is more of creating charts using canvas element of html5 and d3.js uses svg


atoi	atof	4
i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10

as pointed out by n.m in the comments atof takes a float as input - the fibonacci sequence is generated using an int so atoi is more appropriate

upon further investigation it seemed that the more times atoi and atof were called the quicker they executed

both atoi and atof are more or less broken


versioning	upgrade	262
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning

instead of this i want my older versioning application to be upgrade replaced by newer

if you have recently upgrade to a versioning of apache greater than versioning 2.2 the authz_core error error might be coming from your httpd.conf or httpd-vhosts.conf file in the tags

currently i am having the app that has lot of functionality and it is available free for users on appstore but i want that the user can upgrade the same app to paid versioning to view more functionality

on our pc versioning the basic versioning of the app is free and users upgrade to the paid versioning to get more features

the db was upgrade from sql express and when i select versioning it says it s web edition

downsides are that you have to digitally sign the application assemblies and clickonce manifest so clickonce can verify the upgrade and replace the older versioning instead of creating a brand new installation clickonce only installs into a user-specific app directory not into the all users program files directory and you cannot have any user-customizable install settings like installing various components or sidechaining additional package installs besides prerequisites

when attempting to access the admin side of wordpress if the db versioning is lower than your wordpress versioning expects it will redirect you to a database upgrade page

if you think that writing two apps for both versioning is a better idea then should i write app on wp8 first and at the end remove special wp8 features to downgrade it for wp7.5 or maybe i should write wp7.5 app and then add some wp8 features to upgrade it to wp8

i would not test that compressing a particular input produces a particular output because that might break if you upgrade the compression library to a versioning that does a better job of compressing

windows installer rollback will work as you request if you use 1 a minor upgrade or 2 a properly sequenced major upgrade that uninstalls the older versioning after successfully updating all files

one thing before the problem the upgrade from one wix packaged sw to another wix packaged sw is actually working fine i am able to uninstall the older versioning and install the newer versioning

grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your

obviously this may cause problems such as missing functionality that was released in later versioning of devtools but if you can t upgrade it s better than not having it

major versioning upgrade are even more difficult

the upgrade works correctly but if uninstall new build for example build 9 and install an old one example 3 i got an error although nothing currently installed on my machine this versioning is older than installed one

upgrading a language or service can often have disastrous or unexpected consequences thus sandboxing alternate versioning seems the better approach plus it makes projects immune from os upgrade

open your project and select upgrade settings for new versioning

upgrade your python versioning or try an older versioning of simplejson or switch to a python 2.4 compatible json module if you can not upgrade

this convention changed ever so slightly with the mvc 5 webapi 2 release so if you follow a somewhat outdated tutorial or one that s for the newer versioning while using the older or upgrade the mvc versioning in your project or add webapi to an existing mvc project you might end up with duplicate or wrong code

beside tuning the various options of jvm i would also suggest to upgrade to a newer release of the vm because later versioning have much better tuned garbage collector also without trying the new experimental one

if you overwrite the env versioning the rake db migrate will go downgrade rather than upgrade if versioning is smaller than last known versioning in db schema so please check and avoid similar environment variable

requirements to perform a major upgrade include having a higher product versioning and a different product code

bear in mind that you can buy upgrade editions of vs and upgrade from the express versioning or even eclipse

you can also upgrade to django development versioning it has more versatile list_filter implementation see which can be used for providing advanced admin filters including or-queries

i highly recommend upgrade to the latest versioning of spree currently 1.0.0 as spree-conference was just announcing it

if your curl is older than that versioning then you need to upgrade

if the most-recent versioning is lower than the running app versioning run your upgrade and bump the versioning

the problem was the same on both versioning though perhaps a bit worse after the upgrade

then i tryed following changing upgrade code of product - and make high versioning again then uninstall and install lower versioning - and it worked fine

if you are using an out of date mod_wsgi versioning then i also suggest you upgrade to use the better way of handling this as described in that blog post

the manage link used to come up fine if there are more than one versioning for a document but since i ve upgrade to angular 1.2.0 whenever i create a new document which automatically creates one versioning for it and do subsequent edits on the same document creating more than one versioning the manage link fails to appear

and if somebody is running a 6-month old versioning with a known bug upgrade becomes a more acceptable answer if they are 12 versioning behind

so upgrade to use a newer tomcat by the way tomcat 6 is very old and you should use at least 8 or use an older dynamic web module versioning

this also might be fixed solved in the git add mechanism in more up to date versioning i vaguely remember them adding their own .gitignore files to empty directories so i d really recommend trying to upgrade to the highest git versioning you can for that and other benefites your distro may provide by default an older versioning as ubuntu and debian do

i ve been using delphi since versioning 2 and since moving up to around v5 v6 i ve never upgrade to get newer features - but instead to get around bugs in the ide compiler

now i want to convince it by using apt-pinning and not hold to keep the local package if the versioning is the same and try to upgrade only if the remote versioning is newer

you have to make sure your local sql instance is exactly at the same build versioning versioning like the hosting provider otherwise your local sql may upgrade the database structure and you ll be unable to restore it back on the hosting provider or you ll be unable to restore in on your local server if your versioning is earlier than the host s

so i want to upgrade codeigniter to new versioning to have more functionalities and robustness

you used a older versioning of vagrant before 1.5 versioning and made an upgrade to vagrant greater than 1.5 versioning

but as you can see the first versioning is way better not to mention that all php versioning below 5.6 are already outdated - so i d strongly encourage you to upgrade instead

if you have six versioning less than 1.10 upgrade it

it s actually doing a major upgrade and by scheduling removeexistingproducts early the upgrade is removing the older versioning before installing the newer versioning

regardless the in app purchase upgrade would be less crackable than a paid for full versioning

apt-get upgrade actually installs the newer versioning

if you want to upgrade dependencies major versioning it s more trickier

you can safely upgrade to trunk its better than last versioning anyway

the upgrade sequence is much simpler i have a hard link in the app that points to the latest versioning of the apk the donwload starts and automatically laucnhes the install

i would recommend upgrade to v6 or at minimum the latest versioning of v5

i recall an application i inherited that faced a similar situation the programmer who wrote the app keyed off two fields in the database one - the current versioning number prior to any installer running it would check the versioning number so if the database had a higher versioning than the installer was attempting the install would abort secondly in the same table that stored the versioning build another column stored the state of the database operational upgrade in process etc so if the versioning # was older that was the second check if an install was already in progress the secondly launched installer would abort

if using the versioning of groovy you want and frequent upgrade is more important then consider gmavenplus

if the versioning is older than 0.10 please upgrade

major versioning upgrade require more research more refactoring and more testing

if you got a lot of time you can upgrade just glibc but that is usually more trouble than it s worth since the newer versioning may have newer symbols and old symbols may have been relocated

i have also considered using game center groups to make sure you are playing a player from the same app versioning but ultimately decided that getting users to upgrade is a better plan

so my guess is the hosting provider upgrade something maybe mysql to a versioning that requires stronger passwords

if you could upgrade to that versioning there is less that has to be done

it s a google developer tool which bundle majors javascript libraries and make it easier to deploy upgrade and make them lighter by always using compressed versioning

i don t think this capability utf8mb4 exists in mysql 5.1 as evidenced by the query below making this yet another reason why you never run a versioning on a slave that is lower than the versioning on the master and when doing upgrade you always want to upgrade the slave first

you are using a method to bind click event in your case is live and this has been removed in the latest jquery libraries from 1.9+ onwards so make sure your versioning is less than 1.9 or better to upgrade the library and use the recommended method for it .on to delegate the event event delegation syntax is little different with .on

my requirement is i need to upgrade the existing versioning currently installed versioning on the computer of the application if and only if the new application s versioning is higher than the existing versioning

avassetwriter	avassetexportsession	2
this will work directly with avassetexportsession which is much easier than playing with avassetwriter unless you have a very specific requirement typically you need to manipulate the actual video frames

in my experience avassetexportsession is slightly more performant than using avassetreader and avassetwriter for a straight forward format a - format b type conversion however that said it s probably not by enough to be too concerned about


imagemagick	mogrify	1
if they are png images that you are trying to turn into jpgs i d recommend installing imagemagick via homebrew and using the mogrify command to change them see


text-align	text-indent	1
edit maybe a less tricky way with text-indent and text-align


html5lib	beautifulsoup	4
according to their documentation beautifulsoup and html5lib sometimes perform better depending on the input

now i m trying to select between beautifulsoup and html5lib modules but i didn t find any simple examples of using html5lib i need just to extract some text from the certain div element with stripping all the other tags inside

out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup

i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautifulsoup


chown	umask	1
but changing the chmod maybe even working with umask is better than dealing with root-access and using chown


d3.js	protovis	5
the team behind protovis has since created d3.js so this is likely a better option than protovis

the result is that using d3.js can feel a little lower-level - you have more control but you have to be pretty familiar with svg syntax to do some of the things protovis does much more easily

for semantic zooming you ll notice that d3.js is significantly faster than protovis

i m new to protovis although it is no longer under development and d3.js is the newer software

finally i haven t done much with animation but i think you re entirely correct - d3.js provides more animation support than protovis especially in terms of animated transitions


hikaricp	c3p0	4
while you are at it you might want to try the hikaricp database connection pool instead of c3p0 i suspect hikaricp is better at recovering from broken database connections

imo i would recommend using hikaricp rather than c3p0 or tomcat

i would also recommend you to check hikaricp as its way much better than c3p0

i would recommend hikaricp over c3p0 but that is personal preference


easymock	jmock	2
for mock i would prefer mockito to jmock or easymock

libraries like easymock and jmock make this easier to do


mako	genshi	3
mako jinja genshi all offer a more flexible alternative to django templates

for building html pages i prefer genshi over cheetah or mako even if it s quite a bit slower

or you can choose between mako genshi jinja2 or whatever you like for your templates


lasagne	pybrain	1
the question is - how to achieve it with nolearn lasagne or maybe pybrain - it will also work but i prefer nolearn


gulp-minify-css	gulp-clean-css	1
first gulp-minify-css is deprecated and they recommend using gulp-clean-css so you should try updating that


jscrollbar	jslider	1
aside you should probably look into using a jslider which seems more natural than using a jscrollbar for value adjustment


.htaccess	httpd.conf	10
instead of mucking with httpd.conf you might get better results with .htaccess

these two lines are in the .htaccess at root level of the site - the configuration in the main httpd.conf is considerably more complex but just that sets particular options for the ssl within the admin area and doesn t affect non-admin areas so i know this works whether it will for you i cannot say

the best way will be to use httpd.conf even if .htaccess seems easier

ask your hosting company to set the limitrequestbody directive in either your httpd.conf file or a local .htaccess to be higher

i have read that setting changes in httpd.conf are much better as compared to making changes in .htaccess as the later one is parsed at runtime while .conf is parsed at the time of starting apache

using apaches httpd.conf is faster since accessing the .htaccess adds a small overheadâ apache checks every directoryâ and parent directoryâ for the file and it will be loaded for every request

according to apache http server tutorial .htaccess files you should prefer httpd.conf over .htaccess files

easy fix is adding directoryindex index.php to a .htaccess of that directory but we should try to avoid using .htaccess and prefer httpd.conf

doing it via mode_rewrite in httpd.conf or in .htaccess will be more efficient than doing it via a php script

this goes in your root .htaccess but if you have access to httpd.conf that is better


super	implements	1
most of the patterns i ve seen will either break when inheritance level is more than 2 levels child parent grandparent or use more resources by implements super through closures


mocha	jasmine-node	1
i recommend mocha highly or jasmine-node as good starting places


mockito	scalamock	2
scalamock looks more natural when developing applications in scala however from what i read it seems to support fewer test scenarios compared to mockito and it s also less mature

mockito has been around a lot longer than scalamock and is much more actively maintained because of it s much larger contributor base


strophe	smack	2
you can use combination of smack strophe and openfire to get your java based app work as desired

since fb support xmpp protocol u can set an xmpp chat client using lib lik smack strophe asmack etc.


invalidoperationexception	argumentexception	2
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

i think the argumentexception is more appropriate because the invalidoperationexception documentation says that the object itself on what the method is called has to be in an invalid state right


grafana	metrics	1
we do create lot of dashboards in grafana which are more or less combination of few metrics and dimensions but that s becoming challenge as we need to setup two processes one for rt and other for batch due to ttl limitation on real-time index 15 days ttl was finalised after considering es health in mind


textview	imageview	40
i want to have another textview underneath these two but i am having a problem when the textview length is less than the imageview

textview have higher z order than imageview

use compound drawables - a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

i tried constraints spacing each imageview with xdp it is ok if all textview are not higher than the imageview but if a textview is higher than a imageview it will overlap

i got the middle textview to fill up what s left and some extra - leaving the left imageview to be smaller than the 40dip i ve set it to be

make textview lower than imageview

if the textview might be bigger make sure to center the imageview as well

the imageview should be closer to left margin and the textview with tel should be closer to image

i usually do this with nested linearlayouts containing a textview and imageview for the icon but obviously using these compound textview is cleaner

the refresh works fine and i get the refreshed data but the images within swiperefreshlayout cardview textview imageview .. are getting smaller and smaller with each new refresh

i want to design a screen which contains some ten identical components each component contains textview and imageview .what s the better way to design it

in the image the square represents a fixed size imageview the rectangle is a textview which can 1 line smaller height than imageview or multiline height is larger than imageview

when the textview text is longer than cardview length it shows against the imageview and i don t want that

for api 18 and earlier the margin is being applied after the alignment so if the margin in the imageview is greater than 0 you will get your textview moved

all 3 states are much more than an imageview + textview so i went for 3 different layouts for every state and only 1 of them is visible at a time

a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more

a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

but i don t know how to align the imageview and the textview to be easier to hide show just the imageview when needed

in this case if textview is higher then imageview imageview aspect ratio should be intact with max width possible and if imageview i higher then textview again width should be maximal and parent should have height as imageview

how could i make the imageview have more priority than textview

i have a button that is bottom constrained to the bottom of the imageview however should be top constrained to the bottom of the subtitle textview if subtitletextview is taller than imageview

but the android guide says use compound drawables - a linearlayout which contains an imageview and a textview can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable

the button itself has an elevation greater than the imageview and textview so even though they are defined after the button they will still be below it in elevation and be invisible

i m having a problem displaying the layout when my imageview and textview takes up more than 3 4 of the screen

assuming the imageview is always bigger than the textview it ll drive the parent height

double edit so what was happening is that your layout_alignbottom in the linktitle textview was shorter than the height of two lines of text therefore it was cropping the title to limit the height of the textview to that of the favicon imageview

in your sample xml add two more fields one filepathurl textview second add one more textview with text playvideo and setvisibility to gone and set the visibility of files imageview to gone

i need to add more than one textview and imageview in listitem and also i need to add header s at some random positions

i have a larger view with a textview and an imageview inside of it

i have an issue i m creating a uiview that is returned from a method and that part is fine but what i ve noticed is that when i add sublayers to one of the subviews those layers overlap subviews that are higher up in the hierarchy textview and imageview the sublayers added to testviewcopy are appearing over top of these subviews and they aren t supposed to

i have an imageview that is bigger than a textview and i want to center the textview on top of the imageview both vertically and horizontally

however the imageview has a smaller width than the textview

i have tried to put my imageview in a linearlayout and put a weight on it but if my imageview is smaller i have a blank between the imageview and the textview

i also tried to do spacing from imageview to textview but then if the textview is smaller than the imageview the spacing will be wrong again

i want to set imageview and textview on same line in linearlayout but the imageview is always higher than the textview

this should work as long as the imageview is larger than the textview in all dimensions

add layout_weight properties to sub views as well.assign 3 to imaveview and 1 for textview now imageview always will be bigger than textview 3times and textview can not invade imagevies s space

the imageview is bit taller than the textview and so what i do is add padding margins to the bottom of textview to get it align and look like the imageview and textview horizontal centers are aligned

i have more than 20+ textview and imageview in my activity like this

i try to align my imageview and my textview but the imageview is higher than my textview


atoi	strtok	1
for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null


maven	m2e	30
instead of fixing this configuration manually you can have m2e fix this for you just right-click on the project and choose maven update project

once eclipse has downloaded the software choices select m2e - maven integration for eclipse under general purpose tools

once generated run mvn eclipse eclipse if you are using the maven eclipse plugin or right-click on your project and select maven update project configuration if you are using m2e

that way of adding dependencies is better managed by maven with m2e

select m2e - maven integration for eclipse

if you are using m2e be sure to right click on the project select maven and then update project configuration

getting m2e to match maven s classpath

this has worked tremendously well and doesn t require any additional support or plugins from any of ides out there which is a great plus - number two reason we didn t choose maven was seeing how m2e basically took over eclipse

another way to build the ear file is using the m2e plugin right click on the parent pom.xml file and choose maven install then start the application server and use the wls deploy in order to deploy the ear file

i have downloaded maven 3.x successfully but when i am opening eclipse ide file new project and need to select maven project then i am not able to view the maven folder itself .i dont know whether i need m2e plugin or what as i am new to this .please guide me on this

if you are using m2e you can try to update the project right-click on your project in your package explorer select maven the update project

i recommend using maven eclipse and m2e

the problem i found with the m2e though was that it always got so horribly ridiculously go-have-a-coffee-break-while-you-wait-for-it slow performance when the maven project became larger adding more and more sub-projects

as far as i remember the support of wtp was removed from the plugin since the maven eclipse m2e plugin got more advanced

the eclipse builder uses simpler logic than maven so sometimes the things m2e does are just not enough

moreover i m using m2e the maven plugin for eclipse so it seems that the compatibility of any maven plugins that might work by themselves is even less likely with m2e

to enable m2e on an existing project right-click on it in the package explorer view then select maven - enable dependency management this will add the maven builder to the .project file and the classpath container to the .classpath file

i recommend m2e plugin for eclipse maven integration

they recommend using maven and i thought this would help so i downloaded m2e and the android m2e plugin from the android marketplace

when using maven m2e within eclipse i can right click a project and choose maven - update project to synchronize my classpath source folders etc

you need m2e installed for this. go to import and select existing maven projects

with 0.13 m2e this no longer works as the maven builder appears to put things in target your-artificat-version-snapshot web-inf classes

since you re using m2e you can then right-click on the project then select maven download sources

in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way

once you do that open up the console view and select maven console you should see m2e printing out log messages detailing the index download

m2e is also a platform that let others provide better integration with additional maven plugins android web development etc.

when using the m2e you should update your project configuration by right-clicking on the project and select maven - update project configuration

in case you want to update your snapshot releases inside eclipse when using m2e m2e right click the affected project then select maven - update project... - ok with selected project causing problems

maven 2 has a steeper learning curve but provides a much richer set of functionality for building your projects and eclipse integration through m2e or iam

if i right click on my project and select maven -- update project configuration after modifying the pom.xml file etc m2e seems to re-order the build path libraries so that maven dependencies come after the jre system libs which i don t want


rtp	sip	1
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.


for-loop	loops	432
frankly if you need to increment decrement a for-loop makes sense if you don t know the bounds and there is no real increment decrement a while loops makes more sense

using a while loops we can control the flow of i better than a for-loop

my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2

in the hopes that this will further my goal of squashing out the stupid for loops are inherently slow canard for r here is a re-working of your first version still using a for-loop that is more than 40x times faster

you need here while loops better than for-loop

to optimize what you have a for-loop would be much faster than a for in loops

using for-loop is much simpler if you use condition as limit for breaking loops

one there is a race condition in the for-loop between the point where you compare loops counter and where you increment it

i could use a nested for-loop but was wondering if there is a way to achieve this in with one of the apply family members since nested for loops are considered more or less bad practice in r

here i started above testing with the aim that c for-loop performance will be better than c# loops but it goes exactly opposite with my understanding and gone with this question and agreed...but when i increase the upper range of for-loop the c performance goes well as compared to c#.

it would seem that you know how many times you want your loops to iterate len pl so a for-loop might be a better tool

while loops aren t normally used to iterate over arrays as for-loop syntax is less verbose and allows the sentinel variable i to fall out of scope while the for-loop syntax does not

in theory the while loops is quicker because the for-loop looks up the length attribute of foo every time though loops but in real-world use it s going to make an immeasurably small difference

the while loops seems tighter than a for-loop from previous answer but look up for vs while logic

you should use a for-loop which is more convenient to loops in an arrays

i was thinking of making it stitched into one image especially since i am planning on making the images smaller which would make loops need ever more time. so that it didn t have to run through the double for-loop every time it renders shooting for 60 fps

is for-loop is faster than while loops

the result is okay but it is slow.is there any way that i can do this with loops instead of arrayfun because i check for-loop is faster than arrayfun

however the while loops remains a little slower than the for-loop

use a for-each loops to go through a range it s not as fast as using a variant arrays but keeps things simple and offers better speed than a for-loop

also this example uses a for each loops but a for-loop is probably better requires you to count the rows in the first column

the conclusion of the article is that using for-loop is generally better and faster than the foreach loops

the only browser where the while loops was slower than the for-loop was in opera

additionally you should reset i each time you go through loops and a for-loop makes more sense than a while loops especially if you re using c99 as i can be declared within loops

the for-loop is using i as a global variable so if your instance.set_marker function is also using i as a global variable and sets its value to something greater than 6 loops will exit

the for-loop question is more of someone building a loops with exit criterion inside the actual loops

i changed the genrandom function to genrandomword length and instead of using a while loops i used a for-loop which is easier to see how long it will run for

i realize using a for-loop would be best here however while loops are easier to do in asm so i used a while loops

1 set up the for-loop - do initializer check that we can perform the first loops

if your loops is dependant on being able to extract the iteration index out to pass it elsewhere then perhaps a for-loop may be a better choice

as the simple for-loop is faster than a foreach loops

the scope of the variable in the test of the while loops is wider than the scope of variables declared in the header of the for-loop

for-loop is faster then foreach and foreach is faster then for in loops

now you can walk your collection with a for-loop without fearing that one arrays is shorter than another one or even use a foreach loops to go through elements without using an index

then for-loop with each loops subtracting the smaller area from the larger one and incrementing a counter

then you should achive them with a counter and maybe a for-loop is better then while loops

if you want to do more columns as a loops you need to increment this value in the same maner you are incrementing r in your for-loop

it might be better than a for-loop in the terms of readability maintainability but keep in mind that linq usually slower than plain loops tl

and now i want to use either a for-loop or a while loops i don t know which one is the best but from my novice experience i feel a for-loop would work better but i can t find a solution to generate random number and make my loops generate that amount of names

the other option is to use a foreach loops which is slightly slower than a for-loop but works almost equivalently for all practical purposes

and a for-loop may be better for you situation instead of the foreach loops since you are primarily working on index instead of doing stuff just with the values

there will be no real difference in performance between the foreach and the for loops - therefore the for-loop will be a better alternative for the situation you want to achieve

firstly while a for-loop is not wrong here a for each loops is more appropriate

i came across a situation where i need to implement a for-loop with more than one loops control variable

turn your for-loop into while loops to understand this better

can anyone explain why the while loops is taking more time than the for-loop even though the looping of i and j is almost same

a for-loop is faster than a foreach loops

the obvious problem is that your c-style for-loop would be better as a range but you never use within loops block

i couldn t figure out how to get the while loops to iterate more than once for this particular case so i used a for-loop

this conclusion would follow from a logic if an unrolled loops is faster than a for-loop executing a lot of unrolled loops should be faster than executing a lot of for loops

also i ve used a for-loop and not jquery each loops on the sections elements because a for-loop is much faster due to the lack of function callback an each function has

the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal

so you d expect the naive loops to be faster for small values of y because those fewer number of operations in the for-loop outperform the log2 reduction of the fast approach as long as the time lost for those extra operations is more than the time gained by log2 reducing y

hey guys can anyone tell me why my code in this jsperf seems to indicate that a for-loop is actually faster than a while loops

if you are counting up from 0 to n you can use a single for-loop from 0 to 100 would work in the example above while nesting for loops works better if you re using non numerical ids

i also changed the for-loop that you had there to foreach loops which makes more sense when working with arrays

that is because that style of loops is a better fit for what you are doing than the for-loop you used earlier

so you can access the arrays at any index between the range of 0 and array.length - 1 alas if you wanted to use a for in loops to iterate over an arrays you certainly can however a regular for-loop is more appropriate

a for-loop is usually faster than a while loops and it is more difficult to build an endless loops than it is by using a while loops

further as a for-loop it is easier to read as everything initialization loops condition expression to be executed after each iteration are all on one line

a while loops makes more sense to me than your use of a for-loop

in the main method call your new method as many times as you need using whatever construct you prefer for-loop while loops thread executor etc for each file that needs to be processed

i require a c c++ macro to trace the for-loop iterations in the existing source code and to print some message if loops is running more that 50 iterations

the multiprocessed loops is slower than doing the for-loop

if you have a loops counter you should generally use a for-loop to make that clearer

of course you can shove multiple statements in a for-loop initialisation or final-expression by separating them with commas but if that is anything more complicated than i++ j++ k-- it quickly gets too messy for my taste and a while loops would be a better choice

for-each loops is an iterable form of ordinary for-loop which is a better built data structure

instead of getting the length method to treat a single element statement as an arrays i think a better solution would be to use a foreach loops instead of a for-loop to iterate

first you could try to convert the second do while loops to a for-loop which is more appropriate for the situation but i did not use for simplicity s sake

algorithms the instructor said the for-loop will take less time then while loops for the following sample algo

the while loops would be better to write as a for-loop

the workaround is usually using a for-loop and manipulating the loop-variable appropriately but in your case a while loops is simpler

according to benchmark both sefan and the while loops answers take the same ammount of time fruity the while loops answers take a bit shorter with the for-loop answers in second but the multiple loops do answers take far longer

i would predict that iterating over a traditional fixed-size arrays would be more efficient with a for-loop and dynamically allocated storage would be faster with the range-based loops

a for-loop would be better for this type of question because you are iterating over elements there is no real condition to check which would make a while loops better stylistically they result in the same output

don t use a for-loop when a while loops is more appropriate

a for-loop is more appropriate than a while loops in your code

really a while loops would probably have been clearer than a for-loop on reflection

also the native for-loop is faster than any other jquery loops method

the foreach loops is slower than the for-loop yet most people don t rewrite all of their code to use the for

your for-loop iterates over compares loops variable to menunames.length while your using the indexer of the items arrays

in practical programming languages the distinction between the two is a bit blurred but is important to know that the c java for-loop is closer to a theoretical while loops while the pascal for behaves more like the theoretical for-loop

python code is almost always going to be slower than c code so it s not too shocking that a for-loop may be faster than a while loops in some situations

again same error but while loops clearly survived more than for-loop

i think in terms of performance using a single for-loop is faster am i right 3 linqs will be eventually converted to 3 loops

a becomes 10 while it is still inside of the for-loop and gets larger than 10 when the while loops goes for a second run

i have tried creating an if statement inside a for-loop to say if loops is more than 0 and the div is open then run the code so if the div isn t showing then do nothing - but this doesn t work

why simd for-loop only 14 faster than foreach loops

however deleting the initialization loops or putting some more code between the initialization and the for second for-loop removes this phenomenon and any combination of volatiles have the same running time

i prefer the bash c for-loop it doesn t require conditionals to escape loops and looks neater

you can use a while loops to achieve the desired results but a for-loop is much easier to implement in this situation

which loops is a better fit do while or a for-loop

so why while loops is faster than for-loop and why need bunch of lists

in some cases hand-writing a for-loop is much faster than the equivalent accelerate functions because the compiler can optimize your loops better than the function

in older browsers and some not so old a negative while loops will be faster than a for-loop if it can be used

if you need to do something a set number of times a for-loop is generally more concise than a while loops

a for-loop would be more compact but a while loops is perhaps simpler if you aren t used to python s loops

i have an expensive for-loop that is taking more time than it should due to dynamic casting overhead inside loops

note that the for-loop based on the string assignment a_string runs one time more than loops based on the inline assignment a_inline -- notice the last number -3.46945e-18

edit yes i understand that i can declare loops as but that still demonstrates that for-loop declarations have a higher scope than their curly brackets

i ve done a small experiment as will be shown below and it looks like that a while loops is faster than a for-loop in perl

then you can use for each or for or while loops yet i rather user for-loop to identify sequence better

i was told that a while loops was more efficient than a for-loop

for example you know foreach loops is heavy and if we use for-loop is better

a for-loop in general requires less memory than a foreach loops and in this case a for-loop would be more suitable

one occasionally relevant difference between the two is that a while loops can have a more complex condition imposed on it than a for-loop

to my mind a for-loop is simpler to understand than traversing the list backwards with a while loops

also as mark byers pointed out loops would be simpler to understand if you refactored it into a for-loop rather than a while

there are no fundamental reasons why a ranged-based for-loop would be slower than a manual loops

i m assuming a while loops or a for-loop would be less cumbersome

and normal for-loop is faster than for-in loops

i prefer for-loop that for each loops

however arrayfun is just a for-loop in disguise and is often slower than writing loops explicitly

not sure if a for-loop or a while loops would be better

note since there are only 5 fields a for-loop may be more complicated then unrolling loops

and perhaps a for-loop would be a better choice than a while loops in this case

a for-loop may be more suitable for this than a foreach loops

i am adding views dynamically to linear layout in a for-loop of more than 100 loops

in case anyone is curious i ended up refactoring the code and hoisting the whole inner for-loop with i_max outside making the really_big_int loops be much simpler and hopefully easy to vectorize

also ++i increments before you run loops and isn t conventionally used in java and java lets you declare variables a part of your loops definition so i changed that for-loop to be more what your are looking for

i have also found replacing the foreach loops with a for-loop which are quicker

you need to move the document.getelementsbytagname out of the for-loop because after each loops you have less and less elements so you will eventually get a npe

both for loops have the same expected result with the reverse for-loop being more readable

and last if you know the number of loops it is much easier and better to read when you use a for-loop instead of a while loops

i know a while loops would be more applicable for an application like this but it would be good to know if this or something like this in a for-loop is possible

putting the whole thing in a for-loop makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops

first time array1 4 while loops true so go inside loops then upto 10000 time you are adding value so lets suppose it added 4+5 9 and third time which is 8 and if condition is false for-loop is executed one more time

so with the input age the first for-loop will run while i starting at 1 and incrementing by 1 each loops is less than 2 3 -1

i am now trying to load the data without using a for-loop i realise that for loops are sometimes faster in doing this but i m aiming for a compact script

so i decide instead of writing out chucks of code for each of the 10 possible health point not to mention there are other player stats that will be done in the same format i decided upon scraping together a for-loop with two if-else statements to attempt a loops to fill each grid element as long as the health value is greater than the for-loop s i

is the foreach loops slower than the for-loop

your loops would be better written with a simple for-loop like this

i prefer using for-loop instead of foreach loops for-loop is preferably faster than foreach loops when you do not have to do something to each element and can solve your problem by just using the index as follows

changing the for-loop to a do-while loops may be slightly faster - the for-loop has a conditional jump and an unconditional jump but a do-while loops only has a conditional jump

i think a for-loop might work better for you than a foreach loops

i would choose for-loop when there is known number maximum number of iterations before loops starts

i would assume that it has something to do with garbage collector but i m not sure why a while loops would require more gc attention than a for-loop

instead of the above for-loop you can also use the following loops which is even more efficient as this removes the need to find the square-root of the number

in this situation a for-loop would be more appropriate than a while loops

a c-style for-loop has more flexibility but ultimately you can write an equivalent loops with python s while or c s while for that matter which touches not only on the â œone obvious wayâ principle but also â œsimple is better than complexâ amongst others

i think you can best use the for-loop this gives you a little bit more control over loops

just my opinion but i much prefer for-loop conditional variables to be initialized in loops when possible

i prefer for-loop here as it is easier to see that loops will eventually terminate

the way you are using the kotlin for-loop is much closer to java s foreach loops for i indexes

usually if you re going to consume all the elements of the iterator in a single loops it is better to use the for-loop approach and it will be better using the enhanced for-loop that already uses iterator behind the scenes

would a nested for-loop be faster than a with loops

write a for-loop that loops through your arrays taking the integer value of each item and if it s less than min save it to min and if it s greater than max save it to max

i would expect a while loops to be slower than a for-loop since it needs to test a condition before each iteration

0 a do while loops that pre-decrements count --count and compares to zero is better than a for-loop that compares two variables

i have been figuring out on finding the right loops to print out values so i thought for-loop would be easier to work with

the range-based for-loop syntax is cleaner and more universal but you can t execute the code in loops for a specified range different than from begin to end

a for-loop is the typical way to count iterations but the syntax of a while loops may be more clear for a beginner

i searched a lot and discovered nice approaches of others that do solve my problem but out of curiosity i would love to know if there is solution to my problem that keeps the while-loop despite a for-loop would be more appropriate in the first place as i know the range but the day will come when i will need a while loops

microsoft document code review .net application performance recommends for-loop instead of foreach loops to improve the performance

you can write a for-loop that will do it in one pass over the ordered set and that loops will run much faster than the linqtoobjects

a for-loop is more natural than a while loops but you requested no for

as the shader code evolved the max length of the for-loop changed more code - smaller max leading me to suspect it has something to do with loops unrolling

for-loop is more suitable for any countable loops

in my tests i found that one of the loops i tested titled for-loop is astronomically slower than the other loops

you re calling the recursing inside the for-loop find a better place to put it in or just use a while loops

also a while loops seems more appropriate and self-explanatory in this situation than a for-loop

for the blank input requirement i recommend changing loops to a for-loop

if you want to use a counter in a loops a for-loop is typically more appropriate

even if a foreach loops were faster than a for-loop there are still operations being carried out that wouldn t be in your manual example

a while loops is more readable than a for-loop

so we can see that an optimised while loops is faster than a for-loop by 2 operations however it uses more stack space

instead of using indexof i used a nested for-loop since for loops are generally faster

i heard a rumor that for large list items a for-loop will work faster than a foreach loops

if the above is true doesn t this mean that the foreach loops is much slower then the common for-loop since it involves making copies of each element of the arrays

the for-loop should be more like â this is the template for safe for loops in c

or use a single for-loop and there is no need for nested loops that makes it more complex

if you need to care about this because you re in a very tight inner loops you re actually better off iterating with a for-loop on the list directly

a for-loop would be better than a while loops here

a for-loop can be more efficient if you skip further comparisons after a match edit and provides also an easy way to compute the total number of matches that the op s program accumulates during its loops this detail just slipped my mind...

using a for-loop or while loops will be faster than using map reduce and sort

on windows the while loops above is 20 faster than the original for-loop in google-chrome in ie and firefox both loops perform the same

also this loops is better created as a for-loop

for..each loops are slightly slower than a normal for-loop but has the added benefit of having access to the object directly already casted

in your check there is only one loops needed and a for-loop is much more conveniant

this was never intended to compare running times between languages but to see which form recursive tail recursive for-loop or while loops was faster for the languages i m learning

that is one of the reason when people generally prefer for-loop over while loops because in while loops some time we forget to modify the counter variable and some time we forget to initialize variables

just fyi this is sort of an exercise of why using a for-loop might be better than using a for each loops as you have done

i know a for-loop would have been better i tried with the for-loop at first but had the same problem nothing happens during the 2 seconds of the while loops and at the end of these 2 seconds the image suddenly goes from b w to color

the normal for-loop is useful when you don t want to visit every element in the arrays or if you have more than one loops variable

i don t really know why the 2nd inner loops runs n+1 times while the outer loops runs n times wouldn t the inner loops run once more before it exits out of the for-loop

if you insist on having the data in 2 arrays it is easier to iterate the arrays using a for-loop with an index instead of a foreach loops

based on this not created by me the while loops is 22 slower than a for-loop in general

in a for-loop of more than 100 loops

it s worth pointing out that in general the foreach loops is more expensive memory-wise compared to the for-loop see here for details

i feel like i have placed the prompt within the while loops in a way that doesn t make sense or that a for-loop may make more sense but while loops i have read are usually used for when you want the event to keep looping until a specific condition is met as opposed to in for loops when the event keeps looping until the variable count reaches a certain point

there s no point in using a for-loop a while loops is more readable

in ... for-loop it s consider better practice to loops trough it with a regular for

a while loops makes more sense in this situation or a for-loop without initialization

prefer map filter and reduce to for loops in general but donâ t obsess over it sometimes a for-loop is better

i have a comment on your for-loop q is never considered in the stopping condition therefore putting it within loops is more logical in my opinion

whether writing the for-loop like that is a good idea or why is it not just using the erase-remove idiom are different issues as a matter of fact the previous loops is arguably better than erase-remove for a list the concrete situation is that the semantics have changed and because the type is syntactically compatible with the previous one the compiler will not notice that the code is wrong it will not point you to that function and chances are that you will not review rewrite it

one of my professor told me for-loop was faster when scoldering me for never using them for readability i think for-loop are less readable than do... while loops

this is to demonstrate that you can achieve this without for loops however a simple for-loop is much more readable

salu is used for-loop counter so when you nest them more salu pressure is done and becomes a bottleneck when there are more than 9-10 loops nested maybe some intelligent algorithm using same counter for all loops should do the trick so not doing only salu in loops body but adding some valu instructions is a plus

making it a while loops instead of a for-loop is a warning that this kind of loops may be more complicated and in your case it is in fact more complicated

its really strange that the same doesn t work with a while loops as is said that a while loops is more fundamental that a for-loop

though your for-loop seems to be okay but may be your are trying to access some index inside loops which is 1 more than the current x value at some point

turns out that i needed a do-while loops inside a for-loop to get this cleaner

actually a for-loop over length - 1 multiplying by 10 each time through loops would be more efficient than using pow

you iterating i in for-loop so after first loops i is higher then rows

that means you don t know how many iterations you re going to need so a while loops is more suited to this task than a for-loop

benchmarking the and versions against a for-loop with set is informative here and demonstrates that loops version is faster than either of the approaches

in a language like c a for-loop is more or less syntactic sugar for a while loops

i was doing a leetcode challenge here for fun and was surprised that the while loops was more efficient than the for-loop

your loops would be cleaner as a for-loop

the reverse while loops is generally faster than a for-loop as well

note my use of a foreach loops here which is much neater than your for-loop for this kind of thing

the while loops is essentially the same thing implemented differently but in this situation the for-loop looks cleaner and easier to follow

in your for-loop you have given condition such that loops will execute only if the args arrays size is greater that 1

i think that instead of a for-loop is better a while because when you find your item can break loops

loops in c++ are most basic than python the for-loop is more simpler it is based on the three expression initializer expression loops test expression and the counting expression

on another level loops optimizations are much better suited to for loops afaik so a clever compiler might generate better code for the for-loop

a for-loop is nothing more than a glorified while loops

if you want an easy way to return from the outer function from inside loops you re better off with a simple for-loop

the nested loops version is the slower of the two due to the extra the interpreter overhead of the for-loop

foreach or for-loop is somewhat slower than an equivalent while loops or tail recursion the benchmark i linked to above shows a 15x performance difference with 1000+ iterations though it will likely depend on the version of scala and the version of the jre...

foreach can simplify the code in a for-loop but it is a heavy object and is slower than a loops written using for.

the way i like to see more than one for-loop in list comprehension is like the nested loops

now i went into this script there are for loops which are adding some values to the classpath for there are more than one for-loop

it works as i want but it looks a bit messy and i ve read that sometimes breaking from an outer for-loop within a .each loops is more neatly achieved with javascript

max_size must be big enough because a for-loop is slower than lapply you want to do as little loops through the for as possible but not too big or the list extension overhead will make the program slower

i could have built bmin and bmax using a simple for-loop too and it would probably have been faster but the while loops was more fun to write.

-in the same laptop but using the hpc cluster of my department with 30 workers the parfor loops is much much slower than the for-loop and than the parfor loops using the local cluster with 12 workers

this is one of the few cases where a while loops can be clearer and simpler than a for-loop

but this for-loop can be written more clearly as a while loops

if loops body can throw a checked exception a for-loop is clearly better

they are functionally identical however it can be argued that the for-loop is less error prone because all of loops functionality is right there together

also if you can do the above you can probably just as easily turn your code into a for-loop which seems more appropriate given your desire to a break out of loops b use the operator to cause side effects

the for-loop is slightly slower than the foreach loops

arraylist - for-loop is about more than 2 times faster speed than foreach loops

since i am using double nested loops i think for-loop is more suitable than while in this case

i could not create a test where a reverse for-loop was consistently faster than a normal loops but i m assuming adobe knows flash

i know that a for-loop would be a better way to generate the same data but i m interested in making this work with a repeat loops mostly just as an exercise and am struggling with the solution

unless your compiler does automatic vectorisation and loops unrolling your for-loop will be way slower than a vectorised memset

in your case for-loop is better as changed in loops value is numeric

but because loops count 1 i do not know when thread 1-5 finish their 1st round what username passwd they will pick for-loop 2

so your for-loop will complete before any of the timeouts run and before any of the ajax success callbacks run and all of the timeouts are scheduled to run 2000 milliseconds after loops finishes more or less at the same time

you could also test every time in the for-loop and include a break statement but because you don t know when it will stop i think a while loops is better in this case

if you re just going to loops through point use a for-loop as while-loop is more prone to dropping into an endless loops if you forgot to increment counter or doing wrongly or do it in multiple places

within your for-loop the statement command.parameters.addwithvalue is potentially adding to the command additional parameter but no two parameters can have the same value so if your loops is executed more than once you ll get the error you received

although both approaches are o n the for-loop has a larger constant because of loops overhead

depending on what you want to do inside loops and the capabilities of your compiler range-based for-loop might be a better solution

one place where the enhanced for-loop is faster than a naively implemented traditional loops is something like this

you are getting the out of bounds error because the variable i declared in the for-loop is running for less than equal to condition of planetlist size as i starts from zero it will go till the linked list size but since you have given less than equal to it goes in loops one more time therefore out of bounds exception .just change the for-loop condition to i less than linked list size it will work

the result amazed me in the way that as loops goes over bigger range the performance of c# decreases as compared to c..for smaller range c# shown well performance over c....but as upper range of for-loop increases the c# performance degrades as compare to c..

as for your question a for-loop is usually better when you want a piece of code to run a certain number of times and a while loops is better when the condition for the code to keep running is more general such as having a boolean flag that is only set to true when a certain condition is met in the code block

i have to use a while loops for this project i know a for-loop is probably easier but just the way this has to be done

rewriting the while loops as a for-loop is nicer and makes it less likely to get an infinite loops

while loops does not have as much flexibility as a for-loop has and for loops are more readable than while loops

a for-loop fits better to your requirements than a while loops

my guess is o m log m in which the first m is the for-loop that iterates m times and log m is the while loops that counts exponents greater than 1 digit

but you will have loops the outer arrays in order to get it to work which would be better done with a for-loop so you reference both at once

i think what s written within your for-loop while loops is of greater importance of what s affecting your running time

if the matching element was found i set k and j greater than the for-loop conditions to quit the cycle but i get an exception at inner loops condition

to achieve the actual goal you maybe able to use plain for-loop which provides more flexibility in controlling loops instead of using while

if loops like in this case does not create a list then the for-loop will be faster

if so might i suggest that a for-loop would be simpler than a while loops

however inside this second for-loop i need more for loops to do work in finding people invited and what not so my runtime for this is unfortunately o 3n 3 however the first two for loops generally act as one get one chunk of 200 loops through them all get next one etc so it is more o 3n 2 but when in a test org with 2777 events in one month i ran into cpu governor limit

but loops doesn t work like an old c-style for-loop where is checked on each iteration which is part of why this loops is faster

the while loops with decrements was approximately 1.5 times slower than the for-loop

secondly you will find a for-loop is easier than a do loops for implementing the logic as you don t need to keep track of loops counter manually

this is happening because of speed of for-loop which is faster than your time .as loops iterates in time of less than miliseconds and generates values.you can only call it when you want to insert single value to database and don t iterate for values

finally we concluded after we put print statement inside for-loop that it will take much more time than loops in the first case without print statement

how come the parallel loops perform faster than a regular for-loop on the average but the overall application s performance on start degrading

because i heard that for-loop is much faster than foreach loops

also your comparison would be safer as a for-loop that ensures value is less than 100 rather than a while loops

because it appears that your filtering are not mutually exclusive that is a data point can be in more than one filtering grouping i think that your best bet is likely to make a vector of your filtering then loops through that vector though i would use lapply instead of a for-loop

having said i am really not sure why you are getting unexpected behavior i ran your code both in eclipse and intellij ide and i always got for-loop approach as faster than while loops

and you want to iterate through it with a while loops a for-loop would be better but never mind then you would have to loops while the index is less than the length of the list - so the index is never actually the length of the list just up to 1 before

actually it s seams that while loops can be even faster then for-loop

for-loop is widly used and has more advantages over while loops but ther are some cases when while loops is perferable

in place of using a for-loop i think a do while loops would work better in this situation

a single for-loop is generally faster than using 2 nested for loops to traverse the image with x y counters

in my opinion a for-loop would be easier than a foreach loops since you re using 2 arrays and a for-loop can give you an integer for an index to use for both

you could also use a for each loops to handle this though that type of loops is slower than a standard for-loop depending on application

in example sendp method included in for-loop which is slower than making other loops to send packets

getimagedata has a for-loop i realised that each index in loops is called more than once

this in turn means that a generic for-loop is worse than a range-based for-loop for auto i v for the compiler because in the latter case the compiler simply knows that you are going to iterate over the whole range and not go outside of it or break out of loops or something while in the generic for-loop case specially if your code is more complex the compiler cannot be sure of this and has to insert extra checks and tests to make sure the code executes as the c++ standard says it should

i prefer to use for-loop to make loops more definite but you could change that to while do

even if you use a lowly for-loop it s much easier to loops over the elements of a list than it is to construct variable names with paste and access the objects with get

in fact i think a for-loop would be more suited instead of the inner while loops

though in performance critical parts of your application you should benchmark these functions versus the trivial for-loop because often loops are still faster

using functions and objects rather than hand-written for loops may make things less transparent but it i enables reuses ii adds many little things that would render the for-loop tedious such as parallel computing support for different scoring function etc

list comprehensions are preferred over for loops but they essentially do the same thing if a for-loop is more understandable you can break the expression above to a for-loop it looks like this

however if you are going to loops through a lot of records a for-loop will perform faster

what i want to do is to check how many seconds the time is after loops and then if the time taken to finish the for-loop is less than 60 sec than run the mysql update

i think using for-loop is much more easier than using foreach loops to do this

the problem is if i jump over that value which is negative with my while loops to get the higher k i will have to pass the same k in my for-loop which i don t want to because i already got it in my arrays

as a stylistic remark you should use lowercase for your own variables and the counter loops would be more elegant as a for-loop

the main problem i know is the while loops the logic behind it is not correct because last didah is always bigger than n for-loop counter

since i am using two for loops it is consuming more time and is affecting the execution time of my entire program which already had a for-loop

i would prefer for-loop over while-loop because if not used properly while-loop can go into an infinite loops

i added a big for-loop inside the above loops to simulate a slower load and it still doesn t show the loading message until loops is done.

as seen in this comparison using for-loop with counter set to the size of the arrays is significantly faster than for each loops

but according to this answer a for-loop is executed faster than the equivalent while loops

additionally since you are using a numeric counter a regular for-loop would be better than an while loops because loops s step value ++icountertext is required

a table is generated using nested while loops and i do understand that a for-loop is more suited for this and got it working using one

but the the foreach loops takes more time than a the for-loop

also as an aside objective-c has a foreach loops that is more convenient than manually setting up a for-loop with a counter

it works fine and everything but i am using a for-loop and my teacher is wanting me to change it into a while loops to make it more efficient ive tried to change it but i keep getting endless loops here is the code i have using a for-loop what might be a good to change it to a while loops without using a break and only having one return statement in the whole method

the incrementor in the for-loop is more of a while 1 endless loops

i guess you can just manually check the condition within your for-loop continue if it s not met but a while loops makes more sense imo

this complexity still holds true since each for-loop will reduce each operation to a o log n complexity since it divides n every time loops executes making it smaller and smaller smaller than o n at least

i would prefer using for-loop inside of a separate method but since your question is about while loops let s take that one

your while loops always runs a fixed number of times so from a stylistic point of view you would be better off with a for-loop

i am a beginner with python and from the hardest way to learn python i know that while loops should be avoided but rewriting to a for-loop is even slower

a good thing to remember though is that nested for-loop are much slower than a single loops so in some cases depend on the size of the output this will may be the fastest solution

ultimately the check point is do not use more than one for-loop and never use the while loops

says that enhanced for loops is 3x faster than the regular for-loop well that great and its easier to write anyways but what if i need the index

due to your loops accessing the arrays element several times during each iteration in this example a foreach loops would be faster than a for-loop

and the results is that foreach loops is 5-6 times faster than the for-loop

update i made some changes to my code but was already suspecting what others here have already pointed out sure the enhanced for-loop is slower but outside of very trivial tight loops the cost should be a miniscule fraction of the cost of the logic of loops

a while loops would fit better this logic even if your loops is correct a for-loop is usually use to iterate a collection not to hide some logic in it

i found a simple condition where using while loops is better than for-loop

the for-loop will run slightly faster than a jquery .each loops i believe mostly because the .each loops creates an iife for each iteration

since this is a non-standard for-loop using a while loops might be more appropriate as there are fewer preconceived ideas about how they work people looking at your code are more likely to read a while statement than a for statement as there is usually a model of how a for-loop should work in their head

i am really worried about it as i am not sure what could be done which could make it faster but so far to my knowledge is that by using foreach loops instead of for-loop can make things faster but i want to know if you people can please provide me with solutions

also with the for-loop it s considered better to limit the scope of the iterating variable i and to use println you need system.out not just system and you need a string java arrays do not override tostring so something to output the numbers the user entered after loops like

a for-loop would be a more natural fit here than a while loops

here the for-loop header takes actually more time than loops body thus profiling results could be distorted.

i was trying to figure out if a for-loop was faster than a foreach loops and was using the system.diagnostics classes to time the task

for-loop is easier to read than a while loops

the for-loop is faster than the while loops when n 1000000 each takes roughly 0.105544 and 0.2389421

ultimately if the structure of a loops is more expensive than the operations within loops and the tiny performance overhead from loops is actually significant then you might have a case for-loop unrolling

when rendering and binding to lists or arrays i normally prefer for-loop over foreach loops because it will generate required indices for the modelbinder to bind data to the model

lastly whenever you want to iterate x amount of times a for-loop is always more readable than a while loops that uses a counter variable

as an aside i would suggest a while loops would be a bit clearer than a for-loop without a next clause

you could do it with a while loops as well but a for-loop is nicer

so i tried to make it simpler with a for-loop but have been unable to work out how to add labels to each plot inside loops

but isn t setting index greater than the for-loop condition supposed to exit loops

the problem is that when the program first gets to the for-loop 9 is not less than 0 so the value is false and it skips loops

i have the impression that the implementantion has something to do with a for-loop and some kind of adaptive delay that gets bigger as loops count increases

by the way i think a foreach loops would be better in both my settracks and my new uploadtracks methods i m trying to make rather than the for-loop i am currently implementing but i wasn t able to figure out how to use one in this case

that being said your comprehension option is almost certainly going to be faster than the for-loop option because implicit loops are generally faster than explicit ones

a basic for-loop is slower than a for - loops with simplified test condition

alternatively you could initialize i outside of the for-loop but then it s scoped larger than loops itself

to use this in a loops you can write a simple for-loop which always checks if the index stil is smaller than the arrays length

if you won t be changing the string in loops it is better faster to store the value in and then include it in the for-loop

i m working in matlab in which nested for-loop is used to collect data and store in cell arrays however i want to collect data and the inner loops is collect further in the same cell arrays according to its position

1 your while loops would be better as a for-loop for n in range 8 .

therefore the parfor loops simply must be slower than the for-loop because it has to transmit data to the workers for them to operate on

i did this with for-loop too and while loops was clearly faster than for-loop again

i just wanted to point out my answer since i know for-loop is faster then loops

thus your for-loop is probably better expressed as following while loops

if you are using any js loops then for each loops is slower than normal for-loop you might wanna take a look at this

you can use a while loops if you want but using a for-loop might make more sense and reduce the amount of code you need to write

rather than using a for-loop this c-type loops would be better translated using a while loops

instead of using a while loops it is easier to use a for-loop

if i have to use the value of counter in my program then i think while loops is better than for-loop

even if the hypothesis of the while loops being faster than the for-loop were true and it s not the loops you d had to change optimize wouldn t be the outer ones but the inner ones because those are executed more times

for my purposes getting the object keys and then doing a plain old for-loop was faster than doing a decrementing while or a for in loops

i find lapply loops easier than a for-loop in your case as initializing the list and using the counter can be avoided

i m working on an app to load an amount of images from sd card using asynctask + for-loop i ve test the app on my galaxy nexus the app working perfectly but it will crash if i use more than 33 loops

as others have stated the python for-loop is more like a a traditional foreach loops in the sense that it iterates over a collection of items without checking a condition

a loops using a callback function like the standard foreach was approximately 10 times slower than the for-loop

note i have moved thename inside loops it is never used outside and made the final for-loop a foreach loops which should be your prefer loops form where possible

then put a for-loop inside that if you want to do a set number of iterations for loops are better for situations where you know how many iterations you re doing

a for-loop should be used don t you think what loops makes is more clearly stated in the for-loop

the function receives an integer parameter c that takes values from 1 to some positive n and i want that loops doesn t iterate when c 1 i.e when start value of the for-loop is larger than the end value

if i have a for-loop for example and and i want to use something like math.round to round the number but i only need to round the number one time i.e the number doesn t change throughout loops is it better to store it into a variable and then use the variable to in the condition or does it not matter

and a for-loop will be more appropriate than while loops in this case

but certainly wrong syntax in the for-loop is there better way to code it so that after loops i can get

since your counter is decremented by a greater value in the while loops it will cause that loops to finish sooner than the for-loop

use explode to split and i would prefer for-loop in these scenario instead of foreach as the latter will return an empty span tags in the end since it loops five times

if i do it with a simple for-loop i will get an error because loops is done faster then the sensors are changed

i noticed some time ago that a for-loop typically generates several more machine instructions than a while loops

well if _ uses native .foreach then that s easily order of magnitude slower than for-loop but still your problem is 4 nested loops right now so you might not even need the additional 10x after fixing that

now assuming that your inner loops is more complex and the simple for-loop is slower let s look at how much memory we save by avoiding broadcasted data in a parfor with 4 workers and a dataset with 50 million rows for about 760 mb in ram

i also dilemma to choose in between whileloop and for-loop but think that while loops is more suitable because unknow how many time need to insert the words

loops recur is faster - it s one of the most efficient constructs in clojure done correctly it should match the speed of an equivalent for-loop in java code

loops making it more hassle than a standard for-loop

some people use array.prototype.slice to do that but i m not a fan and i think a for-loop is faster in most browsers - but either way i have nothing against for loops and the slice often feels like a hack to me

xrange will give you an iterable object that won t use memory as you iterate a for-loop is cleaner than a while loops + counter if you ask me

i was trying to count the duration taken by a for-loop using std chrono but it gives 0 nanoseconds even if i make loops take longer by increamenting the bound value this is the code

for looping over lines in files you can use a for-loop which is more readable than while loops

the only difference in the two loops is the one if statement in the second double for-loop and loops is slightly longer but in the game the second for-loop is only rendering 3 things as there are only 3 platforms being rendered at this point int time

the decremented while loops is still faster than the for-loop or the incremented while loops with length upper limit comparison by a fair margin

imho loops looks better with a for-loop iterating in the right direction

a while loops or do...while loops is more appropriate here than a for-loop because you do not know how many times the user wants to execute loops

if you want a loops that iterates three times a for-loop may be more appropriate

2 second loops is and easier for-loop to read

according to the answer of the foreach vs for-loop question assuming it s correct for loops on list are a bit more than 2 times cheaper than foreach loops on list and looping on arrays is around 2 times cheaper than looping on list

for what it s worth the while loops is a safer and more idiomatic way to loops over a file s lines in a shell script than the for-loop with backticks even though you see that a lot

can you explain me why in this case the parfor loops is slower than the for-loop

a while loops is better thought of as a looping version of an if statement than akin to a for-loop

i m binding a grid view inside a for-loop which executes more than once.now when loops ends the data in grid view is the data binded at the last run of for-loop i.e all previous binds in the for-loop over overwritten.i dont want this .i want new rows to be inserted at each run of the for-loop ..plz help somebody

if you want to get data from simple list thnn foreach loops is good to use but if you want to data from exact position or to store from id than for-loop is better

i have an arrays of integer and i am trying to iterate back the for-loop to the last index it visited based on some condition lets say i have 2 9 15 19 23 28 37 elements in that loops i am giving a condition that if each element of that loops is greater than a number lets say 8 it will process that element again

at first i thought it had something to do with one being a for-loop and the other being a while loops but even when i reversed the order the second loops still executes slower

in this case i found while loops is better than for-loop because if i want to achieve the same in for-loop i have to assign the value of counter to another variable

for-loop where maximum loops will be less than your number

this is a use case where a for-loop is cleaner to use than a while loops

readability is a big reason for functions using recursion rather than loops makes them easier to follow and for using the iteration methods where possible map to transform an arrays values-by-value rather than a for-loop

a for-loop is more sppropriate than a while loops

but to loops through an arrays you re really better off with a regular for-loop

for this example a while loops instead of a for-loop would be more natural similar to

so i am thinking we can use a for-loop maybe but i read that for loops are slower than list comprehensions

since foreach loops can access more fast than for-loop

is it possible to tweak the for-loop to make it faster or are there options using numba or can i go ahead and use multiple threads to speed this loops up

note using apply functions instead of a for-loop is better but it depends on the actual purpose of your loops

your while loops would be better written as a for-loop

as in c# development in my past i never create a new instance of some tcp socket in loops if i want to make it asynchronously - i create a single instance with delegates to async functions and if there is a similar situation in c# project like in javascript code here in the question s content because it s doesn t produce new objects in for-loop it takes less memory and as for architecture it s represented as more clean and good solution

each line can do one of three things it can call a function which modifies it s argument start a while loops which is really more of a for-loop or assign a variable

just a simple for-loop should be quicker if you need to loops

each individual iteration of the code in the foreach loops takes less than a second per worker and looking at the outfile it s clear that processing stops within a minute of turning the monitors off no matter how many times it s been through either the foreach loops or the parent for-loop

i personally think the while loops looks less clean than the nested for-loop

but is there any specific situation when while loops is better than for-loop

notice that i have added a check in the for-loop that will make sure you don t create an infinite loops by requesting more unique items than the arrimgs arrays can provide

the other advice i have is that a for-each loops is faster than a for-loop

on the other hand for-loop is more like counter based where you want to specify for how many times should loops happened

also the for-loop is more readable than the while loops because it puts all loops variable manipulation in one place

a while loops is imo more complicated to read than a for-loop

this is why a regular for-loop is better to use for this scenario rather than a foreach loops

i thought a forward for-loop was more elegant than a backward while loops

can anyone please let me know what is difference between for-loop or foreach loops which is faster from both of them

if it s a very deep inner loops however and you need to squeak out every last nanosecond my experience has been that with release build code a for-loop indexing over an arrays is measurably faster than a foreach loops with a slightly smaller performance loss for using delegates with linq vs

if i is less than j loops doesn t get executed first time and loops executes 1 step more than each previous iteration of outer for-loop

i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loops if a for-loop is more appropriate

a for-loop is more natural for this than a while loops

the while loops runs 3000 times faster than the for-loop

recently i ve stumbled upon a parralel.for loops that performs way better than a regular for-loop for my purposes

to explain why a for-loop is faster than a for in loops is basically understand the underlying data structures used to store the data in memory

i used to have a while loops to run the whole file but was getting an error and then decided to do a for-loop to have a smaller number of results

i suspect your curly braces aren t in the correct place as per scheff s comment the scope of the page variable is contained within the for-loop and you are attempting to do more operations after loops is over

the child process does not enter any part of the if block and just loops back to the top of the for-loop creating more children

i did test it a while ago with the result that a for-loop is much faster than a foreach loops

if you have a really large matrix the example in your question is far from being large no worry there will be a ram hit and unlikely to be faster than a for-loop commented under your question because no copy of the matrix is made during loops


neo4j	titan	2
when the data is on disk titan is faster than neo4j cause it has a better disk representation

because it seems you re going to deploy a cluster i think titan is the better choice unless you re willing to pay for the enterprise edition of neo4j to support clustering


achartengine	mpandroidchart	1
achartengine is easy to use mpandroidchart has more option but is less easy to use than achartengine


bash	tcsh	6
i prefer bash but csh tcsh korn shell etc

while tcl syntax looks more related to shell syntax like bash or tcsh tcl is actually more closely related to perl or php or ruby

csh and tcsh aliases are more powerful but csh lacks functions -- and you re using bash anyway.

i used to write csh scripts myself but i ve found that sh and bash are much better for programming though tcsh still has a few advantages for interactive use.

i want to do this in tcsh i know bash is better to use but i have to use tcsh

take a look at the various test operators this is for the test command itself but the built-in bash and tcsh tests are more or less the same


tlistview	tlistbox	2
i know tlistbox renders like this but i require the use of tlistview for the data property also the tlistview handles icons better via a timagelist

depending on your actual needs which you did not explain a multi-column tlistview in vsreport mode may be a better choice than a tlistbox


dlsym	dlopen	4
the man page for dlopen and dlsym should provide some more insight

in linux or any posix system this would be based on dlopen dlsym and look more or less like this

given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits

on linux it would be easier for you to link to shared library and use symlinks to correct version - imo it s much easier than using dlopen + dlsym


qtabwidget	qtoolbutton	1
note that instead of using one of the tabs as your + button i have used qtoolbutton thereby making it simpler to make tabs closable with qtabwidget settabsclosable bool


nix	hackage	1
haskellng is a rewrite of how we package things in nix and is of interest to us for being more predictable package names match hackage package names and more configurable


openssl	cryptlib	1
openssl is more similar to peter gutmann s cryptlib and gnu s gnutls


restructuredtext	asciidoc	2
for academic documents you may use restructuredtext or asciidoc which offers more features than markdown

beside markdown and restructuredtext there exists also asciidoc which is more powerful than markdown there are f.ex


nsorderedset	nsset	2
when nsorderedset was added much more recently it had to deal with the existence of prior collections - primarily nsarray and nsset

is nsorderedset faster than nsset


min	median	8
select min of next 50 rows by ordering the rows in desc in case if column count is even this will be median or else max of firsthalf+min of secondhalf 2 will be the median

from min to the median is less equal or greater than the one from

if they are outside i will get many results - should i choose min max median average

i usually choose min in those cases but max avg median all have the same effect when there is only one row in a partition

to find the median and left right you probably want to call it to find the median and then just do the max of the components of the array to the left and the min of the components to the right because you know once the median selection phase is done that all elements to the left of the median will be less than it and to the right will be greater or equal

so after calculating median of first k elements delete the first element directly from heap min or max according to whether it is greater or less than median using pointers and then use heapify at that position

i also microbenchmarked and the mean median min and max were all faster for the lattice plotting function compared to the high charts rcharts plotting function

mysql select min measure select measure from customer_data order by measure limit 0 1 as firstq select measure from customer_data order by measure limit 5 1 as median select measure from customer_data order by measure limit 8 1 as last_q max measure from customer_data


atom-editor	sublimetext	9
there s also the save-session plugin which makes atom-editor behave more like sublimetext the current state of each file is remembered across application instances

plus copy as rtf for atom-editor has more recent updates than sublimehightlight for sublimetext

atom-editor is still missing a lot of packages that sublimetext supports so the question is will atom-editor catch up with sublimetext or become some better

though similar in ui and ux sublimetext performs significantly better than atom-editor especially in heavy lifting like working with large files complex snr or plugins that do heavy processing on files buffers

why atom-editor uses more memory and takes more time to start as compare to sublimetext editor

sublimetext has better performance than atom-editor

again because atom-editor is still in the beta stage sublimetext has much more native plugin packages

atom-editor has better github support out of the box but sublimetext has a several git packages

i m not quite sure what you mean by tools but if you mean a program to create your code in i would personally recommend sublimetext or atom-editor


multiton	singleton	1
however when using the enum version of the singleton pattern would the multiton not allow for more than one object of the class to be created


mono	xamarin.android	1
i m using xamarin.android to write c# but the native java rsa key generator is much faster than the mono one


nss	gnutls	1
nss is more strict than either openssl or gnutls


cxxtest	cppunit	2
i ve used cxxtest and cppunit and found cxxtest to be easier to use it automates generating some of the skeleton code - on the downside it needs python installed and lightweight no libraries entirely header based

i prefer cxxtest as i find it easier not to have to register my test cases explicitly as you have to do with cppunit


listboxitem	textbox	3
select listboxitem - mouseclick once - enable textbox

select listboxitem if textbox in itemtemplate gets focus

textbox autosizes to its content that s ok but when drag apperas the listboxitem becomes wider and move other items it s not ok


alarmmanager	timertask	3
hence the alarmmanager which runs much better than a java timertask thingy

alarmmanager should also be more efficient than timertask

alarmmanager consumes lesser battery power than timertask or thread


websocket++	libwebsockets	1
fastcgi++ is everything i could hope for for the ajax demands but it doesn t have websockets and i chose websocket++ over libwebsockets since websocket++ is more or less a simple #include so i assumed that i could incorporate it into fastcgi++


scons	qmake	1
as a side note i tried qmake for a while but found scons to be much more versatile


invokelater	invokeandwait	3
if so i would recommend using invokelater to build the swing components as i have noticed that opera can sporadically crash at start up with invokeandwait

you can use eventqueue.invokelater to switch to the swing thread and back greenfoot isn t designed to support this but it should work anyway -- invokelater is a better bet than invokeandwait

you can simply create a new thread runnable or futuretask to run on an executor and call invokeandwait only when necessary to update components but if you can get away with it invokelater is better


umbraco	dotnetnuke	4
umbraco is great i work with both but always recommend dotnetnuke for non-heavy programmers

while dotnetnuke is a much bigger market it seems to be crowded with a lot of competition versus umbraco which is smaller but it looks like it lacks modules in certain categories

consider umbraco its architecture is definitely better than dotnetnuke s

i also had good result with umbraco cms it s a bit more lean than dotnetnuke but not as user friendly and definitely not as popular


handbrake	libav	1
occasionally ffmpeg or libav might be better suited but for most cases go with handbrake


translation	localization	10
i don t need more than 2 localization now english and portuguese but i might need more later so it should be easy to add a translation if my app gets used by an russian site it should be able to send welcome emails in russian and with the name of the site brand that uses my app so i supposse what i want to do is something like a whitelabel product

i d have one project team responsible for localization which may well involve more than just translation - different countries have different legal requirements currencies payment providers etc. and one team for improving the code base

now i m not sure if i should store the strings in core data or use ios localization as the translation seem more like app data than true localization to me

is the best solution to add a new column called engmaterial and add the english translation there or is it possible to solve this in a better way with localization in .net

consider training authors or adjusting localization and read folder permissions to only the authors responsible for translation for those publications

localization it s easier to translation text than images

you may find some localization firms are happier to start with a quality simplified chinese translation and adapt it to traditional but you may also find that many companies prefer to start with the english source

the second example the plural form can be translation using more than two strings because part of localization file is how plural forms are arranges

you have to translation the module with translation editor of prestashop in backoffice select localization translation select translation modules and after select core at last select the language dutch in your case

this is where i learned that localization is a lot more than translation


express	koa	9
it is very common to use a web application framework like express sails hapi or koa there are many more

i should also say that i have the token at ctx.request.get authorization koa based i think it s something like req.header authorization with express in all routes

personally i would recommand using express.js framework written by tj but i would not say it s the best one you might have heard koa framework but i think express would be more simple concept than it. like es6 generator function etc.

it shows that koa is faster then other framework but as this question is about express and restify express is faster than restify

i am more familiar with express than koa but could also see it going in the entry server.js file

in the example below for simplicity i ve used express with node v4.0.0 supporting native js promises but you can obviously substitute it with any http server you like these days i prefer koa and promises library you prefer

koa doesn t provide this kind of thing out of the box - it s designed to be a little more low level than express

see this blog when you have 10000 request koa performs better than express

koa middleware is much simpler and less hacky than express middleware due to the way middleware flows in a stack-like manner


ant	buildr	1
that said if ant doesn t give you satisfaction in terms of flexibility then i don t see why buildr would be better


perl	tcl	11
performance beats tcl perl python ruby

while tcl syntax looks more related to shell syntax like bash or tcsh tcl is actually more closely related to perl or php or ruby

supports javascript mason xbl xul rhtml scss python html ruby python3 xml sass xslt django html5 perl css twig less smarty node.js tcl templatetoolkit php

tcl is more verbose than perl here

tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb

hence the code style you adopted actually tries to make tcl code look more like python or perl or whatever was your previous language for no real value and also look alien to seasoned tcl developers

tcl might be easier to embed than perl but i do have to agree matthew scharley s reasoning

i know that perl performs better for some regex but will the tcl performance really be this bad in comparison

in fact in my experience php is faster than any dynamic language i have benchmarked it against - python perl ruby tcl are all slower performing than php

it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

tcl arrays are closer to what python calls a dict and a hash in perl


lwjgl	slick2d	4
you could use slick2d it is way easier to use and works with lwjgl

slick2d is made to work with lwjgl 2 lwjgl 3 however is way newer than slick2d and therefore slick2d does not support using lwjgl 3

on one hand slick2d is fast and simple but it seems lwjgl is more adaptable in the sense that it has both 2d and 3d capabilities

i ve been delving into game programming with slick2d and i ve began to wonder if in the long run knowing lwjgl would be more helpful


robocopy	xcopy	18
in that case you might prefer robocopy or xcopy type robocopy

you might want look at robocopy as it has many more options than xcopy

i have solved it in the past very successfully using robocopy it s much more robust than xcopy

btw this is not essential for this solution for windows 7 and 10 xcopy is superseded by robocopy which is much more performant and powerful

the robocopy command provides a more intelligent exclusion feature switches xd and xf than xcopy does which you could use for your task

lastly instead of xcopy i would recommend robocopy

also prefer using robocopy xcopy or xxcopy as i have them and use them today on my machine

i think copy or xcopy is best used for files while i prefer robocopy when dealing with folders

also robocopy is better than xcopy

that would theoretically cut the time in half but it seems that robocopy is much faster than xcopy at least for this use so it took way less time

depending on your operating system version you might want to look at xcopy or robocopy which provide some more advanced file folder copying features

xcopy was older and unreliable so microsoft replaced it with robocopy which is still rubbish

at least use xcopy robocopy is even faster

use robocopy it s much more powerful than xcopy

xcopy will not be better than robocopy at this

i now understand that a windows specific tool such as xcopy xxcopy or robocopy probably is better for backing up but for now i prefer the simplicity of cp and not having to dive into windows command line

if your batch file only needs to run on windows vista or later you can use robocopy instead which is an even more powerful tool than xcopy and is now built into the operating system

i am not certain if xcopy or robocopy is the best solution for this but coming from server administration i am more familiar with robocopy


jmenubar	jmenuitem	1
my problem is that i would like it to be in black colour to match jmenubar and jmenuitem background colours but i cannot find a way to do it


winpcap	libpcap	1
i ve never done any network programming lower than using libpcap winpcap so i would be happy for any suggestions.


rsa	dsa	19
dsa has signature that is independent of key strength and is much smaller than rsa signature for equivalent security rsa 1024 1568 vs dsa 192

a dsa signature generation could be somewhat faster than a rsa signature generation maybe up to twice faster

however dsa verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than rsa verification

use dsa it tends to be more compact than rsa

eugene s suggestion of using ecc is a good one - ecc keys are much shorter than rsa or dsa for a given security level

the third operation is made much faster is the client uses a rsa key pair rsa signature verification is very fast whereas dsa signature verification is expensive actually somewhat more expensive than dsa signature generation

this is why rsa is much slower than dsa

i want to compare rsa dsa and ecies

rsa is also a better choice than dsa because it has much better breadth of support for signatures still considered secure by nist

that continued usage of 1024-bit prime field elgamal or dsa keys is much riskier than it is for 1024-bit rsa all are still commonly used because once a successful attack has been conducted against a single well-chosen prime field all users of that prime field may be affected at little additional effort.

key type â here you can choose between dsa and rsa

for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signatures typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

i have made some testing and it came out that rsa is lot slower than dsa

a practical introduction to gnu privacy guard in windows recommends dsa and elgamal but i would like to know if rsa is good enough to use these days and if so what minimum key size should i use

dsa and ecdsa both produce shorter signatures with much greater strength that rsa

dsa signatures are signficantly shorter than rsa ones

i ve already done the rsa but dsa is bigger deal to me

however in this case dsa key size is less than rsa key size

i guess rsa is older and dsa is newer


flask	pyramid	2
frameworks like flask cherrypy pyramid or even web2py might be the easier ones to start with

django is an all-in-one package while pyramid and flask give you more flexibility


jdom	xom	8
there are libraries that build on the xml apis jdom dom4j or xom which are easier to use than the raw apis

you might find that other tree apis like jdom xom and dom4j are more to your liking

other similar models such as jdom and xom are much cleaner and easier to use and usually faster

but don t use dom itself there are much better alternatives like jdom and xom that have much friendlier apis

there are at least 3 different ways to implement the xml-wrapping part sax xslt and xml libraries like jdom dom4j and xom--i prefer xom but any of them will work

however more modern object models such as jdom or xom are much easier to work with

i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom

there are many tree representations of xml available in the java world jdom xom dom4j that are vastly more usable than dom

zsh	subshell	1
simple function in zsh to parallelize jobs in not more than 4 subshell using lock files in tmp


packets	multicast	6
multicast are more efficient than datagram socket however it also uses udp and hence does not provide any guarantee that the data packets will be received by all receivers

keep in mind that firewalls installed on pc can sometime silently kill packets i ve see that under windows especially if you use multicast or loop back addresses

if your software is running on both machines you can have one or both machines send out a particular broadcast or if you prefer multicast udp packets on a specific port

as for streaming it s better to use udp first because it lowers the load on servers but mostly because you can send packets with multicast it s simpler than sending it to each connected client

a third possibility would be to send out some form of discovery packets either by broadcast or better by multicast udp

multicast packets are broadcasted technically more accurate flooded at layer2 at the final hop


strstr	substr	2
for an alternative i d recommend using strstr or an alternative implementation that doesn t require nul-byte termination to locate the end-of-line substr and then starting your next search where you found the last occurrence plus the length of your substr

if you only want to search for plain substr you are much better off using the standard c string.h function strstr


sidekiq	god	1
moreover i have run the issue where even sidekiq stopped if you face similar issue then i would recommend god gem for monitoring purpose for sidekiq


monodevelop	sharpdevelop	3
n3 for web my preference will be vwd but for other stuff i ll prefer monodevelop and sharpdevelop

monodevelop is more of a replacement of an ide for mac and linux in windows the recommended thing is to use visual studio or sharpdevelop

i like the monodevelop ide even better than sharpdevelop but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language features


linefeed	delimiter	1
i ve taken the example of two linefeed here but the same is true for any character string i could subvert the problem by maybe taking a longer string as the delimiter but that would have two undersirable effects


treemap	linkedhashmap	9
it sounds like you need a treemap which has iteration which is not much slower than linkedhashmap and does what you really want

you can use treemap instead of linkedhashmap because you dont want to retain the order of insertion and for sorting treemap is better choice

a treemap costs a lot more than a linkedhashmap and adds nothing to your project if you only need to keep original insertion order

however a linkedhashmap is faster as seen here treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each.

linkedhashmap is faster for insertion because it wonâ t have to unnecessarily compare values while inserting like treemap as stated by ejp

you would like reading this post too as whenever you start comparing you might understand better difference between hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap

after a few test hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap are way slower than arraylist and i wanted to use them just for the ability to create submaps

consider using a linkedhashmap or a treemap to maintain a more reasonable ordering

if you care about traversing elements in specific order you should choose treemap natural order or linkedhashmap insertion order


express	node.js	12
i personally prefer node.js with express and mongodb

i have a node.js app built using coffescript on express connect jade less

so nginx will work for this purpose but if you have made a node.js app the core module http optionally paired with express would be a more natural choice of webserver

one could argue that a lighter framework such as sinatra if you re going to use ruby or something like bottle python or the javascript stack of node.js + express would be a better fit if you truly are just going to create a restful api + some landing pages but rails does this perfectly fine as well and has a lot of other functionality that will be available for you to grow into if the time ever comes

i found node.js and used it along with socket.io and express to create a faster chat application

however unless you want to write some low-level node.js code to better understand this language i highly recommend using node.js web framework such as express

first its not a bad idea to use node.js to satisfy your requirement the uniqueness of node and added advantage compared to conventional technologies like apache-php is clearly explained in this following video why node.js is better .the notion of node being just used for advanced or complex applications is wrong you can use node for building applications which are very simple to anything of huge proportion.it would be a not so comfortable task for a node beginner to code without using any frameworks but by using this web application framework called express you need not code from scratch and its very easy to setup html pages using its simplified html templating language called jade and route requests also you can even use your html pages if you are not willing to use jade for rendering the views of your application .here are the series of tutorials which would help you tutorials on beginning with node.js basics of expressjs

node.js does have its own way to make a server but for the sake of brevity and ease i just recommend using express

i was trying to keep a socket connection alive from the google chrome s fetch api to a remote express server and found the request headers have to match node.js s native connection settings

for typescript i normally choose node.js which will allow you to run in process or within a web context with frameworks such as express

i prefer node.js and express

i plan to use express backbone.js mongodb redis if i choose node.js


ocaml	scheme	2
if you want something more popular with more community support then i d recommend scheme or ocaml depending on whether you d rather deal with unfamiliar syntax go with scheme or deal with unfamiliar typing go with ocaml first

i personally believe that it is not worth the effort because basic is a nearly dead language and there are lots of languages better than basic ocaml haskell common lisp clojure scala scheme go d ...


ssd	sata	5
as compilation is mostly reading small files i wonder if buying a fast usb key to work on can speed up compilation time compared to a standard sata drive and with a lower price than an ssd drive 16gb keys are 30

the ssd disks are from 4 to 8 times faster than a sata hdd depending on the model

with this set each time you boot and the sata negotiated link speed of the ssd is less than 3 it s going to reboot until it s 3 however many times it takes

using faster disk connections sata etc. and or upgrading to a ssd might help but more cpu power will not

i can t figure out how to code the option where if you select ssd or sata a different amount of disk space will be shown they then need to be taken to a different cart.php link

saucelabs	browserstack	3
i ve been looking at services and the two most comparable for grid testing look to be saucelabs as mentioned above and also browserstack which offers a cheaper unlimited package i believe

edit i just came across saucelabs which seems to be even better than browserstack for manual testing and they also cover many web browsers tablet mobile devices

i am trying saucelabs to run appium tests and i want to compare it with browserstack


primes	modulus	8
it is perfectly possible to use rsa with a modulus n that is composed of more than two primes factors p and q but two things have to be noted

it wouldn t be especially likely that they d occur an exact multiple of 257 bytes apart but it s a risk which can be avoided by using a primes modulus provided at least that the number of bytes in the file is smaller than the modulus

some of the random values that you are encrypting are greater than the modulus of the key the modulus is the value of the 2 primes in the rsa key multiplied together which means values wrap-around if you set you will see that input and output always match

it would be better to use a large primes as the modulus and get much better collision resistance

hypothesis the first n powers of two each have a different modulus when divided by p where p is the smallest primes that is larger than n

however strong primes do not protect against modulus factorisation using newer algorithms such as lenstra elliptic curve factorization and number field sieve algorithm

someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping

using a higher key size results in larger primes and modulus which makes it harder to factorize the modulus to get the primes out of it to then reveal the private key


netbsd	minix	1
i want test unix-like operating systems on historicial computers like commodore amiga atari st and i386 cpu and run posix compatible apps like pkgsrc x window system and blackbox wm for 40mhz higher versions minix 1.5 is best os for those systems better than netbsd but it is not posix-compatible


jmeter	blazemeter	5
for load testing jmeter is better option but you have quite enough funding then go for loadrunner neoload rational performance tester and for cloud try blazemeter

i would recommend using jmeter blazemeter chrome extension

there might also be the case that blazemeter can be not in sync 1 version behind the jmeter release so i would recommend contacting blazemeter support if the situation won t be solved by upgrading your jmeter version to the latest one

blazemeter has tested and verified that the new jmeter plugin works with the most common xmpp servers like smack ejabberd openfire and hipchat

why blazemeter is better than jmeter


onclick	onmousedown	2
edit i just found out that text selection is done before onclick is fired a better option is onmousedown

sometimes it is good practice to use onmousedown event instead of onclick because onmousedown is fired sooner so ga script has more time to execute event tracking it s only a few milliseconds difference but can help

hash	salt	104
during user login rather than retreive the salt from db create the hashpasword in my code and then compare with hash in db i am told i can do this straight in my stored procedure

however using a salt offers more protection against rainbow tables precalculated hash tables so they re still worth using

having looked at the existing accesses listed i can see that it doesn t appear to be using the salt md5 hash that s stated in the apache docs the hash password that s stored is different to what i m thinking i should expect the salt is significantly more than 2 characters and for security reasons i m reluctant to embed a particular password hashing algorithm in my code

as you have already mentioned salt hash are much better

the hash will be no more easily guessable wherever you put the salt

you can use salt to get a more revere sengineering aware hash

putting the salt at the beginning is better than putting it at the end as more randomness at the beginning of hash is better than randomness at the end

so when we are comparing the hash while authenticating the user we append the stored salt to user inputed password and compare it with hash from database

you should use a strong cryptographic hash function and a salt to make it more secure

salt is used to add an extra level of complexity to the hash to make it harder to brute-force crack

the simplest form of this is to add a salt to the user s passphrase and then feed it into sha-2 to get a 256-bit hash but ideally you want to use something like scrypt to make it harder to brute-force the passphrase

since the hash is generated using the original long salt using a trimmed salt later would just yield an invalid hash when specifying the original password - it doesn t make it any easier to find a hash collision

in storing hash passwords is a common practice to add a nonce or a salt and is marginally true that this salt is better kept secret

yes storing the password even reversibly encrypted is worse than a salt hash of some sort due to password reuse

generate sha512 i would recommend hash in both cron and php file with the same salt and maybe even time and then check if they are the same - it would be impossible for a hacker to recreate it - except if he somehow gets your original hash setup

if you want to compare hash compare the output of your crypt call with the value in shadow both hash need to be created with the same salt

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt

because this is a salt hash it s even more difficult

that accepts either nothing a salt or a hash that crypt made earlier which has the salt to make the hash embedded in it

using the hash value with a salt is much safer if someone breaks into your db no password is there

this salt used in yii2 security helper doesn t require for storing in db it is only used for creating password hash but not need to compare password with hash

the more randomness and more characters your salt has the better for the hash but anything that s several characters long and random works

pbkdf2 is more secure than a simple hash or even a salt hash

just use pbkdf2 to make your hash directly make a 64 bit 8 byte random salt use a higher iteration count 4000-10000

from that system gets the user s password salt and system computes bcrypt on user provided password with salt to see if it matches hash password in database

you use a salt to make it more difficult for the attacker to get at your passwords because then he would need to know the salt so that he can use it in computing the hash for your passwords

restructuring of the database to just add an salt field is better option or the only one really if your going to do it properly but you could use your currant hash field to store the salt as other person posted

hash password by using security salt is more secure than plain text password

hash passwords with salt are much harder for an attacker to use than a plaintext password which they can use with the right username

the first problem is obviously the lack of a salt value which means if 2 users have the same password they will have the same hash which makes it easier to compromise multiple accounts

it is true that randomly generated salt produce a greater amount of security but it is also true that anyone who gets access to a list of your password hash in order to crack them probably has access to your database in which case they have access to your salt

now personally i generally use a salt sha-256 hash on my passwords because i thought that md4 and md5 were no longer secure and that hashing a password multiple times would just put too much strain on a server for no practical benefit

the salt shall make it harder to find the original password with a rainbow-table in case someone could steal your database with the hash

personally i use sha-512 with a salt because a bigger number in the hash name means a better hash

even though they re hash salt it s still better that attackers do not see them

you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique salt is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the hash over username

so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

to clarify my problem i can t manage to validate in javascript the password test against it s sha256 salt hash f27b595d3cbbc60aceac68e4da6a2629558fec383e0b81f764e443c68b0e9808096cdf2d calculated earlier in a c# program

this salt is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your hash password unique

then pick scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 determine the iteration count work factor that takes the amount of time you expect to have available during peak load use a cryptographically random salt of 8 to 16 bytes or so and store the salt plaintext the iteration count work factor plaintext so it can be increased trivially and the resulting hash in the database storage medium

compute a hash on the password when you store it preferably a salt sha256 and then compare hash upon login

prepending a salt is also more powerful than directly setting the seed values because in addition to changing the internal state of the hash if the salt is not a multiple of the digest block size then it can also perturb the alignment with which the input is fed into the hash function

note it uses time as part of the salt so rj doesn t match hash it decrypts

the time to hash the salt you spend better in doing more iterations on the password hashing

as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people

my initial thought is that 2 hash either using 2 different algorithms or the same algorithm twice with 2 salt would be more collision resistant

an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

in gross violation of security principles that recommend saving salt hash of passwords rather than the actual passwords themselves

never store passwords instead store password hash and random salt read more

also i d recommend storing salt password hash rather than plaintext strings

salt sha-512 offers a higher level of security and implementing a scheme where you stretch the hash is even better do some high number of iterations of sha-512 - starting with the password+salt of course

the first which would retrive the salt associated with the user in the db - use salt to prepare password to match with hash

i don t know how safe could it be and how difficult is for the hacker to determinate the technique i use the thing is that the result has the same length as the hash and is harder to determinate a salt so if for any reason in the history hacker uses a rainbow table and catches a probable result it will be the wrong

first you probably need to do more than just salt and hash your password

with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

i think i understand the purpose of using sha1 as it s supposed to require more cycles than md5 to hash unhash and the salt is supposed to prevent the use of rainbow tables

example the salt field might only allow a 64 characters while the generated salt might be longer therefore when you save the salt it gets trimmed which ultimately changes the hash password

i ve been reading about password hash functions and it s said use a salt to make harder the hacker s work use a height cost algorithm etc

using a hash or similar to detect if the transmission was decrypted having a salt hash makes it harder not impossible to change or forge message contents

and secondly to thwart rainbow table attacks that match hash against a precompiled list because none of the precompiled hash used the salt you have used so a new rainbow table would need to be generated for each salt hash

it s simpler deals with salt for you in a completelly transparent way makes way for updates both in encryption algo and in hash time cost and comes bundled in a nice api

now when the user tries to log in you can run your method again using the salt you stored and the output of your method should match hash stored in your database

you should investigate salt hash using more modern encryption algorithims

once you add a salt into the mix it becomes practically impossible to compare hash

in order to verify that the password is correct you shouldn t manually compare hash which may be different with each use of password_hash because of random salt but rather use function password_verify

it is supposed i think that the algorithm cost and salt is used to make the life harder to hackers and if i use that my hash will be safer

if their original password was longer than the salt + hash you may have just reduced the security of their password assuming a good password and ignoring hash collisions

likely not as cheap as xor against n values but seems like there s possibility for better quality results at a minimal extra cost especially if the data being hash is much larger than the salt value

i read somewhere that adding a different salt to each hash makes it more secure

using a encypted method with a salt would be even safer but this would be a good next step past just using a md5 hash

may be you need to select salt along with hash password create a hash using that salt and then compare two hash

the whole point of using a salt hash is to make the impossible for hackers to use a rainbow table common passwords hash but without a salt to match hash

if we are talking about passwords where you only need to know if the user entered the correct password or not then you could hash the passwords with a salt and compare with the database hash read more about that here link

liferay is responsible for storing passwords with encryption or better as salt hash in the database

you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say

the hash can be more secure you can have random salt for every user which makes it computationally expensive for someone to brute force attack the passwords should the database be compromised

would salt and hash be somehow more secure

there are lists available on the internet with millions of already hash values to make hash cracking easier those are known as rainbow tables and they can be easily countered with the use of salt

if your php installation is too old even salt hash with md5 are better than two-encrypted password

keep in mind the purpose of the salt to make it harder for someone to precalculate hash codes and therefore be able to look up passwords in the case of the database being compromised

hash password + salt is better but still not good enough.

if hash are used for more than consistency checks licensing one could use salt and encryption to increase security

in this situation storing password hash and the salt is more secure than storing the credentials encrypted or not because an attacker would have no way of getting the password back even if he manages to get his hands on both the hash and the salt

passwords should be hash and salt never encrypted much less encoded

my reasoning was that storing the salt unencrypted along with the hash password would make it easier to crack the passwords as a hacker that would be able to retrieve the password table and would know or make an assumption about the hash algorithm would be able to find matches between hash of well known words dictionary attack by hashing each word in the dictionary and then salting with the salt he also has access to

the lack of salt is harder to expoit here than with password hash since the hash is not directly known

as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content

that way the hash salt is more random and your data a bit more secure

i get the impression that most people think that hashing salt passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using hash passwords

instead use stronger passwords with salt hash which are harder to break using brute force and are not susceptible to rainbow table attacks if the choice is between pin and password

if the salt is hard-coded into a popular product lookup tables and rainbow tables can be built for that salt to make it easier to crack hash generated by the product

anyway transmit a salt and hash password is always better than transmit the plain password

salt just make it harder by forcing an attacker to hash the dictionary on a per-user effectively per-salt basis

compare salt hash input with stored data to check a password

actually you can insert the passwords as a simple md5 hash it will still work for letting the user login though it is recommended to then change the password through the front end system as the salt passwords are more secure

by using a salt value typically you want this to be a random number the hash won t match the dictionary the chance of them pre-calculating all passwords with all possible salt values is exponentially more difficult

then at every new session take stored salt and secret key to match hash es and get that data

hash salt password that matches username and see if password matches hash

from an architectural point of view storing the passwords in the db like this isn t a really good idea it would be best to at least store a salt hash or use a better algorithm see

although because pbkdf2 applies your hash function a large number of times a long salt is less important than in traditional straight hashing applications. for my application i use a 32 byte random salt unique for each users account where i m hashing their password with pbkdf2

adding a dynamic salt to each user would mean that you will have to hit a datastore to retrieve the dynamic salt and the hash version of the user s password then you will have to perform the cpu intensive hash function in your code twice -- you are hashing a hash which is less secure and more likely to have collisions

most attacks involve generating hash for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with salt some people use usernames as salt others use randomly generated numbers

your suggestion sounds fine but i would recommend storing salt hash of the password instead

c compare the user provided password with stored salt to the same routine and compare hash


junit	cactus	1
junit is older and have more extensions dbunit cactus etc


asterisk	ivr	1
microsoft has the microsoft speech api sapi however if you want simple ivr it is better not to reinvent the wheel and customize an asterisk implementation which i guess falls under the great ivr library for c++ category it s c not c++ but if you know c++ you should be able to understand the c . using asterisknow you may not even need to write any custom code it may do what you want already


postgresql	informix	2
for this sort of answer i would recommend postgresql informix or oracle

those tools are used mainly to compare informix vs other informix or postgresql vs other postgresql database but after some normalizing i believe you can compare postgresql vs informix


gdi	directwrite	2
i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net space

i suspect that they re bypassing gdi and using something more direct like the new directwrite and or direct2d apis


boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt	1
knuth-morris-pratt which is classic or boyer-moore which is sometimes faster


do-while	break	1
if you want to break this convention then perhaps changing it to a do-while loop is more appropriate


x86	64bit	42
pax s aslr implementation for 64bit x86 machines is much stronger than linux s default 64bit aslr implementation

and not to forget on the 32 bit machines choose x86 as target platform while on the 64bit machines choose x64

it did not work with the above error was because i used wins x86 version so i downloaded wins x86 64bit version and it works

some older 32-bit x86 cpus also worked internally with 32-bit integers and operations on 16-bit integers required more clock cycles due to translation to from 32-bit this is not true with more modern 32-bit or 64bit x86 processors as they allow copying 16-bit integers to from 32-bit registers and operating on them with fewer such penalties

if you pick x86 or anycpu then you get the 32-bit version of sgen x64 begets the 64bit version of sgen

no intel or amd x86 manuals ever guarantee atomicity of anything wider than 64bit except for lock cmpxchg16b so this talk of sse vector loads stores being atomic on some cpus isn t something that you can reliably take advantage of or detect when it s supported

in practice i would like to link a 32-bit library when i choose x86 as platform but the 64bit version of it when i choose x64

in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64bit or 8-bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded

menuetos is an operating system in development for the pc written entirely in 32 64bit assembly language...supports 32 64bit x86 assembly programming for smaller faster and less resource hungry applications...menuet isn t based on other operating system nor has it roots within unix or the posix standards

unless you have a specific reason why you want the code to run as x64 it requires the larger address space or it does not perform well on a 32-bit platform it is usually simpler to choose x86 because that will work on both 32-bit and 64bit windows and does not require any modification to existing code originally developed for 32-bit windows

longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local variables into registers for faster access

the x86_64 64bit platform is much more than twice the width of the x86 32-bit

register spilling is pretty cheap on x86 cpus due to fast l1 caches and register shadowing and other tricks and the 64bit only registers are more costly to access in terms of larger instructions so it may just be that gcc s version is as fast or faster than the one you want

there seems to be a problem on win 64bit os with running this dos command from installshield script in that it cannot locate the file in the program files x86 area

x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack

x86 allows easier debugging - edit and continue is not supported when running in 64bit mode

64bit code is not actually faster it is usually a bit slower than x86 code

assuming you are working with 32bit x86 64bit x64 is harder to deal with you would have to either

i had better luck with the x86 one than the 64bit version in win 7

newer primarily 64bit x86 cpus support a more advanced technique called page attribute tables that allow for per-table setting of these modes instead of having a limited number of low-granularity registers

x86 doesn t support higher precision than 80 bits but if you really need more than 64bit for a fp algorithm most likely you should check your numerics instead of solving the problem with brute force

to me the path without x86 is also more visually appealing and indicates that it s a modern application - adapted for 64bit operation where necessary

amd64 64bit cpus have larger registers and more of them compared with x86 32 bit cpus

select x86 64bit from the platform pull-down menu

although maybe you should instead find some 32 64bit recent book for your os as the 32b protected mode on x86 is much easier to learn only the graphics output is not as straightforward as it was back in dos era but if you will mix your asm files with c++ loader which would for example initialize some window surface as argb memory array you can pass that pointer down to the asm routines and toy around with pixels in the same simple way how the old 320x200 mode 13h in dos worked

a 64bit capable x86 cpu is no worse at running 32-bit code

on arm it is not or rather 32-bit os on 64bit uefi is technically possible only would still require the operating system loader to be 64bit but even fiddlier than on x86

for other types of programs though 64bit can be faster than 32-bit at least on x86 x64

64bit amd and later intel machines run faster than 32-bit x86 machines because when amd designed the new instruction set they added more cpu registers and made sse math the default

however my tests have shown that on a 64bit system an anycpu prefer 32-bit application which i confirm runs 32-bit can allocate more memory than an x86 one

is this related to the fact java is installed in the program files x86 folder on a win 64bit

choose x64 if you will install a 64bit os or choose x86 if you will install a 32-bit os

however if you don t have specific reasons to use anycpu then you could still use x86 because in some cases the performances are better than 64bit code

in addition x86 is furhter complicated because there are generally separate documentation manuals for 32 bit and 64bit processors i m not familiar enough with arm to comment here

reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly

faster than on x86 32bits but slower than x64 64bit

operations on 64bit integers are faster on intel and amd 64bit x86 cpus than the same operations on 32-bit integers

on this screen php_info tells windows is 64bit but php is on x86 so you should choose x86 dll

64bit x86 chips have several more registers and this can in theory if the compiler takes advantage result in faster code in some cases

you cannot use a 32-bit dll in a 64bit process and indeed this generalizes- you cannot mix and match x86 and x64 code a single process is either entirely x64 or entirely x86

then under java se runtime environment select linux x86 if you re using ubuntu 32-bit or linux x64 for 64bit

the difference is in the first number which shows the rounding of the intermediate calculation so the problem happens because x86 has a higher internal precision 80 bit than the arm 64bit


karatsuba	strassen	1
i think karatsuba algorithm is best to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers.for sufficiently large n another generalization the schã nhageâ strassen algorithm is even faster


nsubstitute	moq	3
an alternative to using your own mock class they start to build after a while would be to use a mocking framework such as nsubstitute or moq it s more of a learning curve but quicker in the long run

using dependency injection e.g autofac this is much easier to assemble than before and with mocking tools nsubstitute moq this is much easier to do than you think

and there are some nice examples on the internet for frameworks like moq but the case is i prefer using nsubstitute


primes	palindrome	6
palindrome are a sparser set of numbers than primes and you can generate palindrome directly

when i m done with this program it is suppose to display all palindrome and all primes palindrome that are greater than 100 and less than the number input by the user

any algorithm that is based on generating primes then testing for a palindrome will be much slower that generating palindrome and then testing for primes

i am trying to print a primes palindrome which is greater or equal to a given number t

i m trying to create a program that outputs the highest primes than is a palindrome and is less than 1000

calculating primes takes more iteration than checking for a palindrome


uiview	caanimation	1
uiview animation is generally easier and more intuitive to use than caanimation


ggplot2	ggmap	1
for some things easier than ggplot2 or ggmap


libjpeg	libtiff	1
the situation is critical if on some platform libtiff provides a narrower functionality and does not link to libjpeg which will not be available on that platform at all so the above command for linking will fail due to unsatisfied library dependency


coldfusion	railo	4
i m creating a coldfusion railo api wrapper for mailchimp s restful services v3.0

not sure why you just accepted a terribly biased answer like best solution stick with coldfusion or railo from coldfusion is just better

note line value may be inaccurate in adobe coldfusion though railo is much better with this

there are many other small differences railo is generally stricter about syntax and semantics than adobe coldfusion and often those decisions are driven by performance concerns in that compatibility with adobe coldfusion would make railo slower


casting	autoboxing	1
is that casting from long to int plus sparsearray optimizations are going to be cheaper than autoboxing long to long for my hashmap operations


jnetpcap	libpcap	1
libpcap 0.9.8 if from 2007 so you should choose jnetpcap from around this year as well


klocwork	coverity	1
many companies see value and choose coverity or klocwork for a longer term solution although i see also running findbugs and pmd


dplyr	stringr	1
i personally find the use of dplyr and stringr to be easier to read months later when reviewing my code


subtract	addition	9
strict addition is rare but subtraction is more common like when you subtract one image from its filtered one

is there an api which handles decimal arithmetic compare subtract and addition in javascript

since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

however if the result a is added to or subtract from another expression and not reused then starting with the division may be more interesting since you can group the multiplication with the following addition by using a fma thus with a single rounding

division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

if you continue to use your method of performing this task then you need to manually check if the addition of the two lower order decimal digits has caused a carry by checking if the result of the addition is greater than 10 and if it is subtract 10 from the number and then add 1 to the higher order digit calculation

the next problem is a compare is a subtract subtract and add go through the same alu and take the same time as addition so for most platforms old and new trading compares subtraction for addition wont save you anything you end up looking at the branch cost pipeline flush etc

on most processors a boolean operation has no reason to significantly be slower or faster than an addition both are basic instructions even though comparison may take two of them subtract then comparing to zero

when the alu gets a command to subtract it is given 2 numbers - it makes a not to every bit of the second number and makes a simple addition and adds 1 more because 2 s complement is not to every bit +1


primefaces	richfaces	8
primefaces has more components but lack combobox available in richfaces

richfaces is more developed and tested generally since primefaces came out later than rf

i did my part of the research and found out that either richfaces or primefaces would be better but most of my applications were developed using icefaces

i haven t tried any of these in a jsf 2 application but i would recommend using the primefaces one at least the documentation is better than richfaces

one that always trips me up is that core uses render primefaces uses update and earlier versions of richfaces used rerender as the attribute to specify which other elements were the target of the ajax response

for the view layer we have to choose between primefaces icefaces 2 since we definitely want jsf2 and richfaces

choose richfaces or primefaces if it is an application that is used by your internal clients

my personal taste prefers primefaces but i haven t tried richfaces since it turned jsf 2 ready


agda	ats	1
ats is a dependently-typed language that is designed for low-level programming though it s somewhat less elegant than agda


popover	tooltip	4
a tooltip has more in common with a popover but they are generally regarded as a popup historically

not having the tooltip arrow of a popover would be better

you can also use bootstraps modal to display your message but personally i think bootstrap popover would be much better than a modal or you can simply display a tooltip asking user to sign up or sign in

how do i tell the popover or tooltip to be less aggressive with its apply or observe behavior


allegro	sdl	4
i recommend sdl small probably exactly what you need allegro similar or qt largeish

i was also looking at sdl allegro sfml i didnt see much tutorials help on this but heard its better than sdl

i personally recommend allegro 5 but you can also use sdl sfml clanlib qt wxwidgets or any of many other libraries to create a window for you

i d strongly recommend to go with allegro 5.1.x it s a little bit more difficult than sfml but very functional and easier than sdl it s got nice support and it s compatible with plenty of os


admob	inmobi	2
i am still testing with inmobi - cpms are not so good but at least their support replies within a day and they promised that they can provide cpms that can compete admob

i set ecpm for inmobi and mobfox higher than for admob


jtree	jtable	2
having said all that both the jtable and jtree would be far better components to display compound information

either is capable of doing it but swing is more modern and supports components jtree jtable .. and functionality double-buffering built-in key bindings plafs support for rich text that is missing from the awt apis


openssl	m2crypto	1
m2crypto is no longer maintained and doesn t work with openssl 1.0 and newer


cpu	affinity	9
the cpu affinity is more like a suggestion to the kernel regarding which cpu to use

i have created a window application in c#.now i want to set the cpu affinity for this application.i may have 2 processors 4 processors 8 processors or may be more than 8 processors

cpu affinity it s better for the cpu to have a load average of 1.0 and processes to have affinity to a single core

can it be the hard cpu affinity proceses are running slower because they are affected while being bound to a crowded zone

while it would be highly unfeasible to create a test that would exercise every possible code path in tpl you can certainly setup a test that would benefit from many available cores set the affinity mask to 1 cpu and observe through task manager that the affinity never changes and cpu utilization is never more than 1 n where n is the # of cores present

on a system with more than one processors or processors cores you can normally assuming you do have a smp-enabled system cpu affinity doesn t prevent it expect those two processes to use both processors but you do not strictly have a guarantee

running the test on a single cpu was significantly faster â œforcedâ by setting thread affinity with setthreadaffinitymask and checked with getcurrentprocessornumber

if i set the cpu affinity to cpu0 the cpu usage is 5 but after setting affinity to other cpu the cpu usage increased to 9 12 especially set to cpu20 the cpu usage is more than 25

but i found if i do not set their cpu affinity that is they run on same core 0 the time performance get better than setting cpu affinity 8.76s vs 14.66s


variance	kurtosis	2
higher kurtosis means more of the variance in the image is the result of infrequent extreme deviations as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations

for this measure higher kurtosis means more of the variance is the result of infrequent extreme deviations as opposed to frequent modestly sized deviations


slug	permalinks	2
slug will work too but permalinks would be better i want to set it to a different domain

i want my permalinks to be accessable via more than one slug


virtualenv	tox	1
for that i recommend using tox and having it configured to create a 2.6 environment to test on so that when your coworkers run your test suite the tests are run in a 2.6 virtualenv


lasagne	pylearn	1
and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn


jtextfield	jpasswordfield	1
is there some alternative to jtextfield jpasswordfield that is more suitable for this job


away3d	papervision3d	2
from what i have seen papervision3d and away3d should do much more then 3d charting but i haven t seen any examples on how to draw surfaces in any of them except this line chart in 3d

preface papervision3d is close to unsupported closed as a library so i highly recommend using away3d or another actionscript 3d library


couchbase	couchdb	4
the couchdb team is intent on merging bigcouch soon after the almost-ready 1.3 release so starting to look into bigcouch would certainly make sense and i would personally definitely pick bigcouch over couchbase or couchdb-lounge -- many of the bigcouch contributors are couchdb committers anyway

couchbase looks more like a memcache server with a persistence layer powered by couchdb and maybe it does not fit your needs

i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level it s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together

couchbase btw also uses binary replication mechanism which will be more efficient than couchdb as long as the couchdb protocol is not utilized for bidirectional data exchange and conflict resolution


ng-style	ng-class	1
but i would prefer ng-class over ng-style because i really dont think inline-css is a good idea


monomac	xamarin.mac	1
so if initially xamarin.mac was more of a tool chain based on monomac from then on it became a completely different beast with new powers to conquer more challenges


heroku	openshift	3
having used both i can tell you that it s a much more polished platform the servers are about 4ã faster you can run as many apps as you want and the heroku toolbelt is much more powerful than the openshift s client tools

so i would have to choose between heroku dotcloud and openshift

i d like to know what is the difference between heroku and openshift for now i m going to use the free package for my blog i ve noticed the openshift has more supported techs


istream	atof	1
atof is indeed better in reading floating point values than istream


width	font-size	22
this means that font-size is more comparable to height than it is to width

i initialize the loop with this value and increment the font-size with 1 until the string is wider than the width of the containing element

when you are using fittext at that time if the font-size is greater than 100px than you have to set the exact width as per your font-size

you can remove the transform s and the margin-left and add a width set as 0 here smaller than the font-size 16px here to the get the effect

you can then check if the width of the text is greater than 800px and reduce the font-size until the width is less than or equal to

in order to keep the date nicely fit across the width of the screen i decided to dynamically let the font-size change whenever the string changes in width may is wider than jul

keep on lowering the font-size until the span s width is less than the fixed width

from there on the width slowly increases again as the part of the string still on line 1 linearly gets wider as the font-size increases

as you can see the font-size of the text is bit larger than the width of the noisy lines

once the clone s width is less than or equal to the input element s width we delete the clone element and set the input s font-size

if you dont want to crop the image at all or use javascript i think your only choice is to force the text element to have the same proportions as the image with width approximately being 50 larger than height and then adjust the font-size text elements to fit the container

obs the font-size must be dynamic having text height limited by container height when container width is larger than text width and limited by container width when container width is smaller then text width

i ve also experimented with the line-height also when decreasing both height and line-height to 1 px the added height gets worse and font-size i ve put the height and width as attributes instead of inline css a div inside the td etc

if width of text element is bigger than width of container decrease font-size by some value for example by 0.1px and go to step 3

if the width is greater than the fixed width bump the font-size down and then check the width again

as it fit for device but as font-size increase in both width and height so fonts and elements were messing up because font-size was bigger with respect to width

the only font-size is on the body tag but what happens is that the div is square but the button has a smaller height than its width

that being said using viewport units for font-size in the above way is problematic because when the viewport width is much smaller - say 320px - then the rendered font size will become 0.03 x 320 9.6px which is very too small

in this way you force font-size for all elements containing a paragraph p inside a generic col-xs class col-xs-6 col-xs-3 specifically an only when screen width is lower than typical screen width used by xs suffix of bootstrap classes

that is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equal to 800px

the first media query says that if the screen width is less than 992px the h2 in the item class should have a font-size of 3rem should be red and should have an underline

determine if the span s width is greater than the useable width of the input element and update the font-size accordingly


bitwise-and	modulo	3
for large numbers would using a bitwise-and operation be more efficient for determining the parity of a number whether it is even or odd than using the modulo

in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

i read in couple of blogs that in java modulo reminder operator is slower than bitwise-and


mechanicalsoup	robobrowser	1
the problem is that it is slower that doing your own request so i recommend using robobrowser or mechanicalsoup before trying selenium


nant	cruisecontrol	3
i usually prefer nant with cruisecontrol for build integration but then my work is mostly .net which makes it a great fit

think about project management bug reports and it all adds up to something more than just cruisecontrol svn and nant

if you are taking a more open source approach such as teamcity cruisecontrol then nant may be better


vlookup	countif	6
i have tried sumproducts index match vlookup countif - i could be missing something

abs acos and asin atan atan2 average choose columns concatenate cos count counta countblank countif date datevalue daverage day dcount dcounta ddb degrees dget dmax dmin dproduct dstdev dstdevp dsum dvar dvarp error.type exact exp fact find fv hlookup hour if index int irr isblank iserr iserror islogical isna isnontext isnumber istext left len ln log log10 lookup lower match max mid min minute mod month n na not now nper npv or pi pmt power product proper pv radians rand rank rate replace rept right round rows second sin sln sqrt stdev stdevp substitute sum sumifs sumproduct syd t tan time timevalue today trim trunc upper value var varp vlookup year false and true

instead of using vlookup or match use countif that will not produce an error so no error handling is required

bear in mind that index is the same as vlookup in that it will only return the first value if two tenders finished on the same day it will only return the first it comes across if you have more than one maybe sumifs would work better maybe along side countif to show how many there were

have a look into vlookup match sumifs sumifs countif countif

functions like match vlookup and hlookup need to match data type number or text whereas countif sumifs make no distinction


chown	chmod	2
but changing the chmod maybe even working with umask is better than dealing with root-access and using chown

fleet	orchestration	1
fleet docs say fleet is no longer actively developed or maintained by coreos and link to container orchestration moving from fleet to kubernetes


ant	eclemma	1
also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool


tortoisegit	svn	3
the compare dialog of tortoisegit is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commits of the same branches both pointing to the same svn central repo

nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk

never been a fan of git i prefer using svn and hg but considering both tortoisesvn and tortoisehg are quite good i d recommend trying tortoisegit which is a port of tortoisesvn to work with git instead of svn


pandas	bcolz	1
i haven t played around with it recently but i think bcolz is more flexible here in terms of mixing dtypes but doesn t give you all the pandas dataframe conveniences obviously


quicksort	shellsort	2
i did not implemenet and test shellsort which often beats quicksort in practice

if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort


jsf	seam	7
well for that you ll need jsf that is better integrated with seam and jsf does not handle file uploads that actually everyone use so you have to put also icefaces that actually are better managed by maven that you currenty are not using... neverending story

be sure to be perfectly comfortable with environment ide + plugins nothing beats jsf there i d pick richfaces + seam today if full java ee is option

jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3

seam is more powerful with jsf but not necessarily richfaces or icefaces for they mostly just extend the component set which is anyway fall down to standard html components when rendered by jsf

seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above

cdi is so much more mature than seam 2 bijection jsf 2 is so much easier than jsf 1.2 that any kind of application development will simply be much more fun with seam 3

spring security is fine too but if you plan to use jsf 2 you probably also use cdi provided by seam weld which is integrated into the java ee 6 profile from glassfish and jboss it is easier to use shiro as spring heavily relies on its own dependency injection methods although spring security does not need that much injected classes but you should stick to one way of doing things


iwa	adfs	1
the reason that you would choose adfs over iwa is that both authenticate against ad but only adfs adds sso and federation functionality


jaydata	datajs	1
since the test database is exposed with the odata protocol you can do crud operations from any ajax tool but i recommend datajs or jaydata


ant	cruisecontrol	1
if you are interested in improving your coding standards and build systems then i highly recommend using ant junit cobertura checkstyle and findbugs together with a continuous integration server hudson or cruisecontrol and a version control system git


screens	pixel-density	1
just use media queries targeting a screens with lower resolution and use pixel-ratio and pixel-density to be more specific targetting modern mobile devices


glut	glew	1
if you are a noob then i don t think that starting with mesa running on any kind of vm is a good idea.mesa setup is pretty complex in general.also mesa opengl is outdated.it supports up to 3.2 version atm.if you want to get started with opengl the right and clean way you should better setup context with libs like glut or glfw and load gl extension with glew there are more


chameleon	jinja2	1
template engines are rarely the cause of performance problems even if chameleon is slightly faster than jinja2 i doubt the effort of learning a new template language etc


gulp-concat	gulp-less	1
2 you ll need to use gulp-less and gulp-concat to turn multiple less files into one css file and gulp-concat again to turn multiple js files into one


mbunit	mstest	3
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

this example is in mstest but mbunit is more or less equivalent


testng	easymock	1
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take


zoo	xts	7
it s also easier to use read.zoo instead of read.csv because merging time-series is a lot easier with xts zoo objects

for additional awesomeness the zoo and xts packages have many more functions which are great for various aggregations past the day level of detail

perhaps using xts or zoo might be easier i am not sure.

imho xts or zoo would be a better data structure if you actually have time series data

xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point

i recommend xts zoo

however there are many others ts xts which is generally faster than zoo .


checkbox	dropdownlistfor	14
the function - dropdownlistfor on click select by checkbox display selection in the input box

when user select value from dropdownlistfor select date and press search button user can view data in grid according to the selected field till now i have completed my project now what i want is when i select a checkbox to show data related to particular column in the gridview in bulk suppose i have 50 user and 25 are from delhi city now i want when user select checkbox it can only view delhi user in the grid how can i do that..thanks in advance

as administrator i want to create user account and based on selected role from dropdownlistfor refresh form to select by checkbox specific accesses bool connected with role

so the values can be mapped with each list now by the property of checkbox you can select more than one checkbox unlike radio button so when such case comes the dropdownlistfor that is being populated on the basis of each checkbox selection now comes in a merged format like on selecting option 1 and option 2 both the list contains all the elements mapped to both further on de-selecting it comes back to unmerged state

i have a simple multi select dropdownlistfor where i m trying to get the checkbox and label to stay inline with each other without the label text wrapping around the checkbox

everything is fine except for displaying select dropdownlistfor and checkbox lists for wordpress tags posts and custom taxonomies if exists

i need to have a dropdownlistfor which has to be grouped and also should be able to multi select using checkbox using primefaces

i have a dropdownlistfor multi select with checkbox with list of countries.as soon as i check an item in the first drop down i should list all the unchecked items in the second drop down.and viceversa

i have investigated libs cq gui components authoring dialog dropdownshowhide clientlibs dropdownshowhide.js but it s not really fit for purpose given that this is specifically designed for hiding or showing fields based on value of dropdownlistfor and my attempts to modify it to allow similar funationality on a checkbox have been less than fruitful

this is ugly but its the best i have been able to come up with so far to distinguish between input types checkbox radio text and select dropdownlistfor

i am using multiple select dropdownlistfor with checkbox

hi i was using sumo select dropdownlistfor with checkbox it is working fine on ie browser and with no flickering but on the chrome browser it is flickering when first time page loaded or refresh the page any one solve me figure out this problems.here i am attach the code

i have a dropdownlistfor that will select checkbox based on the value of the dropdownlistfor

they wanted to produce a button that upon the user-click it would open up a user-form and have a variety of macro-related options to choose from a dropdownlistfor checkbox option select button etc


ssl	spdy	4
well if you re willing to buy an ssl certificate or already have one i would recommend using spdy it s available in the nginx-extras package to enable it you just add it to the listen line

plus once spdy becomes more common ssl slow down won t really account for anything much

i m using keep-alive so i think the ssl handshake is more or less totally out but i hope to move to spdy soon so i don t really know how that helps after the initial handshake

if we assume that you live in a poor coverage area and your phone and your tower are constantly dropping the signal then re-establishing a spdy connection is no worse off than re-establishing a tcp connection modulo ssl handshake


glfw	freeglut	1
for beginners freeglut or glfw is more simple and portable than pure win32


urwid	ncurses	3
you can use python ncurses it s a part of standard library on nix systems or you can use urwid that is a higher level library for creating console interfaces

easier than ncurses would be to use urwid

if ncurses is not enough for some undescribed reason pycdk or urwid could be better suited to your needs


powerpc	i386	3
on i386 the dyld stub is much faster than the powerpc equivalent so we didnâ t bother doing extra work to bypass it

to facilitate building of universal binaries we ve modified the cflags and cxxflags to include -arch i386 -arch powerpc when compiling wrapper code ogre3d itself already seems to be an universal binary

be aware that there is more than just powerpc and i386 although these are the safest architectures to choose for a universal binary


objectoutputstream	objectinputstream	2
objectinputstream and objectoutputstream are much simpler to use with plain java io

i have read many times that one may not use more than one objectoutputstream or objectinputstream


octal	decimal	8
bitshifts just go easier with hexadecimal than decimal and is often more convenient to read than octal

the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

that number cannot be larger than binary 111 which is equal to 7 in both decimal and octal

hex or maybe octal depending on the machine being emulated will be clearer than using decimal since similar opcodes tend to vary in bits not digits

octal or decimal are easier to use and maintain for bit masking imo

or it can choose a base automatically if base is specified as zero same as the c compiler does depending on how the number is written a leading 0 chooses octal a leading 0x or 0x chooses hexadecimal else decimal

you ll need to convert binary to another base here i use decimal when writing this code because c doesn t have binary constants which would be ten times more useful than octal constants

this means the buffer is enough for printing the number in octal and since decimal representation uses no more digits than octal it will be enough for decimal representation too


excon	eventmachine	1
if you re using faraday and start out with net http you can later decide to use excon typhoeus patron or eventmachine without changing more than a line or two of configuration


appendto	each	2

dpkt	scapy	2
or is it just that scapy is slower than dpkt

scapy is a better performer than dpkt


elasticsearch	kibana	9
so if you want to use kibana please choose elasticsearch as your logs output

while i have found plenty of documentation and tutorials about how to actually install and configure elasticsearch logstash and kibana i have found less information about how i should set up the software across my servers to maximize performance

if you would like a unified front-end for elasticsearch and opentsdb you could consider grafana which has support for both elasticsearch and opentsdb but less functionality than kibana in regard to elasticsearch

odd that elasticsearch is more tolerant than kibana

as kibana is the webui for elasticsearch it is better make it high availability

use kibana i prefer using kibana to postman for elasticsearch query

the new name is meant to clarify that the company is more than just elasticsearch such as the open source logstash and kibana

you can use other framework like elasticsearch and kibana to have more functionality available for the logs

this is too high level to implement this on kibana lets make it more in elasticsearch context


ocamllex	ocamlyacc	3
i choose ocamllex ocamlyacc to parse python ast to c ast

or ocamllex + ocamlyacc should be more than enough

one of the main reasons i still prefer ocamlyacc ocamllex over treetop despite its very sexy appearance. this means you need to convert from left recursive forms to right recursion


kivy	pyqt	1
if you don t plan to move to mobiles later tkinter or pyqt may be a better choice than kivy


cprofile	timeit	1
you should always use the timeit module for time trials it is far more accurate than cprofile here


flask	django	33
for a 2014 answer i would recommend laravel slim php ruby on rails sinatra ruby django flask python grails groovy jvm-based language play

both frameworks are fairly easy to implement flask is much easier than django imo although django has a built in authentication layer that you can use albeit more difficult to implement in a client server scenario like you need

if you re looking for something less heavy than django perhaps try flask or bottle

having used both flask and django for a bit now i must say that i much prefer flask for most things

you must use flask ot django my prefer is flask for this

but if the use of mongodb is a must then i suggest that you reconsider using django in the first place because mongodb has a better integration with flask through mongoengine

i am trying re-write an application in django which was earlier in written in flask

in this approach you won t get much from django you are better of with bottle flask

our team use django as our frame before but now we use flask as our frame because it is more light than django but we still use django template.

flask is more focused on simplicity instead of functionality while django has more functionality

i know you said django but i would highly recommend flask

django is an all-in-one package while pyramid and flask give you more flexibility

i read that flask for beginner is better than django because educational reasons at the same time django have django oscar

i m building an application in both bottle and flask to see which i am more comfortable with as django is too much batteries included

if you are looking for a web framework simpler than django look at flask flask uses jinja2 as the default template engine

i can think of two relatively straightforward things you can do without ditching php though i have to mention that php doesn t have much to recommend it and you would likely be better off with python django python flask or ruby rails

either will do the trick but bottle or in my preference flask will be faster as it is much more lightweight than django

but a friend told me to begin with flask as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning django as django is more complicated than flask

now you can get all those same features with flask if you re prepared to do some integration work but the argument can just as easily be made that django is better for beginners precisely because it does come with all those things built-in

i do prefer flask over django but it doesn t matter what you use

it became apparent that options like flask django would be better suited for the task due to the frameworks

also as soon as you re comfortable with flask you can easily move to django and have more fun while playing with it thereafter

django is very batteries included meaning that it comes with much more out-of-the-box than say flask and to me a large part of that the user auth system

i do prefer sqlalchemy over django orm for projects where django.contrib.admin is not important i tend to use flask instead of django

if you are looking for the latter then flask is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than django

some say that if you won t use django admin interface you d better to choose flask instead

there is a lot of already done frameworks like flask and django that gives you more power easily

i want to make a application that run as a web application or desktop application i know how to implement for a web server using django or flask i prefer django but is there any way to port it to a desktop application too

i would suggest furthering your knowledge of python it s an amazing language so it s gonna be fun and then go back to django or maybe start with a smaller framework like flask which does less magic

oviously noone can make the decision for you but maybe i compare django flask a little

as a begginer the frameworks that i best recommend are flask and django and other flask- restful or restless or other packages that mantain the flask- part fixed and the name after the - changes

flask has a really great albeit smaller than django community and there are a lot of extensions available for common web-app extensions in the extensions directory

current task looks like flask is ok for it since it is smaller and simplier than django


umask	chmod	1
but changing the chmod maybe even working with umask is better than dealing with root-access and using chown


filewriter	printwriter	3
i m not sure if printwriter or filewriter is better but printwriter worked for me

you need to create a fileoutputstream and decorates it with printstream or better filewriter with printwriter

printwriter is more effective than filewriter and filewriter is needed anyhow but this will work also if you want to do multiples people then just for-loop it and dont forget to close


rtp	rtmp	1
the chance of receiving video streams over http is higher than rtsp rtp rtmp and so on


realloc	malloc	32
you could have some initial guess for maxsize 8 and grow when needed your data perhaps by using realloc or just by malloc -ing a bigger new chunk copying the older chunk inside then free -ing that older chunk

if you want to instrument libc s malloc calloc realloc things are even simpler - just wrap them in your allocator functions

a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

in c you would use malloc to get memory realloc to get more memory and free to release memory

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does

i mean i think realloc is way smarter so why do we even need malloc

if new is greater than old malloc additional pointers on the end of the array instead of trying to realloc them

if you want to be able to change it during runtime you need to declare it dynamically using malloc and make it larger using realloc

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

malloc often gives you more memory that you ask and stores the actual value in a special location that realloc can access at a later time

generally new delete and malloc realloc free arrange for more memory from the os using sbrk or os-specific-equivalent and divide the pages up however they like to satisfy the program s allocation requests

i know that realloc would be much easier to use but i am trying to do this only using malloc

as we can see copying manually with memcpy is always slower than realloc because in this scenario malloc is guaranteed to allocate new memory and you re forced to copy the data in every allocation which shows us that realloc is indeed reusing the same address and enlarging the block size in some cases

use of malloc or realloc can give you better way to allocate memory

the standard way to do this is to use malloc to allocate an array of some size and start reading into it and if you run out of array before you run out of characters that is if you don t reach eof before filling up the array pick a bigger size for the array and use realloc to make it bigger

i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free

but if it works with large datasets the users will notice that using the malloc -only program slows down other programs much more than the realloc -using program with the same data

that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

since i don t know how many words are in a document i m using malloc to assign a certain amount of memory to the array holding all the words at first then using realloc to make it bigger if i ve filled that up

the only reason to prefer malloc free is if you want to optimize reallocations with realloc which isn t supported by operator new delete realloc is not a simple free+malloc

realloc is worse than malloc in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during the realloc

you will have to initially use malloc and then use realloc to allocate more memory on each step

if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent

the tool recommends replacing realloc with malloc memcpy and free

fiddly stuff and this is one case where i d recommend using malloc free realloc rather than c++ memory management

now you either use realloc or assign a bigger space to pointer1 with malloc at earlier stage

actually i usually don t recommend using realloc for that reason just do the malloc memcpy free yourself

in the above code i attempt to make a pointer to a dynamic array of structs unsure if i succeeded in that part but my main concern is i use malloc to create space on the heap for the array people. later in the code i create another struct person and use realloc to create more space on the heap for people. i then write to memory outside of what i thought i gave space for by doing people 5 .someone rob

the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free


jquery	curvycorners	2
the jquery plugin i would recommend is curvycorners it does not require you to change anything

i know another plugin named jquery corner is available however it s file size being massively bigger than curvycorners i decided to with curvycorners


button	checkbox	248
i am using icheck plugin to make my checkbox and radio button looks better

when user selects checkbox i m saving this value attribute to an array ...so the user is clicking checking and unchecking and after some time he will press the button

on web site we have text button select button checkbox and search button together in the first we can use textbox with same code we can wirte same text in text button in the first

select radio button regular expression select checkbox

this function has three checkbox and a compare button

add and add isdisabled in ng-disabled attribute so when you select checkbox button is disabled and deselect checkbox enable button

i have group of checkbox each of this checkbox associated to a li tag which contain a query result i have also button so i want when i check more than one checkbox and after that click on button i want to display text of li tag for each selected checkobox

when user select checkbox button it will show uistepper just below it

you want your toggle button to behave more like radio rather than checkbox so why not just convert them all to radio

button select selects checkbox and button deselect - deselects it

the problem is that if i have more than one checkbox checked and i want to uncheck one the button disables

when user selects items with checkbox a button appears in bottom which is then clicked to delete items

then you can see a few checkbox and at the bottom there are two button you can also use hyperlinks but button are easier to work with

once initialized the form will automatically validate as per the various event callbacks built into the plugin such as submit onkeyup onfocusout and select button checkbox click

as such creating a radio button rather than checkbox is a better solution

i have a form with multiple checkbox and a button by default the button will be disable but after checking at least 2 or more than 2 checkbox the button should become active

2 - if i select checkbox two and press delete button checkbox two will be removed and i want the checkbox three to move up to checkbox two position and checkbox four to move up to checkbox three position

only form controls inputs selects checkbox button etc. will populate data inside of and the key inside of the array will be set equal to the value of the name attribute of the form control

i want to get multiple checkbox values from the listed select checkbox on submit button

on the add button will open another forms which will load all the items and a checkbox to select which item to be added then a select button which copy the selected datarows to datatable

the form is questionnaire for a user test including radio button combo-boxes multi select checkbox test areas and a button for submit

the user will check a few more than 1 checkbox and hit the start button which will send out emails with information on checkbox selected in the dynamic table

currently i am able to generate checkbox in column what i need is one more column with button same as checkbox in each row

it would also take further work to create the page that lists the organizations with the checkbox with a select button that updates the organizations raw id field

see the red rectangle you can click the middle button and checked hover checkbox then you will find the reason

as show in image first select checkbox for different records from datagrid1 which want to copy and then on copy button copy selected rows in another datagrid2 with one additional column quantity .in quantity coloumn then i am adding new value manually

i was startled though to find that when running on android and ios mobile devices i couldn t select checkbox or radio button nor follow a tags with a tap

scenario 2 multi select select check box with status dead and then select checkbox with hit status you can observe delete button will be enabled which should not happen in my case as in a multi selection and there is a status of dead type which should make button disabled on overall which is not happening

since you are creating a submit button for each form but you seem to want to trigger the submit when the checkbox is changed a simpler solution might be

in the shopify admin each product has a series of checkbox that allow the user to toggle between online store point of sale buy button and mobile app

the web developer toolbar has a great forms populate form fields command which will fill in a textbox s value with it s name attribute and automatically select checkbox and items from radio button sets

on the server off jsfiddle the submit button sits inline with the checkbox and tick text and the checkbox sits higher than the tick text rather than inline

so i think a custom checkbox is the better choice here but if you really want to use a button i would use a hidden checkbox field and apply onclick functions to the button to change the value of a hidden checkbox field

my aim is when i check pick checkbox button uncheck the drop check box

select manage button and you ll get a pop out deselect the checkbox across project name and ok it

an option would be to use preset numbers and have the user select from a dropdown select checkbox or radio button

newly created groups click more than 2 checkbox then a group button will appear now click the group button then an alert pop will appear asking you to enter group name.enter some name and click ok.then that name will now appear on the right side group table.now clcik the group name then those members will be selected.i want to the same from existing groups also.please tell me how

but when we loaded our older look and feel which was written way before the synth look and feel then all of the gui elements radio button button checkbox etc showed the older look and feel

essentially radio button are a more semantically correct way of styling a toggle and they can be styling to look like a toggle just like checkbox could too

currently in orders.html page when i select checkbox and press the button it goes to orders.html test and prints the item from list

using checkbox to check uncheck is better than radio button

turn on the debug executable checkbox and click the choose button

what i d like to do is make the button images slightly larger than the checkbox and have the text checkbox and both button on the same line

i have an application with three textviews and one checkbox in each row of a listview.what i want that on a click of a button i will be able to get the state of each checkbox and the row corresponding to ischecked checkbox get deleted.one more thing my checkbox are hardcoded in an xml file.i have searched a lot but couldn t find anything specific.thanks in advance.here is my code.

you have to use javascript to style select checkbox radio button

i ve got a box with checkbox and i wanted that button submit appear only if one checkbox was marked when more than one box is checked the button submit must disappear i ve tried code it using addclass and removeclass provides by jquery here s my code for now

you can re-execute this check by updating a persistent parent component of the button using on change of the select checkbox menu

when i did this for a project i found that setting the value of select fields radio button and checkbox necessitated more complex code something along the lines of

when i select button i am using checkbox image when again tap on button it deselect the checkbox image.when i select the button in first row scroll the tabelview it also checks the button on 3rd or 4th row

while the differences may seem insignificant at first the correct usage of radio button and checkbox creates a better user experience because the site behaves in a way they expect

the user selects checkbox and then hits a button to print the sheets associated with each checkbox that is checked

initially the value of button is disable because value of button is true so the button is disabled.after selecting the checkbox now the button should be able to click

obviously for something like show hide functionality a checkbox makes more sense than a button

i have textbox to add service.also user can add multiple text boxes when button add field clicked.there are checkbox to show main services.what i want to do is when user add multiple textboxes select checkbox and submit.it should be insert to mysql table row by row.this is my code

i have an asp page where the status of a list is approved by selecting checkbox and then pressing approve button however when i select more than one checkbox it throws the error index was out of range

on a side note are your sure radio button wouldn t be better suited to your needs you will be able to see the definite answer for each questions whereas checkbox are more for submitted only the selected checkbox

checkbox and radio button were working well earlier

running the snippet you can see a static checkbox bootstrap rendered and a button to add more checkbox

when you submit an html form the only values that get posted are those that are in input fields such as text fields selects checkbox button etc

so lets say you have to following form which consists of a multiple select checkbox list and a button

in both cases plus minus same except in case where is the small checkbox the button is bigger on width maybe it is related with space for checkbox

also if i select a radio from group1 and a radio from group2 button is still disabled and then select checkbox the button gets enabled if i change order it works fine

i know we could use activex radio button but we d prefer to avoid activex if possible plus with checkbox we have more control over the layout

i had created a simple form with select checkbox and radio button

in this project how can i add mark all checkbox besides select button

unlike radio button the user can select more than one checkbox at once or select none of them at all

checkbox radio textfield textarea select button imagebutton hiddenfield

anyway as stated by other a radio button would be better you can style it as a checkbox if that s what you need

and when i select checkbox and then unselect the same checkbox i can t get back to add button state

a button may be more appropriate for clearing the checkbox

all the other fields i m using text fields selects checkbox work as expected just the radio button i m having problems with

i select row with checkbox and i click a button to update the select registers in the database using jquery + ajax + php

actually i found out why using two radio button with same names and different values true and false is better than checkbox

on a button click javascript validation should be if a user select one checkbox it should allow to process further to any script but when user selects more than one checkbox it should prompt that you can select only one check box

checkbox may be a better fit than button here

i am having one mainactivity in the activity i have given an button if we click the button it shows tabactivity which contains contact and group activity.if we select using checkbox either contact or group it has to automatically comes to the editbox with the content of our selected one

i ve been trying to apply icheck plugins to my radio and checkbox and i just cannot figure out why my radio button keep selecting more than a single option with no experience in jquery i think i might need help with this

you ll want to have multiple radio button each with it s own value to set some property to although this is weird for a yes no you are better off with a checkbox but if you had multiple values this is how radio button work

each time a checkbox is changed and less than 2 in the form are checked changehandler calls the next function to make sure that the checkbox are fully functional and disables the submit button so that the form cannot be submitted

2 from this dialog box they select check dates and using the select button in the dialog box a post request is made to a controller action which based on the selected checkbox calculates a few form fields and returns the partial view

i create a button so that we can select checkbox first and filter result after we click the button

doesn t work with radio button select checkbox

so if more than 2 checkbox are selected then a button named group appears

i want to create a select button which can select deselect only filtered results select the checkbox from the first column of filtered results only

i have different kinds of elements - textboxes selects checkbox and radio button on my view

the idea is to compare up to four products the ones they select via checkbox and when the press the compare button it will send the values of the hidden inputs to a page which i can then use to query a database

they wanted to produce a button that upon the user-click it would open up a user-form and have a variety of macro-related options to choose from a dropdownlistfor checkbox option select button etc

select any number of checkbox click compare button for comparison

i have few form elements and a radio button in my jsp page and few other form elements text field text area select checkbox etc in a div tag

radio button and checkbox have more than its input area grayed since the background for them consists of more than an input area

when i click on the button will display popup table for user choose items by checkbox

the new project has two job numbers so instead of using the job number text box at the top i need to add option button or checkbox whichever is easier to choose between the two different job numbers for the four groups of information

select checkbox and click button after that again unselect and click

which component provide us opening multiselection menu with checkbox via click empty part on left or clicking select button on appbar

add column ----- name the column || type select checkbox button image or link || give column header name

this is a css issue you can inspect the button using google-chrome or firefox i prefer google-chrome and see what css properties your button has then disable those properties on fly one by one clicking on their checkbox and see if your button is clickable after disabling a property

when i am not selecting checkbox in my gridview and press delete button it show error no check box has been selected but when after that when i select checkbox and click on delete button it still showing that error don t knw why

for that the user need to select checkbox and click a button to send all emails checked

side note the checkbox you have there imply that the user should only be choosing one of them something can t simultaneously be on time and late for instance - radio button would be a better ui choice here

one option is to use the preupdate hook and add a checkbox to the edit action but a button would be much nicer

i have a list of students with checkbox along them so that the user can select checkbox and after clicking on the remove button those are removed from the list meaning i insert them in a different table

one more thing i also want select only one radio button when i have selected more than 2 checkbox

so the values can be mapped with each list now by the property of checkbox you can select more than one checkbox unlike radio button so when such case comes the dropdownlistfor that is being populated on the basis of each checkbox selection now comes in a merged format like on selecting option 1 and option 2 both the list contains all the elements mapped to both further on de-selecting it comes back to unmerged state

if i ticked more than one checkbox only one row is deleted each time i clicked delete button

you can make use of removeprop to unselect radio button and prop to select checkbox

you would need to build up a standard javascript object yourself by looping over the form controls being smart about how you handle selects checkbox and radio button and then using the file api to read the data from the file input

now each of my has multiple controls like select checkbox button but not fixed for every row and column

you need two button one for up and one for down or you could use one button and a checkbox for up or down but i think two button is simpler

i have multiple checkbox on my page and a select all button.i want that when i press the select button all elements on the page to be checked.this is the javascript code that i have tried

for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined

your form_selection routine should draw a form which has a select checkbox radio button or whatever that will post a string or integer for the switch back to the script you are running from

i think select elements are even harder than radio button and checkbox i don t think there is a reliable html css only for this

the problem is a user can select checkbox a multiple checkbox and after clicking the submit button the lp_number and title should be stored in the database after method create gets executed

while ajax request is in progress if user performs any subsequent action on other input elements select checkbox or radio button on same page that request is not getting queued up

i want to search the form called by formvalidation function for specific class name across all inputs select checkbox radio button

i have some problem with a form which contains foreach and i input submit button outside of form out of foreach but when i select checkbox it get only first checkbox

i want to style radio checkbox select button file uploads inputs

those areas each have an add button which creates a new dynamic row with textboxes and various select checkbox elements so the user can specify options for that object

i want to make a shallow copy of a populated form so if user select checkbox and presses close instead of save button then i want to replace the scheduleform with the checkbox with shallow copy form scheduleform2 which is empty

user selects checkbox and then press an action button to perform some action on selected items delete for example

i want to have the possibility to first select checkbox i tried with return false and event.preventdefault but these completely switch the selection off and then by clicking the button - trigger functions from checkbox

the user chooses checkbox the lines he wants to delete and press the delete selected button

it is much harder to style the elements of the forms like for example input select checkbox or radio button as it seems they are controlled by operating system right

when i reload my html pages its button select and checkbox are goes added more and more.because all the html data fetch from a data base and after added new things in the page i store all the html of the page in data base and when i display this page agiain becuase of jquery mobile its button select and checkbox are increased check here visit jsfiddle.net sharma9853 gbe6p 7

i select checkbox in the datatable and press button and when i return to the page it got deselected

so yes this means the form is now ready and it will automatically do a validation test triggered on all common events such as submit onkeyup onfocusout and select button checkbox click

i want to select checkbox when i click on select all button

i have put a button for each row which i want to create on click event for it to get the id of that row and be able to send user to second page to edit that row info but i have problem with checking this multiple button if it were checkbox it was easier

i choose button over checkbox in this case because i think they are handier and faster to work with

i have noticed that in your form you are using checkbox where radio button would fit better like for field mobile

here i am retriving data from database and i am doing insert update and delete of data using checkbox.my problem is when i click more than two checkbox than also i am moving to update.php page but what i actually want is that when i click on update button first it will check that only one checkbox is selected from list if not than alert message should display like select only one checkbox

the entity type field could be only select checkbox or radio button depending on expanded and multiple options so these are not option for you

when i select checkbox option and click on some action button id s of the selected records should pass to view and perform execute logic on the selected records

i have added select checkbox and once a row or rows have been selected and the delete button is clicked the form calls an external non-wordpress file to delete the rows corresponding to the ids in the get for me to see the data being passed

how about select checkbox and radio button

there is a select button that once pressed a checkbox should appear on top of the images allowing the user to select any picture they want

after that i want to select the checkbox and click the select checkbox button

since you want more of a show hide button i think a better experience is to have a checkbox that indicates what state you re going to set it to instead of relying on the first item

if the select button is pressed again it should make the checkbox disappear

if it s only one colour you want selecting you can use a radio button instead which would be a better idea than a checkbox

initially when the page loads manually i select checkbox 1 and checkbox 3 then i click selectall button which makes all the checkbox checked then i select deselectall button which deselects all the checkbox the problem is here after deselecting all when i manually click any checkbox it is also making checkbox 1 and checkbox 3 to be selected

side note if you only have one radio button on the page maybe a checkbox would be more appropriate

both rails and simple form have methods to create selects checkbox and radio button from an association or a collection of records

as image shows below i want to make next button enabled only if more than one checkbox get checked

i m trying to make it so that the user could select checkbox click the submit button and then get a custom url that displays the content for only the boxes that are checked

if i clicked on button my table changes if i choose checkbox of course

user select checkbox and when press the button sil it has to remove the artist

the flow is like i have to select checkbox and then click on the button to do get some data

i can verify that by unchecking the checkbox it does flip the value because i enable disable the next button depending on the myproperty value - i have more than one checkbox btw

my need is when i select checkbox from state 1 and click on button then according to selected checkbox i want to show perticular states from mysummary mxml

i have a table which contains values.now as per the number of values present in the database table i want to show checkbox into jquery dialogue box on select button click.initially checkbox should be unchecked but the user can select the checkbox based on need

since i have many checkbox as mentioned earlier i want that when i write a certain controls name in a1 when i click the button that control will take the value in a2

my aim is to understand the value binding for select checkbox and radio button

when user select checkbox of michael clark and click close button than cookie has only one value michael clark john doe is logically missing

perhaps checkbox would be better but by using the button and a an extra checked class

user clicks a button a dialog appears user select checkbox and hit ok

i have a table and it has checkbox what i want is when more than two checkbox are selected my button should be visible and vice versa

i agree that checkbox have more of an implicit true false meaning another point is that for radio button you can force the user to make an active choice by having neither option selected

when i clicked edit button i found out that in-app purchase checkbox is grayed out and cannot be edited

different form element types textbox radio button select textarea checkbox have different ways of validating them

i intend to add dynamically fields like text boxes radio button checkbox select boxes on a click of button like add more

if the user selects checkbox and click on button i need to display number of messages in the other groupbox i.e in the list of selected commands ..

while in edit mode i allow the user to multi select cells with checkbox that appear and uitoolbar has delete button

when there is more than 1 checkbox s they do not work as a group like radio button such that only one 1 radio button can be selected when there is more than 1

right click on detail section- click on section expert- click on paging tab- select checkbox new page before - click on formula button

the user is able to select checkbox the rows he wishes to print then clicks the print button

hi i am creating a view where i will be displaying the list of records from database along with boxes where a user selects checkbox and click on activate button


tripledes	aes	4
if you have a choice you should prefer aes over tripledes

but tripledes is older and weaker than aes

tripledes is generally not recommended because aes gives better security more efficiently you might like to see some comparative timings of block ciphers that i took in java to see just how bad it is

i personally would use aes for my encryption as it is lighter and more secure than tripledes in fact i think it is the de facto algorithm at the moment


northwind	adventureworks	2
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind

what are your strategies best practices when it comes to dealing with a reasonably sized sql server database anything larger than northwind or adventureworks - do you use multiple filegroups


qwebview	qtextbrowser	1
unless you need javascript flash css or something like that you can replace qwebview with qtextbrowser which is both faster and free of static leaks


biicode	conan	1
conan uses a more direct and easier approach to library dependencies management than biicode supporting both binary packages as building from source


h.265	hevc	2
edit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for now

4- for comparison purposes between h.265 hevc and h.264 avc intra-prediction the total sae of a reconstructed picture by hevc should be less than avc


entity-relationship	diagram	17
yes class diagram can be used in a similar way but entity-relationship diagram offer a better visualization and support specific presentation options

it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools

entity-relationship diagram may be easier for you to learn

oltp databases use entity-relationship diagram and are therefore easier to update because they are in normalized form

would diagramming mongodb schema in a class diagram uml format be feasible as entity-relationship diagram relate more to sql

i have found the uml class diagram to be much more helpful for doing a logical data model or domain model than an entity-relationship diagram

well a picture tells a thousand words so i would recommend creating entity-relationship diagram where you can view the relationship between tables at a glance something that is hard to do with a text-only description

oo class diagram is more abstract and has more features than entity-relationship diagram

uml s suitability for analysis is one reason why you tend to see uml class diagram that look more like entity-relationship diagram

even if i choose one specific table main one and right click on it and choose entity-relationship diagram choosing say 5 level of details it creates one diagram only for one table without all the other information

then use context menu to select entity-relationship diagram

entity-relationship diagram always seem to better describe a database

found in entity-relationship diagram are more difficult to understand for humans than

an entity-relationship diagram is more abstract

entity-relationship diagram are simpler than uml diagram

class diagram are more likely to map in to real-world objects while entity-relationship diagram most often map in to the tables in the database

usually relationships found in entity-relationship diagram are more difficult to understand for humans than relationships in class diagram


yslow	pagespeed	5
imho pagespeed is better than yslow

to improve page loading speed i d use a tool such as yslow or pagespeed to indicate more obvious areas for improvement

i use firefox with firebug and yslow and think it s more reliable than pagespeed

when using yslow or pagespeed which is a better tool try and use control+f5 to refresh your page so the site is forced reloaded without any offline files

in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow


multiplying	modulo	6
and depending on the architecture you re implementing this on it might be faster - the multiplying might take less time than the branch in the modulo or for hardware implementations might well take the same time

more generally you can always just try multiplying the base by itself a number of times no greater than the modulo and you are bound to find a cycle

but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract

if you have the choice modulo is probably more convenient basically you take your matrix modulo a number m after each power or multiplying and the individual entries of the matrix will never grow beyond m - 1 2 but obviously the result will be an algorithm for modular exponentiation thus different from what you have now

is much harder than multiplying by 5 3 and 2 and taking the modulo in between each time

also integer multiplying is less expensive so you may just do the divide first and calculate the modulo 10


cos	sin	41
an two for a function like sqrt i could probably write my own constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there away around it

i ve just timed this and it is about 25 faster than using sin and cos

for select sin a cos a

this way of doing movement is much faster than using sin and cos

one approach could work with the formula for a circle + -râ² xâ²+yâ² with r being the radius but i think a approach with cos and sin would be easier

3.14 is pretty close but a little smaller than pi and sin 3.14 is thus pretty close but a little bigger than 0 cos 3.14 is thus pretty close but a little smaller in absolute terms than -1 so tan 3.14 is a little less than 0

note that + and - are much faster than cos sin etc

after reading a question related with the performance of sin cos why is std sin and std cos slower than sin and cos

the opengl sin cos implementation has probably higher precision but not by much

abs acos and asin atan atan2 average choose columns concatenate cos count counta countblank countif date datevalue daverage day dcount dcounta ddb degrees dget dmax dmin dproduct dstdev dstdevp dsum dvar dvarp error.type exact exp fact find fv hlookup hour if index int irr isblank iserr iserror islogical isna isnontext isnumber istext left len ln log log10 lookup lower match max mid min minute mod month n na not now nper npv or pi pmt power product proper pv radians rand rank rate replace rept right round rows second sin sln sqrt stdev stdevp substitute sum sumifs sumproduct syd t tan time timevalue today trim trunc upper value var varp vlookup year false and true

note that the method compiles a regex - - that will match cos or sin only as a whole word since b is a word boundary and the will match up to the end of the line

this is faster than the nprect but still slower than sin and cos calls

however even this version is about 2-3 times faster than using sin and cos on every iteration

performance is similar even 1 faster than cos and sin

if you re after a plain parametrization using sin and cos it s way easier

this requires computing cos theta and sin theta just once and then each update is given by a matrix multiplication of a 2x2 matrix with a 2-d vector and then a simple addition which is faster than computing sin using the power series expansion

constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there

if it s faster than sin cos then you can use the identity

or maybe flip them on my machine sin seems faster than cos

why is using spatial index and stdistance slower then the more complicated query with sin cos and acos

i have the below code to choose sin or cos to be integrated

using a-star instead of brute force pathfinding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin cos

that s how we did low-precision decimal calculations on 8 bit cpus for example for sin cos effects also multiplication division is simpler again for 0.5 0x0080 0x0080 0x4000 8 0x0040 0.25

no for-loops or math.pow which is amazingly slow way slower than sin cos etc

is there any way to handle the numbers and or the sin cos arccos functions more accurate to make the outcome get better

in this case sin will be much closer to 1 and cos much closer to 0

so if you re on such a processor and if you have no dependencies in your code you don t need the result of one sin computation in order to start the next one then you probably won t get much faster than using sin and cos directly as they will be fully pipelined achieving an effective rate of 1 per cycle

and my test result show it s more accurate than math.h s sin cos at -m_pi angle +m_pi range

polar is well-suited to rotation operations and scaling i guess but sticking with cartesian where a rotation is four multiplies see below is probably going to be cheaper than using cos sin acos asin every time you want to do a vector addition

but java.lang.math.sin and cos are faster than any other way to calculate sin cos if you use angles between 0 and 45 degree

in fact python s own sin and cos functions are faster than those of numpy if the argument is a single number

if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

the taylor expansions of sin x and cos x takes longer to converge as x increases

cos itself seems to be consistently a tick 0 01 better than sin but the case distinction to reconstruct the sign has an extra test

interestingly enough sincos seems to be even slightly faster than sin without cos and the gcc compiler will use fsincos when you compute both sin and cos - so it does what i d like hotspot to do or does hotspot too

your conversion function results in very small values which for sin may not change the integer value of y and for cos result in larger values for x

here is a simple example of my problem where i have sin x and i compute the numerical difference which matches cos x

so if we have a vector and want to calculate a component-wise function over it say sin and cos it is faster to use vvsincos from accelerate because it will pipeline the calculations of sin and cos for all the entries in the vector which is faster than using a for-loop over the vector

here we need to chose this so that sin î dî is uniform note that we can write sin î dî d cos î so in other words for each value of î that we pick cos î needs to be equally likely

a possible implementation for the sin and cos functions making it easier to define additional functions in the future could be having a something like

the jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still faster


virtualbox	esx	1
because of compatibility with vmware infrastructure esx i would prefer vmware for headless server operations and virtualbox for anything that requires user interaction photoshop gui etc


rar	zip	7
i ve heard that rar decompression requires much more memory than zip decompression

by the way i would suggest creating rar self-extracting archives instead of zip self-extracting archives as with rar compression the exe file with the right switches for best compression using additionally also solid archive options could be much smaller than with zip compression

3- sign and export your application and create a zip with your expansion file without compression compression store in win rar

it s much better compressing than zip rar

i tried win rar 7 zip etc

i want to make a batch file that can take folders from different locations and then zip it in to one win rar file in a location like

one reason to use rar it is sooooo much better than zip

mockups	balsamiq	3
if you are looking for something not as complex as axure justinmind but more powerful than moqups balsamiq you could also consider infragisticsâ indigo studio which can import static mockups from balsamiq and make them interactive and protoshare

from all these wireframes i will recommend balsamiq mockups .all the best for your idea

i d still recommend balsamiq mockups


plupload	swfupload	1
looking for a swfupload url their site is down so maybe plupload is a better bet


vsto	add-in	7
the comaddin base class makes it a bit easier to create an office add-in and reduce infrastructure code to be more familar with vsto - thats the whole idea

vsto beats add-in express in one area it allows creating so-called document-level add-in

if you spreadsheet file has to be downloaded from server you can use epplus on server to generate spread sheet it will be much faster than vsto than you can use wcf from add-in in excel app to upload the data

however since i know that the add-in is more or less working as is for all users some of whom use excel 2010 and some of whom use excel 2013 and some of whom may explicitly have vsto installed and some of whom may not i d like to be sure that i m not setting myself up for a bruising later on when some features of the add-in stop working for no apparent reason due to changing the setting

vba add-in are a bit troublesome to deploy but vsto is even more so

i know the last paragraph might not be a correct question so maybe more generally as the vsto add-in is working with the office application process what can i do here so that a call to setforegroundwindow will work

if you want to go the visual studio .net route i would recommend you look at add-in express or xldna rather than vsto both of these have less limitations than vsto

thanks for raising this issue we definitely want stackage to have better uptime guarantees than hackage


testdriven.net	xunit.net	1
one option is to install testdriven.net which makes it easier to run unit tests on any of the major unit testing .net frameworks nunit xunit.net vs tools etc


simulink	labview	1
given how much image processing work is done in block-level dataflow languages such as labview i would recommend starting with simulink


groupbox	flowlayoutpanel	1
by the way we also added the flowdirection topdown to the flowlayoutpanel but if the groupbox become smaller it places them side by side instead of topdown


super	abstract	2
i could just throw away customsetup and put all the custom code after super but having that abstract method makes clearer what you re supposed to put there

is there a way to pattern match super classes or traits in a class inheritance tree with leafs as case classes and nodes abstract classes or traits


direct3d	directdraw	2
it should be noted that directdraw is old having stopped in dx7 and microsoft recommends using direct3d with textured quads to do 2d blitting

is there any reason to prefer directdraw or direct3d over setdibitstodevice


fgets	strtod	2
if you want to guarantee that people can t mess up the input like that i would recommend using strtol and strtod in conjunction with fgets instead

reading a line of numbers spaced with white-space except n and then finally terminated with n is possible with scanf and ungetc but not worthy of coding except as an exercise as using fgets and sscanf strtod is far better


weka	libsvm	4
i am using a sparse format but suggestions are welcome on other formats too i am able to use the data with weka in a dense format using the function names as variables and it works just muuch slower than with libsvm

from libsvm faq s i discovered that cv is made only to discover best parameters for kernels not during train predict so what is the exact sequence of action that i should do in matlab to obtain similar results in order to compare them with weka

now open weka add your data set go to classification go to functions and choose libsvm

nb weka contains its own implementation - smo but it also provides wrapper for libsvm and libsvm runs faster than smo note that it requires installed libsvm see docs


unix	bsd	1
my case in particular is with solaris servers but generic unix bsd tools are more than welcome

ada	vhdl	1
the choice of language is somewhat arbitrary - i code in vhdl syntactically similar to ada most of the time but some of my colleagues prefer verilog syntactically similar to c


uialertview	mbprogresshud	1
mbprogresshud has more features than uialertview so it might be better suited and more easily adapted for your purposes


tcpclient	networkstream	2
i created a networkstream object and read bytes matches tcpclient s receivebuffersize

i prefer tcpclient because it gives you networkstream which is eaiser to work with than the bsd socket-style api


inherited	base-class	1
normally i prefer encapsulation over inherited but for serialization dto a base-class is usually the simplest option


fold	catamorphism	1
you can give clients a type-safe interface in the form of fold but they have to be willing to write all their code in a higher-order style and since fold is a catamorphism it becomes harder to look at more than one layer at a time

the first solution i thought about was using the keydown and mousedown that seems more work

if you to bind events and use the benefits of a normalized event system you ll use the first version for regular blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error or your custom events

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

accessor	properties	59
error 26 the accessibility modifier of the myeventsource.listener.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer myeventsource.listener

prefer using properties accessor to directly accessing instance variables in methods other than init.

error the accessibility modifier of the set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer and why is internal protected not more restrictive than internal

if an ivar is going to be changed frequently declaring a properties and always using the accessor will make it easier to avoid memory management errors

the accessibility modifier of the accessor must be more restrictive than the properties connection1.connectionstring

i would assume that properties where additional operations are performed in the accessor are harder for the compiler to optimize and that those that only modify a backing field are more likely to be optimized but would like some more concrete rules

even if you need access to the list via a static accessor you are better having a static properties on the same class which you re using to read the db

specialname is more than properties accessor event add remove methods count here as well that s why you have to check the names as well

will properties be any slower than the above accessor functions in a high performance application

i know of the error the accessibility modifier of the set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer

any restrictions placed on an individual accessor must be more restrictive than the accessibility level of the properties itself not less

my guess is that iphone tutorials use properties to make it easier for new developers to jump through memory management even though it s handy to generate appropriate accessor with properties rather than implement them by hand every time

the latter where is called without arguments does indeed have a lesser precedence than the properties accessor - so that your expression evaluates as new number.tostring

for simple accessor like these properties syntax is better than methods

will emitting opcode.call for the static properties s accessor have poorer performance than ldsfld bear in mind this is across tens of thousands of invocations since every method in the assembly is woven

accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer

data is not an accessor for properties it s both more and less than that

the element at index 0 is an stdclass so then we can use the accessor method to grab properties of this object

ultimately the only sensible answer here is because the language designers specified that the accessibility statement on properties accessor must be more restrictive than the properties itself

the accessibility modifier of the abstractpolygon.polygon.length.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer abstractpolygon.polygon.length

if you need getter and setter to expose some instance variables or you want some automatic retain release memory management or thread safe accessor then properties are a less verbose way to automatically create these smart getter and setter

nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct ivar is faster because it skips the accessor call

beside the advantages of encapsulation we prefer using properties with get and set accessor among many other ways because they provide a clear and practical syntax

there s not much to recommend one over the other except that the direct ivar access is slightly faster the properties version creates a temporary array and sends an accessor message to make the new condition create its copy of that array

personnaly proxy generator usertype and properties accessor can be faster than builtin implementation

i would also recommend using accessor instead of public properties

and lastly the properties makes refactoring easier for example when the value later is no longer stored in a variable but is calculated inside the properties accessor or comes from some other source variable

edit as willeke has pointed out accessing a properties directly is technically faster than doing so via an accessor via self

the accessibility modifier of the arp_tll.dataaccess.chromosomeaddedeventargs.newchromosome.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer arp_tll.dataaccess.chromosomeaddedeventargs.newchromosome

maybe an interface that isolates the properties accessor is better

in c# 3.0 and later auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the properties accessor

the public properties accessor gives you more flexibility in the future

properties just offer a nicer syntax for getter and setter aka accessor and indeed a properties just wraps set and get methods under the hood

if you want to specify extra accessibility level keyword you can only do it on one of the accessor getter setter and that level of the accessor must be more restrictive than the accessibility of the entire properties

in some situations the set accessor for a properties can have more restricted access than the get accessor

and named accessor properties naps as getter and setter are there more to naps than getter and setter

i am trying to fix it with this accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer but in my case the main problem is get not set i try to change get into public but still get this error

using properties accessor these do more than just a simple get and set of the properties value

error 11 the accessibility modifier of the framework.oracleprovider.db.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer framework.oracleprovider.db

you only need to specify a private access modifier for your set accessor when the properties is more accessible

that suggests another aspect where a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here

properties just made it easier to write accessor

well your synthesize doesn t match properties declaration - you re declaring properties for mobinfo but generating synthesized accessor for mobinfo

the accessibility level on the accessor must be more restrictive than the accessibility level on the properties

you can use optional properties with the accessor defined lower to make that simpler

accessor properties with getter and setter are much slower than real get set methods

i would recommend using properties instead of writing your own variable accessor methods like this

note that i m caching the length value as the array s length properties is actually an accessor which is marginally slower than an internal variable

accessor must be more restrictive than the properties .

it means a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods getter setter

using the properties and the accessor allows for more flexibility for example key-value-observing is only possible using the accessor

in addition to what s already been said about threadsafeness non-atomic properties are faster than atomic accessor

if it s only an accessor getter giving back some data than a properties fits better

you can use the accessor annotation to specify a method to be used when serializing a properties which is a cleaner way of doing it

auto-properties can have different accessibilities for setter and getter by specifying a more restrictive accessibility for the accessor for which the accessibility differs from the properties s accessibility

the following code errors telling me that the accessor must be more restrictive than the properties and that i can t specify modifiers for bother accessor

however if you have special needs regarding properties such as specific get accessor implementation needs then better define a function which gets the value as you need it

a properties is nothing more than syntactic shorthand for a get set accessor

this too won t compile error the accessibility modifier of the usercontrol1.controls.set accessor must be more restrictive than the properties or indexer usercontrol1.controls


mailkit	imapx	1
i m not familiar enough with imapx to make this more efficient but if you were to use mailkit for instance you could do this


maven	buildr	2
i read in a blog article that buildr a ruby based build tool was two times faster than maven for a simple build

and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven


flask	webapp2	1
if i compare flask and webapp2 i can only see that flask has jinja and wtforms already integrated so no big deal there


hash	whirlpool	2
if you want longer hash lets call more secure you should use something like sha512 whirlpool etc

at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5


cng	cryptoapi	1
however it s important to recall that most of .net cryptography is based on cryptoapi even if cng is being more and more exposed in recent fx releases


fontconfig	freetype	1
we updated freetype in osx 10.6.5 and fontconfig which links against freetype wants this newer version


stdout	stdio	1
you re more likely to be using the low level open close read and write which are a level below the stdio printf fopen stdout you re more likely to be used to as a newer programmer


nstableview	nssplitview	1
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc


apl	algol	1
as far as the syntax goes i guess it s a bit different from the more classic syntax of the algol family languages but it s no more and possibly less weird than apl


emacs	gedit	2
now on linux i still prefer gedit to the other options i ve tried with apologies to vi and emacs fans

i don t know anything about except that it s more powerful than gedit but doesn t have the same feel as vim emacs


vaadin	wicket	4
with this in mind customizing the css of a wicket app is significantly easier than vaadin for the simple reason that you control the markup

this is only a guess and is not based on actual performance testing probably wicket will be doing better than vaadin

i would say vaadin would be easier over wicket as the default ui elements look really good

wicket probably has more resources than vaadin


webapp2	cherrypy	1
and i would prefer cherrypy to the webapp2 which is in the gae example


ggplot2	aesthetics	2
my reasoning for this is that i may want to add aesthetics to the plot and ggplot2 allows this more than plot

or use ggplot2 to achieve a more aesthetics plot as you wish


reportlab	xhtml2pdf	2
this isn t to say that xhtml2pdf is bad just that it s going to take time for it to be as good as rendering in a browser and if pdf output for its own sake is what you really are interested in i think using reportlab directly is a better choice

or go a little higher level than reportlab xhtml2pdf - now weasyprint built on top of reportlab


jscrollpane	jlayeredpane	1
the problem is that with the code below the jlayeredpane always expands to fit the size of the jscrollpane and in the event that the jscrollpane is smaller than the jlayeredpane it does not provide the scrolling ability


twig	smarty	6
if your in the market for a templating engine twig a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than smarty imho

then again smarty 2 is years old v3 has been with us for years and twig is far more practical in the html5 age

i prefer twig over smarty so i m working from the docs but here s my stab

either way i intend to use smarty partly because i have lots of experience with it and partly because its much more well documented and has much more functionality than blade and to me the syntax is slightly cleaner than twig although the template engine is not the point of this question really

supports javascript mason xbl xul rhtml scss python html ruby python3 xml sass xslt django html5 perl css twig less smarty node.js tcl templatetoolkit php

if you use twig which i like better than smarty - although i still prefer self-restraint+plain php most ide s that support django templating should work with it since the syntax is nearly the same


crypt	hash	11
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

the second hashing function is hash which supports many more algorithms and variants than crypt but does not support some algorithms that crypt does

mac os x llvm gcc based crypt fuction is borked junk hardwired to only use des a proven breakable hash worse than md5

my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

hash is newer and seems to support more hashing alogrithms than crypt

that accepts either nothing a salt or a hash that crypt made earlier which has the salt to make the hash embedded in it

if you are using it to hash passwords to store them password_hash or crypt are better suited

crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

if you want to compare hash compare the output of your crypt call with the value in shadow both hash need to be created with the same salt

in addition using crypt to hash password is better

also instead of using crypt you may prefer hash because this allows you to keep the string setting for the hash algorithm elsewhere


jqmodal	blockui	1
one item to note be aware the default z-index for jqmodal is below default for blockui so using them together requires you set blockui basez option higher than jqmodal s default 3000.


messageformat	decimalformat	1
i think it is possible to play better with the decimalformat and messageformat classes here is what i can come with it passes the test cases but i don t think it is that robust


onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener	3
instead of using onclicklistener though it uses a class called onitemclicklistener which is more advantageous for using with listview

is using onclicklistener in arrayadapter worse than onitemclicklistener

if you still would love to manage onclicklistener i will tell why onitemclicklistener is much better than onclicklistener


dygraphs	plotly	1
if i don t use shiny every time i regenerate the plot on some kind of user-interaction the html file created by plotly dygraphs which is more than 1mb needs to be transferred to the client


jqplot	flot	4
bluff charts get really weird when scaled to more than 800px flot has a very limited api and the tooltips on multi axis dont work plotkit and jquery visualize doesnt have tooltips and i couldnt find any good documentation on gpraphael my best shot was jqplot which was meeting all my needs until i tried to print it on paper they print unaligned

jqplot is free in my opinion has better chart than flot it doesnâ t have events

by looking at the google groups for qjplot and flot the support for jqplot is better lot s of unanswered questions at the flot group

i found jqplot easier to use with more options and better documentation than flot or graphael


lxml	html5lib	11
if for some reason you want to use an implementation that does not give you a full parse tree then i would suggest parsing the resulting html using lxml a python wrapper of the c lib or html5lib pure python both of which can return an elementtree object and are much faster especially lxml and more forgiving of invalid html especially html5lib which acts more like real browsers in the real world

html5lib parser does a better job than lxml or html.parser handling the debate element in this case

i just tested this out locally and the lxml and html5lib parsers are much more lenient and they were able to properly select the table element despite the invalid html

the standard html.parser option handles broken html less well than other options while the html5lib option is closest to how a modern browser would handle broken html albeit at a slower rate than lxml would handle html parsing

to get what you want all you need is a simple select using lxml or html5lib as the parser

lxml parser is generally faster html5lib is the most lenient one - this kind of difference would be relevant if you have a broken or non-well-formed html to parse

so i recommend swapping lxml for html5lib which handles baidu s invalid html with no problems

out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup

if you have lxml installed it would pick it if not it would pick html5lib - if it is not installed it would pick the built-in html.parser

lxml is the faster parser and can handle broken html quite well html5lib comes closest to how your browser would parse broken html but is a lot slower

i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautifulsoup


wgs84	utm	1
hence do i need to select wgs84 or web mercator or utm projected


scintilla	avalonedit	1
personally i felt that scintilla performs better than avalonedit


unix	aix	3
nawk alas aix don t have sort and unix sort is far more superior then any hand-made sort in awk

if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix

it is compiled on windows and unix systems including somewhat more exotic platforms like aix zlinux solaris and hpux


hash-function	keccak	1
so nist decided to select keccak as sha-3 and to recommend it as an alternative not successor to the sha-2 hash-function


dictionary	map	30
you can of course use a string translation but i tend to prefer dictionary because by definition they map values

for suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which it s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc

if what you are making is a map from one word to another you might be better off with a dictionary

for lists containing 1000 elements the dictionary zip version is the fastest the generator and the list comprehension versions are virtually identical and they are 1.5 times slower and the functional map reversed is considerably slower

using this hint we can try to guess that a fixmap must correspond to a dictionary data type in c# since a map is more or less like a dictionary of key-value pairs

the difference between a map and vector is a like an array while a map is more a dictionary of key value pairs

a dictionary map makes more sense here not an array of arrays

i know this question is a bit older but in es2015 there is a new data structure called map that is much more similar to a dictionary that you would use in c#

since you want to map some fields to others using a dictionary is a better choice than using a list

a dictionary might have more than one key map to one value or one key map to several values like chaining in a hasthtable eg twitter hashtag searches

generator expressions are generally preferred to map and using the dictionary constructor is more canonical than dict.fromkeys

there also comes a point where assuming that the map is pre-built mapping types to methods with a dictionary will be faster than traversing a linear list of types which is essentially what using a bunch of if blocks gets you

the immutable dictionary implementation is faster but no less pure in usage than the map implementation

if you are changing a few keys in a large dictionary it is more efficient to use dictionary set dictionary unset as described earlier dictionary map is optimized for the case where a lot of changes are being made

note my implementation of map on dictionary returns a copy of the dictionary to be more like the map method of array

though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary method is much less efficient

data structure to implement reverse functionality of a dictionary that is more than one key map to a common value using python

but lastly unless i m missing something this would be easier with a map or an object used as a dictionary of ids

shows a dictionary running 5-40ã faster than a map in the very similar setting of counting the frequencies on ints as a function of the number of unique keys

i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations andâ in at least some implementationsâ leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has

is there a way to handle this simply with a thread pool and map or do i have to do everything in terms of raw function calls and tuples lists dictionary or get more elaborate with multiprocessing or some other parallelism library

c++ std map behaves more like a python defaultdict than dictionary

for example if you want to index your data using a string like a dictionary lookup then the map will perform better

std map though is actually implemented in a way that many operations are slower than dictionary as its size gets large

map is slightly better because the shared dictionary has around 480 entries instead of around 450 but it s still inconsistent and not all 500 as expected

first regarding the dictionary class that class is considered obselete the documentation recommends using map instead

another analogy could be using map dictionary to model anything objects data event handlers etc but using a more specialized form of map dictionary makes things more explicit

or if you ve got tcl 8.6 dictionary map is perhaps better

if it was any other language i feel like using a map would be faster but because it s javascript initializing a dictionary and then evaluating seems like it ll be slower than just doing a o n 2 loop

i would like to transform this object and properties into a dictionary map to make it easier to iterate


stretchblt	bitblt	1
from my tests bitblt is x75 faster than stretchblt


qdir	qregexp	1
there is certainly no need to call grep or ls because the same can be done easier with qregexp and qdir


codeigniter	kohana	13
the documentation sucks but it s very lightweight there s a good community even on so it s more simple than symfony and more powerful than codeigniter the first version of kohana was based on codeigniter

+1 for symfony and another i d like to recommend is kohana built on codeigniter

is the assumption that codeigniter modules work in kohana or at least can be massaged to without too much effort or is it just that kohana s got fewer modules

i ve came to kohana from codeigniter which was a little bit bigger documentation and easier to understood but as far as i found out many programmers say that kohana are alot better than codeigniter

and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better

you had a better chance with kohana 2.3.4 as it was derived from codeigniter and was similar

of the big ones codeigniter kohana zend cake symfony i think the newer zend has the best support for restful webservices but earlier versions of zend framework had woefully lacking rest controllers

i prefer codeigniter and kohana because they re pretty focused and not bloated at all and because they both besides being mvc are also big on the convention over configuration principle meaning you don t have to go around maintaining xml yaml etc config files of your classes url routes etc

overall kohana is more flexible than codeigniter and a great base to build a web application and api on

codeigniter and kohana has more complex translators but basically are the same above..

i prefer kohana over codeigniter ymmv

in kohana for example also codeigniter but kohana is more flexible you can build internal requests with

but if codeigniter has a bit too much bloat for you maybe you can try kohana which is a bit less bloated than codeigniter started as a fork


idictionary	icollection	1
idictionary and ilist are more specialized interfaces that extend icollection


tensorflow	bazel	2
secondly both bazel and tensorflow have become more self-contained since the first of those walkthroughs was written

from tensorflow official github how to construct a new dataset for retraining use official python script build_image_data.py directly and bazel is a better idea


vb6	vba	8
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

fortunately the vbide for vb6 has more classes and methods for working with vb projects than the vba version of vbide

all the .net methods i tried were slower than vba and vb6 but the best ones were able to use the xll interface which gave better results than the automation interface

vba is in fact a superset of vb6 not a subset -- vba has more functionality built in than vb6 itself

if it is useful to you you are more than welcome to it note i m more familiar with vb6 vba than vb.net so this udf is more in the vba style but still works in vb.net

in vb6 at least so i assume it s true in vba replace is faster than concatenation

you can often get better results by searching vb6 which is almost the exact same thing as vba

vba being a whole lot less than vb6


jedi	python-mode	1
if it s too slow i would ditch the autocompletion part of python-mode because it uses rope which is slower than jedi


consistency	acid	5
using a database system such as sqlite or mysql that follows the acid principles is much more easy as the database system guarantees consistency atomicity of the transactions isolation and durability

but if only store the paths ids to external files that are not managed by the db you lose acid consistency one or more db records could point to one or more files that aren t there or one or more files could exist that don t have one or more associated records in the database

some find storing in separate storage using path references a better option and some prefer acid consistency via large objects

however the isolation part of acid sounds more like consistency model in particular the sequential consistency model

newer nosql systems are trying to focus on availability while traditional acid databases had a higher focus on consistency


unix	solaris	3
my case in particular is with solaris servers but generic unix bsd tools are more than welcome

if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix

it is compiled on windows and unix systems including somewhat more exotic platforms like aix zlinux solaris and hpux


maven	cargo	3
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates but that s serious overkill given that we re using jetty

you could also use apache cargo which is more general than the tomcat maven plugin

select the right overall web framework - clojure has quite a few already but i d strongly recommend ring - see this excellent video one ring to bind them plus either fleet or enlive or hiccup depending on your templating philosophy

jquery slidedown is invoked revealing more input fields in the previously hidden div and then slideup is invoked when mousing out

this will slidedown the navbar when the scroll is greater than 150px and will slideup when is less or equal than 150px

instead of toggle be more explicit with slidedown and slideup

with this effect you will have a nice and neat in and out animation of the sub-menu with no need to use two effect functions like delay .hide which will work also but slideup and slidedown will make it shorter in my opinion

using specific method such as addclass removeclass and slidedown slideup makes it easier to debug your code and see what s going on

if you want your slidedown to be faster 200 than your slideup 600 you could lookup the current display property

solution c using slideup and slidedown it works smoother and nicer


aptana	radrails	4
the rails framework is a great setup for doing web development and i would highly recommend radrails as your ide or it s base aptana

aptana radrails 2 seemed much better for refactoring ruby code but it lacks other nice features that the newer aptana 3 offers

i have to say that this combination is much better than aptana radrails 2 or aptana 3 for developing ruby on rails apps

i prefer aptana radrails on both mac and linux


sqoop	hadoop	5
sqoop 1 is older fully functional and mature project supporting hadoop 0.20 1.x 0.23 and 2.0.x you can download the bits from here

also we see hadoop s sqoop is much faster than spark for this part but it writes to hdfs which will needs a lot of work to be converted to dataset for spark uses

can anyone give some details about oracle hadoop connectors will it perform better than sqoop

i can only recommend running sqoop on hadoop in a linux virtual machine or native linux

personally myself i prefer sqoop for hadoop-driven import-export operations and connector approach for querying the data in hadoop


svnkit	subclipse	2
i like subclipse because it allows me to choose between svnkit and javahl while subversive uses javahl only

i have installed subclipse plug in and when tried to check out project following error is shown.i have tried many solution like eclipse preferences team svn under svn interface choose client as svnkit pure java svnkit v..xx . but no one is worked for me


puma	webrick	1
puma also has better concurrency but that threadsafe confgi make webrick multi-thread for me


subtract	add	52
in other words hardly anything slower than multiplying add subtract but not enough to really worry about

a slightly more sophisticated approach with add subtract multiplying divide

we observe that for 7 nodes 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 we are getting further by 1 add 7 9-2 to the score for other 2 4 7 we are getting closer by 1 subtract 2

now i need to group the functions in a class and select add or subtract based on the function pointer that i use

you have to do a compare add or subtract and shift in every clock cycle and you get the answer out in 21 cycles

like this you can add subtract multiplying and divide more easily

provided a string i want to convert the chars from the string to an int add a value from another method getkey to this number and if the result is greater than 26 subtract 26

both are good in that they give you a set of convenient arithmetic operations to compare add and subtract times

quick idea - go through the roman number from right to left if value of more to the left is smaller than then subtract it from the result if larger then add it

the next problem is a compare is a subtract subtract and add go through the same alu and take the same time as addition so for most platforms old and new trading compares subtraction for addition wont save you anything you end up looking at the branch cost pipeline flush etc

this makes it easy to compare two dates you can compare add or subtract dates just as if you were using numbers

shift and add subtract sequence was slower than the lea method above

having seperate class for each and every operation i.e compare add subtract searching into the database getting dbsets

you can make a member function taking one explicit parameter and the implicit this but in the opinion of many people these binary operators such as add and subtract are better implemented outside the class in the same namespace as the class as free functions taking two explicit parameters

it handles leap years leap seconds invalid dates times it can output dates in any format it can compare add subtract etc.

in one group of columns there s either win or lost so i want to add all those columns so that win add up and lost subtract automatically

division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract

since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

of the original length until this add subtract value is less than 1

if the remainder is less than 3 subtract the remainder else add 5 - remainder

while the number is greater than stacksize add a stacksize to the stack and subtract that from the number

i have stored numerical data in lists with its coordinates xvalues yvalues and if i want to compare add subtract divide... that set of data to another i have to be aware of that i can t compare if the xvalues don t match because there is nothing to compare with

this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle it will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit

one simple approach is that if the sprite is headed away from the center line the value you add subtract is larger than if the sprite is heading back towards the center line

if it is much larger or smaller than 1 add subtract a constant from both log_a and log_b

i know this is a simple example but for more complex code if sub add and sub subtract had more code would it make sense to group in subroutines

you can choose between multiplying add subtract

but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract

then while the temp value is greater than 99 subtract 100 from it and add 1 to the counter

then while the temp value is greater than 9 subtract 10 from it and add 1 to the counter

just take the difference and if it s negative add 2pi and then if it s greater than 2pi subtract 2pi

i don t know the format your dates are in but regardless you can use the module datetime to compare subtract add higher lower etc. dates and times with one another

to find all the pairs of integers x and y that sum to n when cubed set x to the largest integer less than the cube root of n set y to 0 then repeatedly add 1 to y if the sum of the cubes is less than n subtract 1 from x if the sum of the cubes is greater than n and output the pair otherwise stopping when x and y cross

parsing dates is simply a lot easier when using a library that has many methods to compare subtract add and manipulate formats

look at it this way based on your logic while x is greater than 100 add 5 while it s greater than 500 subtract 5 .

to make the value gotten from the above steps to a hexadecimal digit in character form then for values lower than 10 add 0 if you re on a computer with with ascii encoding and for values at 10 or higher then subtract ten and add a

also i will need to subtract compare add the numbers

multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

i m trying to use an if statement that says if player wins add bet to balance and if he loses subtract bet from balance

if you need to compare add and or subtract time only values think about the possibility to use a int to store the time value and then to convert it to chars when displaying the result

to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992

so you can compare subtract and add values with the expected behavior

is there a generalized way to compare add subtract svg element coordinates

integer add subtract compare instructions but not multiplying are also lower latency than their fp counterparts

i need some help though i need each number in that list to be subtract from 27 then if the result is less than 33 add 94 then print the numbers as they were just with that sum completed how do i do this

for each customer make a purchase subtract inventory from seller add money to sellers account

if the price is less than 25 add 10 to that price if the price is 25 or over i want to subtract 10 from that price

as you can see just doing the multiplication is many many times slower than add or subtract

if there is more than that subtract 250 + 180 and add 6 h to the time needed

i could implement my own reduced class for a given scale 1 or maybe 2 decimals and a reduced method set compare add and subtract basically but you know i d like to have a more generic solution and not just a quick workaround

if you continue to use your method of performing this task then you need to manually check if the addition of the two lower order decimal digits has caused a carry by checking if the result of the addition is greater than 10 and if it is subtract 10 from the number and then add 1 to the higher order digit calculation

also you may add a table called order to put your purchases in it buy subtract the amount you sold the book from the amount the actual book price you may calculate your loss profit


sip	sdp	1
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.


fgets	getline	19
out of interest i would prefer using fgets because getline is not in a standard c library

for example getline or fgets i prefer getline

frankly i would prefer fgets instead of getline

also your get_int would be better written with fgets or getline if available and strtol

while this is fine in some cases where flexibility is needed reading a line at a time with getline of fgets is the better choice

additionally using fgets getline would make it more obvious that you should be passing charstudent1firstname as an argument not .

i prefer getline to fgets to read lines

you should use getline instead of fgets to make things easier

for example compare fgets and getline

we recommend using getline instead of fgets

i recommend using fgets instead of getline since getline is not a standard c library function

if you cannot tolerate that use getline it s harder to use so use fgets if in doubt

since i provided a getline example above your read loop can be much better written with fgets as follows

your code is trying to do the former but you probably meant to do the latter in which case getline may be easier to use than mucking about with fgets

when taking user input a line-oriented function like fgets or posix getline are much less prone to causing subtle errors you just need to remember to trim the trailing n included by each in the buffer they fill

c offers several functions that provide line-oriented input fgets and getline that are much better suited for reading text one line-at-a-time

getline is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with fgets it is up to you

one more edit if you want to use getline instead which you asked about in the comments - and it s even safer than fgets since it will increase the buffer size as needed you would change to change the code a little bit

i should also mention that there are probably better way to get line-based input in both c fgets or see an earlier answer of mine and c++ such as the string getline and the char array getline


equals	gethashcode	42
also care needs to be taken so that the equals and gethashcode implementations satisfy the all-important condition that if two tuples compare equals they must have the same hash code

override both methods but make gethashcode more tolerant than equals that means make unequal objects have the same hash code and not the opposite

gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique

if two objects compare as equals with equals then their gethashcode must return the same value

if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each

so gethashcode should be much faster than actually running equals

in addition i would recommend overriding equals and gethashcode to be consistent with your equality operator

for .net 2.0 you could implement equals and gethashcode for your class but this might give undesirable behaviour in other situations where you don t want two player objects to compare equals if they have the same name but differ in other fields

â if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must

however these two instances will not compare as equals because they are different instances and you haven t overridden equals and gethashcode by necessity

unless you re really really confident that you don t need to use your custom struct as a key in a hash-based dictionary set i d strongly recommend overriding gethashcode and equals and implementing to avoid boxing

however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two objects do not have to return different values

if included a gethashcode method one could define the semantics of to say that items should compare equals when examined as t s

the drawback is that the equals and gethashcode operations are more complicated than for a normalized number format and there have been subtle bugs in the implementation c# why can equals decimals produce unequal hash values

equals on the other hand can test accross a larger number of fields - ie its test is more specific than gethashcode comparisons

you need to match gethashcode to equals on your comparer

gethashcode is contractually required to return the same result for any two structs that compare as equals

implementing iequatable isn t enough since groupby first uses gethashcode to determine the hashcode before it starts to compare objects with equals so that s the initial filter

if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value.however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

in more formal terms gethashcode must always return the same value for two objects that compare equals

in the equals method only if you re certain the ensuing equals implementation is much more expensive than gethashcode which is not vast majority of cases

and that is for performance reasons assuming that a gethashcode implementation should always be much faster than an equals implementation

compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two objects do not

however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values.

if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object

if you have written a class which implements its own equality that is different from reference equality then you are required to override gethashcode such that two objects that compare as equals have equals hash codes

if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

1 is comparison via gethashcode check if the hashcode of both objects are the same faster than equals

even though gethashcode itself should be fast it s not mostly faster than equivalent equals

the gethashcode implementation must produce the same code for elements that compare equals

in overriding equals i also overloaded as ms recommends gethashcode as well

we recommend implementing equals and gethashcode using business key equality

but i guess as you want to be generic implementing equals and gethashcode would be a better option

if you do not implement gethashcode union will call equals which will work but is slower than gethashcode

if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

there s no inline lambda overload of .distinct because when two objects compare equals they must have the same gethashcode return value or else the hash table used internally by distinct will not function correctly

not sure about the overhead of calling gethashcode a few million times but comparing two ints is probably going to be a lot quicker than the equals object method

compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not

however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

you are presumably returning 0 for many unequal objects and although this does not break the tenant if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values if too many objects return 0 then you will not fulfill for the best performance a hash function must generate a random distribution for all input.

when you define equality for a type by overriding equals you have to override gethashcode as well and guarantee that objects that compare equals have the same hash code

overriding equals and gethashcode gives it better meaning


codeigniter	cakephp	22
i am relatively new to codeigniter basically i choose cakephp to develope applications

if you employ php frameworks like codeigniter yii maybe even cakephp which have comparatively smaller learning curves you will find your path wellpaved for you in php

i recommend cakephp or codeigniter due to their fil structure simplicity

i am currently looking at yii and while its more complex than codeigniter the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s

i have installed both cakephp and codeigniter and it seems that codeigniter is much smaller a little less overwhelming and documentation is clearer

cakephp is newer more feature rich and heavier than codeigniter codeigniter is designed to have a much smaller footprint so you will most likely find yourself creating functionality in codeigniter to match cake s

in my opinion it will probably be easier to integrate with codeigniter although someone more experienced with cakephp might prove me wrong

on the other hand i ve never played around with codeigniter so i can t recommend cakephp over codeigniter

codeigniter has the lower learning curve overall so i would recommend it over cakephp

you need to compare php and ruby or compare codeigniter cakephp etc php frameworks to rails

i personally use codeigniter which probably falls in to the heavy framework category but is at least much lighter than cakephp and lighter than zend too i think

also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby on rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with

i would recommend codeigniter cakephp or zend framework

i have been reading about cakephp but it seems a bit more complicated than codeigniter

yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

of the frameworks i ve tried cakephp and codeigniter i prefer cakephp

cakephp is considered slower than codeigniter but you can tweak it to enhance speed

why do people say cakephp is somewhat harder than codeigniter for people new to mvc

cakephp is very hip zendframework is widely used although more of a all-purpose component library yet i personally believe symfony flow3 and codeigniter to be more favourable

depending on how much you used cakephp you may need to realize that frameworks other than codeigniter often have more libraries and auto-generating funcionality is that the right word

i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful

in my view cakephp seems much more lighter then codeigniter but i never used either one so i can t judge


hex	binary	44
i ve used both otool and otx to disassemble various binaries and i ve found the easiest way to edit them is to figure out what the assembly of the new code i want is using nasm or similar then just use a hex editor i prefer hex fiend on the binary file

i m trying to create a simple code that ll allow the person to choose binary hex or oct and convert a decimal number to the chosen radio button

generally hex values are preferred over decimal values as the conversion to binary from hex involves less computation than the conversion from decimal

and you can iterate through different bases which is super useful if you re doing hex or binary which preserves more of the numbery essence of them

well we typically don t do too well reading binary and hex is a better substitute for that

i assume that a bit shift operation on a binary number is faster than div so i started pursuing a binary bit shift function to use with binary and hex numbers and that led to num

i ve been using images to store data since editing binary data through paint.net is much friendlier than most hex editors

wxp right-click the value choose modify binary data click at the end of the hex string enter 0000 four zeros ok

hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can

format_int in binary case it loops 4 times then 4 times more than hex and dec cases

as others have pointed out hex is much more convenient than binary anyway - you just need to remember how each of the hex digit 0-f looks in binary and replace groups of 4 bits with a single hex digit

that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

unfortunately using hex consumes way more space and takes significantly longer i m dealing with 500gb of data and around 1 2 million records so i would really like to get the straight binary method to work

hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc

the conversion from hex to binary is even simpler since you can simply expand each hex digit into the corresponding binary for example 0xa4 - 1010 0100

one important reason is because hex is alot shorter and easier to read than binary is for humans

the results of running a binary template are much easier to understand and edit than using just the raw hex bytes

the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

and because hex is much more readable and useful than binary - it s often used and shown

you ll see converting from binary to hex is much more straightforward than from decimal to hex for instance

it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers

hex encoding is far more readable than binary that s why sublime uses it

hex is easier for most people to convert to and from binary in their heads since binary numbers are usually expressed in blocks of eight because that s the size of a byte and eight is exactly two hex digits but hex notation would have been clunky and misleading in dennis time implying the ability to address 16 bits

binary data is typically represented in hex to make it easier to read and reference

originally i was looking for a binary display but this hex display is much better for viewing

converting between decimal and hex is more involving and at least to me it s been easier if i have to do it in my head to first convert the decimal into binary representation and then the binary number into hex

a hex string is significantly longer than the corresponding binary string

- i usually find debugging memory in hex x command is easier than binary so i will not use my solution

hex editors are more of a tool for geeks as they also give you the computer data in hex a more readable format compared to binary

i have the following sample query select hex cast 10 as binary

with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary

if we use hex because it s a simplification of binary that makes things easier on the programmer is easier to read than binary and carries more data etc. why do we not jump to the next logical step base64

so i m wondering if anyone knows of a way i could implement either a floating-point to binary digits function or better yet floating-point to hex

i have made it so that the binary properly converts to base ten decimal and the decimal properly converts to hex but it only works if the binary number is less than 5 digits 01101 correctly turns out 16 and 11111 turns 1f but something like 11010110 stupidly becomes 6 here s my code

this is still accepted by calls like inet_addr and has several advantages all fields are fixed width there are only 8 characters to update and the binary to hex conversion is usually faster than binary to decimal

my program reads from binary data and i am just displaying it in hex to make it simpler

if the right side the binary side is greater than or equal to the hex side then you print true if not then you print false

however if these constants correspond to certain bits underneath most programmers prefer hex or even binary to make that clear and more readable

but when anyone human looks at it they look at it in hex using a hex editor which is much easier than reading binary

the biggest problem we ran into was constantly annoyingly having binary data show up in the console everytime you type select you hear a million beeps and you have to always do select hex or insert unhex which is a pain

if the 4 bits are greater than 1001 binary 9 decimal then you want to interpret that as a not-valid number and i guess ff hex is to be interpreted as a blank space

hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

those hex values seem a bit odd they re powers of two in decimal but in any case 0x128 the 0x is a standard prefix for hex numbers is the larger of the numbers in magnitude and its binary representation is 100101000

base64 is usually used in instances to represent arbitrary binary data in a text format it has a 33.3 overhead but that s better than say hex notation which has a 50 overhead


guard	autotest	3
in other words guard is more a generic framework for every process which needs to do something triggered by a file change autotest is restricted to running tests

i recently moved from autotest to guard for a reason it works better than autotest and it has a lot of available guard

is there any reason to prefer autotest to guard


symfony	phalcon	1
i am new to phalcon and coming from more of symfony background i just need to know how define optional relationship between foreign keys in phalcon models


minimum	diagonal	2
even with 32 levels of recusions it will never explode in a rectangular draw area whose diagonal is shorter than 2 32 pixels the limit would be reached only if you are splitting a virtual bezier in a virtually infinite space with floating-point coordinates but you don t intend to draw it directly because you won t have the 1 2 pixel limitation in such space and only if you have set an extreme value for the flatness such that your minimum square sine constant parameter is 1 2 32 or lower

one way would be to fill the diagonal elements with something lesser than global minimum and then use argsort -


packery	masonry	1
for my project packery is better then masonry because packery is filling up all gaps masonry is just looking for the first possible gap and doesn t fill empty gaps


mouseover	mouseenter	24
i prefer using mouseleave and mouseenter then mouseover and mouseout

i have a problem with my code i already make a code with mouseover but it was very slow to display per row my picture edit so i read that mouseenter is faster i hope because i have normaly 2000 row

if you to bind events and use the benefits of a normalized event system you ll use the first version for regular blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error or your custom events

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

i would also recommend using mouseenter and mouseleave rather than mouseover and mouseout since you will have child elements with your menu

the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover

the available events are blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

bind works with almost every event you need possible event values blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup and error

i don t think that this kind of javascript library exist you could easily build one with jquery just listen to all the event blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

mouseover events can occur multiple times so mouseenter is a better option for this

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

i recommend mouseenter because mouseover is noisy it fires more than once as you move from one child element to another within the form and can cause flickering when used with mouseout

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

i tried changing the event but sagepay overrides all these events blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu

i would recommend changing mouseenter to mouseover also

val css html text data width height offset blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

however a long can represent a larger value than an unsigned integer

after analysing your code there is a final unsigned 32 bit integer overflow in the last multiplication by 10 you multiplying by 10 not by 2 so you can get up to four new bits in each multiplication making it easier for an overflow even if you do unsigned arithmetic which is recommended so you don t need to play with the signs

instead default argument promotions take place which means that any integer type smaller than int unsigned int gets converted to one of those -- that s not the only promotion but the only one relevant here -- and which also means that there is no automatic conversion to whatever type you specify with va_arg

note that it is usually advisable to use an unsigned integer rather than an int to access the bits of floating-point encodings because unsigned integers are less prone to certain issues such as sign issues with bit shifts

you can do the same thing with much cleaner code with chr ord and array_map

i tried solving it using the chr and ord functions but ord s signature is chars - int and not chars - int so it doesn t match with toupper and tolower s

also i think you should prefer using chr and ord instead of the casts

it s also much cleaner it s shorter and the best part is that it s 6 times faster than the chr ord solution

and i have no idea how to use them i ve tried to compare with chr and even use ord but can t really do any comparisons

orika	dozer	6
i tested orika and it was a lot faster but was slower than dozer with small collections

i heard geda was faster than both dozer and orika but my only concern is i am not sure if it can be abstracted like dozer and orika as shown in the pseudocode above

performance will depends on your application use cases basically orika perform better than dozer or other mapping reflection based frameworks because it use bytecode generation behind the scenes

orika is way faster than dozer and quite close to manual mapping

wel i have used both orika and dozer i can say orika is at least 10 times faster than dozer in my project after the replacement

i know that orika and jmapper are great libraries from google and they use reflection in a different way than for example dozer which is much slower they se reflection to generete code somehow


strdup	malloc	9
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

he cried. will save the string on the static storage and you will not be able to do most of the function on them you better work with strdup in your function or malloc and calloc to be able to use all the function

i ve never used malloc to store more than values but i have to use strdup to order the lines of an input file and i dont get a way to make it work

you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy

you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally strdup is simpler since it doesn t require a separate malloc strlen call

as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s strdup then that s cleaner than strlen + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy

width	column-count	1

pickle	dill	15
however it also breaks pickle maybe not dill and is less dynamic then this approach

the dill module which is not in the standard library extends pickle to do even better

dill has a better serializer that can pickle socket objects on any os and thus sending the socket object with multiprocess works in either case

cloudpickle might be a good idea for your problem as well it has better support in pickling objects than pickle not per see better than dill and you can pickle code easily as well

this is actually simpler than using dill pickle as the autowrap module produces and compiles c code by default that can be imported as a c-extension module 1 2

the pickle from dill will be bigger however

where i ve used dill to give you better serializationâ essentially dill can pickle class instances easily -- as well as most python objects

you use pickle might fail dill is more stable

dill serializes the class method because there s additional functions that have been registered to dill that know how to pickle and unpickle a wider variety of objects -- you can see them in the disassembled code they start with dill.dill

the fork uses dill instead of pickle to provide better serialization

you can try pickle dictionaries your self i recommend using dill module for that but there are other module you can use too so it would look something like this

i searched a bit and found that dill can perform better than pickle with classes but i am having problems to implement it

i think you can do exactly what you want with dill which provides better serialization than pickle

modules such as dill are doing a better job than pickle

you may also want to have a look at dill which covers slightly more cases than pickle


pthreads	usleep	1
compared to sleep 3 and usleep 3 nanosleep has the advantage of not affecting any signals it is standardized by pthreads it provides higher timing resolution and it allows to continue a sleep that has been interrupted by a signal more easily


qevent	qwidget	1
summed up my draggable qwidget loses qevent mousemove and qevent mousebuttonrelease events after having its parent set to 0


qtreeview	qfilesystemmodel	1
i need show files from qfilesystemmodel in qtreeview and customize that tree to show one more column with qcheckbox so user can pick 0..n files from that qtreeview


strcpy	strdup	5
or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy

because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

in current code you actually don t really copy you will have to do strcpy buffer s unless using the strdup mentioned earlier

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

in general it is nicer in c to have the caller allocate memory not the callee - hence why strcpy is a nicer function in my opinion than strdup


calloc	malloc	66
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

memory allocation in java is 5x to 10x faster than malloc calloc etc

prefer calloc over malloc + memset

compare against calloc instead but also note that malloc and calloc are both available from c++ in the unlikely event that they do prove measurably faster

calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you

if you want to instrument libc s malloc calloc realloc things are even simpler - just wrap them in your allocator functions

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

malloc is far more common in c code than calloc

calloc would be a better choice here as it is going to assign default 0 values whereas malloc will just allocate space having garbage values

i would recommend calloc over malloc as a general rule because it initializes the block of memory to zeroes and malloc leaves the contents unspecified

malloc might be faster than calloc on some implementations

as mentioned earlier memset is available but if you choose calloc instead of malloc it will zero the memory for you

see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc

this makes calloc a little slower naturally but where that is not a problem my advice is to prefer it over malloc

malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros

and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc

how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc

malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions

my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

g_new and g_new0 both take the same arguments unlike malloc that takes less arguments than calloc

he cried. will save the string on the static storage and you will not be able to do most of the function on them you better work with strdup in your function or malloc and calloc to be able to use all the function

obviously dynamic allocation with malloc or calloc is more flexible

assuming the total amount of memory being initialized in your two examples is the same allocating the memory with calloc might be faster than allocating the memory with malloc and then zeroing them out in a separate step especially if in the malloc case you zero the elements individually by iterating over them in a loop

those answers was that calloc can allocate larger blocks than malloc can and etc

edit i m not a java expert but i think that in java members of new array are initialized to 0 or null so calloc is more correct than malloc in my code

if you belong to the second camp which apparently you do then you prefer malloc over calloc

the first calloc subsequently malloc has a longer execution time then

lesser code is better and thus you should prefer calloc over malloc here

and in your particular case allocating an array i would recommend using calloc 3 to get some zero-initialized memory zone instead of malloc

if you want better guarantees about zeroing or to get free zeroing on smaller allocations though it s more wasteful the closer to one page you get you can just explicitly do what malloc calloc do implicitly and use the os provided zero-ed memory replace

one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

calloc does the same thing as malloc but initializes all bytes to zero -- useful when you want to insure all memory is initialized and only slightly slower than malloc

if that s the case perhaps he simply prefers calloc over malloc

secondly i notice that when i run my program i m seeing the free function call more often than the malloc calloc calls 98 to 16

actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

i remember somewhere i have read that calloc is slower than malloc because calloc performs initialization to zero after performing memory allocation

in conclusion prefer calloc over malloc and prefer over sizeof node node

if it doesn t you can always dynamically allocate storage for each of the halfs and if you choose calloc over malloc then your storage is initialized to all zeros providing a nul-byte at the end of each half

from what i understand i have to choose between calloc which will allocate zeroed memory and malloc which can allocate memory on demand

or if you prefer malloc can be re-defined in terms of calloc

in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

for this reason since calloc uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than malloc will ever be able to since malloc takes only one argument of type size_t

calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory

calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

malloc calloc i personally prefer calloc saving you the trouble of zeromemory which is a very important.. the outer struct then malloc calloc the inner word as well

it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

malloc and calloc are typically more reliable

there s also no real point using calloc here - malloc would be more normal

in fact using calloc instead of malloc would be even better

also calloc is slower than malloc from operating system memory allocation perspective

malloc is faster than calloc reason is that malloc processed single dimensional array to pointer format whereas calloc takes double dimensional array and before processed it converts to single dimensional array then to pointer format

is there any situation where you would prefer malloc over calloc

your core graphics surface should be cleared to all zeroes before you render to it so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc

malloc and calloc are much more fun anyway

it would be better to use malloc over calloc unless we want the zero-initialization because malloc is faster than calloc

prefer using malloc or calloc for larger chunks of memory

and always initialize malloc -ed memory you could prefer using calloc which zeroes the allocated memory

it s the same reason a c programmer might choose malloc over calloc

note i prefer calloc to malloc

if you re worried about the performance of calloc malloc might be faster simply due to the fact that it does not initialize the allocated buffer as calloc do

as written malloc would be better than calloc but the question used calloc and it would not be hard to make it sensible for use with this code too for example a conditional assignment in set_matrix such as

just this feature alone would be enough for me to prefer calloc to malloc

this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed


cvsnt	svn	1
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints


applozic	firebase	1
i would recommend using applozic for chat related stuff and firebase for storing user meta data and other data


mediacodec	mediarecorder	3
the gles recording examples uses mediacodec rather than mediarecorder but the idea is the same and it should be much simpler with mediarecorder

android 5.0 api 21 allows surface input to mediarecorder which is often much more convenient than mediacodec

i d like to use mediacodec to encode the data coming from the camera reason it s more low-level so hopefully faster than using mediarecorder


fish	bash	1
gnu bash zsh fish have more features so are more complex


http	spdy	10
spdy is a more efficient protocol than http

anything that you do with http is more or less equivalent with spdy and neither is really anything but an implementation detail of your soa work

both s3 and cloudfront allow domain aliases however cloudfront allows multiple aliases so that d1.mystatics.com d2.mystatics.com and d3.mystatics.com could all point to the same location increasing the capacity for parallel downloads this used to be recommended by google but with the introduction of spdy and http 2 is of lesser importance

with spdy http-2 the need for vulcanizing will go away as those new http protocols are much more clever with dealing with multiple resources requests

the main benefits that you will get for soap rest communication are the fact that spdy can do http header compression reducing bandwidth and multiplexing - that is being able to send multiple requests on the same physical connection

open a tab to chrome net-internals select spdy or http 2 in most recent versions in the top left menu and click view live spdy sessions or view live http 2 sessions

spdy a google initiated proposal to extend http using a more efficient wire protocol but maintaining all http semantics request response cookies encoding

http 2 is even better than spdy and check this article for a use case regarding spdy

in fact with optimizations like spdy you might find that a tls-secured connection actually performs better than plain http

the lack of this kind of holb in spdy and http 2 makes these protocols more efficient than http 1.x


amd	umd	1
umd is even better supported since it is compatible with commonjs and amd so that would be a safer bet


jboss	resin	1
it compares jboss glassfish and resin


struts	stripes	5
if your requirement is for a more traditional web application then compare click with struts stripes wicket tapestry etc

i ve found stripes to be really effective and surprisingly lightweight....it aims to be more lightweight than struts

stripes the actionbean approach doesn t look much better than struts

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt

struts 2 and stripes are more modern and very similar to each other


nginx	lighttpd	21
you can configure apache to act as a reverse proxy to your django application although a number of people seem to prefer using nginx or lighttpd for this scenario

i was also going to recommend nginx + fastcgi as i prefer nginx to lighttpd it s better mantained or at least that s been my perception the last few years

this is all done with outer webserver which listens to the world i recommend nginx or lighttpd

it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd

nginx seems to be the webserver getting the majority of the buzz lately it may be able to serve faster than lighttpd maybe not

according to this benchmark nginx is a little bit better than lighttpd for serving bigger static contents so nginx would be a good choice for static flv video contents

shortly put running some benchmarks on a page doing some database operations and serving static dynamic content has shown that plain cherrypy was twice as fast than nginx and memcached and about half faster than lighttpd

even lighttpd or nginx with natively pre-compiled c++ is slower than g-wan s c scripts

using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

according to these benchmarks it also uses less memory and cpu resources than nginx or lighttpd while running faster

you could do something like configure a reverse proxy for certain paths in lighttpd to go to a different port which nginx owns but this will still push all the data through lighttpd and just use more resources than having lighttpd serve it directly

it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup

question 1 you can use just one server but for serving static media a solution like lighttpd or nginx will be much faster

that being said it s not like i think event-based programming is all just a ruse seeing as how it seems to have been the primary driver allowing such http servers as lighttpd nginx whatever to overtake apache in highly concurrent performance

as such i m assuming that about 96 of our users will being using apache and not lighttpd or nginx which are supposedly more suited for long polling

a more recent benchmark on 1 2 4 8 cpu cores - also made by an independent third-party - compares apache 2.2 apache 2.4 nginx lighttpd varnish litespeed cherokee and g-wan

if you aren t using any of the other features of apache consider using something lighter and faster like lighttpd or nginx

just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation

i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here

letâ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections

unless you particularly need to build against a more standard libc than bionic you can just use the ndk s toolchain either by copying the hello-jni example and changing build_shared_library to build_executable in the jni android.mk or using the script to generate a stand alone toolchain


autoresize	scrollbar	1
select autoresize to get rid of from the scrollbar


printf	strlen	4
if you only need to determine how big would be the concatenation of the two strings i don t see any particular reason to prefer printf since the minimum operations to determine the total length of the two strings is what the two strlen calls do

on the other hand functions like printf or puts have more overhead per call than putc printf has to process the format string and puts has to call strlen or equivalent but that overhead only happens once no matter how many bytes you re writing

strlen is fast alloca is fast copying the string up to the first n is fast puts is faster than printf but is is most likely far slower than all three operations mentioned before together

i wouldn t recommend using printf instead of strlen though

screens	hdpi	22
note for other screens density android prefers hdpi xhdpi xxhdpi xxxhdpi

edit - now that i think about it i m not sure why your image would appear smaller unless your screens had a greater dpi than hdpi

now i have another device which has the same pixel resolution of 480x800 but since the screens is smaller it has screens size normal and hdpi aka device 2

i am not aware of any device that can use api 14 with a screens density lower than hdpi

it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

another manufacturer with a similar screens might choose hdpi what the emulator chose

a ldpi image on a hdpi screens would appear smaller than the same image on a mdpi or ldpi screens

if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

2 layout-hdpi uses layout-mdpi because it s the best candidate it is the folder that theoretically should fit better with the hdpi screens because layout it s totally generic

i have tested that by modifying one image in hdpi folder and keep it as it is in the xhdpi folder the result was note 1 is loading from the xhdpi folder am i missing something here it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio

in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app

try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

a hdpi image on a ldpi screens would appear larger than the same image on a mdpi or hdpi screens

proportionally the hdpi screens is slightly taller than the mdpi screens

because i have bigger font size for hdpi screens and it goes smaller with ldpi screens

if in java code the values would be in pixels so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screens

am i missing something here it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi

armadillo	lapack	2
edit in response to the comment armadillo does not require lapack but works better with it and better still with tuned blas

for example matlab multiplies two 1000x1000 matrices in 0.15 seconds on my computer r needs 1 second while c++ armadillo lapack blas needs more than 10 seconds for that


bmp	ppm	2
the only thing i can suggest is that you use ppm format which is even easier than bmp for you to read from

i used ppm pgm files as they are simpler to write and more portable than bmp


nuxeo	alfresco	2
nuxeo is definitely more advanced in this because with its web interface you can customise almost everything but alfresco has other advantages

at the moment i am in doubth to choose between alfresco and nuxeo

cocoapods	carthage	4
i would highly recommend using carthage to pull in your git submodules then supporting both carthage and cocoapods for deployment

you might want to use some dependency management tool like cocoapods or carthage to do the more or less of the work for you

after doing more research i now feel that using a dependency manager like the documentation recommended cocoapods or carthage is a better option than manually adding the framework to the project

i m currently using carthage as a dependency manager and i know cocoapods is more popular and maybe swift package manager will be something in the near future - so i d like to be able to publish the extensions so people using any of these package managers can easily add them to their projects

the cons of gulp-sass is that you get more than just node-sass - you also get gulp-utils and other things - which is a problem if you are not using gulp in the first place


asihttprequest	cfnetwork	1
you can use asihttprequest which is quite better than cfnetwork


alloca	malloc	3
while alloca gives you automatic de-allocation on function exit the stack is usually a smaller resource than the malloc heap and if you exhaust the heap it gives you back null

dr deallocate memory with the correct corresponding function c s malloc with c s free and prefer alloca -style functions or foreignptr if that s not possible

i would recommend alloca over malloc if you would like the data allocated on the stack and if it s available but malloc will work in most situations


xmltype	clob	3
xmltype is being stricter about the validity than clob

a clob is a safer way to handle the soap request than an xmltype because the data returned may be longer than 32767 bytes

if you are storing varchar type data you should really be using one of the latter two types clob if you are storing various varchar data and xmltype which is a more specific type of clob anyway if you are storing strictly xml data


picasso	universal-image-loader	2
you can choose between picasso vs fresco vs glide vs universal-image-loader

use one of the image loading libraries glide square picasso universal-image-loader or ion ion is actually more of a general purpose async loading tool to do the dirty work for you


mongodb	dbref	1
mongodb docs also do not recommend using dbref fields unless joining collections hosted in distinct servers


aerospike	couchbase	1
high-availability will be easier with couchbase or aerospike than with redis


rpm	yum	7
i know the recent system prefer yum but want to know if there is need for rpm also

both commands works in the same way only difference is yum list installed output maybe bigger than rpm -qa because yum will show package dependencies also in its output

edit i have verified that both rpm and yum show usr local ruby_alt bin ruby as a dependency so this is not a case of yum having more extensive dependency checking than the rpm command

they recommend using yum to install the rpm package

yum makes it easier to maintain groups of machines without having to manually update each one using rpm

i strongly suggest either of the first two options over the latter option as the latter option does not always play nicely with the way rpm and yum handle transactions when more than one rpm are involved

to expand on the udo s answer there is the program rpm which manipulates specifically the packages it is asked to manipulate and there is yum which is a more intelligent management system that can find dependencies and download .rpm files even if they re not in the system


memcpy	malloc	10
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

the tool recommends replacing realloc with malloc memcpy and free

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

i ve used it without any guilty feelings and can see no reason why it is worse than using malloc memcpy

the function then allocates space to a new pointer with malloc and does a memcpy operation or loop-and-copy although memcpy is probably better

actually i usually don t recommend using realloc for that reason just do the malloc memcpy free yourself

as we can see copying manually with memcpy is always slower than realloc because in this scenario malloc is guaranteed to allocate new memory and you re forced to copy the data in every allocation which shows us that realloc is indeed reusing the same address and enlarging the block size in some cases

afaik malloc is not slower than memcpy

this allows you to use the assignment operator instead of memcpy and requires 1 less call to malloc - the one you make

the while executes much much faster than the fadeout fadein calls so you only see the last result

otherwise you will run into issues of trying to fadein and fadeout at the same time if your delay is shorter than your fadein

completely untested and you might want to use fadein and fadeout or use better classes both spans should have the same class but different id

fadein and fadeout are simpler jquery functions for fading in and out elements

i write custom javascript function to select fadein fadeout etc and it is working fine

or more ideally you might want to change show hide to jquery fadein fadeout which is more appropriate for back to top indicators

using fadein and fadeout would be better

like the fadein and fadeout is faster than the actual changing the picture

you then could even make a smooth fading from panel1- panel2 using js see here or easier with jquery fadein and fadeout

more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time

i tried adding the fadein and fadeout which made it more smooth

i want smooth fadeout fadein animations instead setting visibility where fadeout is slower than fadein animation so i ve used enteractions and exitaction of datatrigger

the smooth transition with the fadeout fadein should look better than the text changing directly

i don t recommend doing fadein and fadeout

note the show hide effect is much softer because of the commented fadein fadeout declarations that were triggering console errors probably because jsfiddle uses jquery slim now

jquery might have better methods than fadeout fadein for this job

you can get even fancier with fadeout and fadein too


mocha	qunit	1
i tend to favor mocha for tests but qunit should be possible as well


bugsense	acra	2
i use two app crash tracking systems bugsense and acra they give much more detailed reports than the developer console like device model features android version detailed stack traces etc

acra is one of them another that i frequently use is bugsense there are more also but i think these two will be perfect for you


tolower	uppercase	4
note tolower so you don t compare uppercase to lower case letters if you have both

when performing string or char comparison is it more common to use toupper to compare uppercase characters or tolower for lowercase

further uppercase comparison is more optimized than tolower if that tiny degree of performance matters

we uppercase this with toupper then we add on the next 3 characters of the string starting at the 4th character which we force in to lower case with tolower


appdata	uninstaller	2
i try reinstall after uninstaller delete all leftover data and delete c users yourusername appdata roaming pgadmin delete all data inside pgadmin folder

unfortunately looks like it requires uninstaller and reinstall as the locations seems to have changed drastically from some subsubsub folder off of appdata to something higher up under user directory


flambe	openfl	1
the main defference between these two is that awe6 is using openfl to target platforms such as ios and adnroid while flambe is focused more on html5 and flash games


wordpress	expressionengine	1
but in my opinion for most sites expressionengine is a better choice than wordpress


highcharts	raphael	1
both highcharts google charts generate svg content so if you want to draw on top of the chart you will have to manipulate the svg dom manually - i would recommend using raphael for your custom drawing


request-uri	url	1
since your url contains a path segment ahava-m1-mobile you need to match against request-uri variable


bufferedreader	stringtokenizer	2
important bufferedreader and stringtokenizer are far more efficient

i did a lot of research and most people said that split is better than stringtokenizer and bufferedreader


phong	shading	2
phong is a more nuanced shading model albeit a more hacky one which says that light is composed of ambient + diffuse + specular components

as justin mentioned phong shading is a shading routine used for more accurate lighting per pixel


distance	mercator	1
this compares distance as if measured with a ruler on a mercator projection with the edges of the map at latitude + - 180 degrees


robospice	android-async-http	1
while i like the api of android-async-http better it seems like robospice was more recently developed and supports better libraries


vbscript	vb6	4
vbscript is much more convenient than creating an activex on vb6 or c# vb.net

from vbscript s help same as vb6 s help but less clicks to get to on my computer

vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript


jsf	stripes	3
still jsf might have performance issues as compared to action-based frameworks like stripes which work more closely to http requests without building component model which is using more memory more network bandwidth

but if you do decide on using a framework from my experience of having used stripes struts1 and jsf myfaces recommend stripes without hesitation

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


hiawatha	apache	1
i had the same problem configuring apache until i gave up and change to hiawatha much more easy to configure and according some benchmark is faster than apache


currentculture	uiculture	1
i have a clue to the answer may be currentculture is for a broader class of language en and uiculture is for more specific variant of the language like en-us but am not sure if this is true


triples	freebase	1
since the api has been deprecated i m working with raw freebase dump which is now a list of 3.1 billion triples containing more than 500 million distinct entities subject object and i d like to reduce this number


membase	couchdb	2
the benefits of map-reduce and indexing as well as eventually consistent replication that couchdb brings are nothing less than huge for membase...and the benefits of low-latency clustering and ui that membase brings to couchdb are arguably just as important

i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level it s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together


kombu	celery	1
i did some reading on kombu and it seems to be able to do what i m thinking of although at a much lower level than celery


free	calloc	6
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

secondly i notice that when i run my program i m seeing the free function call more often than the malloc calloc calls 98 to 16

if you want better guarantees about zeroing or to get free zeroing on smaller allocations though it s more wasteful the closer to one page you get you can just explicitly do what malloc calloc do implicitly and use the os provided zero-ed memory replace

it takes extra time because new or calloc are much more complex than the allocation on the stack in typical machines allocating space on the stack takes 1-2 instructions above and beyond the same function with no variables at all where a call to new or can be half a dozen just for the call and the same again for delete or free and several dozen to a few thousand instructions inside those library functions - how long the code is depends largely on how it is implemented and whether the runtime has some memory available or a call into the os is required to get some more memory as well

how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc


mfcc	spectrogram	1
the most commonly used is called mfcc mel-frequency cepstrum which you can think of as a improved spectrogram retaining more relevant information to discriminate between classes


sorting	filtering	59
glazedlists sorting and filtering features are much more flexible than the one on jxtable

if user wants to filtering the list he can choose sorting order cocktail s starting letter and strength

considering sorting is more complicated than summation median filtering will cost longer time

the reason of the choice local sorting paging and filtering will be typically more quickly as the round-trip to the server

this may be optimal indeed if the table access to retrieve the values missing in the index is more expensive than filtering and sorting

you d still have to filtering to get a range though it ought to be faster than sorting at least

filtering indexing sorting all is simpler that way

the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself.

you can filtering by adding pagination conditions but sorting is more complicated seeing as photos can have multiple categories

in terms of your speed query i d propose that your pseudomedian filtering is faster because it doesn t involve sorting

sorting all the objects before filtering is sure to take longer than filtering and then sorting a smaller data set

the filtering on about 10 000 rows of data and sorting all happens in less than 50 milliseconds

but if you want some header functions in header column like sorting or filtering that is more complicated and you have to implement by your own

if you re using thousands of rows you ll probably want to give the user control on sorting filtering and pulling in more information to aid usability

sorting select filtering id name price

angular recommends moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself for performance reasons

when user selects a sorting parameter like title controller sorts books by title and returns to view.then if user selects read filtering i want listed books to be sorted by title and filtering by read parameter

of course i think the db filtering and sorting would be more efficient but the number of rows shouldn t be more than 100 max 200 rows and i was wondering if it would be worth it to make another ajax request just for filtering the result

more than that filtering and sorting by one or more of the attributes will send me to the world of hurt

you need to add filtering to columns and select sorting options

1- i have used virtual mode and works fine but i will lose filtering sorting grouping functionality which i need them somehow

i also find sorting and filtering is also easier on windows forms

the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself

but right now the sorting step is taking way longer than the filtering step so i would like to combine them in some way

or taking a leaf out of friedi s book taking advantage of sorting the array first but using reduce instead of filtering which is slightly simpler because it means we do not need a iife to close around a previous item

this could be done by sorting both lists do a vlookup to apply a flag where there is a match filtering on the flag then delete and or highlight

interactive sorting and filtering are more recent but they are there too

sorting in java is a little bit more work than in sql on the other hand filtering is more versatile when implemented in java

but the least filtering i apply the more sorting is glitching up to the point of being complete broken

in the case of core data running with a local sqlite store your predicates and sort descriptors get turned into a sql query so there s no need to instantiate and work with objects â the sorting and filtering happens much more efficiently on the backend and constructing objects is necessary only for the results

datatables allows you to add sorting paging filtering limiting and more to any html table

you can clear the filtering from the column where you want to undo sorting and come to date column and select sorting option to sort the dates from oldest to newest or newest to oldest to solve the issue

i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control

how to hide certain column if user choose filtering sorting or grouping in xtragridview devexpress windows form

i thought i can use _score for sorting and give more relevance to people who are under 1000 km but geo-distance is a filtering i don t seem to find any way to give relevance in filtering

if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering

filtering is a lot less expensive than sorting

for example filtering and sorting takes longer in java

this is way more efficient than sorting and filtering in php

and select sorting and filtering

doing something similar with sorting and filtering however is more tricky because i do both of those at the sql level

if your sorting and filtering were more complex you might for example want to use a map-reduce operation to create a collection that s display ready but for a simple date ordered set the existing indexes will work just fine

these kinds of tricks can be applied to modify user-driven sorting and sectioning but for filtering you re better off using a predicate on nsfetchrequest which filtering on actual model data

if you hold the data in the database and have indexes on the columns which you permit to sort or filtering the sorting and filtering will be more quickly in the server side implementation

i would recommend using something like a datagrid and a datagridview since the sorting and filtering abilities are much more useful to a user when viewing more than 50 rows

note this won t be sorting sorting by age it should be exactly a filtering having values less or equal to 18 and older than 18 -- a drop down list or radio buttons

recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component

in general the way to handle this issue with a managed bean is absolutely right but keep in mind that if you have to deal with big data it would be a performance problem because the programmatic way using java data objects including operations such as sorting filtering etc. is much more slower than to work with indexed data xp dominoview

on the other hand you may want stable sorting in other contexts as well and so if you have the stable_sort function defined this approach would still be more straightforward than filtering out the numbers with each sign and recombining them

i have seen multiple options like ng-table ui-grid ag-grid kendo-grid.i need features like sorting filtering row styling header column splitting scrolls pagination and also it should be responsive too

this will make your work easier as searching sorting filtering than handling 3 parallel arrays

sorting is more important to me than filtering so if i have to have both sorting and filtering target the same representation of the data i ll just give up on filtering working

i seem to remember reading that though infoset is great in many cases when you re dealing with larger datasets with sorting filtering it is more efficient to go direct to the table as using infoset requires each xml fragment to be parsed and elements extracted before you get to the data

i click on data view properties and select enable sorting and filtering on columns basic table layout only

xml files have none - so sql databases are a lot more efficient with sorting and filtering

but if the collection isnâ t sorted a simple linear search is more efficient than sorting just for a single use of binary search not to speak of the fact that binary search works with list s only while filtering findany works with any stream supporting every kind of source collection

being queryable the data tables produce faster results with sorting and filtering with their defaultview dataview

i d recommend sorting the keys using filtering to guarantee order as well before calling limitto

if almost all elements fail the filtering then it s considerably slower than just sorting everything since you ll end up selecting thousands of times


mockito	easymock	10
for the second test you should favor mockito over easymock that is more easy effective flexible and powerful to use

the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work

i prefer using powermockito with mockito but if this is not possible i have no problem with using easymock instead

i think you can see from the two examples why many people prefer mockito but if there s some reason you prefer or are mandated to use easymock you can do just about anything you can do with mockito just with more lines of code

do you see real reasons or shootout criteria to prefer easymock over mockito

for unit tests single bean tests not run within container i d recommend junit and easymock mockito

like brice i prefer mockito to easymock but here s the easymock version that is closer to your original example since your example was easymock

powermockito is an extension of other mocking frameworks like mockito or easymock that comes with more powerful capabilities

for mock i would prefer mockito to jmock or easymock

i m more familiar with easymock than mockito so i had to do a little digging


llvm	clang++	1
in the tool settings tab scroll down and select llvm clang++ dialect


median	percentile	3
in the end i will add a band that displays 25th - 75th percentile but i figured working with the median would be simpler first

as one good programmer can be more productive than two average programmers i vaguely remember an old ibm study concluding someone in the top percentile was 27x more productive than median it s useful to see the same programmers doing it both ways

median and percentile estimation are more difficult but possible

ggplot2	lattice	7
viewport manipulation is easier with lattice than ggplot2 that s why i choose a bwplot

how can i plot a dotchart like lattice s dotchart in ggplot2 that has thicker grid lines and only horizontal grid lines ie remove the vertical grid lines kind of like this

you may need to do the plots individually if you use base graphics but either lattice or ggplot2 would make much easier work of this

i know it is much easier by using ggplot2 but i need to get it done by lattice

i also recommend using ggplot2 or lattice

one caveat though is that the lattice and ggplot2 packages are really more for data exploration than intelligent data visualization

maybe lattice or ggplot2 would offer easier way to do this


printf	strdup	1
doing a single printf and strdup is faster and simpler than doing 2-3 printf calls


jython	pypy	4
here is a recent benchmark of jython 2.5.2 running on jvm 7 where jython is slower than pypy but faster than cpython

jython is more unpredictableâ sometimes almost as fast as pypy sometimes much slower than cpython

other python implementations such as jython or pypy can show much bigger time differences and can make the join much faster compared to

alternative implementations like pypy or jython use more advanced garbage collectors which clean up unreferenced objects at arbitrary points of time


opus	ogg	1
it is even slower since i could only upload wav which is way bigger in size compared with ogg and opus


appfuse	spring	2
so while you can compare spring web flow + spring and wicket + spring the later combo doesn t offer anything comparable to roo out of the box maybe appfuse or appfuse light but you didn t mention them and they are third-party projects

if you actually need dao s this is something that comes out-of-the-box in appfuse and put partly in spring roo but there is also a great addon for spring roo hades addon that does a great job at this maybe even better than appfuse


do.call	rep	1
if you include the explicit rbind version it is slightly faster than the do.call rbind rep list a n version but not by much and slower than either the apply or matrix versions


moq	typemock	3
or would a tool like typemock be better suited than moq in this case

so far i found that we can buy typemock to mock the sharepoint objects and then use any free mocking framework moq

moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot


reverse-engineering	obfuscation	1
but my current project really does require obfuscation to make reverse-engineering more difficult


clgeocoder	mkreversegeocoder	1
in ios 5.0 and later you can use clgeocoder of core location framework as for ios lower than 5.0 mkreversegeocoder of map kit framework


dokuwiki	pmwiki	1
i like dokuwiki but pmwiki might be better for you

i d strongly recommend addclass removeclass since you can add remove and change a whole swathe of properties with minimal jquery

consider if toggleclass is more appropriate than addclass removeclass

i used the addclass and removeclass is a more elegant way of doing this

then for class i ve used the addclass and removeclass is better then change it attributes

in your scenario addclass and removeclass is more suitable

instead of css i recommend using addclass and removeclass respectively

addclass removeclass is far more efficient since it contains all the styling externally where it s easy to add remove that styling to the element when needed

of course instead of using toggleclass you could also use addclass and removeclass to be more explicit

using specific method such as addclass removeclass and slidedown slideup makes it easier to debug your code and see what s going on

i would use addclass removeclass instead of show hide to get better control

or even better you could add a class with a dynamic positioning and use a addclass removeclass to get a quicker effect

note i recommend using addclass and removeclass instead the css function

using addclass would be a better call hence we could removeclass from the tr selector before we stripe the table

better approach with addclass and removeclass using hover

if you want to toggle css style easily i recommend addclass removeclass or toggleclass

i ve got a box with checkbox and i wanted that button submit appear only if one checkbox was marked when more than one box is checked the button submit must disappear i ve tried code it using addclass and removeclass provides by jquery here s my code for now

in most cases usage of addclass removeclass brings much more flexibility

that s pretty broad though depending on what you re doing you may be better off with removeclass and addclass


jline	readline	1
lein is using either readline if you have it installed or jline if you are so unfortunate i recommend installing readline


linfu	spring.net	2
how am i supposed to choose between castle-windsor unity structuremap spring.net autofac ninject funq linfu etc etc

mef linfu and spring.net are faster than ninject but still pretty


maven	cobertura	3
i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking just that cobertura has a better maven plugin and emma has a better eclipse plugin in my opinion

if you re going to stick with maven and want a plugin for maven that will do the code-coverage job i think cobertura is a better choice as emma stable last build is from 2005

also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool


pandas	dask	4
1 i guess dask will be slower than pandas for smaller datasets

when hdf5 storage can be accessed fast than .csv and when dask creates dataframes faster than pandas why is dask from hdf5 slower than dask from csv

this may help those confused by dask and hdf5 but more familiar with pandas like myself

pandas is far more flexible for working with data so i often bring parts of dask dataframes into memory manipulate columns and create new ones


googletest	cppunit	2
i prefer cruisecontrol.net with cppunit but i don t have any experience or knowledge of the googletest framework

if you use older version of gcc compiler or if your code under tests runs on vxworks or vxsim you might have a better chance with cppunit than googletest framework


rcurl	rvest	1
or you could do it in a way more readable fashion with rvest which ultimately uses rcurl and css selectors


nfa	dfa	17
stephen string search or a compiled dfa you can construct them from an nfa which is easier to make

if we express combinations of states in an nfa as states themselves we ve got a dfa with a lot more states than the nfa but which does the same thing

with a dfa you spend more time building it and allocating more states whereas with an nfa you spend more time executing it since it can be multiple states at the same time and backtracking can eat your lunch â and your cpu

i know that dfa s are easier to implement than nfa s and that nfa s are slower to arrive at the accept state than dfa s but are there any other explicit well known advantages disadvantages

regex is a nfa and is as such in most cases slower than a dfa or hand-written parser

nfa representations are more compact but dfa s are easier to simulate

at the same time the compilation phase for a dfa is typically more complex than for an nfa and dfas don t have all the capabilities of nfas

perl uses nfa which is slower yet more powerful than the dfa engine sed has

if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that

dfa is a better choice over nfa because it has only one transition for an input while nfa can have many

generally speaking dfa is faster but nfa is more compact

because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

though forming the nfa maybe easier on paper checking a valid string against an nfa will be more complicated than verifying one against a dfa due to accounting for epsilon-jumps

an information represented by a single state in dfa can be represented by a combination of nfa states hence number of states in nfa are less than their equivalent dfa

only thing is that nfa have more nodes than a dfa

the net effect is that the backtracking implementations i like that name better than traditional nfa are slightly more expressive than dfa implementations because they can match regexes like which matches three or more word characters repeated twice something that can t be matched by a dfa

in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that


cart	oscommerce	1
prestashop is much easier than zen cart oscommerce and magento


centos	mint	1
my suggestion is to reason if mint is the right distribution for a lamp stack or if other distributions centos fit better


libxml2	xerces	1
yes i m aware this is a very complex task and that using an existing product such as libxml2 or xerces would be the saner choice


memcpy	memmove	41
edit memmove is 2x faster than memcpy on the server

why does memcpy perform slower than memmove on my system

memcpy is more efficient than memmove. in general use memmove only if you have to

however when measuring the time spent inside of each function memmove beats memcpy

bad news is that the asmlib version of memmove is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of memcpy

it is entirely possible that in most implementations the cost of a memmove function call will not be significantly greater than memcpy in any scenario in which the behavior of both is defined

and it said memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy

the question is about is there really any platform where memcpy is faster than memmove

note that memmove has more overhead than memcpy because it has to determine which direction of copying is safe

std copy to be more efficient than memcpy or memmove because it

the memcpy to memmove which peforms faster

why is this slower than memcpy or memmove

memcpy is still a little bit slower than memmove

if you know buffers cannot overlap memcpy is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than memmove

on some arm platform im working on memmove was 3 times faster than memcpy for short unalligned load

what more it seems to beat memset too when memset seems like it could benefit from optimizations that memcpy or memmove can t

bcopy 3 while deprecated so prefer memmove 3 handles overlapping memory regions memcpy 3 doesn t

std memmove may be very slightly slower than std memcpy emphasis added because it has to first check whether the source and target ranges overlap

use a copy operation to correctly copy the contents rather than assign the addresses as suggested use std copy - or others such as memcpy prefer memmove - it s a little slower but is well defined for overlapping blocks etc.

memmove on the laptop runs slower than memcpy but oddly enough runs at the same speed as the memmove on the server

so memcpy can be faster than memmove

i modified the c code to produce more stable timings for me on my machine mac os x 10.7.4 8 gib 1333 mhz ram 2.3 ghz intel core i7 gcc 4.7.1 and to compare strcpy and strcat vs memcpy vs memmove

although it isn t a risk in the code shown nevertheless i normally recommend using memmove rather than memcpy because it works regardless of whether the source and target areas overlap

from reading other so questions such as this or this gives the impression that memcpy should work faster than memmove and intuitively this should be so

although in reality i find it hard to imagine the memmove could be faster than memcpy i don t discount the possibility

in some cases compilers provide intrinsics for memmove and memcpy that are much faster than the code they would normally output due to normal optimizations

moral 2 always prefer memmove to memcpy

it is relatively unlikely that they ve got anything faster than memmove memcpy available

using memmove or memcpy can outperform strcpy handily see why is python faster than c for some illustrations and timing

memcpy and or memmove will do it more generally and of course you can always write an element-by-element copy loop

as already pointed out in other answers memmove is more sophisticated than memcpy such that it accounts for memory overlaps

so in what platform and how memcpy can be significantly faster than memmove if there is none why providing two similiar functions instead of just memmove and lead to a lots of bug

as an aside my c c++ is rusty but is not memcpy more efficient than memmove if you know you don t have overlapping memory

is it a microoptimization or are there real significant examples when memcpy is faster so that we really need to use memcpy and not stick to memmove everywhere

even i don t think the memmove can be faster than memcpy but there should be no big difference at least on intel platform

why is memcpy so much slower than memmove or hand rolled copy on the server

in addition as mats petersson said memmove is cache friendlier than memcpy

note that the behavior of memcpy is undefined when the memory blocks overlap so memmove is more appropriate here

however because of additional checks that memmove performs when the buffers are small and surely does not overlap memcpy is better

while memmove will be only slightly slower than memcpy due to the assumptions it needs to make about the source and destination in memcpy they cannot overlap it should still be far superior to any standard loop

this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions


nhibernate	massive	2
i have noticed that ef is slower than linq2sql massive petapoco ado.net and possibly nhibernate

i would choose massive if you want simple fast but unsupported ef if you want easy and ms support but limited in some ways or nhibernate if you have the time to learn a proper orm


quicksort	radix-sort	3
is there any better algorithm than normal quicksort radix-sort for this problem

why quicksort or introsort or any comparison-based sorting algorithm is more common than radix-sort

which of the two consumes more memory is not defined and depends on the input sequence to be sorted as well as on algorithm tuning parameters see the comments to one of the answers to why quicksort is more popular than radix-sort


lambda	first-class-functions	3
first-class-functions functional match lambda libraries

to list to callbacks in c# you have delegates events and lambda that replace java listeners acting as first-class-functions and allowing a better quality of coding patterns

in summary java 8 lambda are more first-class-functions than i had originally thought


bpmn	jbpm	4
...way to create a visual tool to compare bpmn 2.0 processes using jbpm web designer

however if there are long and highly customer specific requirements which are not met through bpmn i would recommend jbpm as it is closure to programmers

besides i would be glad to hear your ideas about if the improvements of activiti bpmn will make it better or useful than jbpm as time goes on

i would like to know what would be in your opinion the easiest more efficient way to create a visual tool to compare bpmn 2.0 processes using jbpm web designer


cck	ubercart	1
i am creating a custom donation node with each ubercart purchase containing cck fields such as the amount donated


should.js	chai	1
if you don t need chai s full feature set i recommend using should.js instead


mongodb	bson	20
yes mongodb persists data as json or bson to be more precise but you don t have do deal with it

note that json representation of mongodb document could exceed this limit since bson is more compact

mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents

the bson becomes even more annoying to work with when exporting data from mongo to another db platform this is the case when dealing with big data that is collected and you want to merge it with some properties from the back office mongodb this means a lot of pain you need to transform the binary objectid to a string in order to join with the id in different platforms that do not use bson representation

mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson document.

gridfs is not a server-side feature but rather a convention on how files larger than the bson document size limit of 16 mb can be stored in mongodb

how to encode 12-byte bson string of mongodb s objectid to shorter form

is a generic xml-2-json converter a good fit here or would a mongodb bson converter be better

the distinction between int64 and int32 in mongodb is more about bson storage size

so if your document bson is larger than 16 mb mongodb throws exception

i generally use mongodb because it returns queries in json format integrates well with angular.js and its bson format is much faster than json

mongodb must be smaller than the maximum bson document size

if your requirement is to store a key with value as json then mongodb is a better fit in this scenario as by default mongodb stores data in bson which is json + additional data types

basically mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents

mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson

a document in mongodb is more or less like a json structure bson to be specific

the bson storage format used by mongodb supports more native types than javascript including 32-bit and 64-bit integers

mongodb stores everything in memory anyway and works in a similar vein being a key-value based system however i believe mongodb is more flexible as it allows for storing bson objects within themselves

i ve choose mongodb for its scalability great docs bson documents storage and many other great features

mongodb s server-side document representation is a json-like binary format called bson which has richer types than javascript json and preserves field order


imagemagick	graphicsmagick	21
after trying both and finding that imagemagick was better but in the end i choose neither and went with graphicsmagick instead

the origin server would get the images from s3 process them using graphicsmagick since it s much faster than imagemagick then serve them

when people compare imagemagick and graphicsmagick or other similar libraries they tend to focus on performance

using imagemagick or graphicsmagick would be better idea but if you really want to use sips you could try to remove transparency by converting image to bmp and then back to png again

graphicsmagick converted much faster than imagemagick although i did not test conversion with cuda processing

i keep hearing from some people that graphicsmagick a fork from quite a few years back that branched off from imagemagick is significantly faster than imagemagick

graphicsmagick is not that much faster -- and the outputted file sizes are significantly higher than imagemagick

i thought graphicsmagick was supposed to be leaner meaner than imagemagick

note that imagemagick is the most powerful exactimage is the fastest and graphicsmagick is a folk of imagemagick which is faster but a little less powerful and has some bugs

mmmm graphicsmagick is somewhat less developed than imagemagick in many respects

is there a specialized commandline tool to resize the images in a more efficient way than imagemagick or graphicsmagick

i successfully compiled graphicsmagick with q8 but after all it seems about 30 slower than imagemagick 0.3 secs

also changing your imagemagick install from a 16bit one to a 8bit may improve speed as i belive that is one reason graphicsmagick is faster

graphicsmagick provides more extensive api documentation than imagemagick

for me graphicsmagick is performing far better than imagemagick

graphicsmagick is a fork of imagemagick that is faster and has fewer bugs this is what flickr uses internally so it should be good enough for you

graphicsmagick also seems to be faster than imagemagick using better multitasking

in terms of performance you should compare imagemagick with graphicsmagick some useful links here

for a pdf that imagemagick was giving inaccurate colors i found that graphicsmagick did a better job

it would be somewhat easier with imagemagick than graphicsmagick as anthony thyssen has put together some excellent examples - but they rely on imagemagick capabilities such as aside-processing in parentheses which graphicsmagick lacks

i do know imagemagick better than graphicsmagick


wav	flac	4
regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg that is not really the case

i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg

flac is smaller than wav

it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc


tensorflow	tensorboard	1
in order to peer into what s going on in your tensorflow computation i recommend using tensorboard


packets	pcap	5
i am making use of snort to match packets in pcap file against a set of rules

your best bet would be to filter all mail from the pcap file in wireshark with a filter say smtp apply the filter go to file save as then choose selected packets save that file

note the bit that says so fewer than cnt packets may be processed - it s up the the pcap implementation what it does

i am working with pcap in c and comparing the lengths of eapol handshakes with those get in wireshark and the eapol packets captured with pcap are longer

this should give you a little bit of leverage however the last few packets may get lost lower the value in the if statement to mitigate this. suggest using it on both sides at the same time so each pcap should line up later on you can use mergepcap as mike suggests to if you like


octree	quadtree	2
if you want to search a volume a quadtree or octree works better

quadtree is better for big open spaces and octree is better for in-door spaces with many levels


jedi	elpy	1
i would personally recommend using elpy and autocomplete using jedi as the backend for code completion


dojo	dwr	1
they merged with dojo which in my opinion is a better choice than dwr


strsplit	substr	3
joe duffy s blog implies using substr is more efficient than strsplit

usually you use strsplit to break a string in parts but with substr there s an easier solution for your problem

note i am looking for a more elegant way than strsplit or substr


graphicsmagick	im4java	1
i am trying to do a graphicsmagick compare using im4java and gm4java


wan	lan	5
i find that on a lan things are faster without compression compression takes more time than xfer and on a wan it s the reverse

lan is more or less stable wan can be with network issues like

even if all the traffic resides on the same network the client traffic will have been throttled by your wan capacity which is always less than your lan capacity

in choose lan wan

wan is less stable than lan


charat	replaceall	1
i ve counted for occurrences before using stuff like charat i matches contains replaceall and have found patterns index positions special characters numbers etc


laravel	fuelphp	1
does anyone have extensive experience with laravel or fuelphp used for bigger scale projects


canopy	ptvs	1
the upcoming canopy 1.2 release in a couple of weeks will include more complete integration with ptvs and visual studio that will automate this and remove the need for canopy to be the default python environment


extjs	ext.net	2
to answer point #2 i highly recommend ext.net for working with extjs in visual studio assuming you are using asp.net

i d rather not use use extjs directly - i m looking to expedite delivery and ext.net seems much easier


typhoeus	curb	1
instead of net http i can use httparty curb rest client or typhoeus which makes everything easier but i can t find any similar solutions to replace enhance net ftp


emacs	aquamacs	9
on unix like environments emacs is more native and you can use slime which is usually available as a os package or as a separate download for aquamacs

how can i match aquamacs settings in mac os x emacs auctex

if you have a mac i would recommend aquamacs which is a beginner-friendly version of gnu-emacs and therefore has all the power of emacs while still offering standard copy-paste save and other features including normal file dialogs and windows

if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like

however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change

but do yourself a favor dismiss aquamacs and use plain gnu emacs 24.2

you may also want to look at aquamacs which currently has a beta for the latest emacs and offers somewhat better os x integration than the default build

carbon emacs is closer to the unix emacs experience whereas the aquamacs people have put considerable effort into os x integration

the only solution i have found is to restart emacs aquamacs which is obviously less than ideal


prepare	pdostatement	1
more than likely prepare failed and is false instead on a pdostatement object


oursql	mysql-python	3
at least for .executemany oursql seems to be more proficient than mysql-python as the sql statement is only prepared once for all submitted values

i hear oursql is nicer the mysql-python

as one of the best practices i would recommend using oursql over mysql-python

unification	inference	2
because the unification performed as part of type inference transcends quantifier scope you can sometimes end up in a situation where ghc would have to unify a type variable in an outer scope with a quantified type from a nested scope which is how you get compiler errors about escaping types and skolems and whatnot the latter i assume being related to skolem normal form

or it can be disambiguated by type inference unification is a more appropriate term or an explicit type signature like thilo said in their comment


ocaml	racket	1
ocaml is faster than racket for most of the benchmarks on languages benchmark game


interbase	firebird	1
firebird was forked + - 18 years ago from interbase 6 which was opensourced for a short time since then it has diverged and firebird can no longer read interbase databases nor can interbase - as far as i am aware - read firebird databases more recent than firebird 1 or maybe 1.5


nginx	cherokee	2
a more recent benchmark on 1 2 4 8 cpu cores - also made by an independent third-party - compares apache 2.2 apache 2.4 nginx lighttpd varnish litespeed cherokee and g-wan

how do you compare nginx and cherokee in terms of memory usage and performance


mojolicious	catalyst	1
i use cgi application framework but it is old and for me it is already too simple catalyst and mojolicious are more advanced


qframe	qwidget	1
select qframe d in the object inspector window and cut it right click qwidget and break the layout ctrl-0 then paste


pull	push	49
or will every commit pull push takes a longer time as changetsets count increase

it supports fetch pull and push and is more stable for me than hg-git similar features from hg to git

when you push the changes to remote if the new changes are not in the current branch on github it will show the compare pull request button automatically

there is a certain irony here given that within xslt push stylesheets are generally more idiomatic than pull stylesheets

if you need something that works out of the box choose flume once you decide whether push or pull makes more sense

if you don t understand the subtleties between push vs pull architecture then i recommend that you start with xmlreader because pull is simpler to understand and easier to visualize

pull subscriptions perform much better than push subscriptions in a wan scenario

tortoise now has an option push new branch that may be safer than force pull or push

i have found that pull is more scalable than push

using signalr is not a good idea because signalr using push mechanism to notify but it seems in your case some pull method is more suitable and also signalr doesn t support really permanent queue to keep messages in queue while consumers being ready

alone push is better in the accepted answer can t quite work as a push-operation in some class can require a new pull at the pushed object

at both events forstall stated that push notifications were a better means to maintain battery life than background processes which are used for pull technology as far as receiving notifications are concerned

some thoughts push pull are closer concepts to connect accept not send receive

just create a branch from develop cherry pick push and then create a pull request back to develop

under that you can have push selected by default and also can select pull request which helps you to do wnat you are looking for pull request opened closed reopened edited assigned unassigned review requested review request removed labeled unlabeled or synchronized

before do git pull and git push it s better to make sure that git status result is contain text working directory clean

the usual ways of doing that is either by using push pull or to solve under assumptions all on the same solver and context see soft hard constraints in z3 z3 smt when should i prefer push pop to reset

there are many ways to do this github recommends pull requests and unless you have no push access to the repository you will need to do this or send patches

thanks to the fact it doesn t need to communicate with a central server constantly pretty much every command runs in less than a second obviously git push pull fetch are slower simply because they have to initalise ssh connections

in case anyone comes here with a similar issue like me only finding push pull doesn t fit your needs because either col-xs-12 wont pull push or using more than 2 columns makes it tougher to figure out the push pull values here is my solution

pull requests are more complicated because in order to make a pull request you must either open your repository to someone else who can run git pull 2 â this is where the term comes from and is the original meaning of pull request â or else find or create a shared repository push some of your commits to this shared location and then ask the other person to obtain your commits from the shared location

you can do this either in a push or pull based fashion pull is probably simpler just poll for changes

a heartbeat mechanism pull model is definitely easier to implement but a push model is far more efficient

as a general advice i would say to prefer pull to push when dealing with multiple non-bare repositories push to only bare repositories

right clicking my active project and clicking on team gives me the options to pull push commit and more

i create new branch add those new features and than i once again made pull request but now the features i implemented in the master branch are also in my new branch so my second pull request has more features than i want to push to the original project

bootstrap 4 has moved to a full flexbox model so the push pull utilities are no more

if in-order processing is required a much better design would be to use another message processing library that supports a pull model which i think would fit your scenario much better than rebus push model

the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow

update db pull and db push have been deprecated and should be replaced with pg pull and pg push - read more at

how are push notification better than pull notification on iphones

due to the work flow change our qa members would like to have finer control over the push pull operation on the release server they d like to allow only specified user s with user credential s to access to specified repo s

the author recommends pull because push tends to idle in between data inputs

i guess one of them is that the push model is less coupled then the pull model

why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters

push models have higher throughput than pull models

you do not need to set up these remotes but having them for all the repos that you frequently work with push or pull changes makes things easier for you

select let me select individual events. and pick pull request and push

in essence design for mobile first and use the push pull to fix larger screen sizes

i guess i m just surprised that the documentation recommends the approach of querying presumably continually in my case versus keeping a tailable cursor open i would have thought that push would be cheaper than pull

as stated by other answers neither push nor pull is better but rather you should pick the one that best fits your design needs

make sure you select pull not push

pusher works great for receiving events in realtime while your app is running but to get background notifications you really need to be looking at using apple push notifications or period fetch depending on whether you d prefer push or pull

in short this is what we refer to in order to compare against pull or fetch from and push to

if your goal is to eliminate certificate fingerprint warnings during push pull there s a better way to do this

is the performance of pull better than push in this scenario

is there a way to register that user connection and act more as a push if new values exist in the server rather than every user pull new values every 1 sec for example

a little more pull than push style that s because there is no duplicate item.

you may feel it s inefficient for the client to poll the server to pull the data and you d prefer push but the design of the server gets simplified


cifs	smb	4
now if you re intending to use a remote filesystem with ofs which is the primary use-case you have to first install the relevant remote filesystem packages on the os you re using then use for example if we ve got cifs which is the newer name for smb samba

nfs with the right setup version and tuning is just a tad slower than smb cifs

riverbed has also a lot of protocol support - which makes for cifs smb and mapi more delay aware a lot of packages are buffered and sent once - so save roundtrips

it uses less overhead than smb cifs and therefore acchieves greater performance - also - there are many versions of smb in many versions of windows that might not be compatible with each other


qthread	qobject	2
if you re using wizard to create your class that s normal just select qobject create your class and in the sources replace qobject with qthread as base class

finally consider that you can have more than one qthread as well as more than one qobject running on a qthread


rspec	capybara	11
then when i started learning rspec and went through the rspec-rails documentation on there is talks about request specs which many rails developers prefer using capybara and factorygirl

using capybara instead of rspec is a better solution for request intergration tests

if you want to test aspects of your application which are exclusively api-like then i d recommend using rspec request specs for that which are essentially integration tests but focused on one-step request response. you can use get requests and analyze the response using capybara matchers

as i now joined the team so i am trying to change it to rspec-based integration testing using capybara but i have to convince the top management that rspec and capybara is better option for rails based application

i m going through the rails tutorial and i noticed that it recommends including capybara via config.include capybara dsl in spec_helper.rb whereas the capybara readme recommends adding require capybara rspec to spec_helper.rb

is there any tutorial for capybara and rspec to understand better about those

i can t work out how to make capybara with rspec handle anything more than two levels before my expects

i have decided to choose rspec capybara over robot framework for integration tests in rails based app

i use rspec and capybara together but the language syntax of capybara makes more sense is semantic as rspec when testing for request expectations

i have belatedly started testing my rails app a shopping website with rspec capybara using database cleaner to clear the database and factory girl to generate new objects for every test like most people do

as you re a beginner i d recommend using rspec together with capybara and focus on feature acceptance tests instead of unit testing


typhoeus	httparty	1
instead of net http i can use httparty curb rest client or typhoeus which makes everything easier but i can t find any similar solutions to replace enhance net ftp


getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid	4
if you want to manipulate what it outputs via dom then you have to have a known quantity to match with getelementbyid getelementsbytagname or some other method for getting html element nodes from a dom

a solution based on getelementbyid getelementsbytagname will be considerably more reliable and flexible

getelementsbytagname is slightly different from getelementbyid as getelementbyid will only return one element if it exists whereas getelementsbytagname can return more than one element

it would be slightly more sensible to bind the click to an element closer to the form and if you use getelementbyid rather than getelementsbytagname it s more simple since you don t have to worry about the index of the number you re binding to


carrierwave	paperclip	13
choose between paperclip and carrierwave

seems like paperclip is more file oriented and carrierwave is more object oriented

i recommend paperclip or carrierwave

new to carrierwave already loving it so much better than paperclip

honestly i would recommend using carrierwave or paperclip to handle image uploads with rails

carrierwave seems to be gaining more popularity than paperclip but most people seem to be on paperclip

and would you recommend using paperclip or carrierwave here

just take a look on the links to choose between paperclip carrierwave

i prefer carrierwave over paperclip coz it has more options and easy to setup

see compare carrierwave paperclip and dragonfly in rails and refile fixing ruby file uploads

carrierwave is a newer gem than paperclip and it looks a lot more flexible

once the frames have been captured you will need to store them on your server and associate them with the video file again paperclip or carrierwave will make this easier to do

you can try using the rich gem which makes image management with the ckeditor incredibly simple and then use either the paperclip gem or the carrierwave gem for image uploading i d recommend carrierwave


tablet	mdpi	6
the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange

i ve tested this on a few devices a nexus 10 tablet which gets the bigger version of the file from the xhdpi folder a generic tablet using mdpi a galaxy ace phone mdpi again and everything works ok

and in my analysis the tablet must be more than 7 inches xlarge starting at mdpi

each device has a density like hdpi ldpi and mdpi tablet have even more

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

i m sure that aos honestly chooses mdpi drawables for tablet with mdpi display density and thats the problem


maven-assembly-plugin	maven-shade-plugin	1
i prefer maven-shade-plugin over maven-assembly-plugin


libtcod	ncurses	1
the game will be a graphical roguelike 2d rpg requiring more than libtcod ncurses but no 3d graphics thats why i m using pyglet for now


bufferedreader	filewriter	1
i have coded a routine to compute the cartesian product of different tables as in a database with the only exception that the tables are stored as files in my case and for computing the cartesian product i am using file i o for reading files i am using filereader coupled with bufferedreader and for writing files i am using filewriter coupled with bufferedwriter now as i am performing every computation externally in files i.e i compute the product as follows i take a row from file-1 which is table-1 in my case and concatenate it with every other row in file-2 which is table-2 in my case and write it to an external file which holds the result


elasticsearch	fluentd	1
i want to have the milliseconds or better captured by fluentd and then passed on to elasticsearch so that the entries are shown in the correct order


explode	implode	4
if and only if you are using a string for the split string which is not ever going to show up inside the middle of the other strings space may or may not be the case for this then i agree with the others that implode and explode are much simpler

i have an ugly solution that works explode the search string into an array of words look up each word in the array of stopwords unset them if there is a match implode the remaining words and finally run a regex to add the boolean mode formatting

any better way than to explode and implode the string

i m not sure why you d serialize it in php either because implode and explode would be more appropriate


bower	jspm	1
well jspm is much larger and ambitious project than bower


freshmvvm	mvvmcross	1
it s very heavyweight and not fully featured for forms so prism or freshmvvm works better as these are designed for forms from the ground up but if you do use mvvmcross for forms its easy to go native if you need


rouge	pygments	2
note that at time of writing rouge has lesser language support compared to pygments

also redcarpet and pygments were no longer available so they must be replaced by kramdown and rouge in _config.yaml


viewdidload	viewdidappear	10
you could try the block of code in the viewdidload method which is called earlier than viewdidappear

so viewdidload is called slightly earlier than viewdidappear the only difference is that when viewdidappear the view have been already drawn instead in viewdidload the view has still to be drawn

it works perfect and i ve been able to call it from viewdidload which was quicker than calling the deprecated thumbnailimageattime from the viewdidappear

how can i compare viewdidload to viewdidappear

also making the network request in viewdidload will be faster as it called before viewdidappear - but keep in mind viewdidload is only called once for a specific instance of a viewcontroller where as viewdidappear is called every time that instance is displayed again eg

actually as per view life cycle the methods are called in following manner init loadview viewdidload viewwillappear viewwilllayoutsubviews called more than once viewdidlayoutsubviews called multiple time and lastly viewdidappear

i agree with the other answer that it shouldn t be in viewdidload - you ve got no guarantee the view has been added to your window at that point viewdidappear is a better place

how can i compare viewdidload and viewdidappear

you may find using viewdidload rather than viewwillappear or viewdidappear may work better in this case you can set your view up with a loading holding graphic or animation trigger your asynchronous networking call and then once complete display the required information

also don t present modal vc from self at viewdidload at the time of this method execution the vc is often not yet presented itself viewdidappear is more fitting for such tests


typo3	fluid	1
if you are not using a fluid template take a closer look at typo3 sysext fluid classes viewhelpers uri imageviewhelper.php within your typo3 installation


treemap	treeset	1
there is also the treeset class that probably is what you need but since it is just a wrapper to treemap the direct use of treemap would be faster


mapply	melt	1
could i use mapply to do this more succinctly than running melt and dcast separately for each of employed girls guys


cstring	bstr	1
a cstring is more like a visual basic string or a bstr


ssms	sqlcmd	5
you can also do this stuff the old fashioned way using sqlcmd from command line dbas love this for some reason but for us mortals ssms is much less of a struggle

in ssms it takes more than 1 minute to complete while in sqlcmd it takes no longer than one second

from the query menu of ssms choose sqlcmd mode and then type the following

in ssms under the query menu choose sqlcmd mode then run this script

is sqlcmd always that much faster than ssms


cassette	squishit	2
another project you might want to look at is cassette which pretty much does everything squishit does and more

i have a small article on using squishit with mvc3 though i prefer cassette


bazaar	perforce	2
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce

for many of the cases where subversion trumps perforce many people seem to prefer the distributed systems like git bazaar mercurial these days


lisp	prolog	1
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think


recvfrom	datagram	2
wsaemsgsize usually means that the buffer you provided to recvfrom was smaller than the incoming datagram

the datagram is larger than your buffer so it gets trucated you get an error return from recvfrom and getlasterror returns 10040 wsaemsgsize


uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller	2
after googling i found that we can t add images on more tab in uitabbarcontroller because more tab is automatically displayed by uitabbarcontroller when uitabbaritem is more then 5

i have a uitabbarcontroller with more than 5 uitabbaritem so the morenavigationcontroller is available


gridview	formview	2
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list

particularly with the dev stack i am using its seems the less controls formview gridview sqldatasource i use he less problems i run into


fdt	swc	1
we build the majority of our flash projects in this manner or sort of in reverse where we build the assets in flash professional output a swc of the graphics and use that swc in a better development environment we prefer fdt


dplyr	tidyr	13
one possibility is to use dplyr piping and tidyr see more about them here and here

for the given problem size of 100 rows the timings clearly indicate that the dplyr tidyr solutions are magnitudes slower than base r or data.table solutions

i m trying to get better with dplyr and tidyr but i m not used to thinking in r

i recommend dplyr + tidyr it s possible to do this with strsplit and rbind but it s ugly

here is one more idea with dplyr and tidyr

i tend to prefer tidyr to reshape2 of late though that is mostly because the syntax is more similar to dplyr -- which will make this task even easier as well due to loading the magrittr pipe and it s data summary tools

definitely recommend using dplyr and tidyr in the tidyverse as it makes restructuring data very nice and natural

now use dplyr to grab the appropriate level from levels data.frame then spread this back out to short form using tidyr and delete no longer needed id

i started with data table but i think tidyr and dplyr are more suitable for my later purposes

for that i recommend dplyr and tidyr though perhaps broom has utility here as well

spread will be a lot faster than the base r table operation but at scale data.table would in turn easily outperform tidyr dplyr

to transform the data i would recommend dplyr and tidyr and use stack utils mutate dplyr and separate tidyr

based on akrun data.table idea i translated the data.table code to dplyr tidyr is easier for me to read that s all


sublimetext	aptana	1
you can also use any editors likes sublimetext aptana which gives better flexibility to write code for beginners

mechanize	splinter	1
you can do it several ways but since you have not given so much information i would recommend going with mechanize or splinter both work as a browser so you can read what s on the html and even fill submit forms and much more


monkeyrunner	adb	1
adb is more reliable since you get the feedback immediately unlike monkeyrunner which does not provide reliable exceptions in case of any failure in triggering the event

cairngorm	puremvc	2
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t

any large scale flash flex app can get pretty unwieldy without a micro-framework adobe has pushed cairngorm but i personally prefer robotlegs there s also puremvc which i used before robotlegs i prefer rl because it uses native as3 events as well as dependency injection which is easier to test


buildroot	uclibc	1
you must choose uclibc snapshot version in the buildroot


scalaz	shapeless	1
either filterdimensions filter2dimensions could do it but i m almost sure cats scalaz or shapeless have a more decent type


highcharts	rgraph	1
i have found highcharts to have a steeper learning curve than flot or rgraph imho


plot	heatmap	6
note that this relies on image rather than heatmap as the latter offsets the plot making it more difficult to put text in the correct position

i tried to do this with a heatmap but the data plot was worse that way due to the large gaps between samples

it also allows you to use an interpolated shading mode which will make your plot look more like a typical heatmap

for heatmap and correlation statistical analysis based plot i have had more luck with seaborn than with matplotlib

i success in plotting distance with points but i need more visual plot with heatmap

the heatmap plot contains way more information and should use 80 of the canvas height


broom	tidyr	1
for that i recommend dplyr and tidyr though perhaps broom has utility here as well

thunk	trampolines	1
trampolines never runs more than one thunk at a time so if you break


tapestry	struts	2
if your requirement is for a more traditional web application then compare click with struts stripes wicket tapestry etc

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


memmove	strncpy	1
if you know the lengths of the strings memmove is a sensible choice - and nominally faster than strncpy because it does not have to check for nulls as it goes


jboss	glassfish	32
from that point the servlet file actually the web server tomcat glassfish jboss etc is behaving more or less like the iis and aspx file

if money was not part of the equation and i had an employer that insisted on spending money that wasn t mine i d still choose weblogic over websphere or jboss or glassfish or anything else on the market

it compares jboss glassfish and resin

i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss

but in general when you use tomcat use spring if you prefer jboss or glassfish use ejb3

i wouldn t recommend using jboss glassfish etc for your scenario - the overhead far outweighs the only benefit - no additional setup involved

jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand

but in my location jboss is more popular than glassfish so i have a idea

spring security is fine too but if you plan to use jsf 2 you probably also use cdi provided by seam weld which is integrated into the java ee 6 profile from glassfish and jboss it is easier to use shiro as spring heavily relies on its own dependency injection methods although spring security does not need that much injected classes but you should stick to one way of doing things

also note that for example glassfish and jboss wildfly are more than just a servletcontainer they also supports jsf ejb jpa and all other java ee fanciness

scaleing the underlying application server tomcat glassfish jboss ... seems nicer but currently i only found redhats openshift for doing this

to understand the difference compare tomcat with glassfish or jboss

but if you want a full-fledged java ee 6 server then glassfish 3 or jboss 6 is a better alternative

afaik jboss is much more adopted in production deployments than glassfish but this doesn t necessarily mean it s better

1 maybe java ee stacks like glassfish jboss are more scalable they can be easily extended to handle higher volume with out spot coding or ad-hoc optimizations

and this one compares glassfish 3.1 and jboss 6 7

well glassfish is more right than jboss and weblogic business-bean-classes should all have their own ejb-local-interface

they are lightweight because they implement only a few of the specifications at the heart of which is servlet and jsp the larger enterprise level applications jboss glassfish etc implement much more specifications on the server side

these days you d better grab wildfly oracle jboss minded and already java ee 7 ready or tomee apache minded but not java ee 7 ready yet as alternative to open source edition of glassfish

in weblogic and glassfish you ll be better inspired by deploying the native ibm jca resource adapter and creating jndi resources then referenced in the spring context as above in jboss a direct mq client bean declaration suits best as below

i would choose jboss or glassfish for a start

glassfish v3 vs jboss 7.0 in using in production environment i know more people use jboss the application server but glassfish has more features and stability over jboss

jboss has a larger community than glassfish

in my opinion glassfish is more user friendly than jboss so i decided use glassfish for my project

many containers such as jboss provide more complex alternative transaction managers which support concepts like nested transactions but others like glassfish do not

as for me jboss implementation is smaller than the whole glassfish so i m using

even if jboss is the better product in my next project i will shift to glassfish because of the better documentation

i tried jboss too but i think glassfish is easier to use

if so are there other alternatives to to the java se vm the same way you can choose between glassfish jboss etc

glassfish however performs better than jboss and has a very slick gui-based admin console whereas jboss can only be administrated with a command line

any inputs or help on the same will leads to us in deciding to select jboss as7 eap 6 as the suitable candidate for our applications server in place of glassfish

they both contrast with products like glassfish and jboss which are much bigger with many features going well beyond servlets and web serving


textmate	textwrangler	1
open a good text editor i d recommend textmate but the free textwrangler or vi or nano will do too and open


tcplistener	tcpclient	6
what i suggest that you use sockets for you needs you can use the framework socket class but tcplistener class and tcpclient class are much more easy to use

i don t recommend using tcpclient nor tcplistener and if you can stay as far as you can from networkstreams using a pure socket is not very difficult and always gives a lot better results

i am using tcp protocol tcplistener and tcpclient to be more specific

the difference between socket and tcplistener tcpclient is that tcplistener tcpclient is easier to use than socket

on the server side you re using tcplistener which is nothing more than a socket or tcpclient factory

i need to choose between tcplistener tcpclient and wcf


dwoo	smarty	1
so far it has proven to be faster than smarty and it provides a compatibility layer to allow developers that have been using smarty for years to switch their application over to dwoo progressively


ostream	ostringstream	1
ostream is more general subclasses support writing to different places ostringstream is a specific one writing to a string


shadowing	named	5
when you re not worrying about shadowing this is more flexible if the named of the object changes

it is much more complicated at higher levels at deciding which function class choose named shadowing ambiguous named between namespaces etc. or when compiling to bytecode running ast

note that naming a local variable strlen thus shadowing the standard function of that named is going to more than a little confusing for someone who looks at your code later

i believe the reasoning behind it is that it allows the parameters to be named nicer by preventing shadowing of member variables

not using the same named is a more common practice to avoid confusion and shadowing


gitolite	gitosis	11
for this the best option is gitolite better than gitosis

i know gitolite better than gitosis

that being said i find gitolite much more complete than gitosis like all those recent blog posts illustrate

gitosis which is no longer in active development and you should be using gitolite but this answer applies to both of them stores each user s public keys in in your case gitosis .ssh authorized_keys

if you have some product-specific stuff git could be installed with gitosis gitolite gitorious provide more details as to how you ve done it

also i recommend gitolite over gitosis

rather than gitosis i would recommend gitolite for fine-grained authorization coupled with ssh-based authentication

either way gitolite is easier to maintain and more up-to-date than gitosis see how do programs like gitolite work

gitolite is maintained has a dozen features more than gitosis and the author actually responds to emails

gitolite is far more advanced than gitosis and is quite easy to install directly from your workstation based on ssh communication with your git repository server

gitosis which is obsolete for a few years now gitolite is much richer works with bare repos repos without a working tree


nsstring	nsobject	4
or is there any chance to compare nsstring with nsobject

using to compare nsobject instances in this case nsstring instances is a pointer comparison since objective-c instances cannot be created on the stack

to check if two objects are equal nsobject offers an -isequal method which you can use as a general statement and some classes choose to offer a more specific comparison method such as -isequaltodate used to compare nsdate s or -isequaltostring used to compare nsstring s

nsstring has a higher level it also inherited form nsobject const on it should have no effect in fact not the same meaning about the no effect on immutable object


memcpy	strdup	1
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy


colorbox	simplemodal	1
simplemodal has a similar function but i much prefer colorbox s implementation and documentation otherwise i d use the latter


bluetooth	usb	15
in vb goto device - usb - select bluetooth radio

wifi and bluetooth aren t fast enough for a smooth framerate but the data transfer speed across the usb connector is more than enough up to 480 megabytes second

normally bluetooth buffers are smaller than tcp or usb buffers so you don t want to overload them

if your watch doesn t have usb support moto 360 and other induction only charging you need to enable bluetooth debugging slower than through usb though

i am specifically trying to connect it via usb serial as the device needs to be mounted unattended and bluetooth connection seems less reliable plus extra cost for bluetooth capabilities on the device so potentially more cost effective over usb serial

i need to read gps coordinates using a vb.net program directly from a gps device connected to the computer via usb bluetooth also ok but prefer usb

then start your vm and in the running vm window enable sharing your bluetooth device menu devices usb devices select bluetooth device

let me know how to integrate print functionality on button click.after clicking on button it will ask usb or bluetooth and if i select usb then it will send print command to connected usb printer

interfacing with usb is more difficult than it sounds it would be harder to build something which would interface with that and measure millivolts than with bluetooth because the pic processor you use for analog to digital sampling and usb client would in fact have to either act as usb host or usb otg on a phone which is far more complicated than being a usb peripheral

if you are on a budget and can do with a hardwired connection i highly recommend usb over bluetooth

on the other hand a usb connection is far more reliable better supported and of course has the inherent advantage of speed and since it is well supported does not suffer from all the pitfalls bluetooth connectivity does

i created a win usb application in visual studio and changed the device class guid to bluetooth guid e0cbf06c-cd8b-4647-bb8a-263b43f0f974 in inf and device.h files

i had previously sent those commands via bluetooth but the connection fails too often to be useful and is slower than usb

it depends on your requirements but setting up a usb connection is sometimes easier than managing a bluetooth connection

you can purchase usb bluetooth dongles for pc s if needed


ninject	spring.net	3
note i do not know much about ninject but i worked with spring.net that is much more complicated

how am i supposed to choose between castle-windsor unity structuremap spring.net autofac ninject funq linfu etc etc

mef linfu and spring.net are faster than ninject but still pretty


nancy	openrasta	1
however when i compare this with openrasta and nancy in their documentation i don t find this mentioned explicity


hotmail	outlook.com	1
in outlook.com hotmail it looks closer to the results shown with gmail


xquery	schematron	1
but xquery will be more than schematron and i use xquery heavily to validate xml values and i should be able to produce html reports well


tinyxml	xerces	1
for more complex xml reading writing you better check xerces which is heavier than tinyxml


vtk	itk	1
i am more familiar with vtk than itk so propably what comes into my mind is a bit biased


idictionary	iequalitycomparer	1
using iequalitycomparer which is better because works without altering initial idictionary signature


percentile	max	6
the problem is to aggregate these edf s such that when i select max edf it gives me the maximum edf for that day for the financial sector within the particular country the same of min and percentile the code w t the attempted aggregation

i can get the max values like this but i need values greater than 95th percentile for every 5 minutes

step 2 wrapper to grab min max and each of the required percentile

if you notice the 99th percentile is less than 40mb but the max sized partition is still reported to be 3.44gb

the code included in the sapply call will test each day starting from day n. 7+1 8 against the 15-day sliding window as defined before and check if the max temperature is higher than the 90th percentile of that window test1

you can rank records and then select max value with the rank before percentile cutoff


ecj	javac	3
however i think that ecj is even better than javac my opinion .

eclipse compiler for java jdt ecj is much smarter tool than actual javac

to recap i want to know why a javac compilation utilizes so much more cpu than ecj


pygithub	github3.py	1
github3.py has a way to do this but i prefer pygithub because it feels more intuitive


orb	keypoint	3
its however best to used flann based matchers for sift or surf since they extract a higher number of keypoint as compared to orb and flann is suited to large sets of keypoint read more about it here

i am wondering why brisk detector detects much less keypoint than the orb detector

compare keypoint descriptors for orb using bfmatcher


fgets	getchar	3
in short getchar is a poor i o primitive and you should almost always prefer fgets to read entire lines and process those

in general i find it better to use fgets than scanf getchar alternatively if you are using c99 gets_s -- although i still prefer fgets for maximum portability to older compiler environments for all user-based input then if necessary use sscanf strtol and the like to convert the string into other data types as this will read data by line in a way that is buffer-safe and you won t have to worry about things left in the input buffer

use fgets instead of getchar to retrieve more than one character


concave	convex	4
but determining a concave hull is far more difficult than a convex hull

this is a tough problem if you add constraint that concave convex gap is always bigger then max distance between any 2 neighboring points

the check for convex polygons your triangle is simpler than for concave ones see first linked article

the exact algorithm you choose will depend on a combination of how fast you need it to run and what kinds of shapes you want to support convex are the easiest concave is harder shapes with holes are harder too


expandablelistview	spinner	1
you cannot directly use an expandablelistview for the spinner popup any more than you can directly use a listview for the spinner popup


arrayfire	thrust	1
i took the liberty to rewrite your code for arrayfire which you can compare with thrust version and choose whichever runs faster


prawn	pdfkit	2
some options like pdfkit above and also wicked pdf will rely on an external tool like wkhtmltopdf to render existing html pages as pdfs whereas other options like prawn are more ruby native so it really depends on your situation which path your should take in your application

i would have spent at least a full week using prawn and i got pdfkit working in less than a few hours


accurev	svn	3
it s the same if every team will do their development in the separate branch using svn and trying to merge everything after 1 month of development....basically accurev creates late merge price and you are going to pay this price for ever if you will choose accurev for more than 1 team

we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different groups and to purchase accurev

i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths


pcm	music	1
also i d appreciate it if someone could explain how to grab pcm frames from the audio files in the music library


androidviewclient	adb	1
fortunately you don t have to choose between adb or python scripts because androidviewclient provides the necessary bindings to invoke most adb commands from python


air	flashdevelop	1
if you re unsure which version you have or you are targeting a version earlier than air sdk 3.2 you can download the latest air sdk pre-merged with flex sdk from adobe s gaming site download the adobeâ airâ sdk save it to disk and link its location to flashdevelop


roslyn	csc	1
second how can compile with vs2015 with default csc or choose roslyn


matplotlib	canopy	1
another even simpler option than canopy and anaconda is just to download spyder s dmg which comes with the latest versions of numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sympy and the sci-kits


xlwings	xlsxwriter	1
i know that xlsxwriter is way faster than xlwings and have functionality to add border but it is just a writer it can t update already existing spreadsheet


min	max	892
i also tried sorted and the necessary casts but min max is faster than that

write a loop that goes through every element and compares min max values with your arguments

take the first value from the list then examine each other element of the list selecting lower higher values as temporary min max

please observe that the max of one tuple is less than the min of the next tuple

as of now a full index scan has only one direction either forward or backward and can not start from both ends simultaneously this is why when you ask for both the min and the max you get a less efficient access method

and you need to define the minimum and maximum for generate_series - doable with select min time_utc and max time_utc

might want to consider removing the min-width max-width code so that this doesn t break on devices smaller and larger than the min max sizes

match any number of clusters bigger than 3 min 13 max 19 handled by first look ahead

alternately you could assume you are instead intending to take the smallest possible distance between the two outer angles in which case max could actually be a lower value than min and still be valid for testing

also in that if statement i am trying to say if the current hr is greater then my max or if both my hours are equal but my current min is greater then my maxmin

third take the items that match min and max

edit the proposal by jens from the comments using the min max is probably more what you re looking for if you re not interested in complete ordering of your values

in my example using not in select max or min will leave the wrong record in my case

i can inject a hook into running processes to catch when they create destroy max min

probably the line drawer was a bresenham modified to skip the points drawn unless they were greater than max or less than min

this is an option which can be expanded very easily to test more than simple min max

you haven t expressed your requirements very clearly but it sounds to be as if you want the highest min to be less than the lowest max which would be

select min dailylogs.from_time as start_date max dailylogs.from_time as end_date avg userstory.percentage as percentage t

what is the best algorithm to generate a random simple no parallel edges or self-loops undirected graph with a given number of nodes where each node has a number of edges that is no less than min and no greater than max

the function return false if the value is less than the min bound or greater than the max bound

you can choose component with max magnitude exchange it with middle-magnitude component negate it and make min magnitude component zero

select min start_date max end_date from calendar

for example select min salary max salary is most likely going to pull values from different records

i would like to choose min buyprice and max sellprice

take a look at your picture - all the range you want have ending time greater than min and starting time less than max

how can i set a date 1 1 2012 on a kendo datepicker which is less than min date 1 1 2013 or greater than max date 1 1 2014 defined in the datepicker options

select min work_date as start_date max work_date as end_date

for every snapshottime account i want to select min openprice max openprice in such a way that the resultimg min and max are relative to the past only with respect to snapshottime

where user can enter max value greater then min value and min value less than max value

what i know is that how to select min and max value between two dates

i found out that max min sum was faster if you re-implemented them rather than using the python version

note that this will pick any number that is at least min but less than max

because i dont choose max and min values group by id - this problem is in the example 4

it may look odd but it is common for number-to-string functions in many programming languages to make an exception for the min value in this way because with two s complement representation of integers the max value is 1 less than the absolute of the min value range of -2 147 483 648 to +2 147 483 647 which means the min value is the only negative value you can t flip to positive and then process using the same shared loop code as for the positive values.

i usually choose min in those cases but max avg median all have the same effect when there is only one row in a partition

what you would have to do is to use input_slider and choose min and max for the x-axis

you re comparing every value from min with every value from max until you hit a value of min that is greater than a value in max and 55 from min is greater than 22 from max so test will be set to true

on the right side we have two groups where the left group s max is greater than the right group s min 4 4 1 2 6 2

there fore you should order by product id and select max price min price

of course if speed and distance change a lot and you always need to get min max for both you can also just iterate over all items and select min max the classic way

lead min time 1 max time over .

select min tran_date + generate_series 0 max tran_date - min tran_date as some_date

i tried with the code select max min max-min as difference from result

i need to select max min and avg value of fee column which need to split up by and rs delimiter

edit correcting the max lenght so it is bigger than the min lenght

the functions min and max are more succinct

issue is when you create an android app in eclipsyou have asked to select min and max api support and by default eclips select 8 as min and 19 as max if you encounter above error means the function you are using is of version which is greater then 8

select max co_id max_co min co_id min_co co_name from co

in general you want to have a range slightly larger than x max - x min and then divide the range into the desired number of bins

furthermore in fb x y dev min and max is a lower and upper interval and dev some allowed deviation which returns the needed number of iterations for each number in the interval

you might need to add some other logic deepening on what point value you want to select max min etc

then i wrote a query to select min and max date of employee for next 30 days

the engine will find all rows where min is less than x then search within those result to find the rows where max is greater then y

otherwise once max has replaced min once a value can never be both greater than max and less than min

select min as min max

actually you will get better performance with min 10 max 20 or 30 from which corebluetooth will select approximate 20ms instead of 30ms

btw as you might have seen in your first implementation you did not implement compare max or min even if it s part of the type-class and this it got infered too

if the max value ends up being less than -999 or the min is greater than 1000 then your code won t work

both definitions agree that the min can t be less than max 2

where i can try to select min max values across the resultset

i d want to see four tests in total one each for row and column less than the min value of 0 and above the max value for the matrix in question

the question i have is i would like the calendar to only display the min and max date range for the from date and to date any thing greater than the max and anything less than the min should be greyed out

so min will work incorrectly if all elements greater than zero max - when all elements less than zero

in my code every condition is satisfying but the last rule means max price will be always greater than min price is not working

the problem using a linear model like lm is that predictions can be greater than the max of the observed cases and less than the min of the observed cases

now when you have both max and min you can simply get the index of first element greater than min and last element smaller than max from your minheap

if you have data is small or larger than the min and max will be quite different than what matlab thinks is good for pictures

if i change the min textbox to be greater than max the control would be correctly marked as invalid

2 that the min range is not greater or equal to the max range.

i m going to revert to my original implementation of resetting max to no maximum if the user selects a min higher than max and vice versa

the syntax is where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

now this obviously doesn t work because the new bounds don t have to be strictly less greater than the min max

numerical algorithms that need gradients will probably do more than max and min and other complexities can come up

select select max s.age from student s major m where s.sid m.sid and m.dname computer sciences - select min s1.age from student s1 major m1 where s1.sid m1.sid and m1.dname computer sciences as difference

that s why you must provide select statement with aggregate-functions like sum avg min max which will produce 1 result from possible choices

but if 0 and 0 should result in the identical output and likewise for 255 and 255 then just limiting inputs using min and max is simpler

and i need to check for every item if min is always smaller than max

use a series of union ed selects each one selecting one of the six columns and then use this as the inner nested select where you then use select max min from that

age can be in the range of 0..100 but i want also to validate crossing values i mean that max is greather than or equal to min

a variation on pentadecagon you are free to set n arbitrary values on the diagonal in some range min..max containing x and fill the rest of the array with lower than min on one side and higher than max on the other

e. not an input meaning end of execution check whether the value is greater than max or less than min

for example if min is greater than max i want to disable the button in my view

i m seeing is that if you use the slider and move it to either end min or max it appears to display a value which is the step value greater than min or less than max

i know the function does not handle invalid arguments if max is less than min

agg to grab min start_d and max stop_d

when you choose an option that your needs and you can choose min and max instance number

if you per se wanted the minimum index for a set of values with more than one minimum you d just swap out max for min at the front of the expression

first i run a query to find the min and max for each security id then find the difference between the min and max and finally find a value that is 10 more than the minimum like this

in a given point cloud i want to remove all the points which are less than min and greater than max for all x y and z direction

select min date startdate max date enddate title flag from

note you could also use count distinct but that has more overhead than min and max

you could even do without a predicate xpath xquery comparisons have a set-like semantic this means true iff one min value that is equal or greater than one max value

you can t convert the string min is greater than max

you can also select min bedroom_id max bedroom_id the literal sparrow etc

you need to preserve the grades as you go or keep a running min and max which uses less memory but requires more custom code you can get wrong

the min can be less than 0 and the max can be greater than 255

if you want to check that a number is between the min and max of the range you would likely want to check that it is both higher than the min and lower than the max

and as i would like to use checkboxes user can select min 1 max all of them

i have a table like below and i want to duplicate the records while the min date being less or equal the max date

i want to create a select between min to max using php

it is generally much more expensive than min and max because it needs to maintain internal lists of all values

i started toying with select max time - min time from logtable where id but couldn t figure out how to format it correctly

you would now get a random number between 0 and max - min including the larger value

how to popup a window if user hits more than max or min value

so what i m trying to do is grab the max price and min price when the max price entry_date is greater than the min price entry_date

i would use nsnumber for storing your min max and performing lower greater checks

say if the the max of group 1 is greater than the min of group 2

if min is not a number fail if max is not a number fail if min is smaller than max fail

there are many optimizations possible like for instance checking whether the difference of min and max is more than one inside the loop and if that is the case return false immediately

returns false if obj min is less than zero or if anobject max is greater than zero true otherwise

just iterate through values choose minimum and maximum values and set y axis min and max values

select min id max id from select from mytable where 1 1 t1

assuming that pids cannot be repeated this is a trivial task put everything in a table select min time max time pid group by pid

you can think of a window or stage as an independent viewport into the scene which can be sized larger or smaller than the min and max specifications of the scene root

i have these two dropdownlist that are supposed to be for age and i want to make it so that you cant make min age higher than max age

i found havershine formula spherical law of cosines bounding square method to compare min and max latitude-longitude values with coordinate in database and other methods which use trigonometric math functions

for finding max and min you can traverse the entire array while checking if the elements are greater or lesser than your max and min variables

if you look how floating point numbers are implemented they can t represent all numbers between their max and min as the number of real numbers in a range is bigger than infinite

i was wondering about some of the math or theory of whether a signed integer or signed floating-point representation in n bits encodes more granularity between its min and max values or if the two encode the same granularity

if you set scale unit to be month your min max should be more than one month to see the actual scales

in other words i want to select min and max of a column after it was summed

now when i select max value in second dropdownlist less than min value in first dropdownlist the value of first dropdownlist should reset equal to second

choose max or min based on your requirement

the max value set to min value + 100 while this should only happen when max is less than min max min like i said above

i tried suggestions from the following link how to select min and max values of a column in a datatable

however for larger amounts of data max and min will become more and more likely to be of limited help

the last operation in the case where max is greater than min is called self assignment

when i select max timestamp and min timestamp from a colum below are the values that i get

select min a as maxa b max c as minc

if you want it in the worksheet now drag the field inton the columsn shelf and select min max or avg since you don t want to add up all the differences

for example to select max and min values in column exp_data where be is larger than 2 and less than 5

however during debugging i discovered that the min x values area always lower than the max x values regardless of positions and sizes of the rectangles

my answer based on mikko s but allowing better control over min and max limits of breaks and bin size

make sure any of the chart s value is not beyond greater than the max or lower than the min the limits you are setting

anytime you select aggregate-functions like avg sum max min etc.

subquery input prepares data for further treatment period selects min and max minute from table

if i have a list of 5 dates the max position should be 4 more than the min position

. script.m file.csv 7 20 the test fails and i get the output min 7 must be less than max 20

then select max or min id

you can restrict the number of times a pattern matches with min max

you can select min if you want or you could limit your allpossibleids to be less than the max table id

i have a problem to write correct sql query which should select min max avg of duration in days between two dates by country and site for the trial

this is still just setting max to min when min is greater than max

if both are selected then max price value must be greater than min price

i want to pick max and min date from datasheet and then display on x axis b y 1 week difference

while there is a lot written about binary trees min max heaps seem less well defined details vary between implementations

im trying to write a method that returns the number of words from the words parameter that have at least the min but no more than the max c haracters

2 plotting a new series with values less than min and greater than max

i need to pick max of start message to min of success message to make it a match

the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

you re usually much better off phrasing such queries as select max ... or select min ... where possible

produces the same error attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

it s much more efficient to grab min and max from netflows in one query

i have a table as outlined below and i m trying to get the max and min values for a specific id but only if the max entry date is greater than the min entry date

4- you then need to loop over max to check if any rating is higher than any min

note that using the linq min and max functions are faster than sorting the input for larger datasets o n vs

select max odometer - min odometer as totalkm from table

if range is greater then or less then the min and max then it should throw error

select z_depth from elements where z_depth select min z_depth from elements z_depth select max z_depth from elements order by z_depth asc

final select picks min or max to return

urbg min returns the smallest urbg result_type that operator could return strictly less than max

for ease of debugging i pass the value of to reactive values and print the first date range s value to the console rendered to check whether the it is smaller or bigger than the min and max of the corresponding date column as i did in the lapply function

you can pick min max value per group as

keep in mind that if your new min value is larger than either the current slider value or max value it will not render until the remaining two are updated accordingly

sqoop import -d mapred.job.name default oraoop --driver oracle.jdbc.driver.oracledriver --connect jdbc oracle thin myip myservicename --username xxxx --password xx --target-dir my_dir --query select from mytable where conditions --map-column-java a string --split-by coulmn --boundary-query select min splitcolumn max splitcoulmn from dual --num-mappers 30

if the current value is large than the max or lower than the min it is either capped or wraps around

now i need to select min and max for each min price for each day

i try to select min and max prices drupal commerce for current catalog tag

you can pull the minimum select min and the maximum select max you can determine how many results are in a set select count

alternatively you could use aggregation instead and choose min or max

a clean way to check whether there s any positive or negative amount would be to check whether min amount and max amount are less greater than 0

if min is larger than zero then it belongs to complete category max is naturally larger than zero then

using this query it is updating more than one max and min value for column ord_by

with your brief question i will give a couple of pointers groupby select min max

summary will return a number no bigger than max which is then tested for value some min

select max gasconsumedtotalp1 - min gasconsumedtotalp1 from data_rr where date from_unixtime timestamp curdate into var3

in this case you have to choose between max or min as per your requirements

if i now change max to be greater than min the min textbox validation state does not get cleared down presumably because min hasn t changed and therefore doesn t get validated again

how do i get more than 1 min max value from a dictionary if there is more than 1

by doing select min ... max ... avg ... from .

then if there are more than one min entry choose the one with the max id

andreiy s query performs about the same as my simplified version aggregate-functions in outer select min max sum makes no measurable difference just two rows per group

i like to have two functions like min and max to make this easier like unit math in delphi

is it possible to select min and max

you need to tell if it needs to select min max average sum or something else

perhaps you may want to consider doing a select max id - min id + 1

so after calculating median of first k elements delete the first element directly from heap min or max according to whether it is greater or less than median using pointers and then use heapify at that position

and i want to retrieve the course names that having the min and max credits i get confused because there are more than min values

i have to select min and max year of a column and define the remaining years

i have a vague impression that min max are more simplistic and floor ceiling are more mathematical but that s not much to go on

i want to select min min_serving_time max max_serving_time from a date range group by weekday like this

straightforward way to fix your code is - match max index after min index is found instead of break

this works but count distinct is less efficient than min and max

it looks like the default calulation of the range slider is min + max - min 2 or min if max is less than min

no it must be numeric because according to the specs by default sqoop will use query select min max from to find out boundaries for creating splits. the alternative is to use --boundary-query which also requires numeric columns

to do this i suggest to bind to keyup event for range input and store value to internal field i used lastvalue within input itself then bind to change event to compare lastvalue with min max value

i get the max time stamp for status 1 then i get the min timestamp for status 0 and if the min timestamp for status 0 is greater than max timestamp for status 1 then i include it in the result set

ps i set max split size is lesser than min initially i set by mistake and i realized

note that if you expect more than one max min then cv minmaxloc is not sufficient since it returns only a single point

if you really want it you could choose min id or max id but once again what for

you re unlikely to find anything faster than the min and max functions

and only evaluate leaf nodes nodes with maximum depth or nodes that is a win or tie and pick one that is max if the current player is the maximizing one and pick min if the current player is the minimizing one

i need receive product 2 only because his min value is -5 less than -1 and max value is 18 more than 15

size is invalid only if it s length does not match min max constraints and it s fine if value is null

and throws out data that is less than the min or greater than the max

group by the criteria you want to and select min and max as columns per unique combination of these values per row

if min is greater then max or max is lower than min then the input shouldn t be valid

if you just want to match min of 5 chars and max of 12 why even bother with regex

in that i want to select min max of the value

also would finding the min and max be slower than just creating the set

if you want a range use select min user_id as min max user_id as max ..

for example select min key_part2 max key_part2 from tbl_name where key_part1 10

i want select min date of in and max date of out

postgres- from generate_series select min id from message select max id from message as aid

then you have to check that beta1 - beta2 alpha1 - alpha2 is greater than min x1_line1 x2_line1 and less than max x1_line1 x2_line1

but this function fails if min is greater than max

for example with having avg materialgathered in select min avg_gathered ... or avg materialgathered in select max avg_gathered ... instead of a join

and extract the sell min and buy max average them and then do math with the results

with spreadsheet formulas i don t think that you can do much better than that min max construct

so if min is zero it will have one more than max value first possition will be 0 second will be 1 etc last one will be max

splitting the min and max operations seems more simd friendly thus i suggest

let s check if the first which is equal or larger than min is smaller or equal than max so

assuming you will only have one max huge assumption you can do min tableaid where grade select max grade etc....

then like dasblinkenlight writes you can use linq to select max or min

if not we test whether the entered value is less than the min value if it is then we set the value to the min value and if not implying that the value must be greater than the max we set the value to the max attribute

performance decreases a little and the graph shows bigger variations between max and min messages per second than before

count distinct incurs extra overhead so min max often has slightly better performance

assuming width and height are both positive numbers the only way to get a negative output value from the scale is if you input a number that is less than the minimum domain value for the x scale or more than the maximum domain value on the y scale -- which implies that the max min functions aren t doing what you expect

when i specify a min and max value for the y-axis if any value in the series is less than the min value it will extend below the chart usually extending into the chart below

from there you can use having to make sure the max review of the first user is less than the min review of the other user

for example maxwage and minwage are more meaningful than max and min

the output picks 45 as min and 86 as max and color codes the entire dataframe

select min p1.start_time max p2.end_time p1.partition p2.partition

select min effdate max termdate from tab1

i could find only this one which produces somewhat clean sql still not really effective comparing to select min val max val from table

you need min less than max or max greater than min both serves the same purpose in condition then it ll work fine

is it possible using select max base date and min base date

see if the max se value at the minimum cobble is less than the min se at the maximum cobble value

if and n f2 0 f2 1 if and not countif a 3 a 22 min index a 3 a 22 match max f 2 f2 h 2 h2 a 3 a 22 1 +1 index c 3 c 22 match max f 2 f2 h 2 h2 c 3 c 22 1 +1 index a 3 a 22 match max f 2 f2 h 2 h2 a 3 a 22 1 +1 index a 3 a 22 match max f 2 f2 h 2 h2 a 3 a 22 1 +1

that having been said your average is guaranteed to be at least as large as the min value in the column and no larger than the max value in the column

so i already did a select min in_dept which is quite easy and i need now to find the max out_dept to union findings

select min value max value from weather_data where type temperature

whenever and user enters a number with a value that is less than 0 min value or greater than 300 max value an alert box will appear outlining the user of an incorrect value

there are algorithms that will never predict a value greater than the max or less than the min

if the difference between max hi32 and min lo32 is less than about 6 days worth should be enough for a packet capture exercise

val - min max - min performs this scaling no number will be greater than max - min once min has been subtracted from it and never less than zero once min has been subtracted from it

each value entered after would then get checked to see if higher than max or lower than min

the whenever clause is required in this case to prevent min values being higher than the max values and to ensure that the range size does not exceed the capacity of an int

or to show the first time they ordered that product choose min instead of max

iâ m looking for a solution how to select user_id where the difference between min and max dates is more than 3 yrs

this will turn it into a format in the column with which you can then run less than and greater than min and max queries

you can choose min sdk and max sdk in gradle file in android studio

i know select max amount from salary but i need without max min or order by clause

will match x between min and max times

we have to show that b min is always less than or equal to zero and b max is always greater or equal to zero

and i would also recommend setting min and max values for the resizable container see here

min is always lesser than guess and max is always greater than guess

to return a random integer equal or greater than min smaller or equal to max with chance probability of the result to equal x and 100-chance probability spread uniformly among all other results in the given range

you can also choose min max listagg or some other combination of values

also yo can run queries like select max c min c avg c from tname to get exact data the is of interest for you

set a min width 1 pixel higher than the max width of the next query

rand.next int min int max returns a positive random number greater than or equal to min less then max max must be greater than or equal to min

you can write single query if you have one company by using select min price max price ...

however i m getting a attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter. error when i m trying to plot the normalized data

if given value is higher than max or lower than min values then keys holding max and min are given respectively

sigmoid approximates clamp never smaller than min never larger than max

is_valid will be true if inputvalue is larger than min or of it is smaller than max

here i am inserting values min and max id s in a temporary table from another table so that i can then use those values to retrieve my data in the final query.but in the final query where i am specifying the range i.e the line containing select max from rangee and select min from rangee is giving this error.how can i solve it.the values of min and max are returning fine

the new randomint takes min and max which defines the range the parameters are exclusive so the range is covered better

select min login_time max logout_time from this_table group by id

by turnig the bar to the bottom or top the max and min values are higher than setmax and lower than 0 - it was neagtiv

note that you can t let max and min be the same value or lett max be less than min

my if statement keeps telling me that the down payment is always either less or more than the min max values unless i use the min or max values

- preceeding symbol template is expected to appear exactly minimum min times but not more than max times

i want to have validation that min price should always be less than max price and max price should be greater than min price

i can select min and max values and cut the range but if the pks are not distributed quite evenly it may give me some range of seriously different sizes

there are probably other special cases you want to deal with to constrain it -- just pick min and max radians and check them before using in a transform

select min id max id from mytable where date_created 2015-01-27 00 00 00 and created_at 2015-01-27 23 59 59

if the value is less than min or greater than max it returns that boundary

the framework always restricts it to 32 points even if both min and max size are greater than that

if so use group by item and select max or min of item or date

if i have multiple out or in row with same device_id in sequence then selects row with max datetime for in and min datetime for out example

a co-worker and i got it working just by switching thes around to and select max to select min then i added a conditional statement to figure it out properly

in general case you need to determine maximum and minimum shape coordinates along every axis and define minimum axis aligned integer bounding box with values rounded to larger using ceil for max and rounded to smaller using floor for min coordinates

you can also use 0 and 1 and a secondary axis but i think max min is easier

thus after the loop exits you will be able to tell whether the values of min and max are real or just the initial values that haven t been changed another way to do that would be to test after the loop whether min is bigger than max - if it is then the file was empty

i guess i m looking for a cross between describe select distinct col select min col max col and other summary statistics

first use agg to grab min max and size of each group

i understand how i might be able to approach this using a group by and select min max in order to get the first and last colour choices for a given palette however i m not sure how to go about selecting the nth joined row like this

hi all i m trying to find a way to select min or max from a range of data based on these conditions

a version which uses a closure over the min and max values with raising an exception if max is smaller than min

if value is smaller than min it will return min likewise with max value

if i just try to use the if compare logic directly within the min getter or setter when min is changed to a value greater than max i just end up with min equal to max


pylons	web2py	1
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails


dplyr	purrr	4
with library purrr you can have a prettier more compact form see soto s answer for an even more compact one with dplyr

if you have a function in mind that might be more complicated as you describe i would recommend going with purrr and map rather than do from dplyr

note that while you could use purrr for the job it s not particularly better suited than regular dplyr

i prefer using dplyr and purrr


atan2	sqrt	4
my second question is how come this very simple loop is slower than sqrt atan2 and the many hundred lines of computations that come before

indeed sqrt is better than atan2 and 1 sqrt is better than sqrt

abs acos and asin atan atan2 average choose columns concatenate cos count counta countblank countif date datevalue daverage day dcount dcounta ddb degrees dget dmax dmin dproduct dstdev dstdevp dsum dvar dvarp error.type exact exp fact find fv hlookup hour if index int irr isblank iserr iserror islogical isna isnontext isnumber istext left len ln log log10 lookup lower match max mid min minute mod month n na not now nper npv or pi pmt power product proper pv radians rand rank rate replace rept right round rows second sin sln sqrt stdev stdevp substitute sum sumifs sumproduct syd t tan time timevalue today trim trunc upper value var varp vlookup year false and true

with typical libraries on common modern hardware sqrt is faster than atan2

sbt	giter8	1
i greatly recommend using giter8 with sbt and it also comes with a lift template


hammer.js	fastclick.js	1
hammer.js is a more full-featured touch library has many swipe commands than fastclick.js most upvoted answer


vaadin	jsf	1
i d like to know if it s possible with jsf too as i d prefer jsf over vaadin


flac	ogg	4
i suspect the computational demands of flac decoding are probably considerably less than ogg and if dsp gets you excited taking the time to figure all this stuff out is 100 worth it even if the flash route possibly leads to disappointment

regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg that is not really the case

i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg

it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc


rational-numbers	fractions	3
if all rational-numbers could occur maybe the representation as fractions would be better since it is always finite

on the other hand if you use rational-numbers you potentially have to calculate the greatest common divisor in order to compare fractions by comparing numerator and denominator which multiplies running time by a factor of log n

and most importantly all decimals stored on a computer are terminating because in a computer a decimal fractions is not much more than a rational-numbers m n with n being a power of 2


ocaml	prolog	1
haskell ml ocaml miranda alice oz erlang twelf coq prolog all demonstrate more rigorous applications of mathematics to programming


yesod	happstack	3
for the most part i think the choice of snap vs yesod vs happstack is less an issue of features and more one of personal taste

for a beginner i would recommend happstack since yesod uses quite a bit of quasiquotes magic

as far as haskell web frameworks go i would also recommend happstack but yesod is itself fine software with perhaps a stronger support base


return-value-optimization	nrvo	4
if you mix and match nrvo and return-value-optimization inside the same function it becomes hard to apply the optimisation

return-value-optimization or nrvo may be somewhat more difficult

returning an unnamed temporary variable here means compilers without named return-value-optimization nrvo will have a better chance to elide the copy of the local object - instead working directly on the callers stack

for instance for this really_trivial class i just assume that move semantics cannot offer anything more than return-value-optimization and nrvo already does when copying around instances of it


sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter	2
loading is far faster than with the sqlcommandbuilder and sqldataadapter

since i have several gridcontrols that work like this with different data i am trying to not generate select insert update and delete commands for sqldataadapter myself instead of that i m using sqlcommandbuilder to keep it simpler


sdl	devil	1
apart from the other answers mentioning sdl and devil there are two more options to consider


gridview	objectdatasource	3
when you use linq or mvc then prefer objectdatasource and for multi-tier architecture asp.net prefer binding datatable to gridview control from the code behind

on the next load the objectdatasource returns the correct object that matches gridview s fields

from what i ve read the gridview control plays a lot nicer with the objectdatasource


cout	cin	19
i ve made some programs and saw that scanf and printf are considerably faster than using cin and cout

for input and output to complete gandalf the grey s answer if you like to use cin and cout it s better to use std ios sync_with_stdio false

well i have written this class wich do this but when use cin cout works no more

i don t consider it smoother as cin cout dialogue is not smooth imho

using printf isn t faster than cout but scanf is a little faster than cin 0.04s + - 0.05

but given that a c++ solution is acceptable i d recommend cin string getline and cout for i o

in the sst window select u0 and then in the signals window select cin hit the insert button then the same for cout

cin and cout should be generally faster then their c counterparts with synchronization turned off

and of course scanf and printf is a lot faster than cin and cout respectively

allow for the possibility that there may be any number of whitespace characters one or more between cin and and between cout and

scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc

there are obviously situations where in c++ scanf is preferable to cin i was wondering if there are any situations where printf is more practical than cout

note that at least in my opinion sscanf and scanf are actually more powerful than cin and cout in a lot of ways-for this kind of parsing specifically and without bringing in external libraries they re almost always my first choice

generally prefer cout and cin to printf in c++

thing is i believe that cin and cout is faster than scanf anf printf.c++

for the purposes of reading the user s input i would recommend using std cin which uses a similar syntax to std cout and is really more convenient

but still scanf printf is usually faster than cin cout

i just know using cin and cout will be slower than scanf and printf

although since you re already using c++ in your function with cin and cout it s probably better to use std string instead of a char buffer


mktime	strtotime	2
much nicer than strtotime mktime etc

you d be better off using mktime for this as it s dumber than strtotime

junit	mockito	4
for unit tests single bean tests not run within container i d recommend junit and easymock mockito

i recommend junit and mockito for this although there are other frameworks you can use

probably you recommend mockito and junit - it would be wonderful if somebody can explain on example step by step what s going on in sample test s

i am going to need to use powermockito - mockito to create some more tests but before i start writing those tests i am just switching the junit runner to powermockrunner


short	base	4
in short it s worse design to move things to the base class than it is to downcast to the specific class

in fact some would argue that any comment is a code smell and that descriptive names and short routines are more readable and prevent the situation where code has been changed but the comments haven t been updated which has certainly bitten me in a few legacy code base

as the condition reads a loop can not be zipped tighter if it s either too short less than five base or its ends do not match

the short version is that having concrete base classes makes it easier to accidentally slice off your child object use arrays incorrectly


strtol	getline	1
also your get_int would be better written with fgets or getline if available and strtol


wicket	appfuse	1
so while you can compare spring web flow + spring and wicket + spring the later combo doesn t offer anything comparable to roo out of the box maybe appfuse or appfuse light but you didn t mention them and they are third-party projects


mapquest	directions	1
as accuracy goes i ve noticed that for directions here in north carolina mapquest is slightly more accurate


strlen	substr	3
i heard that in php there are some alternatives for the functions substr and strlen which handles safer bits

strlen string + matches strlen replacement -strlen substr + 1

functions like strlen and substr are probably more frequently used with bytes than actual text strings


seaborn	matplotlib	6
seaborn is a higher level library above matplotlib

if its an option for you i would recommend using seaborn which is a wrapper for matplotlib

while i still recommend seaborn and raw matplotlib over the plotting interface in pandas it turns out that you can pass as a kwarg to df.plot.box which will pass it as a kwarg to df.plot which will pass is as a kwarg to matplotlib.axes.boxplot

i d prefer using matplotlib or seaborn

you can import seaborn to get the pretty layout and plot using matplotlib to get easier better config tools

for heatmap and correlation statistical analysis based plot i have had more luck with seaborn than with matplotlib


qpainter	qwidget	1
if you are already doing the rendering elsewhere as a qpixmap and just want to draw the result subclassing qwidget and drawing it in the paintevent using qpainter may be simpler


bigloo	ecl	1
this one is more for bigloo - is it more functional than ecl


rbenv	homebrew	5
install rbenv or rvm as your ruby version manager i prefer rbenv via homebrew ie

highly recommend rbenv and rbenv-gemset installing here with homebrew

but there are some who would recommend using homebrew to set up rbenv

you might find homebrew doens t suit you or you would prefer rbenv over rvm

personally i prefer rbenv because it works well with homebrew and doesn t mangle the shell environment as much but tend to use rvm on servers where that doesn t matter


jcheckbox	jradiobutton	1
for jradiobutton and jcheckbox is better to use itemlistener only because fired exactlty events selected and deselected


trie	tree	27
most likely a trie is more efficient and you didn t sort your dictionary and it doesn t use a binary tree or ternary tree

in my use case i don t anticipate the trie to grow more than 2-3 levels in depth so if your tree gets very complex you might want to analyze performance issues and see if the additional lookups will cause too much overheads

use a radix tree wiki or trie wiki if you are concerned about performance.the radix tree is more memory efficient compared to a trie

another suggested reason is that deletions from a array mapped trie are more expensive tha from a b tree

a radix search tree trie might be more suitable than a hash if you re mapping from string to integer

ps radix tree is usually faster and more compact then trie but suffers from the same side effects of trie comparing to hash tables though less significant of course

a trie or perhaps a van emde boas tree might be a better bet for creating a space efficient set of integers with lookup time bring constant against the number of objects in the data structure assuming that even std bitset would be too large

should i change my project to trie or is there any other good reasons where avl tree woud be more efficient than trie in case of phonebook

however that space overhead can be reduced by compressing the trie using the patricia tree representation using a more efficient data structure to store child pointers or building a dawg from the trie

in this case a general trie might be easier to deal than the more specialized radix tree but the requirements in space are a bit higher

instead there comes a point much earlier where a trie or a ternary tree become better options

a trie is better than a binary search tree for searching elements

for example the patricia trie or the radix tree that is far more space efficient than an hash table for strings but of course being a tree lookup computational complexity is o log n and building it is o n log n

finally b+ tree is admittedly more difficult to implement than a trie it s more on a red-black tree level of complexity

a trie is better suited to this kind of thing because it lets you store your symbols as a tree and quickly parse it to match values or reject them

a radix tree will provide a better memory usage for strings than a regular trie if you have a lot of strings with common roots prefixes which is probably the case for a dictionary words with many forms - although that would probably depend on the language

recursive is usually used for traversal and binary search tree but this tree is more similar to trie of only 2 character in alphabet

a ternary tree trie would be more efficient

a suffix tree has less dummy nodes than the suffix trie

for cases where each node in the trie has most of its children used the trie is substantially more space efficient and time efficient than th ternary search tree

also you can use redix trie or suffix tree these are far better suited for this kind of operations and much faster but they require a pre-processing of the data and might require more processing power

note that while a trie works for the specific case of keys which are strings a binary search tree is much more general and only requires that the keys can be ordered

the article says that a trie is better than binary tree as for a string of length m for trie it takes o m time and for binary tree it takes o m logn time

the suffix tree is lighter and faster than the trie and is used to index dna or optimize some large web search engines

as suggested a trie would be more efficient than a binary tree but you can use a hashmap and hash each word

i ve implemented a n-ary tree to be more specific a trie and i was wondering if there s a method to represent and traverse it as a vector

a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie


thin	webrick	7
i was getting 0.5 reqs s on the front page of my rails app a very simple mostly static page that made a couple of database calls but nothing that webrick said took longer than 0.8 ms served with thin

my personal experience is that webrick is faster in my development environment than unicorn and thin os x in a pretty big rails app lots of gems routes etc

i also found that installing thin as your rails web server c gem install thin will perform much faster than the default webrick server

from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin

in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

if not i will happily switch back to webrick if someone can point out to me how to make sinatra choose webrick over thin i m using shotgun to run my sinatra app

3 use thin instead of webrick - thin seems easier to configure for ssl


tapestry	stripes	2
if your requirement is for a more traditional web application then compare click with struts stripes wicket tapestry etc

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


tablesorter	datatables	1
one thing you could look into is using tablesorter - which is much simpler than datatables - with a drag and drop plugin like sortable for jquery ui or this


rtsp	rtcp	1
the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast rtcp generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via rtp multicast only sender reports are generated


pyshark	dpkt	1
im specifically looking to increase speed of a python script just not sure if dpkt or pyshark is better coupled with cython


qgridlayout	qwidget	2
however the qwidget gauge1 is always bigger than the other one.i want to use a qgridlayout because the application has to work on different sizes of a screen

in this case parent is the parent qwidget upon which the qgridlayout mentioned earlier is installed


cruisecontrol	teamcity	3
for a one man shop teamcity is far easier to setup and configure than cruisecontrol

between cruisecontrol and teamcity teamcity is faster and easier to set up but you may need to check on licensing for it

if you are taking a more open source approach such as teamcity cruisecontrol then nant may be better


codeigniter	yii	17
whether you choose codeigniter or yii the basic integration will be the same

if you employ php frameworks like codeigniter yii maybe even cakephp which have comparatively smaller learning curves you will find your path wellpaved for you in php

so latest codeigniter 2.0 is better than yii according to this benchmarks

you can build apps a lot quicker with yii due to the code-gen and active record but it will be a bit harder to learn than codeigniter

yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

i have worked with codeigniter and yii i prefer yii for developer time and for speed

personally i d say yii might have the edge as it encourages convention more than codeigniter would

should i turn my attention to yii or keep building more codeigniter projects in my portfolio for my first web developer job

joomla can t compare with codeigniter yii

after some time of using codeigniter i found that using yii is more convenient

i am currently looking at yii and while its more complex than codeigniter the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s

i have worked on codeigniter but yii is far more ahead of that

2 yii a bit more structured than codeigniter but you have a basic app up within 10 mins and if your familiar with mvc design its a great way to develop portals incredibly quickly

i don t recommend codeigniter as great and powerful framework but it s simple for beginners and they can learn a lot from it personally i m in favor of symfony and yii

in looking into different frameworks the routing mechanisms they have and the different alternatives employed to make them go faster such as with codeigniter wordpress yii and symphony with alternative caching options how would you do a like-for-like is it possible

i have found one benchmark in which yii is faster than codeigniter and another benchmark in which codeigniter is faster than yii

i prefer yii or codeigniter mostly yii because of its simplicity and nice extensions bootstrap backvendor coco etc


onresume	onpause	8
i unload and reload data upon each onpause onresume it is safer

onresume onpause would have been better off being called oninteractive onpassive

and you should not access vehicledataprovider before onresume in the life cylcle and no more after onpause

as you say the docs do recommend using onresume onpause

focus receives after onresume and lose it after onpause method

technically you can do it dynamically but that would require doing the registration unregistration somewhere more permanent than onresume onpause which i don t think is really what you want.

i can t answer question 1 although i ve noticed that behavior as well but i rarely do much work in my onstop methods i favor onpause and onresume i can help with your 2nd question

i use the slidingtablayout for the tabs and if i am right it prepares the fragmnets near the opened fragment so 1 more reason against the onresume onpause open close


fputcsv	fgetcsv	2
csv handling functions fgetcsv fputcsv are much better for this - they will handle edge cases and will likely be far more reliable than any regex you can come up with

you can make your life easier by using fputcsv and fgetcsv


direct3d	directx	2
i was just searching online for a way to use directx direct3d to take faster screenshots and everyone was talking about getfrontbufferdata and how wonderful it was

directx has a wider scope than opengl in that directx is composed of directsound directplay and direct3d etc


glut	pysdl2	1
i would suggest if you are not forced to use glut to use a more flexible alternative such as pygame pysdl2 or pyqt to create your context instead


migrate	makemigrations	1
as a project grows migrations both makemigrations and migrate take longer and longer delaying quite a lot every deployment


armadillo	openblas	2
armadillo doesn t prevent openblas from using more cores

i wish program with armadillo and openblas is faster than with only armadillo


strdup	calloc	1
he cried. will save the string on the static storage and you will not be able to do most of the function on them you better work with strdup in your function or malloc and calloc to be able to use all the function


mocha	sinon	3
for test suite i d recommend mocha chai sinon and super test

sinon has good integration with chai for making assertions and i wrote a module to integrate sinon with mocha to allow for easier spy stub cleanup to avoid test pollution.

there are also things like chai and sinon that work well with mocha to allow for easier testing


audiotrack	audiorecord	2
there is no need to initialize audiorecord and audiotrack object more than once

then you can use high sample rate in audiotrack and audiorecord to get better sound quality


qfile	qtextstream	1
a qfile may be used by itself or more conveniently with a qtextstream or qdatastream


cocos2d-x	sprite-kit	1
now started porting game from cocos2d-x to sprite-kit as cocos2d-x not offers box2d physics and new version of cocos2d-x 3.0 has less features


selenium	appium	4
iam an automation tester having good experience in selenium automation tool and other tools.now i want to implement mobile automation so i choose appium and started to install but faced number of issues and saw the same issues in several blog to rectify but couldnot.kindly help me and below is the installation which i followed

you can use appium more mobile oriented than selenium and you can use c# to write your tests

does appium or selenium support the older version of windows operating system for mobile

if you really want to use selenium inside an android app you might have better luck with appium


bitblt	gdi	3
when drawing images i found the native bitblt to perform alot better than using .net graphics you could use it to display your bitmap or even use gdi to create the bitmap instead

the thing is that gdi is still faster than direct2d if i draw to a bitmap and after it s done i bitblt the result back to the form it paints at 35ms and with the same graphics quality

will gdi and bitblt be better


solaris	aix	6
the platforms that use struct sockaddr inside struct ifreq also have an ipv6 friendly version struct lifreq that uses struct sockaddr_storage instead for example solaris other platforms such as linux and aix already use the longer structure

from that forum article pwd vs pwd which compares aix 4.2.1 aix 6 sparc solaris 10 and redhat 5 enterprise with this regard

if you really mean unix and not linux i would recommend solaris eclipse does run on solaris and it s much easier to understand than aix

and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

it is compiled on windows and unix systems including somewhat more exotic platforms like aix zlinux solaris and hpux

that would be quite difficult the -i flag in sed additional options in find so getting bash installed on solaris aix might be a better way


domcontentloaded	addeventlistener	2
the javascript addeventlistener domcontentloaded is more watching tags and their good closures to start his job instead of the real full data load

a more superior way is to call addeventlistener in javascript itself on the event domcontentloaded here are more informations


stateless	stateful	21
or in short stateless is better than stateful

but keep in mind that in many cases being stateful or not stateless is no problem and not all stateless applications are by definition better than stateful ones

so because stateless components are easier to keep bug-free the rule of thumb when working with react is to have as few stateful components as possible and to keep those in the top of the component hierarchy

dealing with a stateless cluster is often simpler then dealing with a stateful cluster

a stateful service is typically harder to develop and scale than stateless services

while this is much less convenient than stateful wicket i still find much better than say stateless jsf or struts

for certain kinds of transactions a stateless session may perform slightly faster than a stateful session

i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires

anyhow gwt and many other modern toolkits silverlight talking to wcf seems to prefer stateful client stateless server due to scaleability issues

they prefer stateless vs stateful sessions to avoid session migration session tracking etc

if you want to develop high traffic distributed apps that can scale tens hundreds thousands of nodes prefer stateless frameworks over component based stateful ones

one thing i ve learned over the years is that stateless trumps stateful for maintainability

while a lot of development has been done with stateless connections to solve most problems sometimes it s just simpler with stateful connections

service to build drools knowledge and get session i prepared a stateless engine lighter than the stateful one

but note that while stateful isn t used much these days it usually makes more sense to opt-in for stateless sessionscope is much more universal and fits into nearly any session-based scenario

in ejb3 there is no such thing as stateless is better than stateful session beans

the restful services are rather thin and completely stateless whereas the admin console is stateful and has more interactive functionality and therefore more memory and processing required

i could also see the argument especially in the java world where stateless and stateful beans are much more well defined

that being said idiomatic react greatly favors stateful components housing stateless components

do you have any situation where stateful is more appropriate than stateless

stateless ejb are faster then stateful ejb


rtp	rtcp	4
the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast rtcp generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via rtp multicast only sender reports are generated

the f indicates an rtp profile where the timing of rtcp feedback is more relaxed

then select rtp from the protocol list for the appropriate stream and rtcp for the other one if applicable and then wireshark will show the packets as being rtp and you ll be able to see the packet info

internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.

avro	thrift	6
the main difference between avro and thrift is that thrift is statically typed while avro uses a more dynamic approach

also it is worth mentioning that besides thrift protobuf and avro there are some more solutions on the market such as capt n proto or bolt

3 updates if required will be more challenging with avro thrift

but avro offers far more than just doing away with the need for your own writables although that is in my view a considerable plus it offers fairly efficient serialization the choice between serializing against generated entity classes like thrift requires or using a so-called genericrecord structure instead and not having to have tagged data

if there is lot of data exchange then a binary format like protobuf or thrift or avro is better

if you are developing your hbase application in java i recommend using the raw hbase api - that is more powerful than thrift rest avro etc


quanteda	tidytext	1
the quanteda package is faster and more straightforward than tm and works nicely with tidytext as well


ng-include	ng-init	1
generally speaking ng-init and ng-include feel more like last-resort sort of directives


labwindows	cvi	1
but still labwindows cvi is more targeted for a test environments where e.g temperature controller measurement equipment needs to be controlled


onreadystatechange	onload	1
it looks like the onload function is a more modern convenience method and the old way of checking the result is using onreadystatechange instead


screens	mdpi	25
since the screens size is larger than the common mdpi screens sizes 320x480 the text size looks smaller in this emulator

a ldpi image on a hdpi screens would appear smaller than the same image on a mdpi or ldpi screens

so these circles on a xhdpi screens will be visually smaller than on an mdpi screens where pixels are bigger

the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange

if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

do note that a 120x120px image if displayed on the screens will be 3x smaller on a xxhdpi device compared to a mdpi device as there are three times as many pixels per inch

so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so it s not a big deal

i don t know how many screens today are still ldpi and mdpi but i want to support smaller screens while still looking good on large screens even large screens that are lower density

i read in some tutorials that android automatically scales up the images when the screens resolution is bigger than mdpi

in other words the if these were real phones the mdpi would have a bigger screens allthough both have the same resolution

addressing issue #2 if your mdpi phone has a smaller screens than 600dp it will use the layout in res layout folder

even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio

in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app

it s source density like if designer draw for mdpi for example screens resolution is 320x480 and give you images in this density you need choose mdpi

try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

i have used this link to generate nine-patch images however even if i add the files to the drawable ldpi mdpi ldpi xhdpi and xxhdpi folders the image is still shorter than the screens width

a hdpi image on a ldpi screens would appear larger than the same image on a mdpi or hdpi screens

proportionally the hdpi screens is slightly taller than the mdpi screens

if device screens destiny is more than mdpi - use default values folder

if in java code the values would be in pixels so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screens

i put my pictures in the drawable folder which on a xhdpi screens like mine will cause android to upsample everything twice to match xhdpi against mdpi and will result in a 400 memory usage twice the width and twice the height so 4 times as many pixels


preorder	inorder	1
especially look at the last two results for longer strings for which the preorder inorder approach is much faster than brute force


cvs	rcs	1
unless you get warped into the past and trapped there i wouldn t recommend rcs or cvs


gprof	callgrind	1
i think you will very much prefer callgrind to gprof


mathml	tex	3
i want to type tex equations in onenote send them to mathtype which converts it to mathml and has a more feature-rich editor and send them back afterwards

i read this post any reason to favor mathml syntax over tex in mathjax

change the radio button to select mathml or tex and your preferred standard


pandas	xlrd	2
i m using python and can t decide which of xlrd xlwt or pandas would be more useful

i wasn t sure if pandas or xlrd would be more suitable to do this


directx	direct2d	1
if there s any chance to have item count ranging in thousands - i d recommend using directx or direct2d


gson	xstream	2
if you use case is rendering arrays and other object graphs in human readable form you may go for templating solution like velocity of freemarker or convert them to json or xml and rpetty pring it - i would recommend gson xstream for this task

gson is more about json-based persistence in the vein of xstream which can do json too and sounds a bit too heavyweight for just an applet


operands	decrement	1
i need to group the primes number partially to perform changes to frequency reducing the stages assuring the increment or numerator is greater than decrement or denominator to avoid the undersampling problem preferred small operands


factors	mean	8
the problem is that when the zoom factors is increased to more than 1 the scrollbars are lost on richtextbox but the content is getting edited but not visible i mean the content is below the visible screen once the zoom is set back to normal i can see the content and scroll bars again could you please suggest what i am required to do to get the things right

try a different rate factors -crf 30 higher numbers mean uglier picture quality but also smaller file size

if your growth factors is larger than the golden mean that can t happen

additionally the lowest possible big-o doesn t necessarily mean there aren t faster algorithms with better constant factors

if the factors is larger than the golden mean they never will

if the factors is smaller than the golden mean 1.6 and the previous allocations are contiguous with each other they ll eventually add up to a chunk that can satisfy a later requirement

note that this does not mean that the largest prime factors is less than sqrt n but that if there is a prime factors greater than sqrt n there is only one such prime factors

you can normalize data that is already normally distributed for example take data for average length of human beings 180 centimeter and scale every number by a factors so that the mean becomes less than 1 multiply every length by 1 180


asterisk	pbx	2
disclaimer i recommend read asterisk book like asterisk the future of telephony before creating any design of application with use of asterisk pbx

i need a sip server hopefully simpler more efficient and more secure than asterisk or other full-featured pbx to just terminate sip calls and play audio based on the incoming number


notepad	textpad	3
you could use notepad or textpad but i use and recommend scite

as it happens my choice is textpad but just about anything which is more advanced than notepad ought to be able to do this

on windows machine i would probably go with textpad personally i now use programmers notepad 2 however it does not support a spell checker and i don t really thinks it s better than textpad by any measure


bash	zsh	27
since i prefer bash zsh scripts i did the following

zsh is more extensible and has a much greater focus on searching and completion than bash

note there are many more differences between zsh and bash

can i configure zsh to behave more like bash on that

you could define aliases or functions for your shell probably bash but i recommend zsh

gnu bash zsh fish have more features so are more complex

so no big surprise zsh being better than bash

you ll find that the bourne shell sh and shells derived from it such as ksh bash and zsh behave much more consistently

i recommend using zsh instead of bash

my stackoverflow search indicates that it can be turned off by setting setopt nonomatch then zsh behaves more like bash glob the pattern and pass it to the program if no match is found

update turns out that zsh implementation based on builtin compctl is much simpler than the bash implementation based on builtin complete

in bash or zsh you have many more but always be aware that you are using such extension because some systems have simpler shell installed as bin sh and some usually other unix flavours than linux or embedded systems systems don t have bash at all

you can check user shell in etc passwd and change it with chsh -s path to new shell - list of allowed shells is available in etc shells - but make sure to pick bash zsh also note that links like sh- bash will not work as bash changes behavior based on the name that was invoked

however bash has useful interactive features dash does not zsh is still better imho

why i prefer zsh z shell to bash

in bourne-derived shells newer than ksh bash zsh you can combine the assignment and export

i prefer zsh over bash because of its support for very powerful file globbing variable expansion modifiers and faster tab completion

note that you ll never get behavior that exactly matches zsh one with bash only

i ve seen a lot of people recommend zsh over bash for ruby development and i m failing to understand what zsh offers over bash

how can you get similar highlightings to zsh s less than bash s less in ubuntu

i figure i should prefer learning bash s behavior inside-out before delving into how zsh ticks but this isn t really ideal because chances are at least half of the io redirection i expect to be doing will be spur-of-the-moment hacks that i surely will want to try from the zsh prompt

if your shell is bash or ksh or zsh it s much safer and easier to build up a command with an array rather than a string

if using a decently recent version of bash or zsh it s much simpler

if i run bash instead of zsh the special characters are working home end next work etc... but i still don t have propre support of accented characters prints ï ½ and i d really prefer using zsh

it seems that zsh is more configurable than bash but also more complicated

perhaps someone more familiar with bash zsh osx can make more sense of this

the syntax is used in bash and ksh and zsh i believe to more easily allow for embedding escape sequences in strings


onstart	ondestroy	1
instead of hooking into keypress events and such perhaps working with the built-in events like onpause onstart ondestroy etc is more suited to your needs


atomikos	bitronix	2
setup a standalone jta transaction manager like atomikos bitronix etc i d pick atomikos for its documentation

personally i d choose bitronix or atomikos


scons	autotools	1
edit i was hoping not to turn this into another flame war but i guess that s inevitable so i will just say that i have considerably more experience with autotools and no desire to learn cmake or scons or imake or ant although i seem pretty much stuck with the latter when working with java these days or whatever new tool is invented next year or the year after


hash-collision	key	7
also as sellibitze says an operator is needed to compare key in case of hash-collision

the more hash-collision you have the worse the performance of hash maps because much of the hash maps good performance relies on as few as possible key in the same hash buckets

it will only really matter if you have lots of hash-collision since then the get key call gets slower than o 1 - it gets o k with k being the number of entries in the same bucket the number of key with same hash code or a different hash code which gets still mapped to the same bucket - this depends on the capacity size and load factor of the map as well

but if your key space is vastly larger than the number of targets you ll have a sizable number of hash-collision where you ll have to check if the target stored there is really the key you re looking

when you get a hash-collision the hash table falls back to using string.equals to compare key while searching the selected hash chain

if not md5 would also be suitable for this purpose since you are concatenating the bucket and path and using the hash to provide better key distribution not uniqueness so you have no hash-collision concerns

hash code of key to make hash-collision harder to find


carrierwave	fog	2
one more example with gem fog and heroku configuration for carrierwave with amazon s3 hosted on heroku

i ve read that carrierwave is much faster without using fog


wordpress	phpbb	1
a typical lamp application like wordpress or phpbb runs more than 10 queries per pageview without problems


http.sys	httplistener	1
and also don t forget - http.sys much more customizable than httplistener


profiler	visualvm	5
one option is to use visualvm however a commercial profiler like yourkit may handle larger memory sizes better

i recommend using a profiler such as visualvm to get a more granular view on what s going on

you might be better off with a profiler like visualvm or chronon

i don t know much about profiler in netbeans but i d prefer visualvm

i suggest you try increasing your maximum to just under half your main memory and attach a profiler visualvm is better than nothing and see if where objects are being retained


concurrenthashmap	readwritelock	1
the other question why not use a concurrenthashmap here since it will provide some concurrent writes to different mapentries and provide more concurrency than readwritelock


mouseout	mouseleave	24
i prefer using mouseleave and mouseenter then mouseover and mouseout

also see i ve replaced mouseout with mouseleave which should work better than mouseout text will not jump up and down

there can be times when mouseout is a better choice than mouseleave

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

but mouseout and mouseleave both cause the larger image to instantly fadeout

i tried changing the event but sagepay overrides all these events blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu

val css html text data width height offset blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

umask	sudo	1
if you forget to use this and your default umask is more restrictive or less restrictive then you will need to re-run the non- sudo


cut	dash	1
the smaller the dash symbol is the better results you will get the existing api code doesn t seem to cut off the symbol at the final vertex of a polyline segment and doesn t seem to account for the section of the symbol that went past the polyline after the vertex


fgets	strcmp	1
i think fgets will read line with lf at the end - compare strcmp command exit n


fuzzywuzzy	difflib	1
fuzzyset is much faster than fuzzywuzzy difflib for both indexing and searching

valgrind	callgrind	3
nevertheless various profiling callgrind tool in valgrind cpu profiling google-perfutils and perf doesn t find those debugging symbols resulting in more or less useless output

ps i think that writing script is easier than hacking valgrind plugin callgrind with adding several counters for every instruction type

i can recommend valgrind callgrind tool in conjunction with kcachegrind for visualization


redeclaration	ivar	1
this redeclaration allows a cleaner way to access and mutate the property internally without resorting to fragile ivar synthesis which is becoming an antiquity now that the compiler does it for you


kivy	vispy	1
i didn t try it because i m more familiar with kivy s internals and because my end goal was more of a kivy app containing vispy visualisations rather than the other way around


dynamic-languages	compiled-language	1
because you can determine what code in a compiled-language is likely to do better than a dynamic-languages it has been determined more error free to use a compiled perspective for more things so as you can see with the availability of offset-management and lookup compiled behavior given to you in core perl there is no reason to mess with the symbol table if you don t have to


moq	fakeiteasy	2
fakeiteasy seems to have an overall nicer syntax than moq like the strongly-typed way the former deals with passing parameters to a constructor of a faked class

btw why do you want to use fakeiteasy it looks to me less powerful than moq


wtforms	formencode	1
i also recommend wtforms it s much easier to use than formencode and have builtin sqlalchemy extensions


icu	gettext	1
i would highly recommend using icu instead of gettext and the locale stuff offered by the standard library if you are developing a commercial application


getelementsbytagname	htmlcollection	1
since an id is unique and the methods getelementsbytagename or getelementsbytagname returns a live htmlcollection it s better if you use these elements as unique variables so you won t ask your browser to fetch them many times


pdfbox	pdflib	1
edit 31 march 2014 for what it s worth i have found that pdfbox is much better at text extraction than itextsharp notwithstanding a bespoke strategy implementation and pdflib tet is slightly better than pdfbox but it s quite expensive


maven-shade-plugin	pom.xml	1
this is a lot more pom.xml code but i like it better than the maven-shade-plugin because it does just what i want and nothing more


cdr	cons	3
when dealing with lists think of car as the first element of the list and cdr as the rest of the elements and cons adds one more element at the head of the list - that element can be anything including another list

hons generally runs slower than cons because in creating a hons an attempt is made to see whether a hons already exists with the same car and cdr

as a practical matter a cons is simpler than a list so you can get the value with a straight cdr rather than the conceptually more complex cadr the car of the cdr


react-virtualized	fixed-data-table	1
for this particular case i would recommend react-virtualized or fixed-data-table as mentioned by others


sugar.js	underscore.js	1
i recommend using underscore.js or sugar.js for common tasks like this


leaflet	rmaps	1
possibly part of the reason of my problems is that the original code from ramnath uses rmaps while i m using rcharts also developed by ramnath as it is more developed better integrated with shiny and of course includes leaflet


associativity	operator-precedence	2
you need to use associativity and compare operator-precedence

taking java s operator-precedence notably that + has higher precedence than and associativity rules into account the expression is equivalent to


background-image	background-position	3
instead using css you have a lot more control with background-image background-size and background-position

background-position will align a smaller photo to the bottom of a larger element but when the background photo is larger than the element it keeps the top of the background-image aligned with the top of the container

i m not familiar with the particular problem you describe and i don t know whether there is some specific fix for it but one workaround is using background-image background-position which is easier to fine-tune


glut	qglwidget	1
first of all qglwidget does everything glut does plus more


xlsb	xlsm	1
but i heard that xlsb loads way faster than xlsm so i would not like to change the fileformat


ivar	subclassing	1
if i have a class hierarchy in which subclassing require use of more specific types than those specified in the superclass ivars is it better to declare the superclass ivar as id or to type it and then cast where necessary in the subclassing


mouse	trackpad	5
if you ignore timing the os may decimate mouse motion debounce buttons rearrange the order of motion and clicks ignore keypresses while the trackpad is in use etc

choose mouse trackpad from the options on the left

let s boil your trouble down to this if the mouse is over #inner you can t use the usual methods spacebar arrow keys trackpad wheel to scroll #outer up and down

unfortunately the trackpad s scrolling deltas are orders of magnitude higher than a mouse s so the scroll speed is psychotically high

the trackpad is much more sensitive and can get the breakpoint increment correctly but the mouse wheel ends up scrolling through the section much quicker without correctly keeping up with the proper frame rate so i never end up reach the final frame by the end of the section


uibezierpath	uiimage	1
the uibezierpath class seems easier to use so how could i get that drawing in a uiimage


exif	xmp	1
why one may select to write exif metadata and somebody else may select xmp


dplyr	rlang	1
hadley wickham released a fundamentally new version of dplyr with a new underbelly called rlang which provides a more consistent framework for non-standard evaluation


qgraphicsscene	qabstractitemmodel	1
so which approach would you choose qabstractitemmodel authoritative - qabstractitemview- qgraphicsscene or alternatively qgraphicsscene authoritative - qabstractitemmodel- other views


laravel	yii	8
because i choose laravel 4 after learned yii i recommend laravel

instead i would recommend laravel as it s such an amazing framework but you should also try out cakephp symfony yii or something else which is still being developed

i ve been a senior full stack developer for +3 years and mainly i use yii for php development but i was told that laravel is better so i decided to build an ecommerce script with laravel to get to know laravel more and to see the difference between yii and laravel

according to my experience yii is easy to use but it has some pros and cons too every framework has but i used laravel on some projects and i think laravel is much more better than yii

this guy wrote a book on yii and now he prefers laravel

yii is good but laravel can do better than it

developers community it might seem that laravel has a larger community of developers but during my career with yii i ve found no bottleneck of having a question without an answer

we have a huge app built on yii sadly - i d much prefer laravel but it s too late now


whenever	resque	1
the sitemap generator recommends whenever but i am assuming resque scheduler can accomplish the same thing don t want to install another gem if i don t have to


wicket	stripes	2
if your requirement is for a more traditional web application then compare click with struts stripes wicket tapestry etc

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


fputs	gets	2
you can choose fputs if you re worried about the ending newline that automatically gets added in puts

gets and puts were supposed to be used for simple input output from the terminal whereas fgets and fputs are more general and provide finer control you can specify the stream and they do not perform any implicit linefeed handling


armadillo	blitz++	1
there is speed comparison too click compare blitz++ armadillo boost multiarray


marathon	aurora	2
even though aurora has better capabilities i prefer marathon due to auroras complexity overhead and lack of ui for control api

if you want to schedule basic workloads based on containers you might be better off with marathon or in the future maybe aurora

wma	speex	1
speex is designed for speech and should perform better than wma mp3 or other audio codecs that are designed to handle music if you are just encoding speech which i assume since you are grabbing from the mic


build.gradle	gradlew	15
then modify the test junit run debug configuration in the bottom down before launch there s gradle-aware make in it + another section select gradlew task select project build.gradle file it is in and type copytestclasses

i use gradlew and want to create a string in my build.gradle which goes over more than one line to make it more readable

select build.gradle file of some other gradlew project

select gradlew â refresh gradlew project from the context menu of the project or from your build.gradle file for that

i double checked the build.gradle s and synced the gradlew files once more

i naively assumed that gradlew is better than ivy then when i created my build.gradle the dependency management is even greater mess than of ivy s for the first look

then i go rightclick on build.gradle and select gradlew and then refresh gradlew

although build.gradle has a higher priority so the value in androidmanifest.xml will be ignored by gradlew while building your application

question is there a way to define conditional dependency in the build.gradle or another settings file so that a particular gradlew version is used for the build process that is ensured to be in compliance with the available java version either 1.6 or 1.8 either by manual definition or better by letting gradlew decide which version of itself to use

when i right click on the build.gradle file and choose run as gradlew build gradlew build i get an error that says gradlew installation is not correctly configured go to window - preferences - gradlew enide and configure the correct location

you should choose gradlew becouse only this way the ide will properly find and use build.gradle files

with the build path set up that way you can let buildship update manage the eclipse-project settings instead of asking gradlew to do it after making a change to build.gradle right-click on the project and choose gradlew refresh gradlew project

open your build.gradle file and then add line at top that these lines here you must choose build gradlew version according to your sdk

i assume that this code running only on linux terminal so i open android studio choose open an existing android studio project then i went d abs_library actionbarsherlock and choose build.gradle so it s asked me to locate gradlew home even when i choose androidmanifest.xml

just open your build.gradle file from the side menu on the left open gradlew scripts then choose build.gradle that has module app written next to it and change the property minsdkversion and set it to 14 for example and you ll be good to go


uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar	2
the framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in size

the ardalahmet solution is not the right one if you need different backgrounds for each uinavigationbar when you have more than one uinavigationcontroller such as in a uitabbar because it using uinavigationbar categories


beanstalk	amazon-web-services	10
the folks here tried it and recommend amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk instead

if you are big into java grails jruby etc +mysql+ tomcat development nothing beats amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

if you want to deploy and test live i recommend amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk or ec2

your best bet is to approach cycle.io with that question and ask which mysql solution best integrates with their product or choose amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk is a great service for running docker containers and can provide a mysql instance as an data layer

one of the deployment options they recommend is amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

for generic java applications i would recommend amazon-web-services if the costs associated with beanstalk and rds are not too high

though i recommend using amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk over ec2 that s the service you are using now if i got it right it provides you an easy interface to deploy you web-server with no ssh interference and keeps it alive at all times after deployment and also gives you some other load balancing and auto scaling features with minimum effort

i have successfully deploy pm2 on amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk it has more than one way to achieve

unless you have requirements to use cloudformation directly i would recommend using amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk and the amazon-web-services console to setup your vpc and deploy your application

maybe the amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk are a better place for your needs


appfog	cloudfoundry	1
you can purchase cloudfoundry as service from pivotal or appfog


turbogears	web2py	1
web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears


leaflet	proj	3
ggmaps used for simplicity - for more ambitious proj i would recommend leaflet

it is my guess that your prior leaflet proj had more preceding code than this and address.lon was defined in it

while leaflet aims to be more lightweight than openlayers openlayers is by far the more mature proj


jpopupmenu	jmenuitem	1
the jpopupmenu has this behavior but i need more than just jmenuitem


bots	chatterbot	1
i initially was using chatterbot s default storage adapter and after training with all data the bots took more than a minute to respond to simple message like hello


org.json	jackson	8
for parsing json i d recommend using jackson or gson rather than the org.json library

org.json jackson and gson with gson being 10x slower

quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson

or switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jackson

for 1 see this benchmark i did using jmh which compares jackson gson genson fastjson org.json jsonp performance of serializers and deserializers using stream and databind apis

p.s. my recommendation would be to remove jsonobject conversion and instead return an object of actual class as internally spring uses jackson which is more powerful json framework then org.json

in this case jackson performs better than nashorn which performs much better than org.json

well sometimes performance and usability can be at odds but i ve found gson to be easier to use than alternatives like jackson org.json and others


tunnel	vpn	3
if you absolutely must connect to a database hosted on the cellular network end i would suggest you try setting up a vpn openvpn is a good product available on many platforms or using a reverse tunnel it s simpler but you will need to setup the reverse tunnel everytime you want to access remote database

and between we are just looking to send and receive data over tunnel there is nothing more or need to control computer on the network all we need is to route data through corporate firewall and should support multiple vpn servers such as cisco microsoft etc

on the other hand the secure tunnel created in a vpn is far more secure than remote desktop


abstract-class	superclass	3
for example you want to use abstract-class in such a case that each of the subclassing is a more specific type of its abstract superclass fruit apple orange banana grape strawberries etc. and you want to use non-abstract superclass in a relationship such as dad and son

you can think of extends from a superclass if the derived class is of the same type.i mean that when a class extends an abstract-class they both should be of the same type the only difference being that the superclass has a more general behavior and the sub class has a more specific behavior

while it is a debated recommendation to favor composition over inherited my view is to ensure that an abstract-class devoid of abstract methods is not simply a convenient container for methods convenient to subclassing but instead that each subclassing could stand in for its superclass


rtos	qnx	2
qnx is most famous for being the real time operating system of which there are two versions qnx rtos v4 is an older product but is still used in many existing systems and still supported by the company

an rtos such as os 9 or qnx would be more suited as these can operate more like a gpos in the sense of loading and executing independently linked executables


backgrounding	multitasking	2
it s also a bit difficult for me to imagine why your app cares about battery if it isn t running but maybe that is my failure of imagination. recommend reading backgrounding execution and multitasking in the appledocs

btw multitasking is really more fast switching than backgrounding in ios.


mod-alias	mod-rewrite	1
evidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equal of course


jspinner	documentfilter	1
notice by using documentfilter output from jformattedtextfield or jspinner java internally to hold dot as ascii decimal separator there is only difference betweens view and model swing document in compare with documentfilter there is returned changed grouping space and separator too


bids	ssas	1
ssas performance tuning is not my strong suit but i would recommend bids helper for validating and optimizing aggregations as well as overall dimension design


picasso	fresco	3
you can choose between picasso vs fresco vs glide vs universal-image-loader

use picasso glide or fresco to load images inside those cards picasso and glide are easier to use compared to fresco but fresco is better with memory

see picasso v s imageloader v s fresco vs glide for more guidance


ravendb	couchdb	1
ravendb more than couchdb but that s neither here nor there


websphere	ibm	20
i would recommend ibm redbooks websphere application server v8.5

buy ibm websphere mq mqseries

new server integration - ibm webpshere 8.x application server - on this computer - jvm ibm version 1.6.0 jit compiler 64bit jvm - wait for a connection from jprofiler gui - select websphere server.xml with vm parameters added above now reflecting in it - jprofiler port 8849 - yes start the session and wait for the application server - finish

now you can choose install and you can select ibm websphere sdk java technology edition optional from the list of available packages

select ibm websphere mq service and open the properties by double clicking on the service

select websphere application server version x.x in ibm section

as stated by martin service is a crucial part of why people purchase ibm websphere products and btw

alternatively i think you should also be able to write something that uses jmx to read specific things about websphere state and there is at least one sophisticated monitoring tool you could purchase ibm tivoli composite application manager itcam for application diagnostics which can monitor websphere internals

if you work for big enterprise company - i would recommend ibm websphere 7 portal otherwise i recommend you to consider jboss and liferay

select ibm websphere sdk java technology edition version 7.0

other solution is to upgrade websphere with newer libraries as per ibm websphere upgrade service instructions

ibm makes it easier for those who can t afford websphere application developer or rational application developer which are both eclipse flavour to use eclipse

i moved some .lib files from c program files x86 ibm websphere mq tools lib to c python27 libs and it compiled well

if you are trying to install websphere application server through installation manager then you need to select ibm sdk provided with websphere application server

oracle s other application server weblogic still doesn t even fully support java ee 7 - both they and ibm seem to have similar strategies of maintaining stability in their full-fat releases while being more bleeding edge with glassfish for oracle and the liberty profile for ibm s websphere

websphere development studio v7 wdsc is older than ibm i 6.1 your build date is 2007 the article you re referencing came out in 2008

it only adds some more java ee capabilities ejb and so on and of course the ibm sausage over it so i wouldn t expect websphere to be much faster than tomcat

migration between different versions of websphere might be somewhat more tricky but i m sure ibm published at least one redbook on that topic

so to me the choices are actually sun s jvm unless i ve to run some websphere stuff in which case i d choose ibm j9

this ibm technote has more details on the signals part what is a signal and why does this matter for websphere application server


csv	tsv	11
proto buffer and avro is better than than csv tsv file in terms of size but data is in non human readable format

be careful with writing as csv because your second column now has comma in it so tsv may be better

i think that generally csv are supported more often than the tsv format

it seems you could use tsv instead of csv to produce easier to visualise columns separated by tab

i d recommend using csv tsv to store data as relational tables otherwise you can get into a bit of messy outputs

tsv tab separated values so the built-in csv module is more than enough to export your data

also your csv looks more like a tsv tab separated instead of comma separated

then here you can select csv or tsv format

if my guess is incorrect please edit your question and add the missing information column separators number of columns... note that the tsv and csv format is trickier than it seems

that s why i always pick csv tsv format

right-click on the graph and select save data as... you can choose csv or tsv


glmnet	predict	1
the predict function for a glmnet is more than likely just predict.glmnet


qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	5
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent

if i set a pixmap to a qgraphicsscene that is larger that the window it will add scrollbars so is it possible to get what is displayed in the qgraphicsview

generaly qgraphicsscene better using with connection qgraphicsview

by default when you scale a qgraphicsscene larger than the qgraphicsview in which it is displayed it will show the necessary scroll bars

so i switched to qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview that seems much simpler to use with animations


testng	unitils	1
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take


onchange	keyup	1
however even though i have tried the javascript and jquery events onclick onchange select keyup i can t make it work


docx	xlsx	2
this is typically not a problem but docx and xlsx files are more sensitive to this extra byte

these reps are given read-only access to the libraries as to not change the documents posted by management however we find that if management uploads an office 07 document either docx or xlsx to be more specific the reps cannot open the file unless we give them higher either add edit or even delete permissions


organization	naming	1
code with specific organization providing a simpler interface for different tasks and making it easier to integrate programmers in a project just by naming it


email	dkim	3
i d recommend dkim support at the mta level so all your server generated email for a given domain is signed by default

4 some email providers might mark that email as spam however most spam checks are based on spf and dkim checks more than email existence checks

other advice is to ensure that you have done as much as possible to avoid being flagged as spam such as setup spf record and dkim and also read up on how to create email that are less likely to be treated as spam


valgrind	tcmalloc	1
try tcmalloc you are looking for a heap profiler although valgrind might be more useful initially


memcached	apc	32
memcached is in-memory too and a bit slower than apc

you want to compare apc key-value store vs memcached right

on a single server setup i am assuming apc would be better then memcached for this

apc gives you some more functionality than memcached

memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects

you have apc xcache eaccelerator and zend platform . and data caching session variable userland - we recommend memcached

i would choose option 1 for better performances apc or memcached are faster storage than filesystem and for having more control on what s happening in your project

my experience say that apc is nearly 7-8 times faster than memcached

better use apc on apache server it will be much faster than memcached because you don t need to make a tcp ip call to connect to memcached

doctrine2 doc recommends apc memcached xcache for both metadata cache and query cache reference

it s slower than apc but it s faster than memcached redis etc

to speed this up you can choose memcached redis or apc

if you have access to memcached or apc on your webhost some shared plans disable this functionality look them up as they are considered fairly high-performance forms of caching as it utilizes the system memory directly memcached is more suited for distributed systems

in any case i would recommend using memcached or apc as the laravel docs say

i would recommend memcached or apc

memcached has more functionality but is intended for distributed environments while apc works on single servers only

memcached is faster than apc as zend_cache backend but you still need apc extension installed even in development mode to get a great speedup of your code

apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs

a quick googling says that apc is 5 times faster than memcached

memcached is more along the lines of a distributed object cache vs something like apc or xcache which stores php bytecode in memory so you avoid having to parse it each time

redis is the default for production performance would be fairly similar to memcached but without the volatility and cdbcache is the default for other environments with the ability to choose apc if they have it or file if all else fails

as you know apc is much more faster than memcached if we re fetching keys from a single server

the big caveat here is that apc generally has less memory available for storage though. default being 32mb memcached s big adavantage is that while still fast it s distributed so if you have multiple servers running they could share this data

memcached is more for caching database queries and improving performance in that regard while apc is more for improving performance of php code

apc is faster on a single server - but memcached is distributed

if you site is located on single box you will get much better results with apc which unlike memcached is not distributed by nature

memcached around 4-5 times slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touched everywhere in my environment

if everything works use apc or memcached instead of files files usually work great but apc memc are faster

please don t mention memcached i am already using it but it is not suitable as direct replacement of apc because i am doing many apc_fetch calls because apc is much faster than memcached for this purpose

apc is more an opcode caching system than a key value memory database like memcached altough it can be greatly used for both purposes

in my case apc is 59 times faster than memcached

apc access is a bit faster something like 5 times faster than memcached if i remember correctly as it s only local -- no network involved


persistent	transient	3
my intuition is that transient properties would incurr less overhead than persistent properties because they do not need to be persistent and read from the database so converting them to persistent properties will likely only make things slightly worse

memcache data lives in memory and isn t persistent so is for more transient data

first i have a transient property called sectionidentifier .this could be now next and past depend on the current time.i added a new persistent property next to this transient called sectionid


goose	boilerpipe	1
2 readability library content is passable slower on average than goose but faster than boilerpipe


nspopover	nsbrowser	1
in addition i d like to display the list in an nspopover as i do on ios and placing an nsoutlineview or a nsbrowser inside a nspopover might look less than elegant


xrange	enumerate	5
if you measure properly you ll see there s essentially no difference enumerate is microscopically faster than xrange in this example but well within noise

enumerate is also more appropriate than xrange

i m not sure that one way or the other enumerate or xrange will be significantly faster or better since i think lists store their length in a variable so it can be quickly accessed without counting through the list elements

why is enumerate slower than xrange + lst i

enumerate is more pythonic but xrange is fine here too


caffe	mxnet	1
i like caffe but the amount of gpu memory caffe use is larger than mxnet i test in resnet-50 with mxnet-memonger


glfw	glew	2
i particularly prefer glfw + glew

if you are a noob then i don t think that starting with mesa running on any kind of vm is a good idea.mesa setup is pretty complex in general.also mesa opengl is outdated.it supports up to 3.2 version atm.if you want to get started with opengl the right and clean way you should better setup context with libs like glut or glfw and load gl extension with glew there are more


super	self	9
you should call init on super and update self more details here

unless you have super -calls involved or more generally subclasses that override x and call directly to a.x self as part of their override s implementation looking for the first item in type self .mro that has an x attribute would work --

compare self valueforkey key or self valueforkeypath keypath or just self outletname with the passed in value after the call through to super

as i commented in the code queue.dequeue self can be written more pythonically using the super builtin

i think a.__init__ self x is better then super .__init__ x because it supports multiple inheritance and i didn t find a way to do it with super

normally you can just call parent class methods directly by doing parent.foo self ... but in case of multiple inheritance super is much more useful

the second correct class doesn t even seem to inherent since it has no super .__init__ even worse it is setting up a method that is never even called paintevent self event which takes an argument that seemingly comes from nowhere

one quick solution to this might be to subclass nsslider nsslidercell and override the mouse dragging machinery to call super then post a custom nssliderdidchangetemporaryvalue or whatever name you choose notification with self as the object

also as stated by martijn pieters using super super .__str__ is better than doing it the way i did deck.__str__ self


symfony	kohana	5
of the big ones codeigniter kohana zend cake symfony i think the newer zend has the best support for restful webservices but earlier versions of zend framework had woefully lacking rest controllers

the documentation sucks but it s very lightweight there s a good community even on so it s more simple than symfony and more powerful than codeigniter the first version of kohana was based on codeigniter

i would use xpath with simplexml or domdocument depending on my needs although kohana might offer something better like zend does with zend_dom_query or symfony does with sfwebbrowser both of which let you use a querys similar to jquery s css selectors

i would go with kohana over symfony because kohana is much easier to understand out of the box and doesn t require any special setup to work with

+1 for symfony and another i d like to recommend is kohana built on codeigniter


qtextstream	qdatastream	1
a qfile may be used by itself or more conveniently with a qtextstream or qdatastream


wordpress	joomla	24
i am not a great wordpress user myself i prefer joomla but my client is needing his site to work right in wordpress

i speak of great experience in this area as i have developed my own cms over a cumulation of years and selling the cms becomes even much tougher as joomla wordpress and drupal have a price point that you cannot complete with

if you know php - server side language then you can make wordpress joomla etc websites which are some of cms - content management system also if you wanna make blogger websites then grab some blogger template and customize it and same can go with wordpress you can grab wordpress template and customize it as per you requirement or need

while wordpress is great the simplicity of it gets the better of it joomla is far more flexible and has a huge support network and extensions library

joomla and wordpress are easier to configure but not as customizable as drupal is

yes but if joomla is any example of how hard it is to implement a complex custom website with oop then wordpress is far easier and quicker and time is money

i seem to be getting the impression that wordpress is more popular than joomla nowadays

looking into cms s like wordpress drupal or joomla would be a better option as compared to have it on file system although i would like to point out that those cms s are capable for more than just serving static pages

bigger better than wordpress you re typically looking at joomla or drupal there are others these are just the most common ones

you have to realize that this is a common probelm with joomla and wordpress as i explained to you in my other answer to your another question here is joomla 2.5 much faster than joomla 1.5 querywise

i am good at wordpress and have far more knowledge then i have regarding drupal or joomla

imho wordpress is better do work and customize than joomla

i prefer it over wordpress and specially over joomla

yes joomla takes more time in cooking the resulting html when compared to wordpress

is this is the case wordpress or joomla might be better starting points

imho creating templates for joomla is the easier than most other cms i know typo wordpress modx as you simply have to replace parts of the static version with joomla tags menu content etc. it still needs some time to get used to the system but its not that hard

me too don t get any advantages for joomla it s big system and it just as good as wordpress for regular projects just wordpress is much simplier

but drupal i believe is more powerful than wordpress and joomla

if that will solved later than wordpress menu is better than joomla

anyway it should be a good choice if you are a fan if microsoft but if you are not i strongly recommend using wordpress drupal or joomla

i mean it came as a surprise to me that drupal is so much faster than wordpress and joomla

bitnami for xampp installs the application you select wordpress drupal and or joomla

drupal makes it easier for the developer to accomplish much more complex tasks than joomla or wordpress

although i prefer wordpress over joomla the acymailing solution is great and has worked successfully for several clients of mine


neoload	blazemeter	1
for load testing jmeter is better option but you have quite enough funding then go for loadrunner neoload rational performance tester and for cloud try blazemeter


postgresql	mysql	331
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes

mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way

db is irrelevant but id prefer postgresql sql server mysql in that order

just having both mysql and sphinx on your system doesn t guarantee this - the best way to check is to use mysql as your app database just temporarily - i prefer postgresql too check that sphinx indexes fine with that setup then you can be sure mysql support was compiled

mongodb is fun to toy with and i ve built a few apps using it myself for that reason but it s almost never a better choice than postgresql mysql sql server etc

i ve tried switching from mysql to postgresql and whilst postgresql was fractionally faster it was a matter of 2-3

mysql run 4x faster than postgresql

i prefer postgresql over mysql any time

some say mysql is much better for bigger projects while others think just go with postgresql

postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them

i really like postgresql s indexes which are far better than mysql s

i have never used postgresql myself but i think it s mostly a matter of taste whether you prefer it over mysql

better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas

postgresql is much more similar to oracle than mysql is

sqlite is a more simpler database than postgresql or mysql and if you are testing very small applications you can easily use it instead of postgresql

as a developer i prefer postgresql over mysql as the latter behaves different from version to version they re still playing catchup to the sql standard and probably always will

mysql is popular but i prefer postgresql

mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates

big sites built around open source software choose mysql over postgresql by a wide margin

it seems very unlikely that you would want this behaviour for a real application so i recommend mysql postgresql or similar instead

it s actually faster when you are not cpu network -bound because i ve seen it perform better than them in many cases especially with bigger dbs -- say 10gb when it comes to filesystem access mysql and postgresql however are more efficient in terms of cpu network utilization when these are a constraint

not only does postgresql have a far more flexible indexing than mysql but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are

in my personal openion mysql is slower than postgresql and mongo db

postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings

i would need a scalable database so probably postgresql would be better than mysql

i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql

while filemaker easily supports hundreds of users if you go into thousands of simultaneous users many sql only databases eg oracle ms sql server mysql postgresql are designed to better spread out the load across more machines

firstly dump your local database i prefer using mysql postgresql whatever docs for this rather than using . manage.py dumpdata

mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing

if you want to use sqlite you need to store it in your openshift_data_dir but we recommend using mysql or postgresql instead so your application can be scaled if you want it to

i also greatly prefer postgresql but i think if you re planning to use other peoples php applications forums blogs etc it s just a reality that you re probably going to have to run mysql to support them

mysql indexes were occupying more size than the table data itself and postgresql was using considerably lesser sizes

postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

i personally prefer postgresql over mysql and find it very scalable even with millions or even billions of rows when setup correctly

mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem

postgresql supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in mysql and also give better performance

postgresql has better support but the support by mysql depends on the used storage engine

ps you can also migrate to postgresql it s smarter than mysql when choosing right indexes

postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc

generally speaking i find postgresql lends itself to 24 7 operations better than mysql

but in mysql it is ok and in postgresql it is wrong and ask for the other fields besides site_id either in a group by clause or in a aggregation function i know that postgresql is stricter on sql than mysql so i must select the site_id in the query object of msg_published but in pure sqlalchemy i can do like this

for any application with reasonable traffic you should choose mysql or postgresql

does anyone know issues with mysql s i18n support and if postgresql would be better placed for building an application with indic language support kannada telugu tamil etc using utf-8 encoding

run phpinfo on your local and production servers and compare mysql postgresql mssql whatever-database-you-use driver versions

in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

i recommend postgresql as well especially as an alternative to mysql

postgresql specifically has gotten easier to manage while mysql has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter

mongodb is way faster than mysql and postgresql but there s a tiny chance like 1 in a million that it won t save correctly

also if you open to moving away from mysql i ve found that postgresql has much better resolution of deadlocks

i know that sqlite in tests should be fast because it is run in-memory and all that stuff but it is just still much slower than normal postgresql mysql database

i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options

they are sufficiently similar that i d recommend starting with mysql but learning postgresql as well

mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates

i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid

i would pick postgresql v8.4+ over mysql given the choice

this is ancedotal but the postgresql servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than mysql which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down

on the other hand mysql and postgresql are more capable of handling csv data and mysql s load data in file and postgresql copy are both painless ways to import very large amounts of data in a very short period of time

i d have said that postgresql is more security aware than mysql supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application

it starts from simple strings length supported by postgresql or mysql mysql limitations are bigger and also for types like inet in postgresql that should be converted to string in mysql

both postgresql and mysql support the lower function

you could then compare these with mysql and postgresql

i ve heard a lot of postgresql but i always wanted to know why you d choose it over mysql

mysql can do a good job with a small number of clients at higher client counts the locking mechanism in postgresql might do a better job

other databases where it was about the same for a transactional database as oracle sql server where were better than mysql postgresql etc

this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks

i prefer postgresql over mysql because of the schema architecture

my question is that will postgresql suffice for having such a large number of entries while performing both read and writes or should i switch to mysql because i heard mysql is more advantageous to read heavy tasks

in world nosql mongo world perhaps the schema is a little more flexible than mysql postgresql and thus changing the schema is more common practice

drupal 7 mysql 5.0.15 or higher with pdo postgresql 8.3 or higher

we choose postgresql as our database because oracle and mysql are just too expensive

some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql

i hear postgresql is more robust and doesn t crash like mysql does in these situations

postgresql and mysql are trickier as the binary data is kept in multiple files and may not even be valid if you were able to snapshot it

postgresql is far more powerful and scalable and doesn t have mysql s silly limitations and gotchas

for simple time aggregation influxdb has shown much better results than postgresql and mysql in the order of ten times faster to respond

this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysql full-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene

take you pick mysql postgresql sqlite.

does that mean perhaps rails team favor postgresql slightly more than mysql

i m thinking about postgresql to store the data because i ve already used it and i like it also if a nosql would be a good choice -since not all data needs to have a relation- i like the postgresql support and community and i feel better knowing that there s a big community out there to help me mysql innodb is also a good choice tbh i ve not a real reason to choose it over postgresql and vice-versa is maybe mysql easier to create shards

also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql

may be postgresql takes less time than mysql

i wonder why postgresql s single insert statement is completely faster than mysql s when autocommit is turned on

if you re going to send fences from a web service i would recommend using mysql or postgresql as both have really good geospatial extensions

for high consistency and availability- choose mysql postgresql greenplum vertica neo4j

mysql is more preferred db choise for symfony projects symfony mysql symfony postgresql so choosing postgresql is a rare decision and maybe there are some pitfalls those we have to consider

otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since it is more standards compliant and has a nicer license

i also wonder if postgresql will be a win over mysql

at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

and any python orm will make it easier to switch out your database if you find something better than mysql like postgresql

no doubt i would prefer postgresql to mysql for an application with a lot of data fine security levels a lot of replications and a lot of data checks and automatic updates

typically you want to compare different solutions like how mysql compete with postgresql against a similar model

mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql

it is one of the reason why i do not like mysql and prefer postgresql

note i m not saying mysql s license won t work for you but postgresql is definitely simpler

if you are more comfortable with mysql because you should install postgresql locally if you are going to use postgresql for production then you should consider using one of the mysql add-ons heroku offers

however i find postgresql to support more sql features than mysql and be more efficient when handling more data

setup instance of mysql or postgresql i personally prefer postgresql for many reasons create database create table with structure like this

now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it

i would recommend postgresql over mysql

i start off with something like mysql and then later on i might decide that postgresql makes a better fit - and if i have done everything the propel way switching to the new engine is trivial - rebuild and go

i am aware that postgresql interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than mysql and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject

i am less familiar with postgresql than mysql but

and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

i would recommend using postgresql over mysql especially if you re going to be leveraging django orm as it s a bit more fine-tuned for postgresql

with out looking at the type of queries or the complexity it is difficult to say if mysql or postgresql will work better for you

does this affect postgresql harder than mysql

postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql

hard to compare mysql and postgresql

for a database i generally use mysql though postgresql might be more suitable if you do lots of really complex queries

it seems mysql is more forgiving with this than postgresql but in every case you use a reserved word you should escape it

also you can choose mysql or postgresql

the query optimizer in postgresql is more advanced than in mysql and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects

choose postgresql or mysql as they have better optimizers you don t have to code it

that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey

looks like postgresql is a little more compliant than mysql so try this instead

poor performance from mysql has more to do with it not being smart and automatically creating an optimized plan like sql server postgresql or oracle would

i have a default installation of mysql and postgresql on my os x box and mysql is 2x faster comparing queries that are warmed up by repeatedly executing the query

however i don t know whether databases in my case mysql maybe postgresql would be better at handling compressing option a in contrast to option b

do you find rails with postgresql is slower than mysql knowing that it produce more query on the background

postgresql seem to better than mysql in terms of speed

or maybe i want to use mysql for forum posts but postgresql for geo-clustering more realistic for me heh

for other databases like mysql and postgresql there is simpler solution

i suppose postgresql could have higher metadata overhead than mysql or has to extend its data files in larger chunks but i can t find anything obvious that postgresql wastes space for which migrating to mysql is the cure

postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql

i d recommend postgresql but mysql should do if you already have it

an alternative would be firebird which is not so flexible but in my experience it is in some cases performing much better than mysql and postgresql

i did a simple performance test and i noticed postgresql is slower than mysql

though mysql is more popular than postgresql but instagram is using postgresql maybe due to these reasons

i don t like mysql licence firebird and postgresql are better

copied from comment below i m looking for a statement like in mysql and postgresql count is faster for short queries exists is faster for long queries and use queryset 0 when it s likely that you re going to need the first element and you want to check that it exists

the big question as far as i m concerned is still outstanding -- will postgresql require more fiddling and configuration to run well than mysql

i ve built a rails application using mysql and now would like to move some models to a postgresql database for performance reasons the tables are quite big and postgresql is faster

i am working on a web application using python django and would like to know whether mysql or postgresql would be more suitable when deploying for production

postgresql is much better suited for data warehousing compared to mysql

personally i d always prefer postgresql over mysql because of the much better sql feature set and the overall quality of the product

i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation

postgresql is way better than mysql in nearly every respect

with django it is easy to use postgresql instead of mysql so i tried it with the same query and same data in db postgresql is much faster that mysql x10 more faster while using inner join analyse shows it uses indexes unlike mysql

why postgresql is more capable than others mysql etc. on django

what is more common is inserting small chunks of data from different connections simultaneously in this case postgresql uses row-level locking - a feature not supported by the default mysql table type which theoretically at least should cause it to outperform mysql

if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend postgresql it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than mysql

mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql

2 using databasemigrations allows you to use an in-memory sqlite db for testing which is faster and more lightweight than mysql or postgresql

for these ultra simple queries postgresql can be slower than mysql - postgresql has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower

i have been searching for a blog post or a feature matrix which compares mysql and postgresql by their json capabilities

secondly would migrating from mysql to postgresql be more involved dan doing a dumpdata on the mysql dbase change the settings to point to postgresql and the loaddata on the new backend

i like the idea of sqlite but i m more comfortable with postgresql mysql even ms access or oracle

if i were able to upgrade the server s versioning of mysql to 5.5 would innodb be a safer bet than postgresql

postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance

just select mysql from the dropdown instead of postgresql

but in low traffic sites mysql postgresql is better

is file based caching faster than the mysql mariadb postgresql

what is nice about cast is that it works exactly the same on most sql engines sql server postgresql mysql and is much easier to remember how to use it

mysql and other relational dbs such as postgresql are better data stores than mongodb for relational data

as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

anyways mysql is bad and on longterm especially if you are enough good for java i suggest you to use some better db with postgresql you were really satisfied i think

that is one area i really think mongodb fits for but mysql postgresql is more recommended in general

far easier than getting mysql or postgresql installed on a system.

i m pretty sure i ll be using sqlite for this project but does anyone think postgresql or mysql could perform better with a pretty big join like this

nosql solutions are better than mysql postgresql and other rdbms techs for this task

worse with mysql if you drop multiple indexes on the same table it will re-copy the table once for each index you re removing instead of being smart and re-copying the data once without all the indexes you re dropping. is something like this happening with postgresql

i feel postgresql is much more mature and robust than mysql

and a wiki for why postgresql is better than mysql

problems with corruption seem to be more frequent with mysql than with postgresql

postgresql is better than mysql in many ways

is there a quick guide to which words in mysql match postgresql

i would still recommend checking out postgresql and postgis in comparison to mysql if you intend to do more complex queries in the foreseeable future

i have used both and even migrated projects from mysql to postgresql and in my experience postgresql was the better choice

postgresql is picky pickier than mysql -- all fields in the select list when using distinct must be present in the order_by and group_by clauses

if you want to go open source i would recommend using postgresql instead of mysql

an efficiently configured mysql is better than a badly configured postgresql and vice-versa

i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available

you may choose mysql or postgresql as the backend database

in an oltp database like mysql or postgresql it s better to use a range query over an index where you keep track of the last value seen on the previous page

this works fine on my local and current hosted environment using mysql but postgresql is clearly more strict

my problem is i m more familiar with mysql and could probably figure this out but this is postgresql and i am still getting tripped up on syntax

the mysql one was more stable than the postgresql one

p.s postgresql have better features to store json data compared to mysql or mariadb

while mysql is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend postgresql

local installs of postgresql or even mysql might be a better choice than sqlite for what you re doing

if you need multiple writers more than one process thread writing to the database simultaneously the locking overhead is probably worse and mysql or postgresql would perform better especially if running on the same machine

since oracle has mysql and now is working on drizzle for a new project should i choose postgresql

in my opinion mysql or postgresql will be better option if you want to use relational database and create graphs with your application code

from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

if i had to support a huge number users on a reasonably simple application and had the team to build a heavily partitioned and replicated database with eventual consistency i d pick mysql over postgresql for the low level data storage building block

you might look at postgresql as i find it a bit easier to manage and maintain as i feel some aspects are more logical than mysql

is there some typical cases where postgresql outperforms mysql

personally i prefer postgresql rather than mysql so i asking for help how to resolve this problem

there is also postgresql its a bit more robust than mysql and is free just the same

you may find postgresql to be a better free choice than mysql but you ll have to evaluate this yourself 1

i am more familiar with postgresql than mysql

triggers in postgresql have a syntax a bit more complex than mysql because they execute procedures as the action

the only reason i was considering postgresql was that some research suggested postgresql has much better support for changing schemas along the way than mysql

in the community you only can choose between mysql and postgresql no oracle or ms sql for community

all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post

i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested

in many cases at least 2-3 times faster than mysql postgresql

postgresql is stricter about conversions than mysql is and generally will throw an error rather than try to convert a string to an integer if it doesn t look like one

the advantage with sphinx is easier integration with mysql and postgresql however lucene is more feature-rich

mysql is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers postgresql is probably a little more powerful

postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

with that said if you are worried about sql server licensing costs i d recommend postgresql first or mysql second as your database of choice

with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql

mysql is ok choice bit if you re expecting vast amounst of data i would prefer postgresql sql imho best free db avaliable

postgresql or mysql is better for production environment

postgresql is good too but mysql is undoubtedly more popular and you re going to find more hosts that provide you a mysql database for instance if that matters

i am using postgresql before which i tried mysql mysql is even worse

in my experiance with the two postgresql has shown to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads

given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used

postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s

first of all you will have to install something other than sqlite i recommend postgresql not mysql

since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on

in my cases postgresql was better than mysql mysql do not completely support unicode

i am using postgresql btw which can do more than mysql incase that changes things

postgresql or mysql might be better or worse at this sort of query

i get that pushing the code up is a matter of using git aws.push - but what do i need to do to push the data up the the ebs environment i m happy to use either postgresql or mysql on ebs - but i m guessing postgresql is the better choice given that s what the local app uses - if so how would i need to configure my database.yml for postgresql on ebs

i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically postgresql fulltext is 10-100x faster than mysql and xapian 10-100x faster than postgresql but not integrated

while postgresql is less popular than mysql most of the serious web hosting supports it

but if you do a lot of heavy updates to a table as often as other threads have to read then the default locking in mysql is not the best and postgresql can be a better choice performance-wise

for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive

if you are using mysql or postgresql this is a better way

i d personally recommend using postgresql as it has a cidr data-type and powerful functions to go with it but there s an interesting discussion on doing similar things in mysql too

sqlite is very fast in many trivial cases it performs faster than mysql postgresql or firebird and supports a good subset of sql-92 syntax but there is extra overhead to populate the data-set sqlite db and building any indices etc

postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django

in fact this presentation which still refers to an older incomplete version of mysql s opengis support suggests that with proper indexing some mysql geospatial actions may actually perform better than postgresql postgis though i m sure that s up for debate

personally i think mysql would be a better solution then postgresql if you are looking for an open source solution but keep in mind open source sql solutions with not be the easiest when it comes to scalability or a high availability environment if that is your ultimate goal

you may choose mysql or postgresql and then take advantage of the aws managed relational database service rds

i would turn to the documentation for the database operating systems you choose postgresql mysql sql server oracle et cetera all have years of history running jobs against them in batch or on demand

while other databases like mysql can use only one index per table in most situations postgresql can use more than one

honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql

then postgresql is much better than mysql

postgresql has a more comprehensive gis extension . mysql s is as dumb as a flapjack in flatland

according to my own experience postgresql run much faster than mysql especially handling big tables 1.4 gb lineitem table in my case

while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions

i find working with php 5.3.1 and mysql i prefer postgresql however comfortable

is postgresql a better option than mysql for partitioning tables by date

the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case

i found that postgresql 9.3 has better capabilities for json than the mysql versions i am using

postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions

it s not true unit testing however it does run much faster than mysql or postgresql

i just recently switched databases to postgresql which has given me a slew of problems although i must admit i like it a lot better than mysql

however when i do an insert and then a select postgresql mysql give me the correct time stated above however with microsoft sql i get the following 2017-07-12 06 02 08.917

mysql has very little drawbacks even though i prefer postgresql in most cases like altering large tables by adding a new index for example

i ll recommend postgresql but mysql is easily up to the task too

either postgresql more proven than mysql for such huge data

i never tried on any unix but i think that postgresql or mysql should be more mature

would you recommend using postgresql over mysql for this scenario

however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise

postgresql will always be a little bit more mature than mysql

postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb

unfortunately it was built several years ago using rails 2.1 and uses mysql i prefer postgresql

i would have to disagree with the other answers suggestiong you to switch to mysql or postgresql without knowing more about why your code isnt running fast enough

i d actually recommend postgresql over mysql for the window functions alone

postgresql with the optional hstore module might be better than mysql at this.

if you want open source postgresql is much smarter than mysql as well

i was told that postgresql is a better choice than mysql for displaying hierarchical data so i installed postgresql and i m ready to go

fill information and press next i m using postgresql so in your case choose mysql

as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query

for this load i can recommend mysql or postgresql because i already worked with even higher load on postgresql

however the observation of database-locking stands - if you have particularly onerous updates sqlite performance won t match mysql or postgresql

in fact if your rdbms supports boolean on select mysql postgresql you can see why

mysql is more permissive and allows the non-standard use of distinct but postgresql throws an error

i ve used both db systems before and while postgresql is great for it s licensing terms and standards compliance mysql is definitely easier to get up and running quickly

i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql

i only mention this because a lot of people are more familiar with mysql than postgresql so linking lastval to something familiar might clarify things

my advice is to use an sql database such as postgresql or mysql i recommend postgresql over mysql although probably either one will work

how would reading the data compare with mysql postgresql

by the way if starting a new project i would recommend postgresql over mysql because support for mysql is uncertain at best

mysql has some advantages like easy replication but postgresql is generally nicer to work with

it seems it uses mysql driver but why if i choose postgresql

the framework has also improved majorly not to mention it supports pdo mysqli more secure than mysql and postgresql

postgresql is worth learning and much more advanced than mysql

if you already know sql toss a coin to choose between mysql and postgresql for your first project

if you run a test with myisam tables that does trivial non-concurrent selects your benchmark might decide that mysql outperforms postgresql

that page recommends using mysql or postgresql

i d recommend postgresql but probably mysql and its variants such as mariadb and commercial non-open-source offerings would be just fine too

also which database syntax postgresql or mysql is closer sql mssql syntax and structure

if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql

there are workloads where postgresql is better and there are workloads where mysql is better

i know postgresql could be considered more mature than mysql with regards to locking thanks to mvcc - can i use row-locking or some other feature in postgresql instead of the token field

i think one good reason to choose postgresql over mysql is that you won t find any guides on howto switch from postgresql to mysql

following the first answer it appears that postgresql is more compliant to sql standard than mysql so it needs a group by clause for each selected column you want to display with your aggregated function

in my opinion it s silly to compare mysql and postgresql in terms of speed if there are variables unknown such as - what s your budget what s your target system output and what s your load rate

however people often argue that postgresql is cleaner and easier to use that mysql

in general mysql is optimized for pkey lookups and postgresql is more generally optimized for complex use cases

personally i prefer postgresql over mysql i find it really easy to use psycopg2 to write to postgresql from python but mileage will vary

mysql does a lot of implicit type conversions postgresql is rather more strict and requires you to say exactly what you mean

also would prefer mysql over postgresql based on my experience level with mysql

i haven t chosen a db yet so if mysql or postgresql is better in some way over the other please provide your preference and perhaps why if you have time

some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production

is postgresql better than mysql for such purpose

while i am more familiar with mysql than with postgresql i believe it is true for both databases that sub-queries have a negative impact on performance relative to joins

for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use postgresql a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than mysql via py-postgresql

i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

unfortunately in postgresql select count is often slower than mysql to which it often get s compared to

the biggest reason why i recommend postgresql to people who have more oracle mssql experience as opposed to mysql is that the sql syntaxes and general feel of the database engine match pretty closely

no cross-database queries if you need something like that mapping mysql databases to postgresql schemas is probably easier

it s known that sqlite is slower than mysql postgresql excepting very small tiny dbs

if the primary keys always match up between mysql and postgresql you can just try to save the record setting the primary key explicitly

the first using transactions is most likely to help but i m not sure if it works on myisam tables with innodb it does a very good job - i only use those when i m forced to use mysql i prefer postgresql

this compares postgresql to mysql

i would recommend postgresql for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than mysql

this is one of the primary reasons i prefer postgresql over mysql for new development

note i can t change the database engine i use so don t recommend mysql or postgresql or anything like that

the other question is that what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates

it s a shame postgresql isn t more popular than mysql since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.

postgresql is stricter to the sql standard than mysql is

in my opinion it doesn t matter that much if you choose mysql or postgresql the orm will handle both just fine

if you are looking for location based queries in relational databases postgresql is more matured compared to mysql

a database using a separate server to manage multiple clients such as mysql or postgresql is a better choice if performance is an issue

i got webaplication jsp jstl mysql database it like rental you can add things show catalog it s work on mysql but now i have do add second database i choose postgresql when adding item to database it have to go to both is it possible with jstl

fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link

you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql

i d recommend postgresql mysql or mariadb

mysql is probably part of the problem but updating to postgresql would be a larger task than i want to commit to right now

installing a real database server is fairly easy so i d recommend sql server express as others have or even mysql or postgresql whatever is easier to set up

in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with

postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that

i don t want this to be a mysql postgresql is better than postgresql mysql debate

i d recommend postgresql if mysql won t work for you

traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

well i don t know why mysql barfs so much on queries 1 and 3 which are pretty simple and easy in fact it should even beat postgresql using an index only scan but apparently not eh

i d also recommend postgresql over mysql if you are going to have nested comments as postgresql does hierarchical querying better than mysql

migration to postgresql or mysql would be much easier too in terms of code

in your case postgresql may be a better option than mysql because your query is going to likely be against secondary indexes

i prefer postgresql over mysql but that s another debate

if you actually prefer mysql over postgresql i d lay out a migration plan just to be ready if need arises as a kind of lazy proactiveness .


mallet	lda	1
this paper goes into this in depth but if you use a standard lda package i d recommend mallet they should have this functionality already


nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	3
using nullpointerexception and runtimeexception to whet it further is not correct because runtimeexception need not be declared on the signature

you probably had an exception possibly a runtimeexception such as a nullpointerexception which stopped further invocations

a note on the runtimeexception re if you catch a nullpointerexception nullpointerexception and throw a re you are actually losing information since nullpointerexception is a more specific error rather than re


onchange	onkeyup	4
you might want to use onchange instead of onkeyup to make it less hyperactive

i know you mentioned onchange and onfocus though personally i tend to prefer onkeyup so that values will change as the user is typing

using onkeyup or oninput suggest by mohamedrias rather than onchange event is more suitable in your case

also onchange won t work you ll need to use onkeyup although onblur is probably more sane


woocommerce	wpml	1
when woocommerce updates the product_count_product_cat entry of a category after a purchase wpml doesn t notify woocommerce to do the same for the other translated instances of the category


submit	submission	13
to keep from getting duplicate lead submission when the submit button is clicked

i think it can be better to do form submission through javascript so on submit function can be controlled more wisely to kill popup on more than one submit click....am i right if yes plz guide this way

in that case binding to the form submit may be better to prevent other means of submission the form which cricumvent the button click

i suspect this will submit the right form data but may not be acceptable if your button is calling js and is doing more than submission form data

if a user submit it once and the request is made i don t want them to keep submission it making more requests otherwise that ll bog down the site

also note that for form submission it is typically better to use the onsubmit event as opposed to the onclick event since forms can technically be submitted by hitting the enter key as well as clicking the submit button

first of all i prefer submission forms using a click on the submit button because this in 90 is the case when a real user submit the form

you should treat submit as what happens after you ve done any pre-processing so binding to click events then conditionally raising the submit is better than always submission but conditionally stopping the submit

so if data is not ok it must destroy submission the form because if returns false but it doesn t and the form submit as usual and even alert doesn t appear

the captcha is generated on load and it s checked by another server script which you can call on clicking the submit button but before actually submission explore more events of form submission

i am wondering if i can submit the paramaters to via ajax show a loader image after submission it but once the file is complete return the file for download

so i have a form that submit to a database and i want to prevent more than one submission if the user clicks the submit button more than once...with a little research this seems easily enough done however none of the solutions i found worked for me as i am using the jquery validationengine plugin to validate the form client side

to request earlier access log on to the dev center dashboard click feedback at the bottom of the dashboard select submission api for the feedback area and submit your request


polymorphism	specialization	1
while it can be argued that the example in the op does not exhibit static polymorphism the use of specialization can make a more compelling case


gulp-sass	gulp-ruby-sass	2
i ended up using gulp-ruby-sass that while is a bit slower than gulp-sass is rich with features such as loadpath

but the plugin gulp-ruby-sass slower than gulp-sass


pyramid	web2py	1
frameworks like flask cherrypy pyramid or even web2py might be the easier ones to start with


odoo	openerp	1
its just a name they choosed it because odoo provides more than openerp for example web site modules


code128	code39	1
data density in code128 is better than code39 - since it gets mentioned that often in other replies


gridview	onclientclick	1
either way i lose getting onclientclick events for my gridview


gif	png	104
file extension does not match gif | jpg | png | css | js | ico

gif jpeg png bmp are more standard than any vector format where usually adobe has the market

if your icon exists in only one size and support in older versions of internet explorer is no concern you might prefer png or gif because of the smaller file size

the gif format is substantially less capable than png

since you don t need animation and want to stay with loss-less compression you would get somewhat better compression with png instead of gif and png is patent-free

other than that it s up to the uses of the images quality compression etc. in terms of whether you choose png gif jpeg tiff etc

png gives you better alpha result than gif

so here any extension will match gif or jpeg or jpg or png or css

compared to gif png offers better compression larger pallette and more features including transparency

for non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much better

it depends on the nature of the image if it s a photograph jpeg would give the highest quality compression ratio if it was pixel stuff like writing or clipart or have some transparency then it s gif png to choose gif png8 offers one level transparency while png24 offers a levelled transparency for each pixel

it might help to reduce your gif file sizes smaller oh and i believe -depth 8 can only be used for png images

is jpeg format lighter than png or gif

note that if you convert your png files to gif images they are likely to look uglier as gif files can only have 256 colors and do not support alpha-transparency

use png or gif it s faster types of images

for example given gif may be deprecated in a system because png has proven better for the system s users - perhaps because it supports better colour depth preserving the colours more accurately or svg might be deprecated because some clients have been found to be using web browsers that won t display them jpeg might be deprecated because it s known the images in the system aren t natural photographic images and the format gives visually poor results despite larger compressed files slower processing speed and higher memory usage - lots of possible motivations for making things deprecated

animated png is better than gif if we re focused on file size â achieving a smaller file size was one of the reasons the apng format was designed

android prefers png for bitmap image files accepts jpeg and discourages gif

since that appears to generate index-color gif files which are smaller than the png files that doxygen generates

jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

just press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpg

i prefer png for any internet image work i m doing as gif has a limited palette and jpg doesn t handle transparency

the image is outputted correctly but both the gif and png are considerably lower quality

this properly means if the file is an image of gif or jpeg or png and is less than that size

jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss

if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

sometimes you ll find that jpeg at 100 quality ends up smaller than the gif or png version but most of the time line art is best stored in png form

i am trying to use an svg form an image on a website as it s far more crisper than an png gif or jpg that i can use

png and gif are better than jpeg gif probably better than png

i used gif because its file size 2.1kb was considerably less than png or jpeg in this case

gif is smaller because it s based on an colour palette of 256 colours rather than the separate rgb values for each pixel or group of pixels in jpg and png

png and gif are better at compressing certain types of images basically blocky graphics while jpeg are better for photo-like images

as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression

then the headers of the more complex png format put it at a disadvantage so there is no reason to prefer gif in this case

icon size indexed png is often smaller than the same gif

many people don t know about 8-bit png which is usually better than gif in size.

a 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as planned

for storing line drawings text and iconic graphics at a smaller file size gif or png are better choices because they are lossless

gif jpeg and png are more complex - the data is compressed

if there are rows with the same height prefer jpg over png over gif over the rest 3 9 10

and unless you require animation i d always recommend png over gif

bear in mind that the conversion is not trivial if the png is true colour or has transparency gif is more limited

if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode

if the icon img don t appear it will be the size of image try with another size less than 64x64 px format of image gif jpeg and png the documentation recommend png if it doesn t appear check permision of image for public request external request .

jpeg images do not support the alpha transparency channel choose gif or png instead

there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry

the bottom line is that decoding jpg is going to be slower than say png or gif

while png is definitely better that gif occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in gif format

2- if you want a smaller file size and choose gif or png 8 bits you must select a matte color that will be at the background on your website

i recommend png or gif gif only for 255 colors

with the parentheses it will match followed by gif or jpg or png and then followed by s

still most simple gif usually are much more smaller in footprint compared to their optimized png version

so looks like gif and png are better choices although jpg still gets you under the 300 bytes mark

choose the correct type of image extension sometimes gif or png delivers better results then jpg s

in your implementation of the converter i would use the imagetools library to convert between gif and png png will be better quality than jpeg

one thing to note is that gif supports a smaller palette than png - only up to 256 colors

i haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmp

also if i change all to png is not bigger and alos i am using prawn pdf outputting these images so cant use gif

i would recommend png or even gif

png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

gif|jpg|png - match gif or jpg or png

i recommend png rather than gif but either would work

for example png has better support for transparency than gif or jpeg

convert it to png 10-30 smaller than gif on average

wewtaco i noticed that your png file has wider dimension than the gif file and i am guess that could be a reason the black bars are showing up

you can then use imagecopy to insert each gif image including the background and imagepng to generate png output which is better for line art than jpeg offers better compression than gif and can support more than 256 colors

reduce image resolutions to the bare minimum and experiment with file formats gif or png might be significantly smaller than jpeg for some images cartoons logos icons but much larger for others photos gradients

png files have a larger default pallet however you can shrink their color pallet so that when you do they result in a smaller file size than gif

i wasn t aware that png should be any worse in terms of file size than gif

you could do the alternative if you need the image to be animated but using a 32-bit png instead which you should prefer over gif regardless

png achieves better compression than gif because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of png filtering

i m not sure if this matters but the gif is significantly larger than the png files

the web favors gif jpg and png mostly

also you can choose between png gif and jpeg image formats by using either imagepng imagegif or imagejpeg

despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects

png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

so this script will take a jpg gif of png image resize it to 110px width if width is greater of 110px height if height is greater

if image doesn t match png jpg gif etc. reject it

printing a png or gif would be much easier -- just extend the printdocument class and use the normal print dialog provided by windows forms

but keep in mind that the gif color palette is way smaller than png

jpeg is bad at that kind of thing and you ll probably find png to compress better probably better than gif too

i would recommend gif over png because there are some issues with color profiles in webbrowsers and pngs

i don t know why you choose gif as a format the vector format svg would produce much prettier results png would be my second choice

try to put both of the images background and logo back-page1.png logo5.gif in the same format either gif or png i prefer png and it should do the trick

png has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is not

doesn t have to be gif s for the second one personally i prefer png s

after pressing it about twice there is a smaller and smaller delay between the gif being set and the png being set

if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

it will always be a web format which basically comes down to jpg png and gif with gif being very unlikely because of its limitations gif can contain 256 colors at most and is generally larger than png

png beats gif on everything except that animations are not supported mng supports them though

for storing line drawings text and iconic graphics at a smaller file size png or even gif are better choices because they are lossless

but in my search i found that png images return shorter base64 strings than gif images

png and gif need less than half the time

as far as compression that is going to be a function of the image format you choose png jpg gif

but in that regard it is replaced by png which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where gif pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly gif images are limited to 256 colors

first i use fileinfo for 100 known matches gif jpeg png because i do want to rely on fingerprint detection for certain files

png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

paul points out that png compresses static line art better than gif for nearly every situation

now i want to show an error message when the image isn t a png jpg or gif or is larger than 250k

according to wikipedia the png format provides better compression than gif

png does everything except animations unless enhanced with apng that gif does and better

png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

png gif works much better


range	median	2
you should also adjust your conditionals to check for a low high range as it should quickly get smaller as your median value approaches the real value

on the other hand if the number of range is smaller than log n it may be better to move elements of a given range to the beginning of the array and use a linear time selection algorithm to find the median


inline	constexpr	3
the statement about inline and constexpr functions having more than one definition does not mean that the definition can be repeated multiple times in a single compilation unit

if the global constant is of literal type prefer using inline constexpr the inline is optional if itâ s a static class member instead of inline const

you may be interested in looking at the constexpr keyword which i think is better than the inline keyword when you can make use of it


weka	mallet	2
i have tried weka too but mallet is smarter than weka on this aspect

which product mallet or weka is better for text classification task


noexcept	throw	5
i ve heard that noexcept keyword is more like it should never throw an exception rather than it doesn t

noexcept was added rather than just removing all throw specifiers other than throw because noexcept is more powerful

noexcept allows for more efficient code generation in that it does not have to perform rtti on throw exceptions instead if an exception is throw from a call-frame underneath a noexcept-declared function std terminate is called short-circuiting the crazy std unexpected machinery specified by the 98 standard

unwound before program execution is terminated. he said code using noexcept is more optimized than code using throw

on the other hand if you are certain that the body may not throw you may want to declare it noexcept to be more explicit and help the compiler optimize but be careful if you choose to do this because if a destructor of any member ancestor of your class decides to throw your code will abort at runtime


squash	branch	12
this is an extra step but you are free to squash the history or select branch to push if needed

use git rebase -i and select squash for your 10 commits so you ll only have one big commit rebased on your public branch

if you will have only yours commits on your branch issue is much simpler you can do squash those git squash

if you really need to be the only one to whom your work-in-progress history is visible you could create a local branch pointed at the head of your local work-in-progress to preserve a named reference to the commit and then perform a squash merge git merge --squash which will still create a merge commit but will collapse your work-in-progress commits down to a single commit the local branch you created earlier will still point to the true detailed history however

this way you don t alter your parameters branch and you can apply those changes to your current branch - if you want to combine several commits into one choose squash

moreover i read that a branch is just a commit but why do we have to merge branch but pick squash

i pull switch back to master pull select merge choose my local dev branch under merge options i select squash under fast forward options i leave the default if a fast-forward only update the branch pointer the other options are if a fast-forward create a merge commit and if not a fast-forward fail

prefer squash small commits into a fat one before git svn dcommit or branch merging using either git rebase -i or git merge --squash

i see ones i merge master to feature branch i can not squash he commits any more using interactive rebase

to squash all commits of a branch down into a single commit keep the first commit as pick and replace all subsequent pick entries with squash or simply s

i do not recommend squash branch as it loses important history that is useful for code archeology ie

if it is just you using the repo or a select grouping of folks that you can easily communicate with then you can safely squash or filtering see below to clean up history and then when they fetch they ll need to manually reset all their branch heads to the new heads


uinavigationbar	uitabbarcontroller	1
in specific i would like the uinavigationbar in the uitabbarcontroller s more view controller to be an instance of my class


flot	rgraph	1
i have found highcharts to have a steeper learning curve than flot or rgraph imho


phpunit	behat	3
i think you should extract logic of titles to separated classes and then test it by phpunit or use more appropriate testing solutions like behat or selenium

for general testing phpunit is a more well-established product while behat is focussed on tests written using bdd methodology behaviour driven design

phpunit does also have bdd features but behat is much more targetted toward that style


wns	mpns	2
select push notifications and then select wns mpns

back on the windows dev center page for your new app select services select push notifications and then select wns mpns


xls	.doc	1
the last two doc and xls don t render in-line on the page it downloads the word .doc or .xls to the client computer


domxpath	domdocument	8
i recommend using domdocument and domxpath code not tested

you d be doing this much easier with domdocument and domxpath instead which works as you d expect

as exampled by jan i too thought that domdocument domxpath provided a more robust solution that preg_match .

you re better off with domdocument s loadhtml and domxpath

for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable

i recommend using domdocument and domxpath

i would recommend using domdocument to parse the html and domxpath to query the document tree

i highly recommend domdocument domxpath for this .


jar	war	22
while impact in compilation is minimal the impact in deployment can be bad i ve just came across an unused import that required a separate library witch became a maven dependency a further transitive dependency problem was not found hopefully but the war was thicker for no reason add to that a superfluous jar in the webapp classloader

but including this jar in my war only broke more things

i set up a maven multi module project one with packaging war two more with packaging jar

you can use eclipse to compare jar war files

so in my practice using war app easier than jar to manage and re-configure

last but not least the packaging you select jar war ear pom etc. binds goals to the lifecycle phases by default

i have the jersey resource classes bundled within a larger war as jar file which is now residing underneath web-inf lib folder on websphere application server

resources in war have higher classloading precedence than those in jar so the empty file would be loaded instead

accessing and dynamically reloading non-class resources inside jar war files is way easier

keeping your business logic in ejb jar will pay off when you ll need more than one war in your ear different security realms etc.

5 a war file can be runnable executable though this is more common with jar files

when a jsf resource is found in war instead of jar then those in war will have higher loading precedence over those in jars

however spring-boot as a practical trend recommends jar over war

i tried to do it in server s pom.xml file and i set the impl module to provided scope so the jar file is not longer contained in war but now the tests are failing as after unpacking the war file used for running the tests does not contain the impl jar file which is required for that

like remove the jar s from your war in case the version of your jar is same or lower than that of jboss s or replace the jar s of jboss and remove that jar s from your war in case the version of your jar is higher than that of jboss s

is embedded jar better than embedded war file

one could use beyondcompare software to compare war jar diretly

gradle pick jar file but no war file

i recently got this error with tomcat 7.0.21 on windows 7 when a war contained jars which had duplicate class definitions a class was defined in more than 1 jar within the war s web-inf lib directory

resources in war have higher loading precedence than those in jar

you linked to a question about a war vs a jar while spring boot s jar is indeed a jar it contains more than what you usually put inside a jar

if your client jar is really thinner for example only the interfaces having the war s reference the client jar effectively disallows them to access to ejb implementations which is always a good idea


median	minimum	6
maintain 2 heaps maximum heap for numbers less than current median and minimum heap for numbers greater than current median

but for value 1 and value 3 maximum is less than minimum and median receptively

there are at least n m+1 2 elements no larger than the maximum hi of these median and at least n m+1 2 no smaller than the minimum lo

but i can only see 5 possible values not 7 or is there more than minimum q1 q2 median q3 maximum to a boxplot

if the number is higher than the median the median is the new minimum

i want to repeatedly rearrange an array or std vector so that the minimum is the first element the maximum is the last element and would be the median elements before the median is less than median elements after the median would be greater


inline	inlining	23
we inline the call instead inlining is way better than tail calling and opens the door to many more optimizations

the keyword inline is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual inlining which the compiler can decide to do or not to do

i have no problem with methods declared inline in a header in some cases - a struct s constructor a simple method where inlining measurably makes it faster we have some math functions like this etc

as pointed out you cannot inline which is another speed trick but inlining on the if-then-else tree doesnt necessarily make it faster than without inlining and is generall not as fast as the function pointer

if your compiler can do this then writing functions in a way that the compiler is able to inline is better than manually inlining the calls yourself

a similar argument can be made for inlining functions inline is generally faster but will remain in the same big-o complexity class although there is an additional size tradeoff inlining makes your compiled program larger if the code was being used in many places

but as the inline code gets longer the savings for inlining become smaller so maybe you could just have a hard limit on the size of the code - any code to be inline must be smaller than the limit

if a definition should be in a header to allow inlining i personally prefer inline-functions with external linkage as addresses compare equal and the compiler still can inline if it thinks it s worth it

callee is too large message is printed by c1 when the size in bytecodes of the method being inline is larger than maxinlinesize 35 multiplied by nestedinliningsizeratio 90 on each next level of inlining

note that just as you wrote this version is significantly slower than the inline one under cpython which of course does no jit inlining

early inlining is the compiler s ability to inline a function early on when it sees the call costs more than the inline

templates will be inline in the standard meaning of inline which is more related to the one definition rule than to actual code inlining

you will probably use both in large projects - put the definitions of the functions that should be inline and templates in the header and put the ones that inlining makes less sense for in the cpp

inlining inlining produces fatter code which is faster the inline functions will not appear in the call stack

generally speaking the inline keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about inlining

the decision to inline is based on an estimate as to whether inlining will result in smaller code size

as a practical matter i can simply change these to static inline to get rid of the warning or turn off the specific warning entirely but i do find it useful from time to time but it seems that large utility functions which won t benefit from inlining 1 are more logically declared static 2

while function calls can be a little worse than inline code for very simple operations repeated inlining of non-trivial functions can create arbitrarily worse code bloat

i m well aware that inline is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to inlining non-specified inline-functions so the user control is almost negligible

the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean the compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid the compiler from inlining the function

if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

in reality the inline keyword has less to do with inlining code and more to do with allowing legal violation of the one definition rule

i prefer using inline assembly for rdtsc instructions to guarantee inlining


ocp	principles	1
i think adhering to the dip principles makes it easier to comply with the ocp principles


min	rank	7
i tried this but sometimes user by min score got higher rank

a simple way to get the indices of a rank 1 array arr for elements greater than value min is

in the case of ties this will take the average rank you can also choose min max or first

select from student where rank select max rank from student or rank select min rank from student

or you will be able to select max min rank for any user with aggregation

thus if the rank of an nxm matrix is less than min n m then the matrix is singular


ami	rightscale	1
rightscale which was mentioned earlier as an ami provider in chantheman s tutorial is one of them but you can have a look at enstratus and scalr as well disclaimer i work there


lasagne	keras	4
as a result of this comparison i see that lasagne is performing so much worse than keras that i m starting to doubt about my code

if everything is correct why keras perform so much better than lasagne

and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn

it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features

vbscript	jscript	14
are you stuck with coding in vbscript or can you choose jscript

you run your jscript i prefer jscript to vbscript because of its resemblance to javascript

asp with jscript is 100 times better cleaner simpler nicer than vbscript and makes my job a joy rather than a vbscript head ache

...i suggest doing all of the scripting from within the vbscript file and avoiding the use of .cmd .bat files completely if you can as vbscript is much more readable and powerful though i prefer using the jscript language instead but that s just me

the inclusion of jscript code into a batch file is simpler than vbscript and the translation of a small code segment from vbs to jscript is not problematic

i d pick vbscript or jscript via wsh or maybe powershell mdash

in either group create a new script in whichever language you prefer vbscript jscript or javascript

to let you compare jscript and vbscript code dealing with the same problem

when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection

certainly it has pretty much all the advantages of interpreted in this case compare with vbscript or jscript used in classic asp along with much of the advantages of compiled

not many people use jscript for classic asp most prefer vbscript

i am much more experienced with vbscript than jscript but i will give it a shot since not many takers on this question

powershell or any other windows scripting language like jscript or vbscript would be a better solution for getting the date

on contrary jscript is more c-like do not require explicit enabling of script running accepts relative paths case sensitive and loosely typed both are imho advantages for scripting language compared to vbscript


fadein	removeclass	3
that s because removeclass is executed faster than fadein method you can remove the class when animation is complete

nerdtree	rails.vim	1
if you want a recommendation i would say vim with three plugins - rails.vim make vim more aware of rails and its structure command-t great for jumping around between files quickly and nerdtree - a graphical tree based file browser


colt	jama	1
colt does this already but i have found it is more complicated and more powerful than jama which may explain why simple functions are slower with colt


web.py	bottle	1
in particular i d recommend bottle and web.py both of which can be used with more or less finagling with the excellent mimerender library for solid content negotiation


parse.com	firebase	1
i haven t used parse.com but i think firebase is easier for a beginner


oledbcommand	sqlcommand	1
as shown in sample below for sqlcommand which is more or less same as oledbcommand


kramdown	redcarpet	2
not too easy extending redcarpet this way maybe kramdown is easier

also redcarpet and pygments were no longer available so they must be replaced by kramdown and rouge in _config.yaml


matplotlib	colormap	3
to allow you to scale down the data away from 0 and 1 i had to do this when combining colormap in matplotlib single pcolormesh with more than one colormap using matplotlib so you can likely see how the code works but basically say you have values -5 1 10 in a sample but want to normalize based on a range of -7 to 7 so anything above 7 our 10 is treated as a 7 effectively with a midpoint of 2 but shrink it to fit a 256 rgb colormap

here is a good page discussing how to choose matplotlib colormap

to allow you to scale down the data away from endpoints 0 and 1 i had to do this when combining colormap in matplotlib single pcolormesh with more than one colormap using matplotlib so you can likely see how the code works but basically say you have values -5 1 10 in a sample but want to normalize based on a range of -7 to 7 so anything above 7 our 10 is treated as a 7 effectively with a midpoint of 2 but shrink it to fit a 256 rgb colormap


beyondcompare	winmerge	1
my friend used beyondcompare however i am more comfortable with winmerge


mergesort	in-place	5
mergesort is more difficult to implement in-place but the out-of-place version is very cache-friendly - i suspect real-world implementations accept the o n space overhead - ram is cheap but memory bandwidth is a major bottleneck so trading memory for cache-efficiency and speed is often a good deal

1 in-place merge sort is used when you want to sort a list in o nlogn time while using less space than standard mergesort

another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort

parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place

of course you just asked for advice about sorting on stack overflow so i feel compelled to ask you if you need an in-place sort what kind of big-o performance you re looking for and then ask you to choose between quicksort introsort heapsort mergesort and stoogesort for what will work best for you


imagick	gmagick	5
imagick seems to be very buggy at least when it comes to security so i choose gmagick as the second option

update graphicsmagick is faster than imagick doesn t means gmagick is better than imagick

imagick is more resource hungry than gmagick but when i tried to use gmagick it is not working properly

gmagick is newer version of imagick with more set of features it is less resource intensive and fast but the problem is there is very few discussion about this wonderful tool on web i recently came across this on

imagick i personally prefer gmagick which is the same pretty much


irrlicht	ogre3d	2
i prefer ogre3d to irrlicht over the structure of the api but it s entirely personal preference

ogre3d seems to be more mature than irrlicht judging by the amount of applications and games that is

coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.


javassist	bcel	1
here in so i found a lot of questions asking something similar and the answers normally said you can use cglib or asm or javassist is better than cglib or bcel is old and is dying or asm is the best because it gives x and y


unicode	ucs	1
according to wikipedia the bmp of the ucs has 65536 characters the latest version of unicode contains more than 107000 characters and the ucs has more than one million code points


mvp	presenter	11
my main and pretty noob question is it ok from an mvp perspective to have a presenter that communicates with more than one interactor or should just be one interactor per presenter

to summarise the differences controllers in the mvc have more control over the ui and handle events while a presenter in the mvp is more passive and just presents information through the ui

however since i m using mvp it have been more complicated than expected because i ll have to have a presenter for form foo with fields a and b then a presenter for bar with with field c and a reference to the presenter of foo so that it can inject the fields a and b into it

since the flow of logic is still basically a loop but the api boundaries of the presenter is a cleaner boundary than view in mvp which helps decouple v and m in mvp than is possible in mvc

the use of a presenter is closer to mvp and gets away from the dependency injection model advocated by apple mvc

mvc framework is suitable only for web applications while mvp can be more universal and can work for web forms and windows forms - views implement interfaces for presenter to use and views themselves handle implementation details pertaining to navigation

also this way mvp pattern becomes more testable as you can mock the view with fake object and test your presenter in unit tests

imho activity is your controller or perhaps presenter a la mvp is the better architectural analogy layout xml and their constituent views are the view layer and your database is your model

mvp offers greater seperation as your presenter have no knowledge of web centric concepts

i think you would lose a lot of those benefits with mvp as the view and presenter are more tightly coupled

i have been searching on the net and i made a couple of examples of both of them but i m even more confused because in some sample web pages mvp uses more than 2 interfaces to communicate the presenter with the view layer some ones even have completely blank interfaces only declarated but in other ones it only takes two interfaces to transport data from presenter to view


mathquill	mathjax	1
in short choose mathquill for editing katex for speed for mathjax for comprehensiveness


jtds	mssql-jdbc	1
both freetds and jtds support an older windows authentication scheme named ntlm while current versions of microsoft s jdbc driver for sql server mssql-jdbc no longer support that authentication mechanism


datediff	difference	16
for example if the start time was 8 55 and the end time 9 05 datediff hour ... would return 1 although the actual difference is much less just 10 minutes

so if there are two dates separated by one day the year difference can be 1 see select datediff year 20141231 20150101

the difference in minutes for a period of 3 years is approximately 1.5m select datediff mi 2010-01-01 2013-01-01 -- 1578240

i would recommend datediff for finding difference

datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds

generally you can use datediff to specify more narrow period if you would like this difference to be less than 10 days you could use

for me testing with a data set of 2508 records with dates evenly spread through a single year and joining the table to itself datepart performed significantly better than datediff the difference between datepart and month was negligable though datepart was typically 1ms faster

select datediff second 2012-02-29 09 00 00.000 2012-02-29 09 59 00.000 only gives 3540 which is difference of second

select datediff d sdcreatedate getdate to get the difference displayed

select datediff enddate startdate will return the difference which is 2 not 3

note that diffseconds can cause an overflow when the difference becomes larger than int32.maxvalue error the datediff function resulted in an overflow

i ve using the datediff method to get the difference b w two dates obtained using the date yyyy mm dd hh mm ss function but getting the output 0 every time even when the difference is more than 1 day

select datediff date1 date2 as difference

you can use datediff between the column date and your current date and retrieve only the lines where the difference is less than 7 like

you can then add datediff and a case statement to flag a new login where the difference is greater than your threshold

alexa	amazon	2
mycroft ai seems to have a nice stack of projects that offer functionality and programmer interface very similar to amazon alexa custom skills and you can host and modify it yourself to get more flexibility than alexa voice service but that s also a bit of a downside because you have to scale it yourself

you can find more information by amazon here link an alexa user with a user in your system


ffmpeg	libav	5
ubuntu 12.04 ships with the ffmpeg fork libav in version 0.8 which is more compatible with ffmpeg 1.0+ or even later ffmpeg versions iirc

not to be confused ffmpeg is more recent and libav was used in some distributions of linux

possible solution is building ffmpeg it s rather simple - i really don t understand why debian ubuntu prefers libav without alternative

occasionally ffmpeg or libav might be better suited but for most cases go with handbrake

the solution has a modular design and better performance than ffmpeg or libav at the current time


cufft	fftw	3
however for a variety of fft problem sizes i ve found that cufft is slower than fftw with openmp

in the experiments and discussion below i find that cufft is slower than fftw for batched 2d ffts

i am working on a code which needs to be time efficient and thus using cufft for this purpose but when i try to compute fft of a very large data in parallel it is slower than cpu fftw and the reason i find after finding the time for every line of code using high precision timing code is that cudamalloc taking around 0.983 sec while the time for rest of the lines of code is around 0.00xx sec which is expected ..


ecto	elixir	1
fortunately ecto 2.1 has a better alternative since it s supports the built-in calendrical types from elixir 1.3


jsf	wicket	11
while this is much less convenient than stateful wicket i still find much better than say stateless jsf or struts

i would advise you to try wicket it is very easy to learn much easier than jsf and it let s you re-use many existing components as well

icefaces is a component library for jsf you really should compare jsf to wicket

i won t go into the discussion whether wicket or jsf is better this is mostly a religious battle anyway but due to the popularity of jsf there are simply more people experienced with it and there is a large community offering many things for jsf like component libraries and extensions

for some people action based frameworks struts spring mvc are easier to grasp while for others component based ones jsf wicket come more natural

i can recommend wicket you won t have licence restrictions it s an apache licence and it s a time resistent solution jsf are too complex for simple use cases and struts is quite as complicated but a rather old technology

in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s ioc container makes it more powerful than wicket

i m in the hate it part so anything i said is biased plus in our test prototypes developing in wicket was faster than jsf

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt

reasons to choose wicket over jsf and spring mvc

to understand my pov in web programming i prefer wicket jsf in prototype i m quite new in groovy and no real project in grails


clearance	devise	1
i d recommend devise or clearance


graphlab	pandas	2
i only get the first column actually using graphlab package but i d prefer pandas

i m using the module graphlab in my python script and many more such as pandas and numpy etc graphlab module only works on python2 not for python3


ordinals	difference	1
the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the set of ordinals dates is one more than the length of the set


atom-editor	notepad++	1
we recommend notepad++ or atom-editor which are both free


theano	cudnn	3
userwarning your cudnn version is more recent than the one theano

usr local lib python2.7 dist-packages theano sandbox cuda init .py 600 userwarning your cudnn version is more recent than the one theano officially supports

finally i don t expect to learn many meaningful lessons from this benchmark both cntk and theano are calling the same cudnn implementation the advantages of cntk are more around higher level things such as a comes with a high-level library b the user doesn t have to worry about the batch and sequence axes except for a few specialized operations c efficient recurrent networks d efficient i o e easy distributed training


jquery	jqtransform	1
yes i would also recommend using jquery a very nice plugin is the jqtransform plugin


wideimage	phpthumb	1
wideimage is the more modern php5 approach while phpthumb has much more features


peer	p2p	1
also to be noted that p2p networks get stronger the more they grow you could aswell implement that peer already connected to the network and reachable from the outside help those others to connect to the other peers.you should look up p2p relaying and hole punching


passenger	unicorn	13
sergio suggested nginx + unicorn or nginx + puma but nginx + passenger which replaces unicorn puma is much easier to setup performs great uses less memory works better and has more features

i personally prefer passenger over thin unicorn having run nginx to thin backends for a long while just for the convenience but your proposed setup is fairly standard

memory optimizations - phusion passenger uses less memory than thin and unicorn

it does not have master worker as unicorn or passenger thus uses less memory

the better question to ask might be which one of passenger unicorn is a better fit for containerised rails apps

i d choose unicorn over passenger if only because passenger still doesn t offer rolling restarts

i m more familiar with unicorn but based on the documentation i ve read you shouldn t have to start passenger in a separate process

the passenger whether via apache or nginx or unicorn are much more established production ready application environments

unicorn and passenger are way better tools than mongrel clusters

in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

unicorn does not use less memory than passenger

if you choose passenger or unicorn you would not configure the server within your sinatra application file itself but instead typically configure it separately using a rackup config.ru file

it compares thin unicorn passenger torquebox glassfish and trinidad


theano	keras	6
should i be surprised that the keras theano backend is about 18x - 19x slower than the keras tensorflow backend

when training a neural net implemented in keras in a screen session i appear to be running into race conditions with theano

i would recommend using theano binary lstm link or keras tutorial for this because they are fairly simple to understand and are well documented

it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features

and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn

don t forget to choose theano as backend of keras


epplus	exceldatareader	1
honestly if you are annoyed by this i would recommend using epplus or exceldatareader this one only for reading the excel spreadsheets as alternative libraries


valgrind	glibc	1
to accomplish what you need you ideally match valgrind appropriately with glibc or use the macros in valgrind valgrind.h to work around them


fast-forward	merge	9
- if there is a parallel commit on the master branch you will always get a merge commit unless you select fast-forward only

fast-forward merge made this more difficult and i found that my team really

or you might be happier with a fast-forward merge

i pull switch back to master pull select merge choose my local dev branch under merge options i select squash under fast forward options i leave the default if a fast-forward only update the branch pointer the other options are if a fast-forward create a merge commit and if not a fast-forward fail

qa verifies functionality and approves or disapproves it then i m verifying code and if it is ok i merge his work into master by fast-forward or rebasing for better commits history

or whatever you branched from so the resulting history will appear i started from later version and the merge back will probably be fast-forward it s easier to work with especially since you are rewriting the actual history to logical changesets anyway

let s see in principle when merging b to master after the bug has been fixed and if the file with the bugfix was not touched in any of b s commits git should do a fast-forward merge and keep the newer already fixed file

if all goes well and people only added stuff on top of your feature branch your suggested merge should only do a fast-forward and keep morefeaturework up to date

it tries to do a fast-forward merge read more here but can t


latex	stargazer	1
stargazer is at least in my experience more general than latex from hmisc


devise	cancancan	2
i d recommend using devise + cancancan + rolify to authenticate your users and assign permissions based on their individual roles i.e admins can create delete edit or users can only view

for authentication i d recommend devise with devise_token_auth and for roles the cancancan gem


equals	charat	1
you create an object java.lang.string which inherit some methods which in the java.lang.string class like compare equals contains charat and more


filesystems	fat	11
since the filesystems is more than likely fat or fat32 protecting it permission based way would be more convoluted

as far as i know almost all filesystems support larger files than that a notable exception is of course fat 32

i d suggest to check the documentation of your filesystems regarding maximum file size but most modern filesystems don t have such low limits that 2gb 4gb applies to fat and some other old filesystems that are no longer broadly in use on servers

for fat filesystems that s less complicated but still you ll have to study the fs for a while

if you need to load from a well-defined filesystems fat or ntfs this is more tricky you have only 450 bytes of space because 60 of the 512 bytes are used by the filesystems internally for code that interprets the data of the filesystems finds the file containing the code and loads it into memory

granted fat is an easier problem but they claim to support many filesystems and it would be my first choice

what i ve outlined is a really simple but to be honest quite inefficient type of filesystems vaguely similar to what you might have seen on a really low-end computer 30+ years ago--but just for an obvious example even the ms-dos fat filesystems was more sophisticated

most modern filesystems are also considerably more complex than fat which would add further difficulty to the implementation

the mass storage media must be compatible with windows and mac therefore i choose fat as the filesystems file allocation table

actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

it s not too hard for the fat filesystems as it s quite simple and well documented but it s more difficult for ntfs as the filesystems is much more complicated and not-so-well documented


xtragrid	radgridview	1
i have used the .net s griddataview without any problems using the virtual mode while trying to show over 10000 rows but there are good products out there that are also very good in loading tons of data like developer express xtragrid and telerik s radgridview


bokeh	plotly	2
i can do this in bokeh but i have other issues regarding interactivity which plotly manages better

bokeh allows standalone htmls but plotly will be an easier option for me


onclick	onmouseup	1
note also that onclick would be much more appropriate than onmouseup for this


opencart	magento	6
i d have to say i d personally go for either prestashop or cscart as they do have a lot more features than opencart and at the same time also don t cost anywhere near magento to setup and run

both magento and opencart would be better options because both communities around them are entirely focused on ecommerce

magento is much better if you can find a good magento developer to customize it for you but opencart is easier to use

i m working on my first magento site and things are a little bit different than for example opencart but just trying to learn new things i decided to go with magento and try harder however there s one thing that i git stuck and is this i m calling my shopping cart elements using this

magento and opencart are more modern and all free

magento is way ahead and has larger extensions than opencart

most of the articles compare ferret lucene to ultrasphinx or possibly thinking sphinx but none that talk about searchlogic

i ve used ferret in the past with few problems although i ve heard sphinx is better


coverity	pc-lint	1
to go further than the compiler then static analysis tools such as coverity and pc-lint do stronger analysis


cocos2d-x	libgdx	3
performance i did some test with simple game similar to swing copters and found that game created with libgdx consumes 15-20 more ram on ios device that the same game created with cocos2d-x but then i used apportable to run cocos2d-x game on my android device and found it almost not playable

for integration with android native app libgdx is better because you can easily call android platform code through interfacing but if you choose cocos2d-x then you need to use jni that is slightly tough to use with objects

if familiar with java choose libgdx or cocos2d-x for c++


temp	tmp	1
it is better than c temp and c tmp though

bison	jison	1
indeed it would be relatively easy to preprocess a bison grammar file but it is easier with jison because you can compute the grammar programmatically and pass it to jison as a json object


jlabel	jeditorpane	1
however if i put a jeditorpane below this and have it span the length of the whole window the jlabel becomes larger and grows if i enlarge the window


chmod	mkdir	1
i recommend using chmod after mkdir


cmmotionmanager	uiaccelerometer	1
basically it seems like cmmotionmanager is much larger and slower than uiaccelerometer is


avassetwriter	avassetreader	1
in my experience avassetexportsession is slightly more performant than using avassetreader and avassetwriter for a straight forward format a - format b type conversion however that said it s probably not by enough to be too concerned about


strftime	strtotime	1
this is better than strtotime and strftime because it does not try to guess what is the format of the date but rather use the date format you provide


pylons	turbogears	5
others prefer turbogears and or pylons maybe bfg maybe grok maybe zope maybe plone

you may want to look at turbogears which is built on top of pylons and has more out of the box things for you to use

compare the very active django tag on stack overflow with that of pylons or turbogears though and i d argue getting started is simply easier with django irrespective of anything to do with code

the difference between pylons and pyramid are the merge of repoze.bfg and turbogears which brings more api resources

as far as python frameworks go i personally prefer django over turbogears or pylons which i believe also have admin interfaces because it seems much simpler to get installed setup and running


unixodbc	iodbc	2
the iodbc included with os x has some things that are listed as deprecated and i ve had better luck with unixodbc in the past

one of the other posts recommends unixodbc or iodbc as starting points however this will not work


arp	icmp	1
in addition seeing arp being slower than icmp doesn t necessarily mean icmp isn t deprioritized---it might mean bandwidth is insufficient to hit the limiting threshold


enlive	hiccup	2
select the right overall web framework - clojure has quite a few already but i d strongly recommend ring - see this excellent video one ring to bind them plus either fleet or enlive or hiccup depending on your templating philosophy

other then hiccup and enlive there is the lesser known fleet which is closer to popular ruby php solutions


nsview	ikimagebrowserview	1
while i haven t used nscollectionview myself my gut feeling is that there s probably going to be a greater overhead with numerous nsview s compared to ikimagebrowserview which uses the standard coupling of an nsview with an nscell -like reusable drawing mechanism to help improve performance


fileoutputstream	filechannel	1
i don t see any reason why filechannel could be any faster than fileoutputstream in this case


pyodbc	adodbapi	1
i am not sure but by reading the documentation i think you need to download the pyodbc it seems to be better supported than adodbapi


primes	square-root	1
iterate over the primes already found which are less than the square-root of p


scheme	prolog	1
in scheme or prolog it s often less than a page of code


pandas	seaborn	3
while i still recommend seaborn and raw matplotlib over the plotting interface in pandas it turns out that you can pass as a kwarg to df.plot.box which will pass it as a kwarg to df.plot which will pass is as a kwarg to matplotlib.axes.boxplot

i also think working with seaborn is much easier using pandas dataframes and not numpy arrays

for similar functionality that speaks pandas but has more flexible features you could use the facetgrid object from seaborn


wordpress	elgg	1
it is working only for simple .php files but wordpress is more complex and after long period of loading it show elgg nothing found site loaded


menhir	ocamlyacc	1
this is actually the syntax of ocamlyacc which you should not use if you start a new project in that case you should use menhir which has a more readable syntax and is better for numerous other reasons


omnipay	ci-merchant	1
i recommend using omnipay the successor to ci-merchant as this uses guzzle for http connections which comes bundled with the latest root ssl certificate so you don t need to worry about your server having them installed


jmeter	neoload	1
for load testing jmeter is better option but you have quite enough funding then go for loadrunner neoload rational performance tester and for cloud try blazemeter


sin	sqrt	5
if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

an two for a function like sqrt i could probably write my own constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there away around it

the jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still faster

abs acos and asin atan atan2 average choose columns concatenate cos count counta countblank countif date datevalue daverage day dcount dcounta ddb degrees dget dmax dmin dproduct dstdev dstdevp dsum dvar dvarp error.type exact exp fact find fv hlookup hour if index int irr isblank iserr iserror islogical isna isnontext isnumber istext left len ln log log10 lookup lower match max mid min minute mod month n na not now nper npv or pi pmt power product proper pv radians rand rank rate replace rept right round rows second sin sln sqrt stdev stdevp substitute sum sumifs sumproduct syd t tan time timevalue today trim trunc upper value var varp vlookup year false and true

it s like asking whether sin is faster than sqrt


qtcpsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager	1
qnetworkaccessmanager is higher level than qhttp and qtcpsocket so they have abstracted away the sockets connection state


smartgit	gitkraken	1
i think you should use gitkraken it will be better than smartgit on ubuntu


respond.js	modernizr	1
first off based on the forums i have been reading you should not include respond.js from modernizr they are more than likely going to drop it


maven	pom.xml	91
i want to set up a spring boot project using the spring initializr but i was wondering about the difference in the project type you can choose between maven project or maven pom.xml

also find projects that are utilizing maven and look into their pom.xml configurations learn more about what is possible with maven

1 in netbean file- new project- select maven in left pane - select project with existing pom.xml on right pane and finish

right click on your pom.xml file select maven add plugin

but when i right click the pom.xml file and select maven build it gives me the below error

keep in mind that a maven project is more than just the pom.xml file it also conforms to the maven standard directory layout and more but that should get you started

when i create a new jbpm project in eclipse and select create as maven project the pom.xml is generated without the dependency section

you already know the answer to the very oriented body of your question there is no ant equivalent to this minimal pom.xml because unlike maven ant does not define a set of standards patterns conventions in other words a lingua franca or shared language for project management that would make it possible so ant can t beat maven on this sample

now to add a dependency either right-click the project and select maven add dependency or edit the pom.xml manually

right click the pom.xml file and select maven - reimport

i definited maven build with select pom.xml file after installed eclipse and team explorer everywhere for team foundation server on my client computer

if your project is a maven project then you can just right-click on the pom.xml file and select add as maven project

this is a more general problem with maven 2 it doesn t allow any pom.xml code reuse expect properties and custom plugins

converting to maven requires more work -- afaik there is no official tool or wizard that allows you to generate a full pom.xml configuration from an existing eclipse project

and when i run maven with -f pom.xml2 option as reactor with projectb specified as module it looks like that it picks pom.xml2 from the projecta and it picks pom.xml from projectb

when you remove it from pom.xml - it remains in the run configuration even if it does not show up in the project explorer s maven context menu maven select maven profiles ...

i agree with khmarbaise above the versions-maven-plugin will do just this or you could move to the maven release plugin if you want a much heftier approach to managing your versions but you could also just run a script to sed the pom.xml file using jenkins build_number environment variable which is a quicker and dirtier approach

you can also start by adding pom.xml for an existing module of your project right click on it in the project tree add framework support... choose maven

in maven projects tool window click on green + button and select pom.xml of a dependency

in intellij idea in the right navigation bar i click add maven projects choose pom.xml then intellij always shows resolving maven dependencies in background tasks

if you right click on the pom.xml you can select maven - add dependency - which will search the default repositories

i am able to create a maven project but when trying to add dependencies select pom.xml - dependencies - add artifactid s enter groupid artifactid or sha1 prefix or pattern which are inputted are not getting displayed

right click your pom.xml file and select maven - reimport

the solution that worked for me was to right click project pom.xml in eclipse and select maven install

or right click your pom.xml and pick maven like so

when i now right click my project in eclipse and the choose maven update project it never seems to go to the repository on my testapp and get the missing jar files instead i just have project reference problems and problems in the pom.xml file

it asks me to select maven projects and has a file structure as it should be-parent project pom.xml and 3 child projects poms with a checkbox beside all 4 items

with the transitive dependencies declared even if they are used explicitly the maven pom.xml becomes more verbose

setting project.build.sourceencoding to utf-8 like you did should work but i think eclipse cannot pick up this change from the pom.xml automatically you have to give it a gentle push right-click on the project and select maven update project.

it has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but it does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven

right click on pom.xml click on maven select maven clean or maven install

if you haven t used maven here s how you import one of the springsource example projects in sts download the project unzip it if you downloaded the archive go in sts in project - import and choose existing maven project and browse to the location in which the pom.xml file in the unzipped project is

select exisiting maven projects and point to the directory containing pom.xml file in the cloned repo

i would recommend maven assembly to be in your pom.xml for packaging

maven uses the classifier construct for artefacts build from the same pom.xml but differing in there content for example one for jdk1.6 or jdk1.7

proceed as follows at least in eclipse select pom.xml right-click run as maven build.

another way to build the ear file is using the m2e plugin right click on the parent pom.xml file and choose maven install then start the application server and use the wls deploy in order to deploy the ear file

to see a full example of a maven pom.xml that includes more libraries from play look at the sample pom.xml included in the play-pure-maven-plugin s repository

that way they are in a separate file that can be parsed a bit easier than a maven pom.xml

right click on pom.xml run as you should see the list of m2 options if you have maven installed you can select maven clean from there

despite the fact that the sub-dependency was specified on its own elsewhere in the pom.xml maven used the older version that was pulled in as a sub-dependency

i googled but no resolve can help me.one of the suggestion was the go in properties-deployment assemble-add-java build path entries and to select maven dependency but when i click on java build it shows me nothing.here is my pom.xml

i could deactivate this in the build path and add each corresponding dependency in my pom.xml but i m afraid this would lead maven to deploy them again in my webapp web-inf libs

i add the plugin to my pom.xml like so you will need to upgrade maven to v3.1 or higher to use the plugin

but thn i get presented with a setup maven plugin connectors dialog and the pom.xml file shows more errors

first you need to make sure that eclipse and maven are playing together correctly so that when you add dependency to you pom.xml eclipse will recognize them too and your eclipse project setup and structure match with maven

in some case the project does not have the maven nature then right click on the pom.xml and select aadd as maven pom.xml

i would also recommend maven for handling your dependencies in this case your pom.xml would look like

you would be able to circumvent this by first running mvn clean install on magnicompcommon s pom.xml then on model pom.xml but this is much easier done by invoking maven directly on the root pom.xml

yes - you should be able to right click the pom.xml choose run as and for example choose maven install corresponds to mvn install or define the phases to be processed under maven build.

if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files

since having a single maven module produce more than one artifact is generally a bad idea it would be best if you isolate this in a maven module of type pom.xml so that this would be its only artifact

i should also mention that i m running the project in eclipse so ideally what i would want to do is right-click on the pom.xml click on run-as and select maven test

sure there is a learning curve with maven but reading a pom.xml is far easier than reading a build.xml

when work in sts springsource tool suite open pom.xml file and check dependencies in dependencies tab add select maven dependency will give 0 result found

my ide is eclipse luna 4.4.2 so i saved the new pom.xml file right click project select maven - updated the project then i right click the project select run as - run on server select tomcat server and it failed to load the content and the error page looks like this

so i looked in the local maven repo and realized i had not updated by target project pom.xml to use the newer snapshot version of the connector project

open pom.xml in eclipse id- overview- artifactid- packaging select pom.xml from dropdown - save then create new maven module

note that the files linked are unlikely to be updated so i would recommend using maven which should download all of the correct libraries based on the version number in your pom.xml file

3 then right click in pom.xml and choose add as maven project

once the set of projects has been validated maven now does some more parsing of those pom.xml files to construct the list of build extensions if any and the list of plugins

compare pom.xml with effective-pom.xml and see what maven does for you out of the box

to not having too much trouble with the maven-release-plugin and the multi-module parent project be sure to put your parent pom.xml one directory upper all your child pom.xml it s the designed recommend by maven but unfortunately sometimes eclipse users don t follow it because eclipse don t like hierarchical projects

in idea you need to right click on pom.xml file and choose maven - reimport

that doesn t cover some of the more fundamental problems with maven such as its namespaces breaking java namespaces and xml namespaces it s build unit the pom.xml having no relation to anything in the actual deployment environment think about it when you separate via poms what are you actually accomplishing in the finished product

type in maven in the filter field and select maven pom.xml file

grab maven dependency xml and put it to your pom.xml file

i would personally recommend using maven and a basic pom.xml would then look like this

from that dialog you can select existing maven projects where you need to navigate to the highest directory containing a pom.xml file

using any kind of non-trivial maven pom.xml makes is more visible though

i have the exact same problem and exact exception but i solved the problem just by specify package type of pom.xml to war like war and right click the project and select maven update project configuration then re-deploy that web module to tomcat server that s it

if i right click on my project and select maven -- update project configuration after modifying the pom.xml file etc m2e seems to re-order the build path libraries so that maven dependencies come after the jre system libs which i don t want

when maven is going deeper it falls back to normal pom.xml

right click the pom.xml file and select open with maven pom.xml editor

when i select pom.xml and right click there is no maven run option

to resolve the issue right click in the resolved dependencies pane in the pom.xml dependency hierarchy and choose exclude maven atrifact

1 i choose pom.xml for making maven project

error failed to execute goal org.eclipse.tycho tycho-packaging-plugin 0.15.0 validate-version default-validate-version on project org.sonatype.m2e.subclipse osgi version 1.1.1.qualifier in meta-inf manifest.mf does not match maven version 1.1.1-mine in pom.xml

right-click the file then select open with maven pom.xml editor

for those who are more comfortable with maven you could add this dependency to your pom.xml file

if you already have pom.xml in your project right-click on pom.xml and select add as maven project option then intellij will process your file and import your dependencies

right click the pom.xml - select maven profile - chosen ticked openshift-dev

right click on your pom.xml or your project in eclipse and select debug as and then maven install or if you want an other maven goal select maven build...

assuming you are using eclipse you right click the pom.xml choose maven -- update project

right-click on the pom.xml file and select run as maven build.

assume this plugin config is in a parent pom.xml only maven super pom.xml is higher up in the hierarchy

it will depend on the complexity of your builds if you have basic java builds then maven might be more suited as the pom.xml files maven build filds are pretty simple but if you need to do a lot of custom specific stuff you may well end up having ant scripts to perform also if you already have one system in place there isnt necessarily a huge advantage of swapping

one more thing as in maven we can update or if we save the pom.xml file maven downloads all those dependency automatically

create a pom.xml in the project root then right-click on it and choose add as maven project

alternatively right click on pom.xml and select maven - add dependency .

right click project pom.xml in eclipse and select maven install


ng-show	ng-class	1
edit as mentioned by chandresh using the ng-show directive with a true false value would be a better option than using ng-class


istanbul	lcov	1
istanbul has more complete coverage stats not just lines - branches etc and can export to lcov for tools like code climate


stringbuilder	stringwriter	2
building on the previous good answers stringwriter is actually much more versatile than stringbuilder providing lots of overloads

stringbuilder or stringwriter are a better choice


clang	icc	3
gcc7 finally changed it to match icc and clang

with gcc and clang your sse code is better whereas icc is a looser

should i suppose that the lengthy simd versions emitted by clang gcc with -o3 icc should run faster than the above one emitted by gcc with -o2


ggmap	googlevis	1
i recommend ggmap googlevis and or rgooglemaps


stringbuilder	stringtokenizer	1
stringtokenizer is faster than stringbuilder


strlen	toupper	1
any decent libc will have an efficient strlen that s much faster than looping a byte at a time so separate vectorized strlen and toupper loops are faster


sum	datepart	4
did something like select sum qty datepart hh saletime

from select sum mainv1.number as totalbk datepart yyyy mainv1 . proddate 1 1 - right 0 datepart m mainv1 . proddate 1 1 2 as groupmonth

select datepart week my_date sum quantity

declare totalwaitingminutesoverall int select sum datepart mi isnull departuretime getdate - arrivaltime


sum	floor	4
for a fixed value of m the numbers to choose are ceil n-m m+1 and floor n-m m+1 in whatever combination makes the sum work out

for your algorithm i think your are trying to pick floor n 2 items and find it s maximum sum of value as array1 sum... if this is not your original thought then please ignore the following lines

edit as suggested by gregor the r code can be better written as sum floor sqrt x 10

this formula fails for integers whose sum is an odd -ve number as their floor is one less than their average


svm	cross-validation	1
however for the other question making svm run faster in python this solution is not likely to enhance performance either as it involves additional cross-validation and does not support parallelization


isapi	iirf	1
i would recommend iirf ionic s isapi rewrite filter which is a rewriter for iis that unlike isapi_rewrite is completely free for the full functionality


ubuntu	mint	3
you install ubuntu i recommend linux mint 17.2 rafaela - xfce rc 32-bit as it s lighter on your cpu and ram and dual boot

i applied some delay 100ms to loopback interface using netem tc command on a ubuntu machine mint to be more specific

if you don t want to change your operating system which i would suggest as mint ubuntu are quite easier for programming ruby you can use pik


filesystems	xfs	7
xfs filesystems documentation has some comments on how to select filesystems block size - it is also possible to defined the directory block size

ext4 is a reasonably mature modern filesystems while xfs is older but still quite reliable

i prefer xfs so we create an xfs filesystems on dev volgroup logvol1

a filesystems such as xfs is more suitable for this

some filesystems such as xfs try harder to provide good aio behaviour in comparison other filesystems but even there a user still has to be very careful as to avoid operations that will trigger synchrony

actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job


happy	cup	1
i will be happy to hear more insights regarding what causes the extra time to elapse - 10msec sounds as eternity for a modern cpu - though i am not familiar with the specs of the ipod cpu it s ipod 4g and wikipedia says the cup is powervr sgx gpu 535 200 mhz


notepad++	textpad	3
i know there currently isn t a maxscript syntax definition for sublimetext2 but is it possible to easily either convert an existing syntax set from say notepad++ or textpad or create one more of a daunting prospect as i wouldn t know where to begin

i typically use and prefer notepad++ to look at text files but on this server only textpad is installed

i prefer notepad++ myself after using textpad for many years but always keep textpad on my system for multiline regular expressions and a few other things it does well


firepath	firebug	4
while there are a number of good tools for this i like to recommend firebug and firepath addons for firefox

btw - if you do have xpath issues i would recommend installing firebug and firepath and open the website in firefox

i recommend installing firebug and firepath to give you an insight as to how to create and try out different xpath and cssselector

firefinder is good but i started with and prefer firepath for firebug


sfdc	salesforce	1
if that is the case i d recommend having salesforce send the generated sfdc child session id into the iframe as you are doing and then store that on your end in the asp session


autofac	castle-windsor	2
how am i supposed to choose between castle-windsor unity structuremap spring.net autofac ninject funq linfu etc etc

right now we choose between autofac and castle-windsor


scribe	twitter4j	1
i have an app that uses the public part of the twitter api the on who not requires to login but with the update the login is required so i need to implement oauth i ve seen there are libraries like twitter4j who makes this easier but my app has a lot of code and i don t wanna rewrite it not now so i ve think to use scribe or oauth-signpost but i dont realy know how to


atomic	interlocked	1
but consider this it s literally impossible to do any better than interlocked operations for cross-process communication with atomic updates and no locks are held


gauge	progress	1
--progress type select progress gauge type


loops	if-statement	2
if you have to limit the number of questions to 10 i would recommend replacing loops with this if-statement

nevertheless i need a dynamic list for my loops with nested loops which is processed more than 500 times and multiple if-statement therefore the arraylist


rtos	isr	1
an rtos could equally trap the usage of a non-isr safe call in an isr and run a more specific error handler if it does not bother to do so then the resulting behaviour might trigger a usage fault


explode	fgetcsv	1
you will probably find that php s built-in fgetcsv will be easier and more accurate than a manual explode based strategy


text-align	height	1
in a two column table where both columns are set to valign top and the text is set to text-align baseline if an image exists in the first row of the second column and the image height is taller than the text itself the text in both columns is not aligned


theano	tensorflow	11
tensorflow is better at marketing itself than long-time players of the open-source market like torch and theano

should i be surprised that the keras theano backend is about 18x - 19x slower than the keras tensorflow backend

theano is still faster than tensorflow in many respects and supports a wider range of operations

keep in mind that the somewhat by-construction-approach used by theano tensorflow will be more efficient because of the more defined input and because these two libraries are a bit more evolved

i believe some other frameworks such as theano go farther than tensorflow in proposing deterministic operations

it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features

tensorflow and theano are better at 2nd order gradient differentiation

it theano runs much faster than tensorflow

but to be specific -- i am trying to compare theano speed vs tensorflow speed with some of my more complex computations with a much larger dataset size

tensorflow has better computational graph visualizations than theano and torch

in my testing the slow-down from using tensorflow ranges from about 1.5-3.0 times slower than using theano but its performance will depend on your application


knitr	latex	4
you might want to use r markdown and knitr which is easier than using latex and r as also zhaoy suggested

you may want to see how the default chunk hook for latex is defined in knitr to know better how the chunk hook works

even when latex editors support knitr their support makes working with .rnw files much clunkier than pure latex .tex files

i am using rstudio with knitr etc to make reproducible reports and want to have the best versions i can for both word documents and pdf - i prefer working with latex but the end-users tend to prefer the flexibility of editable word documents


nunit	typemock	1
at my company since we started unit testing with nunit and typemock we reach higher code coverage and release the software in a shorter time to market


webkit	gecko	14
webkit is stricter than gecko

it s called web audio api and is currently a draft but is well supported by webkit you ll need to use prefixes and a little less by gecko

you will need to choose between webkit and gecko depending on your requirements

anyway i just prefer not to use it because gecko is slower then webkit

my understanding is webkit is pretty good smaller than gecko

i m developing with canvas too and have found that webkit based browsers in general handle canvas operations quicker than gecko in most cases

somehow webkit seems to do better than gecko on the html5 single-page spec scripts and i can t figure out why at this point

so the easiest way is to use one either webkit or gecko webkit has probably better support for svg these days plus i can t find package of gecko right now

gecko seems to like anti-aliasing more than webkit

which of these gecko or webkit uses less memory in general case

fwiw i was able to solve my problem with greensock using tweenmax to animate individual paths inside and this worked in firefox gecko and webkit browsers safari google-chrome it does a better job of calculating the origin not exactly sure how but it worked for me

gecko is often considered to consume less memory than webkit but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented

some user agents like those based on gecko implement this requirement and others like those based on webkit are less strict

it is to be lamented that ms instead of following the lead given by webkit and gecko engines have decided to add yet more browser extensions and hacks to muddy the waters instead of going for plain adherence to the standards


base	fractions	3
so while for the integral part you divide by base to move the more significant digits towards the decimal point for the fractions part you have to multiply by base to move the less significant digits towards the decimal

memory use is a fractions of that used by the non-paged version at just under 600 kilobytes for a hundred million and just over 600 kilobytes for one billion which slight increase is just the extra space required for the base primes less than the square root of the range list

fractions exponents are considerably more difficult since it means essentially calculating an nth-root of the base where and multiplying the result by the result of the integer portion power calculation


magento	expressionengine	1
thinking you can format magento blocks any better in a cms such as expressionengine and use magento just for the backend will put you on a hiding to nothing to end up with a fairly useless setup that isn t going to go anywhere


ireport	subreports	3
now select the subreports then go to the property tab and it won t run in ireport and select subreports expression there you have to give the path of your subreports which is in jasperserver in this

if you are using ireport to create reports then open the main report in ireport and select subreports and go to the property section of the report click on parameters property and click on copy from master tab

if your report is complicated and have many subreports and subdatasets its better to go this approach since ireport will make it quicker and easier for you to design and maintain later


gridview	entitydatasource	1
i have entitydatasource with gridview is there any way to make the data in entitydatasource to be lower or upper case


jpype	py4j	1
in terms of performance py4j has a bigger overhead than both of the previous solutions jython and jpype because it relies on sockets but if performance is critical to your application accessing java objects from python programs might not be the best idea


uu-parsinglib	parsec	4
uu-parsinglib is definitely worth the time to explore but i would suggest that getting familiar with parsec first is the better course for these reasons

it seems that the idea of uu-parsinglib it to be more declarative than parsec so you just have pure

looking briefly at the list-like combinators for uu-parsinglib i m more familiar with parsec i think you can solve this by folding over the result of the psome combinator

if you are decoding some formatted file rather than something like a programming language attoparsec or similar might be better than parsec or uu-parsinglib


moq	nmock	1
this is another reason why i d prefer rhinomocks and moq over nmock nmock uses the older expectation style whereas rhinomocks and moq both support the arrange act assert approach where you specify you expected interactions as assertions at the end of the test like this


hibernate	jdbi	3
other useful pieces would be jdbi for database access much simpler than hibernate or other full orms async-httpclient for doing calls to other web services

since i am new to this framework i want to know which option i should choose hibernate or jdbi

i have really enjoyed the simplicity of jdbi and here are a couple of reasons why i prefer it over hibernate


getc	fputs	1
using fgets and fputs is faster than multiple calls to getc and putc all you need is a buffer a little buffer in this case to store the current line


createjs	easeljs	2
click the button and select easeljs createjs in the long list

and found out that framerate of createjs easeljs is much worse in firefox than in google-chrome ie


np-hard	subset-sum	1
the subset-sum problem is hard more precisely it s np-complete which means that your variant is hard too it s not np-complete because it s not a decision problem but it is np-hard


vundle	pathogen	4
also i tried installing pathogen and that worked for some bundles but would not work for perlomni.vim because it was an ftplugin and pathogen was not appending the bundles correctly and after research i saw most people saying vundle was better than pathogen

surround.vim is easily installed with either pathogen or vundle personally i prefer vundle

personally i prefer vundle but janus uses pathogen

i followed this howto which recommends vundle over pathogen


range	minimum	46
to summarize the problem given time range t1 and t2 on day d how can i determine the remaining time left in d that is longer than the minimum time block m

i need the navigator to select range to a minimum of 1 month

i need to be able to select minimum and maximum value for the range

n s e w nw sw ne se. you keep going until the distance to the buckets and therefore all the points in them is greater than your minimum range

the smallest most negative value that does not cause a range error is the one greater than the minimum exponent minus the number of bits of mantissa

if you take the binary search approach then there is scope for doing this smartly - spotting when successive tests in the same binary search return the same letter and so assuming that as a minimum range size then aborting any possible range that s shorter than that - but chances are you d do better to code this up using the separate searches

how do i compare range that have the same minimum value and remove that element if the maximum value is greater than the other

if the 32-bit float range is larger than -1..1 then you need to find the minimum and maximum values and calculate a scale factor that gets the samples within the int16 range

i want to combine range where the difference b w minimum and maximum of another range with respect to the considered range is less than or equal to 300 i e

this is slightly better than the minimum allowed for mediump as it can represent all of the ints in the range -2048 to 2048 source not the -1024 to 1024 that you re worrying about

but if there are less birds than the minimum spawns to wait for an argument out of range error would be thrown

to get the same difference with two different numbers one of them has to be either less than the minimum or more than the maximum of the initial range which is contradictory

for each low end of the range find the minimum high end of a range that is greater than or equal to the low end or in sql

but even with the minimum required range it s more than big enough for your loop

if the value is less than the minimum value of the range it should throw a numberlowexception

i have hinted at my analysis of the problem finding the common range of depth values across all datasets and you should be able to track through how i have implemented this in excel to cater for cases where some datasets might contain depth values which are less than the minimum of the common range or which are greater than its maximum or possibly both

i want to validate a number as decimal up to two decimal and minimum range is greater than 0.00 and max range is up to 99.99

minimum 1.6.0 is not less then range maximum 1.0.0 inclusion is

for this reason you need to either try and be smarter than just setting a limit or set you limit a bit higher than the minimum operating range of the sensor

how about for integer values you specify a range and a predicate that specifies the value must be greater than minimum less than maximum instead

basically the result is to find a criteria in row and then in other range find minimum higher than 0 and maximum value

what i can t seem to wrap my head around is how to determine the minimum value for the second argument to range that can guarantee the last value in the range is greater than max_val

but my problem is that the maximum and minimum salary are not known or if the range are smaller then i had to write alot of codes to get the result

therefore there is no hard guarantee saying that the size of long must be equal to or greater than that of size_t but by current implementation standards say 2 s complement representation long will always be larger than the minimum size of size_t by virtue of having to store a larger range than that which is currently equivalent to that which can be stored by size_t minimally

how to get random number between given range in java if minimum is more than 1

if there is a run for a particular serialnum earlier than the minimum date of the range it won t be excluded

the cause for an integer overflow is when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value

to date is greater than the minimum date lesser than the larger date but not in range

if you use the range compression consider setting the required distance at least as large as the expected rms error for the gps device likly to be about 5m minimum use a longer distance if you can stand it

the -7 argument is less than the minimum allowed range of 0

this obviously means that range is less than its minimum of 1

for any particular set of hyperparameters this range is much closer to the minimum response than to the maximum

the objective function is guaranteed to be finite and contionuous in the interpolation range along with its first and second derivatives and has no more than one minimum in this range if it has no minimum it is monotonic

the maximum length is only one more than the minimum length abc de fgh i jkl mn opq has seven sub-lists as well but the range of lengths is two here

even though the minimum range requirements for int and short are the same in a typical modern implementation the range of int is usually greater than the range of short

you may initialize both scores to an value lower than the minimum for instance if scores range from 0 to 10 you may initialize them in -1

once macro triggered input box asks me to select range where it has similar subject lines then input box ask me to give minimum number of range to be created then it names range in first column as empty range 1 2 and so on

figuring out the necessary exponent range is much more straightforward if you can describe the max and min possible absolute values of your input you can easily find suitable corresponding binary minimum and maximum exponent

for example the language standard only mandates minimum range for types like short int and long but they may be wider than the minimum requirements

145 the output is like â ºâ â â ºâ â it doesn t reverse when the range is higher than 145 it works fine in gcc for borland turboc the minimum range must be 65 otherwise the program prints strange values instead of reversing it

now you can see in the product.rb i want to fetch the product based on the price so that in the with_min_range the result will be the products whose variants minimum price range will be greater than the value of min

the reductive point here is the expression can actually be simplified to just the range that has the greater minimum value and the lesser maximum value

at each step if both indices are in range i m and j n choose minimum of a i b j and write it to c k

the above statement reads if pay is greater than minimum range or less than maximum range then do things

the unfortunate side effect is that half your circle will be cut off as it extends into the range that is less than your minimum value

a range is contiguous when there is no value one smaller than the minimum and no value one bigger than the maximum and there is no gap within the range


notepad	scite	1
you could use notepad or textpad but i use and recommend scite


audiotoolbox	avfoundation	1
can someone if i should use the avfoundation or whether the audiotoolbox library is better


spweb	spsite	1
since spsite takes a longer url you may also be able to open the right spweb as well using site.openweb


datamapper	activerecord	19
with datamapper this is somewhat more work than with activerecord which provides it s own db tasks

datamapper is newer than activerecord

i prefer datamapper because it has only dataccesss logic instead of activerecord use business logic in

codeignitter is using activerecord something that uses datamapper could be faster not sure if you can change that though most probably you can havent use codeignitter

datamapper idea is definitely better than activerecord

from my point of view the datamapper model is much easier to grasp but since activerecord is the defacto standard it feels weird to change the orm just for this little problem

i don t know whether this port of cql3 to ruby support activerecord it acts more like a simple datamapper but it worths having a look

also datamapper is much more ruby syntax friendy and features like lazy loading when doing chainable conditions like activerecord in rails 3 are there from the beginning

datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord

i have searched it in google but most of the articles talk about how to use database cleaner gem with activerecord but none of them clearly specify how to use databasecleaner gem with datamapper

if what you want is to compare activerecord rails and datamapper hibernate the data source architectural patterns chapter from patterns of enterprise application architecture is a good place to start

datamapper is much smarter then activerecord

so a question for those who know better is datamapper newer than activerecord

i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install

so far the only legitimate reason i ve found to use datamapper over activerecord is that datamapper is better in terms of the single responsibility principle -- because the database rows are not the actual objects being persisted but with propel that doesn t really concern me because it s generated code anyway

you can compare activerecord with datamapper or sequel

both use the activerecord pattern so you ll actually get your database tables back in objects without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe

the level of abstraction of datamapper is way higher than the activerecord s

activerecord is much simpler then a datamapper but also much more limited


optgroup	textarea	2
if i m not mistaken only button input select textarea optgroup option and fieldset elements can actually have the disabled attribute

according to w3c recommendations the following html elements can be disable button input select textarea optgroup option and fieldset so if you want to disable a table then it is not possible because it do not has any disable attribute


jspm	npm	3
jspm is more commonly used to bring in client-side front-end libraries and npm for server-side ones

assuming that you are building a webapp jspm is more suitable for managing your frontend dependencies than npm

lately i have been experiencing that an jspm install more often then not results in a status 500 being returned by the server whenever angular packages are being downloaded via npm


gtk	motif	1
gtk and qt are two of the most common ones these days but there are others such as motif which is older and doesn t look as nice


rtf	odf	1
is html better than odf as a templating markup for generating emails letters documentation for rtf pdf


jslint	sublimelinter	2
also i recommend jslint in sublimelinter package over jslint

if your sublime plugin only supports jslint i can highly recommend sublimelinter which is what i use


coldspring	model-glue	1
fortunately model-glue has tight integration with coldspring a popular bean container for cfml and model-glue 3 makes it easier than ever to use coldspring beans in your controllers


devise	sorcery	2
check out sorcery it s more lightweight and less obscure than devise

it s easy to use a gem for this such as devise which does a lot or sorcery which does less so may be easier to understand and alter as you like


gson	jackson	72
i m only interested in a small subset of properties of the json so gson was nice because of its very concise syntax but i m losing an internal battle to continue to use gson as jackson is already used elsewhere in our application and it has documented better performance which i concede are both good reasons to lose gson

try this lib that s a good one with the jackson we use only in the server side because jackson is more slow in the android than gson at least in our test

org.json jackson and gson with gson being 10x slower

gson is a popular choice for solving this problem however we find jackson to be more performant since it supports alternative ways of processing json streaming in-memory tree model and traditional json-pojo data binding

i heard about jackson and gson they are better than json.simple

i highly recommend abandoning gson in favor of jackson whenever possible.

i am surprised these have not been mentioned but instead of using bare-bones rather manual process with json.org s little package gson and jackson are much more convenient to use

although jackson s nexttoken will work like skipvalue gson seems more flexible to me

you will see that the jackson outperforms gson in here

note that other libraries like gson and jackson have much better abstractions for json arrays and objects jsonarray arraynode

jackson type safety is way better than gson

we plan to use gson extensively in the application as it seems safer and better than jackson

if your json is quite big i recommend using gson or jackson libraries

i use and would recommend jackson but you could use gson also if you wanted

i looked at gson metrics and it seems slower than jackson

multiple posts on the internet point toward jackson as having better parsing performance than gson granting somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-30 speed improvement

for 1 see this benchmark i did using jmh which compares jackson gson genson fastjson org.json jsonp performance of serializers and deserializers using stream and databind apis

large objects google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json

i suggest you to ditch it and use gson or jackson which are fare more advanced

under some conditions gson has proven to be a lot faster than jackson there also exists jsonp and json.simple

gson and jackson are better to use

spring recommends using jackson for json serailaisation so when gson is used it causes some problems

gson is faster with smaller documents and jackson is faster with large documents

very small object google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json

aside if milliseconds make a big difference look at the stream parses that both jackson and gson provide for faster raw acess but you will be in charge of parsing logic and rebuilding your objects which may be a net loss

jackson is more suitable if you have a complex deep json tree because gson creates a lot of temporary objects which leads to stop the world gcs

jackson is faster but the api is 37x more complex than the gson api

gson 1.6 now includes a low-level streaming api and a new parser which is actually faster than jackson

gson is not particularly fast but the jackson library can almost compete with most binary serializers jackson is 2-4x faster than gson in most situations and 10-20x faster on utf-8 because it has special code for utf-8

android comes with basic json parsing classes and there are other libraries available gson jackson that offer greater feature sets

while this does work i prefer jackson as we use it everywhere else in our stack nothing against gson just don t want to add it as a dependency right now

based on jackson s streaming api logansquare is able to consistently outperform gson and jackson s databind library by 400 or more1

all in all jackson is considered to be faster but i ve also read that gson gives better performance when working with large objects

going to go ahead and say that gson is a lot more user friendly albeit less powerful than jackson

i found jackson better than gson performance project activity better docs ...

personally i prefer jackson as according to test benchmarks it s faster than gson

quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson

it seems gson is more faster than jackson the average time of gson is about 2ms while jackson is about 16ms does i make mistake when using jackson

also please suggest me an open source json binder better than gson could be jackson json genson or if any other which could help me to develop fully fledged application in which application continuously hit to restful services and receives the response from the same

after searched in google found that jackson has better performance than gson i plan to replace gson with jackson in my project but i got a diffrent result when run test code

note also that gson comes with less features out of the box than genson or jackson

according to the performance results at for serialization with databind with strings gson.tojson myobject gson is over 10x slower than jackson

gson is simpler jackson is faster

some pull parser like gson oder jackson would suit your task better jackson claims to be faster but also heavier jars and more dependencies - i prefer gson

performance wise comparisons it matches jackson and beats in some cases and destroys gson

performance of jackson is better than gson

i can get these items into an arraylist of objects using gson or jackson though i think i prefer gson but i do not know how i would be able to that arraylist of objects to the wearable

further more gson really seems to be faster than jackson json

code looks correct and even at its worst jackson should be no slower than gson

i recommend using gson or jackson to convert back and for from java json

i m using gson for the parsing and i know jackson might give me better results

no hate against gson but in my experience jackson has been more featureful and the lead dev is very good about addressing bugs feature requests

choose a json parser to use in your application most likely it would be gson or jackson others are much less popular

for parsing json i d recommend using jackson or gson rather than the org.json library

in my case i found jackson little faster than gson i used default serialization because so far i don t have a need to customize serialization

or switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jackson

i recommend gson as this has small memory footpring just pull parsing is about 16k jackson is way bigger

since i am more familiar with jackson here are some aspects where i think jackson has more complete support than gson apologies if i miss a gson feature

so you may want to consider other libraries i would recommend jackson gson also works

also i want to know if google gson is better than jackson for json parsing

keep in mind though that jackson is a larger library than gson so depending on your case you might prefer gson to avoid 65k methods limitation

also it seems jackson lib has better performance than other packages such as gson which i haven t tried personally

actually genson is faster and has more features than gson and has performances close to jackson but its a lot more lightweight see

deserialization performance is similar with gson over 9x slower than jackson and fastjson about 0.5 faster than jackson

i ve seen questions like this come up before and the general consensus is that jackson is much faster than gson

aside from gson that some like i would recommend jackson

take a look at the jackson json parser it s faster than the one in android and faster than gson and supports streaming

gson is very easy to use while jackson has better performance

take a look at this related question that compares jackson vs gson

i prefer jackson but when i evaluated it i found it was just too big for me to feel good about putting it in an android project so i went with gson

you can parse it like what you are using or you can do the same with more less code and more performance by using gson as described in this answer or you can use jackson as described here

well sometimes performance and usability can be at odds but i ve found gson to be easier to use than alternatives like jackson org.json and others


fileoutputstream	bufferedwriter	1
for a few bytes passed in just one call probably the bufferedwriter is even worse because it problably later calls fileoutputstream


happy	alex	2
if i don t have a grammar i ll use parsec it is more flexible powerful than happy and its more fun to work in haskell than generate code with happy and alex

also note that parsec is not very fast and for non-toy projects happy alex may be suited better


jpql	hql	4
jpql or hql is much more expressive and it s much easier to predict the associated generated sql query

there are not much difference apart from hql knowing more stuff than jpql or exotic feature

because hql is more or less superset of jpql it of course works also in hql

one way to query those is following jqpl hql being more or less superset of jpql


uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller	1
the code you presented will never pass more than one uiviewcontroller to the uipageviewcontroller


qabstracttablemodel	qabstractlistmodel	1
this is not an absolute problem since you could use a qabstracttablemodel but since you are using a listview in qml you should prefer using qabstractlistmodel


caliburn	prism	1
prism is more of a modularity framework and caliburn is more of a mvvm framework i know both have overlapping features but it would be great to take best features from two frameworks when they are combined


googletest	gmock	6
i m almost sure you can t somehow automate it and this operation would require rethinking and recompositioning of your tests to follow the googletest semantics if you use something specialized to create your mocks then porting them to gmock would require even more effort simply because gmock s approach is not the obvious one and is actually complicated

i strongly recommend using googletest and gmock both used extensively at google for your testing

i personally recommend googletest and gmock

for this i would recommend googletest and gmock

projects don t have to use both googletest and gmock but one might want to choose using googletest without gmock or vice versa

if you re using googletest you may be able to use gmock to make this easier


universal-image-loader	ion	1
use one of the image loading libraries glide square picasso universal-image-loader or ion ion is actually more of a general purpose async loading tool to do the dirty work for you


cryptlib	gnutls	1
openssl is more similar to peter gutmann s cryptlib and gnu s gnutls


curb	httparty	1
instead of net http i can use httparty curb rest client or typhoeus which makes everything easier but i can t find any similar solutions to replace enhance net ftp


do.call	tapply	1
or is the do.call with by just typically much slower than tapply


subtraction	multiplication	47
while multiplication normally works subtraction fails for higher values

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

i am trying to make a simple calculator using radio buttons to select addition subtraction multiplication or division

so for a class assignment we are using html and php to make a form that asks a user to input two 2 numbers and to choose between addition subtraction multiplication or division form using radio buttons then to input a guess as to what the answer is

remember multiplication division and remainder operators are all higher precedence than subtraction

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

this subtraction operator occurs within the second brackets and so has a higher precedence than the multiplication

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

in t-sql unary minus is made to be the same priority as subtraction which is lower than multiplication

in general multiplication is more costlier than subtraction right

i don t know how it works but it s much more complex than addition subtraction or even multiplication

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

indicates that multiplication and division have more precedence than sum and subtraction

the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

subtraction operations and usually significantly faster than multiplication and division

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

addition and subtraction are slightly lower latency multiplication is the same

subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication is slower than subtraction

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

as in title why is multiplication much faster than subtraction in this example

after much fuddling with the sparse matrix algorithm i realized that distributing the multiplication over the subtraction was dramatically more efficient

put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does


scylla	cassandra	2
scylla a cassandra clone which is generally more efficient than cassandra also has similar issues with huge partitions as in cassandra moderately large partitions are fine but these issues are actively being worked on including re-designing the file format so eventually scylla should support arbitrary-sized partitions

i wrote a detailed description of the sstable format on scylla s site scylla is a more efficient c++ re-implementation of cassandra to which i contribute


groupbox	panel	2
put a group of controls for which you would later call findsize ... under the same parent a panel for example or a groupbox whichever makes more sense to you

if you have other containers like panels or groupbox inside that panel that contain more buttons these buttons are not enumerated this way


qtreeview	qstandarditemmodel	1
tried comboboxes with qsqlquerymodel without threading to improve performance but experienced it works much slower than qstandarditemmodel in our project qsqlquerymodel works very fast with such amount of data with qtreeview for example


zoo	tidyr	1
but the answers with zoo tidyr are more elegant


floor	math.h	1
with no difference result so in all tested cases it matches math.h floor values


cube	skybox	1
i recently switched from unity to unreal and the first thing i wanted to do is create a skybox but the only thing it seems to support is a skydome which has far more polygons than a cube and the generated .dds cubemap files are far too huge to be used in webgl projects


freemarker	velocity	32
stringtemplate is also respectable though they are mvc nazis and can t match velocity or freemarker for features

however i think velocity or freemarker are more powerful in terms of what you can do with it.

velocity or freemarker might be a better route in this case

likewise many people used to choose freemarker for better performance or more advanced features but velocity fixed a lot of the performance issues and velocitytools provides a huge wealth of features

beyond that i would also recommend pebble over velocity or freemarker primarily because of pebble s best feature which is template inheritance

velocity or freemarker might be a better option

freemarker is more powerful than velocity

probably you can take a look at rythm template engine which is much faster than freemarker and velocity also much easier to use

for templating i recommend freemarker or velocity

placeholders - do velocity freemarker give anything more than jstl

although i agree that velocity or freemarker may be a better choice if you really need to render a jsp and capture the output as a string which you could pass to a javamailer check out my tutorial on capturing jsp output

i dont think velocity or freemarker will be faster than this

i suggest using a template engine such as freemarker for this or velocity but freemarker is better imo

i actually slightly prefer freemarker to velocity just in case you re open to exploring other options

i prefer freemarker here over velocity

i prefer freemarker over velocity due to fm s better error handling

a templating system such as velocity or freemarker may make this easier

freemarker is more advanced but a little complex as compared to apache velocity

from my experience of both i would suggest that velocity is a little bit simpler but freemarker is more powerful

also note that velocity is not the best option going forward freemarker would be a better way to go

i d like to have the view tehnology be jsps i find them much easier than freemarker or velocity

if you use case is rendering arrays and other object graphs in human readable form you may go for templating solution like velocity of freemarker or convert them to json or xml and rpetty pring it - i would recommend gson xstream for this task

velocity did not give me any problems but having had some experience with freemarker i would probably pick freemarker now

i would recommend freemarker or velocity as a replacement for jsp

i would recommend freemarker velocity or stringtemplate

velocity is simpler than freemarker

you can certainly choose freemarker velocity and other cool viewer but if your entire team is already comfortable dealing with jsp you need to take account of your project deadline and all the learning curves when taking on a new technology

freemarker provides much better native whitespace handling recent velocity releases provide more interesting content controls #define #evaluate # literal block #

i m trying to create a template in velocity since i have more knoledge than freemarker

chunk features includes branching looping and macros and has a simpler syntax than velocity and freemarker

i would recommend using freemarker or velocity

velocity is worse than freemarker and stringtemplate has got its own issues


fpdf	fpdi	1
doing this with pure php on your own will get very messy so i recommend using fpdf in combination with fpdi to open your templates


typedef	typename	1
they describe intent better than built-in typename do typedef int errcode


expression-blend	silverlight	6
silverlight will be quicker to develop - as animation data binding and charts via the silverlight toolkit are part of the platform - and there are mature tools for designing and developing it expression-blend and visual studio

i can see silverlight being utilised more in the coming years for a few reasons it is easier to deploy than activex it has excellent tool support vs2010 expression-blend and you can leverage your existing code base

if you re aiming at using silverlight or wpf then i d recommend expression-blend as you can produce a rough working gui design and quickly transform it into working code

expression-blend has much more advanced wpf silverlight visual designer than visual studio including wysiwyg animation editor etc

if you re looking for an application to create a mock-up design of a silverlight application i d recommend using expression-blend 3 version 3 or greater with sketch flow

ä tryed all the ways ä know but its not work i want image show pictures when ä click item of pathlistbox in silverlight here is my website you can see what ä am trying click to photogalley than left lower corner picture click on it than storyboard will show pictures ä want click on images of pathlistbox and bind it to image source than ä can see big picture here tutorial of create carosel pathlistbox but when i do lä ke they do sample data create in expression-blend xap getting bigger ä didnt create sample data ä load images from images folder in client bin folder here my website http forum.websayfaci.net


memset	malloc	19
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

prefer calloc over malloc + memset

calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

it requests memory from the os kernel but the request is not satisfied until the memory is written to with memset . this allows for greater efficiency in the system s memory management but it can result in misleading malloc behaviour

your core graphics surface should be cleared to all zeroes before you render to it so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc

as mentioned earlier memset is available but if you choose calloc instead of malloc it will zero the memory for you

it will be presumably more efficient than malloc + memset for large allocations

after a malloc you ll better clear the entire zone with memset

actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc

in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc

malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions

one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed


cvs	svn	42
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths

i need to prove that git is better than cvs and svn to my team.the only thing git lack is a standard server

wondering mainly if svn uses less disk space or more than the same in cvs

i would recommend svn over cvs although distributed version tracking tools like git and mercurial seem to be very popular among open source projects

i would recommend svn over cvs but don t confuse versioning system with publishing

git and mercurial both handle this more easily that you re imagining and easier than say svn or cvs do

you go to view- filename filters or ctrl-i and select cvs and svn directories under the local filters

the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well

even the cvs maintainers as far as i understand don t recommend it for new projects but recommend svn instead

the best way to really do this is to use source control to keep your projects in sync and i strongly recommend git over cvs or svn

well i just suggest before you make your choice and pick svn or cvs or perforce or god forbid tfs carefully consider mercurial as well

svn in much better than cvs and have lot of mature tools for every platform

svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well

nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land

i wondered if there were still any reasons to prefer cvs over svn or git nowadays

in this case i converted the cvs to svn and found the file size on the hard drive it was on my own laptop at the time but it was much smaller in svn than in cvs but there could have been some compression applied i dont know but everything on the web said svn would actually be bigger than cvs

i suspect the continued prevalence of cvs svn is much more to do with inertia than anything else

for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

as drupal.org is in the process of moving from cvs to git i wouldn t recommend svn

seriously why would you prefer cvs to svn

part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs

for internal work i ve found out that fossil uses little bandwidth much less than cvs or svn and is able to synchronize huge projects in a blitz even via an adsl or a 3g connection

managing changes that need to be made across these branches is a lot easier with svn than it was with cvs but it s by no means pain-free

since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues

that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs

there are arguments for keeping cvs if you already have it but for virtually any other case i d recommend svn over cvs and so would most of the people who use either heavily

i ve used svn not cvs as stated earlier for a while and have some projects in git

in fact svn does stores binaries a lot more efficient than cvs for more info see the svn-faq

the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years

i would definitely choose svn over cvs if only because people who learned source control using cvs tend to use svn delete then svn add instead of svn move

many say that svn was build to be a better cvs and in almost all aspects svn is better and is widely used

if you use svn then it still okay because svn handles binary files much better than cvs

svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

svn is much better then cvs and git or mercurial are even better again

i donâ t like using git itself though itâ s far better than svn or cvs but github is such an awesome site that iâ ve considered switching just to use it

svn is better than cvs

so what is with svn that your company dislikes so much and cvs does better

it s model it s much more twisted than svn cvs git

based on what you quoted it appears that git and svn are actually more similar than either is to cvs for example

i can only guess at the reasons and i don t worry much about the occasional downvote but perhaps some readers think i m advocating cvs as a better system than svn or git

after years of use i cannot responsibly select svn as a successor to cvs in my organization for a number of reasons

in addition another coworker said cvs was a lot more popular than svn

tolower	chr	1
i tried solving it using the chr and ord functions but ord s signature is chars - int and not chars - int so it doesn t match with toupper and tolower s


hidapi	libusb	2
also if this controller is an hid the hidapi library might be a better fit than libusb

so you can either use hid manager apis directly or you can use libusb or as the other answer mentions hidapi which are nothing more than wrapper libraries over hid manager apis


strtol	strtok	3
prefer strtol over strtok

for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null

rather than read a text file using fscanf strongly recommend using fgets and then parsing via sscanf strtok strtol etc


facebook	fbconnect	1
i m not familar with the facebook api but the fbconnect success looks more like an objective-c selector instead of a url


pdfbox	itextsharp	2
however i would recommend pdfbox for the parsing a bit more elegant...although itextsharp worked out ok.

edit 31 march 2014 for what it s worth i have found that pdfbox is much better at text extraction than itextsharp notwithstanding a bespoke strategy implementation and pdflib tet is slightly better than pdfbox but it s quite expensive


raft	paxos	1
i couldn t understand why paxos is better for split-brain scenarios or other network failures than traditional bully algorithm because i can easily find out when quorum of nodes leave from the cluster without using raft


uitableview	uisearchbar	1
uitableview is reporting a bigger contentsize than expected when using a uisearchbar


nsmutablestring	nsstring	3
nsstring is more general as it leaves you the oppertunity to create another subclass of it that could add the altering functionality without using the nsmutablestring s implementation why ever you would want that to do

note also that using nsmutablestring is more efficient than creating a new nsstring each time a letter is added

all-in all the reason is that nsmutablestring is able to do more things than nsstring and can do anything nsstring can hence the direction of inheritance


gridbaglayout	boxlayout	3
although madprogrammers comment to use a gridbaglayout is an easier solution but knowing about glue and struts can be helpful for customizing the layout of a boxlayout

boxlayout is far easier than gridbaglayout because you don t have to learn how to specify constraints

yes the default layout is borderlayout which expands all the content to fit the whole area you have to set a new layout i recommend gridbaglayout to extensive control of the sizes or which i most use boxlayout


glibc	tcmalloc	4
tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc available as a separate library called ptmalloc2 and other malloc s that i have tested

jemalloc and tcmalloc with some setting changes can be more aggressive than glibc to release memory to the os - but again it depends on the allocation patterns

then we found glibc also have same issue but increase rate is less than tcmalloc

tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc.


virtualenv	conda	6
conda environments are more general and powerful than those provided by virtualenv

if you are using anaconda conda is a better alternative to virtualenv as it manages conda packages which are not limited to just python packages

an additional bonus i find that conda works better as a package manager than virtualenv

i highly recommend using conda or virtualenv when doing development in python to avoid this types of issues

conda environments are easier to manage than virtualenv environments in my opinion

i am using conda i thought using conda should be better than setting up via virtualenv but looks like this is really a pain


glasspane	mouselistener	1
glasspane only added more troubles to me because i could not scroll jscrollpane which is under glasspane and redispatching mouse event suggested in glasspane swing tutorial did not help at all because mouselistener on glasspane did not receive mousedragged


highcharts	flotr	1
you should be able to do this in flotr which has a better license than highcharts by just throwing what they showed in this blog post on its side


actionscript	mxml	7
so yes it can be used with flash or rather pure actionscript but it is a little less convenient than with mxml where everything is set up by the framework because it takes more under the hood configuration to be able to run all the necessary parts for remoting

what s the deal i thought actionscript would be nicer than mxml

i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as

i can see that my skeleton mxml module is slightly larger than my actionscript module 66kb vs

actionscript is quicker than mxml but for what you re going to do you re trading speed for convenience - mxml comes with all the different ui classes list scrollbars etc already there

sometimes your mxml does not get you the itch of what you are looking and actionscript gives you more power

if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better


mp4	webm	8
webm is usually more robust than mp4 which can be all over the place

probably webm will load faster than standard mp4 but i am not so familiar with webm format

i tried mp4 and webm and sometimes the file size after i convert to mp4 is smaller than webm but it is also sometimes larger than the original file size

the mp4 implementation is more widely used and wouldn t require a webm fallback in most browsers

- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4

if you wanted to prefer mp4 format containers instead of webm use

the ogv version of the video seems to run a little better than the webm which itself seems to run better than the mp4

also it looks like when i transcode webm to mp4 2.7 is 30 faster than webm


irc	xmpp	1
regardless the irc protocol is more simplistic in nature can handle orders of magnitude more client connections than xmpp for the same memory utilization uses less bandwidth on the wire doesn t require authentication although you can add this feature etc


atoi	strcmp	1
once you ve done that you can use strcmp to see if the string is equal to stop and if not then call atoi or better yet strtol which has better error checking to get the numerical value


mdpi	hdpi	29
layout-sw320dp-land will pick up drawable from hdpi folder whereas layout-sw720dp-land is mdpi device so it will pick up drawables from mdpi folder which will be smaller than hdpi

for example mdpi is basically 72dpi as your computer monitor hdpi resources should be around 1.5 times larger than mdpi resources and so forth

the system will pick the closest match and mdpi is closer to hdpi than to xxhdpi

example if using dp unit hdpi device will have 1.5 240 160 times larger than mdpi

each device has a density like hdpi ldpi and mdpi tablet have even more

a ldpi image on a hdpi screens would appear smaller than the same image on a mdpi or ldpi screens

if the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for ldpi 48x48 for mdpi 72x72 for hdpi

if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it

ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc

as mdpi is less than hdpi so it will take the values from the folder which is least below it in you case it is values which is applicable to all

so as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolution

why the launcher picks mdpi instead of hdpi

i have found that delivering your application with already scaled images having ldpi mdpi hdpi is the better approach

images in these different folders should have different physical pixel sizes mdpi has smaller images than hdpi but the images pixel densities aren t used

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

now a days most of the devices at least fall under hdpi range mdpi ldpi are being less popular now

your normal sized image should be optimized for mdpi 160dpi while the ldpi image is 25 smaller 120dpi and the hdpi image is 50 larger 240dpi

when you put images into hdpi folder their appearance is smaller than from mdpi and ldpi

try reading this link also for more study over hdpi and mdpi concept

even if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratio

in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app

and you know your image at hdpi folder so its 1.5 larger than the mdpi

the picture is in mdpi and hdpi and my testing device samsung galaxy s i think it s no more than hdpi

try placing youre images in res mdpi they will be streched to fit screens which are bigger hdpi xhdpi

first of all if you anyhow provide a hdpi graphic adding an mdpi and ldpi graphic which both are less than the hdpi graphic in size there is approximately 3 4 6 scaling ratio will increase the size but far from triple it more close to double

a hdpi image on a ldpi screens would appear larger than the same image on a mdpi or hdpi screens

proportionally the hdpi screens is slightly taller than the mdpi screens

if in java code the values would be in pixels so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screens

ideally the hdpi version of your button should be 1.5 times bigger than the mdpi baseline version


opencv	vips	1
this is done on an extremely large image and i feel vips might do a better job than opencv on this


visualvm	jprofiler	3
the major free one is visualvm and as a commercial solution i recommend jprofiler disclaimer my company develops that tool

apart from visualvm i recommend jprofiler whose servlet probe will show you all invoked urls

apart from the free visualvm that comes with the jdk i can recommend jprofiler for profiling any kind of application that is running on a jvm


sbt	scala-ide	1
it d be really nice if scala-ide supported tighter integration with sbt


lasagne	nolearn	1
the question is - how to achieve it with nolearn lasagne or maybe pybrain - it will also work but i prefer nolearn


telerik	componentart	1
although it depends on your project size and requriments i recommend devxpress and telerik web windows .i ve used componentart telerik devxpress and i think telerik is better if u are developing web applications.and devxpress are better in winforms.by the way while developing in some cases i came across especially performance problems in telerik products.nevertheless telerik is good choice for web development


free	strdup	3
in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller	1
nsarraycontroller and nstreecontroller are treated more as view objects than true controllers so it sounds like you re on the right track

sqldatasource	objectdatasource	1
objectdatasource also allows for more efficient paging than a simple sqldatasource i m assuming that s what you re using


devise	bcrypt-ruby	1
how can i force devise to use the newer version of bcrypt-ruby that is in the gemfile 3.1.1 and not the auto installed dependency 3.0.1 because adding bcrypt-ruby 3.1.1 to gemfile and running bundle update install does does not seem to solve the problem


ocl	uml	1
eclipse ocl provides a much stronger ui and an ocl2java code generator so that ocl embedded in ecore uml provides much more acceptable executable code


perforce	cvs	3
it s probably easier to learn from scratch than cvs but i don t have experience that way. if someone needed a centralized source-control system i would recommend perforce as long as they had the resources to license it

since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues

well i just suggest before you make your choice and pick svn or cvs or perforce or god forbid tfs carefully consider mercurial as well


laravel	codeigniter	11
like laravel i see has lot of classes while codeigniter has much less classes and looks simpler to read follow extend

i am new to laravel it s good for coding but it is not much faster than codeigniter

in my personal benchmarks laravel is undeniably faster than codeigniter due to lazy loading

i am now preparing for my next project and it seems as if codeigniter is now obsolete at least most of the people seem to recommend laravel over codeigniter

edit 2 what i would suggest you do is either to try to learn laravel getting cooler or codeigniter lightweigh if you have some free time

unfortunately i m pretty sure you ll not find any packages or projects that migrates a joomla web site to laravel or maybe codeigniter which is much older than laravel

well i recommend laravel rather than lumen frankly speaking codeigniter framework may be more suitable which is simpler and friendly to new user

if you ve been using laravel then you already know it is better than codeigniter

before i am using codeigniter but i found out that laravel is much better than codeigniter and it has a lot of features

right now i personally prefer laravel since it supports php7 unlike codeigniter i still haven t read if codeigniter 3 supports php7

i understand that laravel is what s hot right now but i ve never played with it and am not sure if learning laravel is more time-effective vs using codeigniter which i know pretty well but just doesn t excite me any more

rsa	private-key	1
essentially all rsa implementations for about 30 years do not simply do c up d mod n as shown in the first few paragraphs of wikipedia or billions of blogs copied from brief news clippings or exceprts from decades ago but instead use a more complicated private-key that supports the more efficient chinese remainder theorem computation as explained if you read all of the wikipedia article or look at a text by an author who actually knows about modern cryptography


selenium	sahi	2
even though we have switch to selenium mentioned above as a better tool i still can recommend sahi for testing automation

there are certain types of browser event that selenium struggles with that sahi handles much better


lapack	gsl	1
lapack is very low-level library and gsl may be more comfortable to use but speaking of good performance -- blas-based library it is


cbc-mode	ecb	1
choose cbc-mode over ecb


flot	highcharts	2
highcharts is svg and as such it is much more dynamic than flot you can restyle graphs with css attach events perform animations etc..

i have found highcharts to have a steeper learning curve than flot or rgraph imho


intersect	contains	3
i d say the intersect method see answer by dasblinkenlight + any must work better than contains + any

given two ranges a a b and c c d do they intersect is one greater than the other or does one contains the other

edit just checked the performance of intersect it is slower than using .all with contains


cassini	iis	19
i thought iis should be faster than or at least as fast as cassini

i would recommend iis express since i have spent 2+ days chasing bugs that worked fine in cassini that now rear their ugly heads in iis express and trying to publish to iis7.5

while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio

by default the visual studio web servers cassini for older implementations iis express for newer implementations do not even bind to your network adapter s ip address instead only binding to localhost

granted iisexpress is much better than cassini but if there is no reason to not use full iis then i conitnue to advocate it s use

trying to debug on a client machine running xp and vs2008 and the app works ok running on cassini however when i select iis i am getting a 403 forbidden error

iis express would only be used by people who don t have access to iis or want something that is lighter than iis but more like iis than cassini

iis express is a web server albeit better than cassini iis express is not your problem

from this question i found out that iis server is better than cassini for my purpose but i don t know how to check the default server of my website

perhaps you will have a more pleasant experience with iis 7.5 express as a replacement for cassini

for my webapp the integrated visual studio server cassini ist much slower than iis

you are on vista iis got better 7 cassini stayed crappy

cassini was much better than iis express but doesn t properly support the integrated pipeline

what could be the reason that makes iis slower than cassini

cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation

what i would suggest is to make sure you are using visual studio 2010 sp1 then install iis express which is an upgrade to cassini and is much more like real iis and then switch your project to use iis express and see if you get the same exception

there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier

some prefer cassini over iis or want certain projects to be hosted

cassini or iis express are much better alternatives and are directly integrated into visual studio


ember.js	backbone.js	15
there are many options for client-side mvc or mvvm code organization such as knockout.js and ember.js but personnally i prefer backbone.js which has less magic but offers more control

would backbone.js or ember.js handle this better

ember.js would make things even simpler than backbone.js

i already know that ember.js is a more heavy weight approach in contrast to backbone.js

both give you the ability to implement things in a variety of ways which can be confusing but ember.js provides more of the code that you would have to write yourself in backbone.js as standard which for me personally is more important for rapid prototyping than the wealth of backbone.js examples available

the complexity with ember.js happens when you want to do something the non-ember way in which case backbone.js can allow for more flexibility

i would actually recommend ember.js or angular or backbone.js as they provide the exact functionality you re looking for

but the flexibility in the right hands is also a very strong point that is why larger companies still use frequently choose backbone.js whilst newbies would go for something with a little more magic out the box like angular or ember.js

if you need something a little more robust go with ember.js or backbone.js

ember.js is larger than backbone.js but thanks to expires cache-control this only matters on the the first load

i checked a lot of resources on the internet on how to go about structuring ember.js projects but compared to backbone.js resources are fewer and the tutorials i do find do not provide an explicit answer

without keeping node in mind i think i d prefer ember.js + handlebars for templating or backbone.js + underscore for templating

on a side note if one is starting with a large scale javascript application at present using angular.js may be more suited than knockout.js if you prefer declarative approach dom attribute based data-binding and mvvm pattern and ember.js may be more suited than backbone.js if you prefer mvc and string based handlebars templates

but on the other hand although new the ember.js package is actually more complete imo than backbone.js

until now my thought was to use symfony2 plus an mvc framework for the front-end like backbone.js or ember.js prefer ember.js as it seems more documented and in general more organized and easier


gmock	cpputest	1
i recommend cpputest - it s a c c++ unit testing framework with mock support and memleak detector - but others like gmock are an option too


background-position	background-size	3
you can play with background-position and background-size to make it smaller than just the full header size or put it into an after before element and change the size on that element

i would recommend using background-size cover background-position center and background-repeat no-repeat to accomplish this

instead using css you have a lot more control with background-image background-size and background-position


touchesmoved	touchesended	1
btw for extra credit if you are using ios 3.2 or 4.0 or later use the uipangesturerecognizer class to handle the drag and drop logic - the drag and drop motion is a lot smoother than overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended .


actualheight	actualwidth	3
in each iteration of the loop get the item s canvas position upper left and add actualwidth actualheight to get lower right point

i forget if height width or actualheight actualwidth is the more accurate value - you may need to test that one

be sure you use a rendertransform instead of a layouttransform because rendertransforms get applied after the popup gets rendered so the actualheight and actualwidth will be greater than 0


installation	downgrade	1
unfortunately sql server 2008 r2 sp2 and sql server 2012 does not support installation over that data which is especially obvious if the previous installation was a newer version than the present one in which case there is no way to downgrade the database schema versions


startapp	interstitial	1
imo startapp is better than admob especially when using their interstitial ads


metaclass	subclassing	3
it s a little less magic than metaclass but it also means you re going to have to remember to decorate each subclassing

i think this is better done with a metaclass in order to handle both runtime and subclassing method decoration

you could then wrap this up in a metaclass to make it easier for people who are subclassing


gruntjs	yeoman	4
all this will be much easier with yeoman 1.0 which will be more customizable and will let you use whatever gruntjs tasks you want

so i would choose yeoman or gruntjs if i were you

i would recommend yeoman bower gruntjs to manage your client side libraries

for new projects i recommend scaffolding with yeoman which will automatically create the files necessary to build for production live-reload auto-compile scss less and even optimize images -- all handled by gulp the best alternative to gruntjs and easier to use in my opinion


gtk	clutter	1
use clutter which is much more suited to animation and integrates with gtk


quicksort	heapsort	65
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

you can indeed show that on average quicksort will do more comparisons than heapsort roughly 1.44 n log 2 n for quicksort versus n log 2 n versus heapsort

quicksort also has a better cache access behavior than heapsort

the difference is large enough that the constant factor in front of the n log n term in quicksort is lower than the constant factor in front of the n log n term in heapsort which is one reason why quicksort is much faster than heapsort

so normaly you could use heapsort but most times quicksort is faster

why it is said quicksort has better constant factor than heapsort and therefore quicksort is better than heapsort in average

i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort

for example using linear search instead of binary search using wrong sort algorithms for example quicksort heapsort are faster than bubble sort on unsorted data but insertion sort can be faster than quicksort on partially sorted data

of course you just asked for advice about sorting on stack overflow so i feel compelled to ask you if you need an in-place sort what kind of big-o performance you re looking for and then ask you to choose between quicksort introsort heapsort mergesort and stoogesort for what will work best for you

as for me i prefer mergesort and heapsort because i forget how actually quicksort works

this is because quicksort is generally faster than heapsort unless the call depth becomes to deep

dr don t just repeat the old quicksort beats heapsort it s more complicated

quicksort time complexity is typically o n log n but it s worst case is o n 2 which is avoided with the switch to heapsort since heapsort is always o n log n but slower than quicksort so it s only used to avoid o n 2

worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average

in the event that the quicksort starts to degenerate it uses heapsort which is o n log n worst-case but slightly slower than quicksort on average to guarantee o n log n worst-case runtimes

however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is

because heapsort is actually slower than quicksort for each n

in theory quicksort is worse than heapsort

while other algorithms like merge sort and heapsort have a better worst case complexity o nlogn usually quicksort is faster - this is why it s the most common used sorting algorithm

can anyone explain why heapsort performs better and under what circumstances quichesort would be better than both quicksort and heapsort

in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort

asymptotic analysis reveals order of growth of heapsort in the worst case is big-o n logn which is better than quicksort s big-o n 2 as a worst case

however in practice a well implemented quicksort with good heuristics will outperform heapsort on every single data set

average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops

typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast

the reason heapsort is slower in practice than quicksort is due to the better locality of reference in quicksort where data elements are within relatively close storage locations

no matter how much i google or try to come up with applications almost always one chooses merge quicksort over heapsort

what makes quicksort faster than heapsort in practice is its constant that was ignored by big o analysis

unless you re going to write a very good sort probably quicksort merge sort or heapsort depending on your specific needs quicksort will be better and it takes fewer lines of code

heapsort has higher overhead than quicksort but its worst case is o n log n vs

while testing my implementation i discovered that although it generally performed better than regular quicksort heapsort consistently outperformed both

heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases

the typical implementation of merge sort uses a temp array of the same size as the original array or 1 2 the size sort 2nd half into second half sort first half into temp array merge temp array + 2nd half into original array so it needs more space than quicksort which optimally only needs log2 n levels of nesting and to avoid worst case nesting a nesting check may be used and quicksort changed to heapsort this is called introsort

but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average

each iteration in quicksort is a lot simpler than heapsort

in other words the per-comparison-overhead of heapsort is higher than the one of quicksort

so for even small inputs quicksort does less work than heapsort and is physically faster for every n

in their respective worst cases heapsort is faster than quicksort

after several tests i found out that my heapsort is way quicker than quicksort i think it should be the other way around my selection sort is also faster than insertion sort

for example quicksort is faster than heapsort in general although their time complexity are the same

but quicksort will execute faster because its constant factors are smaller than the constant factors for heapsort

for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort

it s usually better to use quicksort instead of heapsort even though heapsort is better in theory consumes o 1 extra memory and o n log n time in worst case

in fact the heapsort algorithm works this way first arrange a random order into heap order and then obtain a sorted order somewhat less efficient than quicksort on average

between quicksort and merge sort since both are type of in place sorting there is a difference between wrost case running time of the wrost case running time for quicksort is o n 2 and for heapsort it is still and for a average amount of data quicksort will be more useful

you can pick between quicksort mergesort or heapsort

heapsort has a better big-o than say quicksort yet quicksort performs much better in practice

normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort

however heapsort is slower than quicksort in the average case in the sense that heapsort performs c n log n whereas quicksort has d n log n performance with d being significantly smaller than c the numbers c and d are constants

in theory insertion sort and quicksort are worse than heapsort

quicksort outperforms heapsort in practice

if you are interested in why quicksort is faster where is a link quicksort superiority over heapsort

if i do heapsort i can create the stack while i m sorting but would this be faster than a quicksort and then build the stack afterwords

it is a variant of heapsort which is particularly suitable for the sorting of very large amounts of data if a relatively high cost per compare operation is needed and on average better than quicksort

for in place sorting quicksort or heapsort would be faster

the wikipedia article on quicksort provides a good example of how asymptotic analysis is used on best average worst case it s got a worst case of o n 2 an average case of o n log n and a best case of o n log n and if you re comparing this to another algorithm say heapsort you would compare apples to apples you d compare quicksort s worst-case big-theta to heapsort s worst-case big-theta or quicksort s space big-oh to heapsort s space big-oh

however heapsort is somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort

but heapsort is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard in-place quicksort

so for instance heapsort is faster than quicksort in the worst case but slower in the average case

it s quite possible that the algorithm will detect a potential worst case and switch to heapsort even though using quicksort would have been faster

in short - if all we care about are comparisons heapsort is a better choice than quicksort

from what i heard quicksort should have better average case performance but from my tests it performs 4 times worse than heapsort for array of random integers

quicksort has worst case time complexity as o n 2 while others like heapsort and merge sort has worst case time complexity as o n log n ..still quicksort is considered as more fast...why

when you say something like heapsort should be faster than quicksort what makes you say that

the kernel developers recommend heapsort over quicksort within the kernel and give the following rationale


georss	kml	1
the amount of data will vary depending on whether you choose kml or json or georss but if you end up with 20 bytes per line segment that would take 50 seconds to fetch on a 1 megabit broadband connection


onfocus	onblur	4
why initial render time for component with both onblur and onfocus is much bigger than others

you can have simpler code as .on method as mentioned above but remember onfocus and onblur are better event handlers for text boxes rather than click events

select onblur onchange onfocus

i have made a small javascript so that when the user selects onfocus or deselects onblur the the will change colors


division	multiplication	250
i picked c 1 1 8 for this example simply because it is exact in ieee-754 floating-point representation and typically multiplication is much faster than division

the cpu operation for float division is much more complicated than multiplication

in fact if the intent is to divide by 22 10 or some other real value that isn t necessarily exactly representable in binary floating-point then half the times the multiplication is more accurate than the division because it happens by coincidence that the relative error for 1 x is less than the relative error for x

multiplication takes less time then division so you can try this

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

multiplication and division are much more complicated and the compiler usually produces some small helper functions to deal with these whenever you multiplying 64-bit numbers together

compilers often prefer replacing multiplication and divisions with number of bit shifts because for the computer shifting the bits is much faster than actually doing real multiplication or division of the values

multiplication is less expensive than division so

the multiplication should perform somewhat better than division

division may be heavier than multiplication but a commenter pointed out that reciprocals are just as fast as multiplication on modern cpus in which case this isn t correct for your case so if you do have 1 x appearing somewhere inside a loop and more than once you can assist by caching the result inside the loop and then using y

multiplication may be faster than division

integer division is about an order of magnitude slower than multiplication on current cpus.

division and multiplication take more operations than shifting and thus shifting is faster

division though is an iterative process in logic the implementations you see on educational sites verilog vhdl are simply doing the same thing we did with log division in grade school but like multiplication it is much simpler than grade school you pull down bits from the numerator in the long division until the number being checked against the denominator is equal to or larger basically the number can either go in only zero times or one times into the next number under test unlike decimal where it can be between 0 to 9 times

in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine

admittedly mrbob doesn t yet have the number of plugins that zopeskel does but since archetypes has been overtaken by dexterity there is less heavy boilerplate code to generate

dexterity arguably has more better documentation than archetypes see plone.org products dexterity as well as my book professional plone 4 development

i d recommend using dexterity 1.0 with plone 4.1 if you want a site that mixes dexterity and archetypes content

variety of supporting widgets is probably the single area in which archetypes is still stronger than dexterity

the good news is that dexterity content types are more lightweight than archetypes content types and doing raw listing by iterating over folder.contentitems in your template should not be that expensive


prometheus	metrics	1
for single server metrics ingest i would expect prometheus to have better performance although we ve done no testing here and have no numbers because of their more constrained data model and because they don t append writes to disk before writing out the index


multiplying	transpose	3
apparently transpose a matrix then multiplying it is faster than just multiplying the two matrices

while your original matrix may contain only 3348026 non-zero elements keep in mind that multiplying the matrix with its transpose may yield a more densely populated resultant matrix

this seems too deep in the original code so i won t touch it but if there s any possibility of flattening the stored array it will be a speed boost even if you can t transpose it multiplying add dereference is faster than dereference add dereference


qmainwindow	qdialog	2
i m creating a program which has a settings menu in the shape of another window this used to be a qmainwindow but i read that a qdialog would work better for this so i manually converted the qmainwindow into a qdialog window

if you re not using qmainwindow s docking area functionality a qdialog would be a more sensible base class to use


harfbuzz	freetype	1
i recommend using harfbuzz in combination with freetype


splinter	selenium	5
consider taking a look at splinter which is a simpler webdriver api than selenium

splinter makes it easier to use selenium plus

i got this working and would recommend using splinter which is basically just running phantomjs and selenium under the hood

if you do move forward with selenium though it might be worth to take a look at splinter which is an abstraction layer on top of selenium making it easier to write tests

splinter simpler than selenium


prerequisites	uninstaller	2
if we try to uninstaller or repair it it would show the install welcome screen and if we go further it would end up with our install condition failures because required prerequisites software is no more there

it will install and uninstaller quicker because it doesn t run all the launch logic of the setup.exe checking any prerequisites checking the installshield engine unknown installshield stuff - god knows what they are doing in all the slowness and it will provide users with a context menu in explorer so then can right click the msi and select uninstaller for easy uninstaller of the package


quicksort	insertion-sort	3
it seems that when sorting insertion-sort would be more time-efficient then quicksort when sorting a linkedlist

i think that insertion-sort would be much faster then quicksort when sorting a linkedlist

in cs insertion-sort is less commonly used because we have much better algorithms quicksort and merge-sort come to mind


protractor	intern	1
there is a more detailed comparrison between intern and protractor in this blog post here


d3.js	flot	1
though flot may be simpler d3.js is definitely more powerful


stringbuilder	printwriter	1
btw unless you are using java 1.4 or older you can use stringbuilder instead of stringbuffer although in this case printwriter would be even better


accelerometer	gyroscope	9
also i have tried the accelerometer sensor and it worked but i m asking to check whether the gyroscope is more accurate to this function or the accelerometer

i want to use accelerometer but i learnt that gyroscope is better option to calculate the accelerometer

some of people says that i have to use not just accelerometer sensor use more sensors such as gyroscope or magnetometer

the gyroscope will give a beter indication on movement then the accelerometer

however a combination of accelerometer and gyroscope can give you better results

i was considering to at some point implement more interfaces to get the raw data from the android hardware sensors compass gyroscope and accelerometer to generate more accurate results but even if i do go ahead with this would this improve much

so after googling this i found that using gyroscope sensor is more accurate than the accelerometer

gyroscope consumes more power than accelerometer based on my analysis its 4-6 times higher

the precision of the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors is much greater than the precision of the compass and gps


kerberos	ntlm	15
it seems a little bit more straight forward than kerberos but provides good ntlm sso capabilities

but as i understand it ntlm disallows the more secure kerberos domain credentials if they re available

if you really want to go more secure than ntlm your may want to configure kerberos

yes negotiate will pick between kerberos and ntlm but this is a one time choice

apparently this defaults to the negotiate authentication method which will select kerberos against a remote machine but will select ntlm otherwise or at least that was my observed assumed behavior

prefer kerberos spnego instead of ntlm

i understand that kerberos has better performance than ntlm

kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site

in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos

for a low traffic site the huge tokens that kerberos send across the network actually makes it slower than ntlm

kerberos could be considered as a better option than ntlm

edited i think i m interested in the algorithm used by sspi s initializesecuritycontext using negotiate in order to choose between kerberos or ntlm as the prefered mechtype

but since ntlm is less secure than kerberos why isn t it the other way around

this is how one can adjust auth scheme preference to force httpclient to choose ntlm over spnego kerberos

windowsstreamsecuritybindingelement invokes an sspi handshake between the client and the server using the spnego security package in the nettcpbinding this will normally result in kerberos being selected as the underlying security provider if available but will choose ntlm if not


floating-point	fractions	7
therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the integer is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly

a floating-point format with a n-bit fractions can t represent the integer which is larger than 2 n+1 -1 because it will lose the precision

the floating-point numbers are rounded to have not more than eight fractions digits

all other fractions floats have more digits after the dot when expressed in decimal because the representation of floating-point numbers is binary not decimal

and using floating-point values is more realistic - you need fractions values because when you rotate something the new coordinates will nearly always be non integral

so it seems that python s floating-point division is internally done with high enough precision to know that 1 0.05 that s the float literal 0.05 not the exact decimal fractions 0.05 is actually less than 20 but the float type in itself is incapable of representing the difference

if you want to compare fractions - do not use floating-point at all


hindi	tamil	1
i have a doubt is it possible to give text other than english in my latest project i need to support hindi tamil and french so if user selects language as hindi or tamil or french so what ever value the user is giving in the textbox it must be displayed in the corresponding language selected


printf	fgets	2
also i d use fgets rather than scanf as it is inherently safer for the same reason that printf is safer than printf

i am getting a problem using printf and fgets as in my code printf is written earlier then fget but it does not run it runs after fgets runs


opencms	magnolia	1
however if i d built a new site with a cms on java i d probably go with magnolia cms because the documentation and community is more mature despite that it s newer than opencms


trac	bugzilla	6
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis

if you really want something with php then i guess bugzilla but imho trac is better

in my experience this is a much simpler sell than trac bugzilla and all the rest

i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill

i have used both and didn t like them at all i prefer trac thou if you really need to choose between those two i d go for bugzilla

trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible


yacc	sablecc	1
javacc yacc are sablecc are more traditional lexer parser generators and you ll find that they re a little more primitive and have steeper learning curves


boost	eigen	1
inspecting the assembly shows that in the sequential access case eigen is faster because the sum becomes vectorized while it does not when using raw boost multi_array


jasmine	mocha	7
mocha s implementation of it.only and describe.only has issues so i recommend jasmine or fixing mocha

many prefer jasmine mocha or something else

while i prefer mocha my experience with jasmine has generally been better for in-browser development thanks to the awesome jasmine-jquery plugin

update after the answer it seems as though mocha might work more easily than jasmine

i liked cucumber and jasmine too but i think yadda and mocha are more flexible

i can recommend jasmine but i also heard many good things about mocha

in general for testing promises i d probably recommend mocha rather than jasmine since it supports promise tests out of the box with return statements


mp3	speex	1
speex is designed for speech and should perform better than wma mp3 or other audio codecs that are designed to handle music if you are just encoding speech which i assume since you are grabbing from the mic


des	rsa	2
by comparison des see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the rsa algorithm

des code is 8 times larger than rsa


d3.js	dc.js	1
i suppose it has something to do with dc.js s mouseover event listener which is not bound to the svg in dc_plot dc.js d3.js and crossfilter.js are added at the client side


alamofire	afnetworking	1
also consider using the swift version of afnetworking alamofire which has an easier imho way to set the encoding format


dataframe	multi-index	2
i ve thought about multi-indices but i m already using the index for something else source of data row not shown here and i m afraid a three-level multi-index might make it more complicated for slicing the dataframe later

the real dataframe has more columns in the multi-index


hazelcast	terracotta	2
we started with ehcache terracotta server array cause it s well-known backed by terracotta and has bigger community support than hazelcast

jgroups is more about task distribution and cluster management while hazelcast terracotta are more distributed caches data grids - there is certainly overlap between them when you compare all the functionality - you need to figure out what functionality is more important and perhaps easier to implement


activiti	alfresco	1
if the identifier really only makes sense in the context of a workflow then putting the logic in activiti and storing the data in some back-end separate from alfresco might make more sense


mailgun	sparkpost	2
the api based drivers such as mailgun and sparkpost are often simpler and faster than smtp servers

personally i recommend using mailgun sparkpost or another email service


bitarray	bitset	1
1 might not yet be sparse enough to make this better compared to just a plain bitarray assuming longs storing 64 bits each it doesn t take more than 2 longs to have more than one bitset on average but if the sparsity increases beyond that the space and time savings will show


srp	principles	4
there is another principles which i like even more than srp - dry

it breaks srp principles and makes code more complicated

i think the single responsibility principles srp is much more useful in practice -- as long as a class only does one thing it is okay to modify it if the requirements for that one thing change

if you re interested look up some info on srp single responsibility principles to get more info on this concept


openssl	crypto++	2
tried all day with crypto++ to no avail openssl was much easier just hung up on this one error.

crypto++ and openssl both implement needed functionality but i think crypto++ will be easier to use since it has less code


dom4j	xom	4
there are libraries that build on the xml apis jdom dom4j or xom which are easier to use than the raw apis

there are at least 3 different ways to implement the xml-wrapping part sax xslt and xml libraries like jdom dom4j and xom--i prefer xom but any of them will work

you might find that other tree apis like jdom xom and dom4j are more to your liking

there are many tree representations of xml available in the java world jdom xom dom4j that are vastly more usable than dom


coalesce	nvl	11
coalesce does the same thing here as nvl but is more portable

i prefer coalesce to nvl because it is ansi standard

the coalesce function is used here because it is more portable than nvl or ifnull

coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

the ansi standard function coalesce is simpler than using nvl and decode which should be obsoleted anyway

2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion

nvl versus coalesce oracle is much pickier about reserved words

i prefer coalesce to nvl because the former is ansi standard

you could also use nvl but that is a legacy function and coalesce is quicker since it stops at the first non-null

coalesce is more efficient than nvl as it only evaluates the second argument if the first is null whereas nvl evaluates both arguments every time

i prefer coalesce to nvl because coalesce is the ansi standard function


squash	fast-forward	1
i pull switch back to master pull select merge choose my local dev branch under merge options i select squash under fast forward options i leave the default if a fast-forward only update the branch pointer the other options are if a fast-forward create a merge commit and if not a fast-forward fail


ansible	puppet	8
if you compare it with ansible puppet does not support running ad-hoc commands inherently otherwise

ansible unlike chef and puppet uses agent less run

i can personally recommend puppet and ansible

puppet chef ansible cfengine are more general configuration management tools that can be used on almost all linux os-es

if you just expect puppet to restart httpd simple because you asked it to then you either need to use a program like ansible which is more of an actual task manager or use some kind of inotify thing to see that a certain file has been changed so httpd must be restarted

other products like ansible and puppet are more equipped to tackle this issue

ansible is in an earlier stage than chef puppet and other tools out there when it comes to community support

puppet chef always have a place in my heart stack but ansible is just easier


tapestry	sitemesh	1
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page


cairngorm	flex	1
any large scale flash flex app can get pretty unwieldy without a micro-framework adobe has pushed cairngorm but i personally prefer robotlegs there s also puremvc which i used before robotlegs i prefer rl because it uses native as3 events as well as dependency injection which is easier to test


isnull	nullif	4
next value for function cannot be used within case choose coalesce iif isnull and nullif

select isnull nullif ms 99999 as date

in my opinion using isnull nullif is faster than using case when

select isnull nullif ltrim rtrim county n a county


led	adc	1
it should turn on a led if the adc value is more than half of max


pyopengl	pyglet	4
i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl

simple summary if you don t wanna code until you cry choose pyglet but if you want to be a master choose pyopengl

pyglet is more strict the pyopengl so i m now learning it

obviously for 3d games you are going to have to muck around with opengl functions anyway in which case i recommend pyglet over pygame + pyopengl


centos	linux	14
usually i prefer using linux centos ubuntu for production server

scroll down to the centos section and select centos linux 6

the pattern-based version installed by default on red hat-based linux distros fedora centos etc is simpler

i am planning to purchase vps with linux centos with cpanel

however since you are new with linux machines you would need some sort of control panel to manage the linux machine.hence i would recommend centos box with cpanel for easy startup

some of linux distributions use older python version for root user like centos .have a look at the outputs of which python and sudo which python you ll see they might be different

some of linux distributions use older python version for root user like centos .if the python verison you re running with sudo isn t correct you can t access those modules installed by pip

for the centos ami you would want to select linux unix or linux unix vpc depending on whether you are running in ec2 classic or in a vpc

one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it

also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long

and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

others might prefer centos or some other flavour of linux but my opinion is that it is best to choose something that matches your production environment

you can use alpine linux docker image it is very light and is better than both ubuntu and centos image to be used as the docker

fiddling with the script on my server box running centos linux by putting in more echo statements etc


gtk	jhbuild	1
i d recommend installing gtk via the officially supported method or using these custom jhbuild modules that i developed


uiview	cashapelayer	3
i think that either a coregraphics implementation or this cashapelayer implementation make more sense than png files or uiview objects with rounded corners

by doing this not only do i avoid drawrect inefficiencies but one could theoretically also change how you use this cashapelayer use it as a mask for some uiview revealing some more interesting color gradation or other image behind it

you can use a bezier path either in a custom uiview w drawrect or easier with a cashapelayer whose curvature can be controlled via its control points


delphi	oxygene	2
you can also pick delphi f# il c++ and oxygene as language targets

right now oxygene is much better as it supports a broader set of language and platform features than delphi .net ever did


n-gram	words	10
it has support for tokenizing lemmatizing n-gram ideas that span more than one words

for some problems character level n-gram do better than words level and logistic regression parameters

but it is doable for example you could gather a set of articles containing the words apple and about the company and a set of articles not about the company then identify words or n-gram that are more likely when it s about the company iphone

furthermore it is handier than google n-gram as for a given phrase it does not simply output its absolute frequency but it can output its joint probability conditional probability and even the most likely words that follow

the problem is that you re not going to find appropriate statistics for all possible words. character n-gram statistics are easier to accumulate and more robust even for text without typos words in a language tend to follow the same spelling patterns

if some characters or bigrams or n-gram occur more frequently a compression algorithm can encode this distribution skew to codes that favor the frequent occurrences with shorter code words and you get a delta of compression

if you will be classifying multi-paragraph text all in one language a functional words list which your bag of words with pruning of hapaxes will quickly approximate might well serve you perfectly and could work better than n-gram

i tried using collections.counter to get the each subsequent words combinations frequency count and print all n-gram that come up more than 2 times sorted by value

shouldn t the character n-gram have a lower test error since it extracted more features than the words features

arun s suggestion is not bad but the n-gram alone are more geared to find general fractions of words


glassfish	weblogic	6
in weblogic and glassfish you ll be better inspired by deploying the native ibm jca resource adapter and creating jndi resources then referenced in the spring context as above in jboss a direct mq client bean declaration suits best as below

shortly what you need is an application server with java ee 6 full profile support - i would recommend glassfish or wildfly or weblogic from commercial end

if money was not part of the equation and i had an employer that insisted on spending money that wasn t mine i d still choose weblogic over websphere or jboss or glassfish or anything else on the market

3 from all the suggestions select glassfish tools oracle weblogic server tools oracle weblogic scripting tools oracle patches oracle maven tools

well glassfish is more right than jboss and weblogic business-bean-classes should all have their own ejb-local-interface

oracle s other application server weblogic still doesn t even fully support java ee 7 - both they and ibm seem to have similar strategies of maintaining stability in their full-fat releases while being more bleeding edge with glassfish for oracle and the liberty profile for ibm s websphere


elf	dwarf	2
so far my columns are id primary key name type first last or either gender unisex male or female and then i have a column for each race dragonborn dwarf elf etc.

basically each row of the table is a different race dwarf elf ect.


xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest	1
the usage of xdomainrequest has been simplified from xmlhttprequest by having more events thrown with onload perhaps being the most important


marmalade	bada	1
cocos2d-x already works with marmalade so if you want to take your cocos2d game to ios android symbian webos bada rim qnx and more check out marmalade


phpstorm	rubymine	1
webstorm + pycharm + rubymine + phpstorm though to be fair rubymine has more features than radrails atm


zlib	libpng	1
several things i found in the cocos2d forums lead me to believe it s an issue with the zlib implementation on ios but i ve tried using both stb_image and lodepng to avoid zlib and those libraries actually performed even worse than libpng


addition	multiplication	185
an addition is faster than a division and a multiplication

trig functions should have precedence lower than multiplication and higher than addition

you don t have to store zero values outside the bandwidth in that case but your operations like addition and multiplication become more complex to code

i am trying to make a simple calculator using radio buttons to select addition subtraction multiplication or division

however if the result a is added to or subtract from another expression and not reused then starting with the division may be more interesting since you can group the multiplication with the following addition by using a fma thus with a single rounding

addition would work here too but multiplication is generally more useful particularly with nested objects

instead of computing the slower it instead computed x + x because addition is faster than multiplication

for example since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition is read as not

the actual error can be more than computed by this statement because nothing prevents the floating-point addition from being a lower approximation of the mathematical result the multiplication happen to be likely exact because one of the multiplicand is a power of two in each case

i assume that is parsed correctly because the two operators have different precedences meaning that associativity does not come into play and that your grammar correctly implements precedence although you should note that is a more standard example for showing that multiplication has higher precedence than addition since simple left-to-right parsing of gives the same result as your parser

you don t even need multiplication for it though addition is more than sufficient the classic example being 0.1 + 0.2 which also results in 0.30000000000000004

what i m going to do after either creating or finding a library like this is to then change the way it produces the output to make it more biased to produce certain examples more than others so in the previous example i can make it more biased to produce more expressions with addition in them rather than multiplication

proposition when implemented in logic gates using the usual algorithms an integer multiplication circuit is o log n times slower than an addition circuit where n is the number of bits in a word

in technical terms the x multiplication operator has higher precedence than the + addition operator

other cpus take three or four cycles to do a multiplication which is a bit slower than addition

because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

multiplication is not more difficult than repeated addition

and has higher precedence than or so the brackets are optional - in the same way as multiplication has higher precedence than addition so

multiplication has higher precedence than addition + which is why 2+3 4 is interpreted as 2+ 3 4 both in c and normal math

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

even if addition is faster than multiplication i think that you will lose more because of the branching

but in many cases addition is faster than multiplication

because addition is faster than multiplication and can be faster than shift

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

i d recommend using addition instead of multiplication in this case as processors are much faster in addition than multiplication

division has worse latency than multiplication or addition by a factor of 2 to 4 on modern x86 cpus and worse throughput by a factor of 6 to 40

years ago and on some relatively uncommon embedded cpus it used to be the case that multiplication took more clock cycles than addition but even then the additional jump instructions to loop would result in more cycles being consumed even if only looping once or twice

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

they state that the binary multiplication operator has higher priority than the binary addition operator +

this requires computing cos theta and sin theta just once and then each update is given by a matrix multiplication of a 2x2 matrix with a 2-d vector and then a simple addition which is faster than computing sin using the power series expansion

on modern processors floating point multiplication is generally slightly more expensive than addition which is one reason why compilers will typically replace by x+x

for integers multiplication is harder than addition may be slower than addition etc but may still be very fast as long as there is sufficient cpu-power dedicated to it

i would also be moderately surprised if the multiplication actually was faster than the addition

since you want to do same thing couple times writing your multiplication num1 num2 function yourself with only addition and using that when multiplying would be much better choice

it s because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

multiplication is higher precedence than addition and addition is left-associative so this is equivalent to but knowing that only tells you that the first addition will happen before the second addition and that the multiplication will happen before the second addition

and has higher precedence than or just like multiplication has higher precedence than addition

the multiplication has higher precedence and therefore binds more tightly than addition

at the time this was faster because addition was a lot faster than multiplication but that s no longer the case

i know that addition operation is more trivial than multiplication operation

multiplication is a relatively complex operation and is likely to be slower than say addition or comparison

multiplication is much harder than addition

i used instead of to convert the string to a number since addition is usually a little faster than multiplication and it s the more common way of performing that action see to force a string to be converted to a number add zero to that string

then the multiplication happens before the addition because multiplication is higher precedence

multiplication is generally slower than addition

put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck

it used to be that multiplication was slower than addition and programers used several tricks to avoid multiplication but with haswell it seems that it s the other way around

as multiplication of ints has more overhead than simple addition

so for a class assignment we are using html and php to make a form that asks a user to input two 2 numbers and to choose between addition subtraction multiplication or division form using radio buttons then to input a guess as to what the answer is

so ideally i want to have approximate relative times of elementary operations execution like multiplication typically takes 5 times more time than addition exponent is about 100 multiplication

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

this is similar to operator precedence in mathematics where for example multiplication has a higher priority than addition

you should expect a division to be a bit more expensive than a multiplication and a multiplication to be lot more expensive than an addition

in my computer architecture class i just learned that running an algebraic expression involving multiplication through a multiplication circuit can be more costly than running it though an addition circuit if the number of required multiplication are less than 3

however when i switch from multiplication to addition it looks much better

that s because the multiplication oprator has higher precedence than addition

multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

if multiplication is slower than addition instead of doing

it might seem unintuitive but it has a lower precedence than multiplication addition and modulo operations

since multiplication has more priority than addition when you give a+1 to the macro it becomes 10 + 10 + 1 21

multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction

if the multiplication is truly faster than the addition then i expect somebody well-versed in byte code could explain why the load_fast for num is faster than the five operations for line 12

and as you hopefully knows multiplication have higher precedence than addition so the expression is equivalent to probably not what was intended by the macro writer

since parentheses were used around the addition but not the multiplication we can infer that probably in this language addition has lower precedence than multiplication

i d also recommend xor over addition and multiplication because of this

my question is why do both integer and floating-point multiplication execute faster than their addition counterparts

division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition so what this is actually doing is

addition is cheaper than multiplication

for example in the expression 1 + 5 3 the answer is 16 and not 18 because the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition + operator

if memory serves this is the same technique slide rules used although they also took advantage of with the idea being that addition is easier than multiplication but my exposure to slide rules is limited to an eccentric high school physics teacher and a cryptographic teacher using it to explain certain tricks with big number math

this is valid under normal arithmetic operator precedence rules because multiplication has higher precedence than addition +

associativity and precedence specify that the last two statements must be performed in that order since multiplication has higher precedence than addition

although the calculation method that uses a prime a multiplication and an addition is slower than a single xor it gives you an overall better hash code in situations when you have multiple fields

isinstance g str and g.lower or g multiplication is of higher precedence than addition

it is well-known that the processor instruction for multiplication takes several times more time than addition division is even worse upd which is not true any more see below

addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication

if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication

i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

if you insist on having many nbs you should merge them through multiplication or addition of logarithms which is the same from mathematical perspective but multiplication is less stable in the numerical sense

of course it is 10 because the addition operator has a lower precedence than the multiplication operator and so 4 + 3 2 always means 4 + 3 2

multiplication is more complex and you can reference the solution in the question efficient 128-bit addition using carry flag

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

for example if you had a class in which it would make sense to do addition before multiplication how could you make the addition operator have higher precedence than the multiplication one

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition

the multiplication are the bottleneck of the calculation even though they may be one instruction a multiplication takes longer than an addition

on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition

the reason for this is that and is strong than or it s like in math where multiplication is stronger than addition 3 5+3 15+3 18

m_expr can expand to a u_expr because unaries bind tighter than multiplication operations and a_expr can expand to a m_expr because multiplication operations bind tighter than addition operations

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

in arithmetic books and computer software and more-expensive calculators this means 12+ 34 56 not 12+34 56 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

this is because of operator precedence multiplication trumps addition and the somefunc method must resolve to a value before it can be an argument to the root multiplication

or has a lower precedence than just as addition in mathematics has a lower precedence than multiplication

direction of evaluation does not affect the results of expressions that include more than one multiplication addition + or binary-bitwise | operator at the same level

multiplication has higher operator priority than addition in java

multiplication has a higher operator precedence than addition so it s done before the two additions when calculating the value for a

addition happens to be exact in fixed-point as long as it does not overflow but fixed-point multiplication is no more exact than floating-point multiplication

it s technically not so in haskell but mostly for the reason that number types haven t been given a monoid instance because there are two obvious operations to choose between addition and multiplication

the difference is that in the second pattern the concatenation x followed by y in xy has higher precedence than the choice either x or y in x|y like multiplication has higher precedence than addition so the pattern is equivalent to

for example multiplication is of higher precedence than addition so 2 + 3 x 4 is equivalent to 2 + 3 x 4 not 2 + 3 x 4

in addition to the other answers usually simple multiplication is way more efficient than using pow

remember that multiplication even with strings binds tighter than addition so we must use brackets

also remember multiplication is much more expensive than addition

so in your case an expression like 3+2 5 would yield 25 instead of 13 because addition is of higher precedence than multiplication

so every multiplicative-expression is an additive-expression but not vice-versa and this is what makes multiplication bind tighter than addition

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas

you expression is then 7 + 5 7 + 5 which is 7 + 35 + 5 as multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

for multiplication the technique described at is a reasonably easy thing to implement and is better than serial addition

of course multiplication has higher precedence binds more tightly than addition

the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first

why with this grammar multiplication have higher precedence than addition

but i guess multiplication is more computationally expensive than addition

so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

multiplication is nearly always a lot slower than addition

if we look at the speed of operations multiplication is not drastically slower than addition

in any case if addition is faster than multiplication a better solution might be to use a table and index by it

just like it would be possible to come up with arithmetic expressions that could be written with less parentheses if addition had a higher precedence than multiplication

that is if you have then you are guaranteed that a happens before b and that b happens before c regardless of the fact that a is involved in an addition which is lower precedence than a multiplication

note that this algorithm avoids any math more complicated than addition and multiplication so will likely have much better performance than something that requires trig functions

now i wondered if there is any way to implement addition using only higher level operations such as multiplication specifically or exponentiation logarithm etc

which doesn t do what you want because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

the and operator has higher precedence than or just like multiplication has higher precedence than addition

in addition since all my coefficients are positive and i only want the x qth one is there a way to get mathematica to discard all exponent that are larger than that and not do all the multiplication with those

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

mathematics clearly defines the order of operations as giving multiplication higher precedence than addition

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

though i was thinking the addition is more simple than multiplication

not sure about this but multiplication should take more time than addition so it s slowing it down ex

it s no more multiplication than addition so is misleading syntax.

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loop than you would in the multiplication loop

i don t know how it works but it s much more complex than addition subtraction or even multiplication

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

addition should be faster as multiplication

each operation takes a specific length and typically multiplication will take more than addition

since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition the same convention is used

yes pow is slower than multiplication multiplication is slower than addition

for instance in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition

it is because multiplication operator has higher precedence over the addition + operator

an expression like binds as not because of associativity but because 2 multiplication has higher precedence that + 2 addition

based on the order of operations e.g where multiplication is evaluated with higher priority than addition push the operators and operands onto a stack

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

the direction of evaluation does not affect the results of expressions that include more than one multiplication addition + or binary-bitwise | operator at the same level.

and the value of this expression evaluated according to the precedence rules is 62 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition

in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition

this again may be another trick as the multiplication may be slower on a iphone application than an addition

the same speed as addition though still faster than multiplication

you probably already remember that multiplication is higher precedence than addition

this line works because of operator precedence multiplication has a higher precedence than addition + so it will be done first

we have now turned our multiplication into an addition which is much easier to do

for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

but both addition and multiplication have higher precedence than bitwise or so why no warning on the int b expression

multiplication and division are higher precedence than addition so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation

start with the number you want to reach and if it s divisible by 5 then divide by 5 because multiplication by 5 results in a shorter solution than addition by 3

multiplication has a higher precedence than addition so it is evaluated first

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

clearly ruby considers the multiplication operator to be of a higher precedence than the addition + operator

multiplication wins out over addition as demonstrated by the corresponding parse tree

usually multiplication has a higher precedence than addition but the grammar you have posted has the reverse that might be part of your problem

addition and subtraction are slightly lower latency multiplication is the same

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

the precedence relationship is the same multiplication is higher then addition

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

but that s not the case here since division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition and there are no parentheses involved

for example 1 + 2 3 is treated as 1 + 2 3 whereas 1 2 + 3 is treated as 1 2 + 3 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition +

note that the type cast has a higher precedence than multiplication which is in turn higher than addition 3 vs

this means the work is sequential addition not multiplication not division which are much more expensive

each execution of the inner loop body takes constant bounded time assuming we re dealing with fixed-width integer types otherwise it would depend on the multiplication algorithm used and addition but that s hard to implement in a way that multiplication is faster so the execution of the body of the outer loop is o d î d even where

for example 1 + 2 3 is treated as 1 + 2 3 whereas 1 2 + 3 is treated as 1 2 + 3 since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

that s akin to multiplication has higher precedence than addition so 3 sticks to 4 instead of 5 so the output is 17


orientdb	neo4j	7
the number of requests orientdb could serve is consistently 3 to 5 times lower than neo4j

using orientdb that is supposed ti be faster than neo4j for depth i m seeing a slow performance

i found that orientdb is too slow at least much slower than neo4j even on relatively small 150k datasets when searching records by text pattern despite the presence of indices

i read in some blog that orientdb performs at least as good if not better than neo4j while also offering more complex types like mongodb would

as you can see the neo4j result is way longer then the one from orientdb

orientdb looks more fancy and advanced but not as popular as neo4j and is not supported on heroku

in very short orientdb supports full replication while it seems neo4j does not natively but neo4j would be more widely adopted and has better documentation

listview	gridview	40
i m trying to convert a gridview to a listview to allow me more control over the table display

i tried replacing the gridview with a listview and the scrolling of the listview is much faster

by using a gridview with an item width as wide as the screen size 320 you can get it to behave like a listview and if the gridview get s wider the content will automatically produce two columns for you

now what i want to achieve is like if the expandablelistview or the gridview items are more than what fits in the screen then on scrolling up on the listview or gridview the toolbar should hide and show if scrolled down the toolbar should visible

after android l developer preview published google supply a new view called recyclerview which can replace listview and gridview it makes it easier to make a horizontal list so i update my answer here

now i want parent of listview and gridview is scrollable but gridview and listview are not so that listview can show more than 2 items at a time

if you can get away with it gridview and listview can be much easier to work with using adapters such as arrayadapter and cursoradapter

i think you are confusing deprecated which means the api method calls are marked to not be deleted in the future and should not be used which being replaced by newer features as in gridview and listview

i think using a gridview is better for your case than a listview

if you have scenarios where you need more control over how the table is rendered the listview would be better choice but based on what you said simple tables i would recommend the gridview

templating rows like this is possible in a gridview but the listview control is much better suited to this type of data

if you are concerned about the performance of your page s i would also recommend using listview instead of gridview

i wasn t able to find out how to do it and since i didn t have more time i decided to go with a listview and a gridview which was actually easier to achieve

i add a gridview as headerview of listview when i change gridview s content it s height does t changes i can only see a part of gridview s new content.i have tried invalidate but it does t work.in the gridview i click the more button and then change the adapter of gridview but i can see only a part of new content of gridview and when i call geidview.getheight it does t change

i m thinking the listview gridview would be more elegant but i still need to create a listview for each cell and then i have to figure out how to style the control in such a way that it looks more like a calendar and less like a table

however there is a grid here that compares listview gridview datalist and the repeater you may find helpful

listview gridview is more work but is faster

then depending on your needs a multi-item control such as a listbox listview or gridview might be even better for logs

personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html

you may also consider using a listview which is easier to customize than the gridview

for simple thing i d choose listview gridview

listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html

else if you have more than one listview or gridview in the scrollview you need to create a customlistview

for example choose listview instead of gridview

regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview

basically gridview are the most powerful way to present tabular information whereas listview controls are for more complicated displays of repeated data

i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control

as i write in the title i would like to study the way through you can choose listview or gridview

i believe gridview allows much finer grained control of display than does listview

it is much more efficient than gridview listview for complex layouts

i think the listview is better than gridview in this situation

i have a sneaky suspicion that listview its view property and the gridview are more closely related than it would appear at first glance and achieving my goal may not be possible in any practical sense but this is just a hunch

btw if this hyperlink is not in a databound control like listview or gridview it is far better to set the property from the code behind

note that i do not want to bind a gridview directly to the view property from a resourcedictionary where the datatemplates x shared attribute is set to false as this leads to problems in the xaml designer view can t be shared by more than one listview

it will produce the desired layout with a gridview but indeed the asp listview is a better choice

if a listview or gridview is a better approach i am open to that as well

the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview

here s another article that describes the listview control and why it s probably a better fit than the gridview

i need to display data in gridview or listview form more than one xml files

but don t know if listview or a gridview could be more useful for what i need


hindi	french	2
hi am doing one application here i need to enter some into edittext and that data after button click i need to save in database up to here my code is working fine.but problm is in another activity listview i have 10 languages if user select french that time if enter data in edittext that time i need to write data in edit text in french format and save data in data base also french format..or else user select hindi means i need to write data in edit text in hindi format and save data in data base also hindi format.but in my app default languge is english please how i have to do this suggest me.

i have a doubt is it possible to give text other than english in my latest project i need to support hindi tamil and french so if user selects language as hindi or tamil or french so what ever value the user is giving in the textbox it must be displayed in the corresponding language selected


distance	altitude	3
this raceprofile is a diagram showing altitude depending to the race distance

a negative verticalaccuracy signifies that altitude is invalid whereas normally a smaller but positive value of verticalaccuracy actually means that altitude is more precise since it s the vertical distance that it may be off by - i ll leave the discussion as to why this measure is called verticalaccuracy and not verticalinaccuracy for some other time

because most of the case zero-altitude distance is quite larger than altitude itself so normally you can ignore altitude


typemock	moles	4
i have no concrete figures on that but from my own experience i d estimate that instrumented tests are around 100-400 slower typemock seeming to be faster than ms moles

sorry can t give you specifics on the problems i faced - typemock was definitely more powerful to use as it is a lot older and mature - pex moles is fun though i found the tutorial for sharepoint rather nice unit testing sharepoint foundation with microsoft pex and mole

if you want to cover a brownfield project with tests which was not written at all with testability in mind then you have to use one of typemock or moles in my opinion typemock is the better choice

moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot

uicontrol	uibutton	4
instead of working around the 1 label and image you get in a uibutton it s cleaner to start from scratch with a uicontrol and create your tiles

a solution i ve used is a simple subclass of uicontrol which allows more customization than subclassing uibutton and less hassle than nsattributedstring et al

sounds like you want to use some of the inherited uicontrol methods such as sendaction to forevent this offers even finer control than with uibutton

i set the superclass as uicontrol instead of uibutton because i might want to change this to let the user drag the item to reveal a menu or something but i m pretty sure that uicontrol should be able to do everything uibutton can do and more


interpreted-language	compiled-language	32
naturally interpreted-language will run slower than compiled-language as compiled code can be ran blindly by the cpu where as compiled code needs to be checked ran line by line

interpreted-language are inherently less performant than compiled-language - c will generally outperform python - some operations more than others

this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are interpreted-language slower than compiled-language

a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code

java seeks to find a compromise between a purely compiled-language with no portability and a purely interpreted-language that is significantly slower

it should be noted that interpreted-language are inherently many time slower than natively compiled-language

and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language

my guess is that in interpreted-language the efficiency benefit in using switch statements is indeed smaller than in compiled-language

there is no way an interpreted-language can be faster than a compiled-language or even a jit language under trivial conditions

php is an interpreted-language so will run a little slower than a compiled-language

from what i know a compiled-language such as c++ is much faster than an interpreted-language such as javascript

fact is that interpreted-language like php are always slower than a compiled-language

in my general programming experience compiled c c++ programs generally run faster than most other compiled-language like java or even compiled python and almost always run faster than interpreted-language like uncompiled python or javascript

performance of programs in compiled-language is significantly better than that of an interpreted-language

this makes interpreted-language generally slower than compiled-language due to the overhead of running the vm or interpreter

are compiled-language better than interpreted-language or vice-versa

while ruby and python are both interpreted-language and operation-for-operation slower than compiled-language the reality is in executing an application only a small portion of cpu time is spent in your code and the majority is spent into the built-in libraries you call into which are often native implementations and thus are as fast as compiled code

interpreted-language are usually more high-level and therefore have features as dynamic typing including creating new variables dynamically without declaration the infamous eval and many many other features that make a programmer s life easier - but why can t compiled-language have these as well

an interpreted-language will typically run one to two orders of magnitude slower than a compiled-language

while java could be described as a compiled and interpreted-language it s probably easier to think of java itself as a compiled-language and java bytecode as an interpreted-language

so compiled-language are faster in execution as at the time of execution no compilation is required but in interpreted-language each execution step is preceded by a compilation step every time making it slow

interpreted-language execution speed are slower than compiled-language true but once there is need for more speed you can call in compiled stuff through gems or micro services

an interpreted-language surely makes it easier but this is still entirely possible with compiled-language like c

of course c++ or any compiled-language will be faster than an interpreted-language but you also have to take in account the development time of the web site app

then c which is one those languages closer to the processor level is very performant and generally speaking compiled-language because they turn your code into assembly language are more performant than interpreted-language

python is an interpreted-language so by definition is slower than other compiled-language but the drawback in the execution speed is not even noticeable in most of applications

interpreted-language tend to be but not always are significantly slower than compiled-language

that being said a compiled-language like c will almost always be faster than an interpreted-language like javascript

this is usually seen in dynamic interpreted-language but is less common in compiled-language

writing in a compiled-language java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an interpreted-language like php

mostly interpreted-language are a bit slower compared with compiled-language but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.js

especially in an interpreted-language like php where classes add more overhead than a compiled-language


bitarray	bitvector	2
you will probably find that bitvector performs a good deal better than bitarray

why is the bitvector 32 structure more efficient than bitarray


qt3d	qtopengl	1
qt3d was developed earlier than qml became mature as an extension to the 2d world provided by the qtgui module or even qtopengl


qt-creator	clion	1
another alternative that people might mention is clion which is from jetbrains but its closed-source not well supported and whilst it might look nicer than qt-creator it has more or less the same features but is much more resource-heavy and laggy so i d pass on that


junit	jmock	3
the later version of jmock makes things easier by integrating with the junit lifecycle as a runner

i recommend using junit 4 and the latest jmock when writing new tests rather than investing time learning something that doesn t have a future path

first there was a transitive dependency problem namely that of hamcrest-core 1.1 - jmock 1.1.0 - junit 3.8.1 where in maven s dependency-tree the older junit was closer to the systemtest module which was inheriting the version dependency and revision 3.8.1 of junit doesn t have contain org.junit.runner.notification.runlistener

because it appears that your filtering are not mutually exclusive that is a data point can be in more than one filtering grouping i think that your best bet is likely to make a vector of your filtering then loops through that vector though i would use lapply instead of a for-loop

filtering by topn_rank column to get the top n rows for each grouping prohibiting more than 3 per grouping

another reason to consider this route is if parsing xml files is more complex than filtering off node values grouping elements assigning new ids filtering by attributes

an easy way to find duplicates is to write a query that grouping by the identifier and then filtering for grouping that have more than one member

i want to filtering and only get grouping that have more than 1 related contact

from my experience collapse filtering is much faster than grouping

certainly if your select with grouping by has no where clause it s going to be a lot more efficient if you run the report with filtering values

now i would like to filtering the container mydiv using an ajax call on a select grouping

then you filtering the grouping that have more than one element

this filtering will return only those grouping where the sum of othervalue of the rows in this grouping is greater than zero

i am using groupby on tickets then filtering my dataframe to those records where the count in that ticket grouping is greater than 1 using filtering

one can obtain all the id of all posts that are tagged with both tagid 123 and 456 by grouping filtering tag_post for only those tags grouping by post and then dropping any grouping that contain fewer tags than expected

i was originally trying to use match after grouping and aggregating the data - which is obviously only going to filtering the data after

this works perfectly fine but our company has more than 1000 grouping that would be imported if i don t set a filtering for grouping

you can grouping the rdd by productid and then filtering it based on if the length of the grouping is larger than the threshold 1 here

instead of in count aggregate use distinct column_name in count aggregate to filtering the grouping which is having more than one distinct values

for getting all pedidos with max aditamento value you need to grouping filtering pedidos by aditamento and select grouping with max key value

if you want to filtering the grouping having less than 2 observations we can grouping by x and then filtering the number of rows n less than 2

unfortunately this not possible using openldap because your filtering is returning more than 1 object multiple grouping each with a unique dn

you can use selectmany to get a flat sequence of all of the reviews from all of the results you can grouping those by name filtering out the grouping that have more than one item select out all of the items after the first and then remove all of those reviews from their result

in order to accomplish this what i ve done is created a sql query where i join the events for each location and then grouping by the location name and only use location grouping having more than 10 entries that filtering out the somewhat non-reliable entries but i still end up with some very different spellings and entries resulting in duplicate properties locations

extra grouping by clause in query 2 filtering records.to know more look at below example

again this is perhaps more clear than using raw sql and only requires one query but this one query could be very large it will return all items and their categories and doing the grouping filtering yourself is probably less efficient than letting the database do it for you

you could use a grouping by statement in the sql you wrote or you could filtering the table based on the start_date to the end_date and then right-click on the column you want to count and choose grouping by

but what i m mostly interested in is how can i select grouping filtering all commits that share a certain property value like repository or author_email or date_day_week without specifying any explicit value

if i do regular filtering see below and the user selects grouping 1 from the dropdown it will still show customers who are members of grouping 10

select grouping in combobox 1 and this causes combobox 2 list to filtering to only those skills associated with that grouping

if you would like to perform several functions like editing filtering grouping please provide us more details about your requirement along with the following details

the having clause indicates that we want to filtering after the grouping to only show the grouping which have more than one entry

since each grouping is an just perform a select after filtering our attribute as productcategory and get the first value

2 filtering per grouping make sure the number of rows for the grouping is larger than 1 and then either the first gene starts with unknown which means the whole grouping contains unknown since unkown has been sorted to the end or take the first row

basically how do you perform a sql query on a dataset to first grouping the rows based on a few columns and then select filtering only the grouping with more rows than a specified size

we then filtering all words from the given string if the length of any of the grouping is more than two

if it is just you using the repo or a select grouping of folks that you can easily communicate with then you can safely squash or filtering see below to clean up history and then when they fetch they ll need to manually reset all their branch heads to the new heads

or could you restructure into nested grouping to make it easier to filtering

if you upgrade to pandas 0.12 you can use the new filtering method on grouping which makes this more succinct and straightforward

to achieve a dataframe containing only one grouping i d recommend using filtering instead of groupby you can first collect all the grouping keys then map each one to a filtering dataframe

i am facing one issue i need to filtering products with multi select filtering attribute in same grouping example

named grouping allow the use of linq to process matches filtering them and generate eg a dictionary of key value pairs eg

words grouping filtering has higher

under grouping row or column select filtering add

you can even specify if they are in the same collision category grouping using filtering to be more specific about which bodies collide with each other

for example if i make a column bytedict would that make a difference over lzo when it comes to selects grouping bys or filtering

please note this approach is much less efficient than grouping and filtering in a dataset query if it is based on a database

solr - the collapsingqparser is really a post filtering that provides more performant field collapsing than solr s standard approach when the number of distinct grouping in the result set is high


flask	eve	1
eve s server_name seems to be based on the configuration variable by the same name from flask see more on server name below the table in the flask configuration docs


tcpdf	fpdf	9
the demonstration of tcpdf i saw at the following presentation showed that tcpdf may have more in-built capabilities the fpdf

i suggest you to give a look to tcpdf which is far better than fpdf also because it is actively developed

i d recommend using tcpdf instead of fpdf

on a side note i d recommend using tcpdf instead - it s a fork of fpdf that has better supports for utf8 among some other improvements

somewhat good news you could move to tcpdf which is much better at handling utf8 and is more modern in general than fpdf

if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf

tcpdf was always slower than fpdf

i strongly recommend fpdf unless you need the features that tcpdf has that fpdf doesn t have

i ve used tcpdf in the past and found it a lot better than fpdf


avr	microcontroller	2
i see that the microcontroller used in commercial devices are much cheaper than the avr or pic

either use less ram by either reducing the scope of your project or finding a way to encode your data more densely or use a avr microcontroller that has more ram in the first place such as the atmega1284p


nexus	artifactory	11
while i generally prefer nexus over artifactory the accepted answer in that question makes a compelling argument for artifactory in this case

i ve used both artifactory and nexus 2 of the most popular maven repos and found nexus to be much more flexible and full-featured

i can clearly state that while nexus is very simple and operative though i sometimes have problems with the installation process on ubuntu its free version cannot compete with artifactory s community free edition

nexus looks better choice than artifactory because of using filesystem instead of database to keep repository

if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation

i would recommend artifactory much better than the nexus

and of course if you really like to use maven you should have to use an repository manager as already mentioned like artifactory or nexus which make life easier

on price and support alone then nexus pro makes sense until you get to 67 users at which point artifactory becomes the cheaper option

i will not argue why and if nexus is better than artifactory as it would not be fair and would only cause flame wars

i prefer artifactory and there is also nexus

there are many free open source ones i recommend artifactory or nexus


magento	oscommerce	2
prestashop is much easier than zen cart oscommerce and magento

there are many more out there magento oscommerce zen etc.


bellman-ford	dijkstra	9
in fact i think it is fair to say that bellman-ford is more similar to dijkstra because of its use of iterative relaxation

surely there is some situation in which the bellman-ford approach is better than the dijkstra approach

if you want to have all all shortest paths from all nodes to all other nodes you can just run dijkstra from each node or you can try bellman-ford which is bit faster but a little bit harder to grasp

after a lot of googling i ve found that most sources say that the dijkstra algorithm is more efficient than the bellman-ford algorithm

bellman-ford as suggested in your question tends to be slower than either dijkstra s or a - it is primarily used when there are negative edge-weights which there are not here

since a proper implementation of dijkstra is faster than bellman-ford use dijkstra unless there are negative weight edges in the graph

but under what circumstances is the bellman-ford algorithm better than the dijkstra algorithm

the only issue with applying that technique for the single source shortest path problem is that reweighting with bellman-ford takes o mn time which is slower than dijkstra s o m log n

however if g is guaranteed to have only non-negative weights g is non-positive weights then dijkstra s algorithm could be better choice over bellman-ford


pybrain	nolearn	1
the question is - how to achieve it with nolearn lasagne or maybe pybrain - it will also work but i prefer nolearn


tstringlist	tlist	1
i believe it is much much faster than using tlist descendant or tstringlist


laravel	silex	1
you can do a good job with php too but i suggest to use frameworks like silex slim or laravel that are better suited to put up a rest api which you will need if you want to use backbone


strcpy	memset	3
memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute

your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy

you could use memcpy memset for strings too but strcpy is simpler


sctp	udp	1
sctp mapped over udp ipv4 allows more private hosts per public address but udp mappings in ipv4 nat gateways are notoriously tricky to establish and keep maintained due to the fact that udp is a connectionless transport without any explicit state for a nat to track


qscrollarea	qwidget	1
when i expand the widgets on the left pane by clicking on the controls and the height of the qwidget of the qscrollarea is bigger than then height of the qscrollarea itself the scrollbar appears as expected but it s overlapping the content of the qscrollarea


scheme	racket	12
and i d recommend using racket for a scheme

i do recommend racket to new-comers since it provides one of the nicest ide s for scheme beginners or rather programming beginners who happen to be using scheme or better still working their way through htdp

mit scheme is known for strong interactivitiy support while plt racket feels much more static

do racket macros have more advanced functionality than those found in scheme or common lisp

racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development

all of racket s languages can interoperate so your language of choice is up to you though the rnrs languages tend to go unused in the racket community #lang racket is much more useful for writing programs than any of the scheme implementations but they can be useful if you want to write programs that run on different scheme implementations

racket and some other scheme implementations use a richer representation for syntax objects so that they can have properties attached to them indicating in racket at least what context they re bound in what source location they come from what pass of the compiler inserted them and any other information you might want to store cf

i would suggest you start with scheme and more specifically with racket formerly plt scheme

scheme racket can return more than one value with values

if you want to get started i recommend downloading racket a highly popular implementation of scheme

there are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the scheme dialect and its surrounding culture chicken scheme seems to be more object-oriented than racket for instance

on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations


datalist	repeater	5
if you are only displaying data consider using repeater or datalist they are lighter

however there is a grid here that compares listview gridview datalist and the repeater you may find helpful

this can be done in a repeater but a datalist control is more straightforward and is just as easy to use

repeater is more light than datalist as datalist creates the view by creating a table whereas repeater doesn t

you might have better luck with a repeater a datalist or a datagrid


teamcity	psake	1
i have been automating all my builds through psake and finding it really useful to get my teamcity build more powerful


subclass	abstract-class	5
but unless you re using such excellent testing practices and patterns i d be suspicious of abstractions that have a single concrete example -- interfaces with just one implementation no less than abstract-class with just one concrete subclass

write the application differently - create a matching interface and write the service provider implementation against it testing that and also write a minimal subclass of the abstract-class that does nothing more than forward calls to the interface

image is an abstract-class so i think the real question is which subclass is more efficient for your program

making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for them

i ended up defining an static string in each subclass holding the tag of the element so i decided to turn the interface into an abstract-class and give it more functionality


cakephp	phalcon	1
phalcon is more powerful verstile but to get started with it i feel you have to be a better php developer than you do to get started with something like cakephp


restsharp	refit	1
i have used restsharp before but refit is alot easier to get running


preorder	postorder	1
if you have dynamic element sizes you can t write out child pointers in preorder so postorder traversal is more appropriate


mediarecorder	audiorecord	2
i had to choose audiorecord instead of mediarecorder because it gives me the chance to get the raw data

this class leverages audiorecord which is a lower level approach to using mediarecorder


oncreate	findviewbyid	2
this is better than normal findviewbyid because the views are create on compilation and are injected automatically inside the activity at oncreate being way more efficient than your standard initialization

you can t findviewbyid earlier than oncreate


mantis	bugzilla	5
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface

since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks

i ve used bugzilla and mantis but i prefer mantis simplicity

research showed me that mantis is simpler to use over bugzilla so i decided to use mantis but have no idea how to install it.can anyone please tell me what are the steps you need to take in order to install mantis bug tracking system in a small company to track website mobile portal bugs

i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis


paperclip	fog	1
i have found though that since i started using the asset_sync gem which uses fog instead of aws-s3 gem i don t have any more trouble with paperclip and s3


freebsd	solaris	1
both systems have large suites of available software packages available freebsd is likely larger and there s a better chance something may have been ported to freebsd over solaris depending on the niche of the package of course


redmine	mantis	3
i have been trying out redmine to see if i like it better than mantis

i ve read that mantis contains less project management tools than redmine

i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis


profiler	gprof	1
for time measurements use google s cpu profiler it gives way better results than gprof


nettcpbinding	net.tcp	2
in site binding add nettcpbinding edit binding - add - choose type as net.tcp and add port like this 12345

once that s taken care of just be sure to edit the default website bindings to enable the specific bindings your service uses for nettcpbinding go to website - edit bindings... - add... then choose net.tcp and assign it the ports


kerberos	ldap	3
active directory is far more than ldap - at the very least you d need kerberos but it also tightly integrates with dns both srv and a records which d require significant trickiness to fake over an ssl connection

in short as an authentication protocol kerberos is far more secure out of the box is de-centralized and will put less load on your directory authentication servers than ldap will

one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server


opensuse	linux	3
i have used a lot more than 10 linux distributions and i now stick to opensuse

i took the linux distro chooser at and it recommends opensuse mandriva ubuntu

i m using linux opensuse to be more precise


as.date	posixct	1
i prefer as.date for dates and strptime for posixct objects dates and times


robospice	ion	1
i ve used both robospice is more robust but ion is easier on the eyes


qfile	qdir	1
i d highly recommend checking out qdir qfile and qprocess objects in the qt creator help or online documentation since you are using it


swrl	owl	2
however some people prefer swrl s syntax to owl s and use swrl even for statements that could be successfully expressed in owl your example axiom is expressible in owl as well

drools and jess have a higher power than swrl but protã gã supports swrl in that it supports owl so the use case is to support multiple swrl implementations


fread	textscan	1
then for reading i find textscan to be more powerful than fread fscanf the differences between them all are summarized here


flask-extensions	flask-security	1
seems like this will be the case with several flask-extensions that involve more view template code than pure infrastructure like flask-security flask-login etc.


qlayout	qwidget	2
when you put more than one qwidget on a qt form you should always use some kind of qlayout the quickest way to fix your problem is to select all items in your form and click on the grid layout button the one with 3 x 3 small squares on top of the designer box

instead i chose qlayout setfixedsize which made the layout adjust the fixed size of the owning qwidget effectively making it smaller when it needed to be


gif	ico	4
there are a couple of options where you can set one color as transparent then load a simple bmp jpeg and do some bitmap tricks however using ico gif will be far easier for this

file extension does not match gif | jpg | png | css | js | ico

jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss

gif favicons are sometimes used so that they can be animated but ico s have wider browser support


retrofit	okhttp	11
as for json parsing i recommend using retrofit with okhttp client

i have created this library that is built on top of okhttp and have more features and customization than retrofit

see also the retrofit guide which uses okhttp and makes it easier to

first you have many different library you can use instead of retrofit the basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion and you can use volley to perform the same service as retrofit

the basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion the best solution is to use volley or retrofit

since you re using android and retrofit i suggest using okhttp wich is better supported by retrofit and android thread safe the way to this is the following

note that if you have json and rest then retrofit is going to be better than pure okhttp

the point of using okhttp instead of the defaulthttpclient by apache is that okhttp is threadsafe for android and better supported by retrofit

if you re using retrofit and okhttp to perform the network calls i suggest you use moshi as it s also from square and claimed to work faster and better than gson

created an aws gateway okhttp interceptor for those who prefer retrofit over the aws sdk

if you want to use json objects with okhttp retrofit would be a better library


gson	moshi	1
if you re using retrofit and okhttp to perform the network calls i suggest you use moshi as it s also from square and claimed to work faster and better than gson


mef	linfu	1
mef linfu and spring.net are faster than ninject but still pretty


winpcap	pcap.net	1
pcap.net uses c++ cli to wrap winpcap which is considered more efficient than pinvoke


qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel	1
do need implementation of qabstractitemmodel that can be more useful than qstandarditemmodel


onclick	onsubmit	7
also i would recommend using onsubmit event instead of onclick event

edit to answer your question in comment bellow at first i thought i will bind it to button onclick event but to keep validation that is handy in this case when some questions aren t answered it notices the user about it i think form s onsubmit will be better

also note that for form submission it is typically better to use the onsubmit event as opposed to the onclick event since forms can technically be submitted by hitting the enter key as well as clicking the submit button

an online search for the use of onsubmit with h commandlink indicated that onclick would be a better choice and this allowed a solution to our primary problem

it s just a supposition but try recreating the form widget onsuccess or even hide the form onsubmit actually onclick is better and show another form to the user

you can indeed execute scripts on almost any page using content scripts that can manipulate the dom allowing you to add an onsubmit event listener to a form more reliable than onclick on a button as it is fired however the form is submitted - hitting enter

someone recommended a javascript onclick event but i would instead recommend using onsubmit


haskell	ocaml	28
ocaml is closer to c++ because of it s imperative and oo features but i recommend you learn haskell as it is more functional more mindbending and has more resources

overminddl1 if you want to learn functional typed programming something like haskell will teach you better than almost any other language however ocaml will be the best if you want to write to get stuff done

note that it currently does not support true parallelism you won t have two threads running ocaml code in parallel but it doesn t matter as ocaml is much faster than many other languages for example on a quadcore the language shootout shows that ocaml outperforms even haskell with multicore capabilities

i assume you re using linux or f# would be a much better choice than either ocaml or haskell

if i remember correctly they initially experimented with haskell but then decided ocaml was more practical

haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components

secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor

as others have pointed out ocaml s learning curve will be lower than haskell s

i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes

but according to the the computer language benchmarks game haskell oftenly beats ocaml if only by rather small fractions â there remains the problem that this benchmark takes only very specific samples

it loses points for being about standard ml when ocaml f# and haskell are seemingly more popular

haskell ml ocaml miranda alice oz erlang twelf coq prolog all demonstrate more rigorous applications of mathematics to programming

the reason i wanted to investigate this was because both c and ocaml were significantly faster than haskell for this program

i personally believe that it is not worth the effort because basic is a nearly dead language and there are lots of languages better than basic ocaml haskell common lisp clojure scala scheme go d ...

i m more familiar with ocaml than haskell so type constructor may not be the right term

the haskell zipwith is friendlier than the ocaml list.map2 which requires the lists to be the same length

but according to the the computer language benchmarks game haskell often beats ocaml if only by rather small fractions â there remains the problem that this benchmark takes only very specific samples

i ve heard people complaining about haskell s type system having holes and that agda and ocaml coq are better

a lot of people seem to say that writing compilers and other language tools in functional languages such as ocaml and haskell is much more efficient and easier then writing them in imperative languages

keith pointed out that haskell has a more powerful type system but it can also be said that ocaml has a more powerful module system than haskell

haskell has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libraries for ocaml as well including the peg parser generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser generator dypgen

you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your ocaml code more intuitive than haskell because of haskell s lazy evaluation

go is much more c++ like and low level oriented than c# and c# has only a few functional features while scala allows you to write typical functional code more verbose than ocaml or haskell but similar

disclaimer i am more familiar with haskell than ocaml so i may not be doing things in the most idiomatic way

for writing compiler the fore-front functional programming languages haskell ocaml etc... have much more rich library of used cases and examples you might want to explore that.also their community are full of programming language geek that are more than happy to share their experiences

ocaml will be easier to learn if you coming from almost any other language this is because haskell is as function as functional languages get and working with mutable random access structures can be a little clunky in haskell

haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction

if you want only very coarse parallelism at best and you intend to stick with mostly functional structures then pick based on something else like syntax i think haskell is much nicer here but that s subjective or available libraries haskell wins on quantity availability but ocaml might edge it out in the graphics department nonetheless


lisp	smalltalk	3
smalltalk methods tend to be more fine-grained than lisp functions so that may be a good place to begin

you could make a case for smalltalk and lisp here too but in the late 1980s both smalltalk and lisp practice tended toward larger and more complex methods

common lisp is an image base language although usually to a lesser extent than smalltalk


mezzanine	cartridge	1
you requirements sound like mezzanine + cartridge would be a better solution for you


gmail	hotmail	6
newsletters in email campaign tools like outlook gmail hotmail has less css support

in outlook.com hotmail it looks closer to the results shown with gmail

i know for a fact hotmail is using a rules based spam filter which is quite strict and gmail uses more like a self-learning system which could explain why gmail accepts your message and hotmail doesn t

the kind of mail server that could compete with gmail and hotmail in a near futur - say two years.

i have tried changing ports 25 465 587 changing email servers smtp.gmail.com smtp.live.com tried both gmail and hotmail enabled less secure on both gmail accounts even setup outlook and disabled the firewall in avast

i need to send bulk mail in my php application but its outgoing limit was 500 if i purchase vps server for sending email if it grows more than 1000+ gmail hotmail will mark me as a spam so what is the solution for this issue


crypto++	keyczar	1
i recommend keyczar and crypto++


gridview	radgrid	1
each tab contains multiple radgrids as radgrid is heavier than asp.net gridview


ienumerable	iqueryable	25
so if you working with only in-memory data collection ienumerable is a good choice but if you want to query data collection which is connected with database iqueryable is a better choice as it reduces network traffic and uses the power of sql language

entity framework s iqueryable implementation is more picky about creating new objects in objects than regular linq to objects ienumerable

in simple words all operations on ienumerable causes simple iteratation over all elements well it s lazy ienumerable really slower than iqueryable

i m not familiar with the infeasability of iqueryable but this blog post seems to indicate that iqueryable is much more preferable to ienumerable because iqueryable allows access to the underlying expression

i understand the differences between iqueryable and ienumerable but would an ienumerable object be better for data that allows filtering

however the method that returns iqueryable takes 15 seconds while the ienumerable takes less than a second

this may be safer as iqueryable inherits from ienumerable

if you return collections or instance and if you choose ienumerable iqueryable ilist list or whatever depends on your needs

what i know is using iqueryable is better than ienumerable if another query is going to be performed

i often use such code with the entity framework and iqueryable to generate smaller sql queries but it works just as well for linq to objects ienumerable

i assume applying iqueryable will be much faster than the ienumerable not to forget i was able to use iqueryable on the other entities without any issues

ienumerable is more generic than iqueryable though all instances of iqueryable implement ienumerable and only defines

there is a very good linq video that i enjoy a lot- it hits more than just ienumerable v iqueryable but it really has some fantastic insight

for your view to expect an ienumerable you need to change your view declaration to be also if you really need to perform a find use iqueryable first them return the result as ienumerable since the payload on ienumerable is smaller than iqueryable

generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course

i d say iqueryable is more suitable for interaction with a database than ienumerable is

final result will be of type ienumerable and in terms of performance this would be better than iqueryable since here join is taking place between in memory collections

can you provide any useful example that shows ienumerable could be more useful than iqueryable

the ienumerable side of linq which works on in-memory objects that are already in the heap will almost certainly perform better than the iqueryable side which exists to be translated into a native query language like sql

in my reading it seemed iqueryable had more functionality for linq to sql but since i am returning a simple two column list then i only need to return an ienumerable or list

or perhaps ienumerable is better since ienumerable types can be cast to iqueryable to be used with linq

i d recommend using iqueryable insteam of ienumerable in your genericrepository though

ienumerable is more generic than iqueryable though all

with really basic calls to the database iqueryable is way quicker but when do i need to think about using an ienumerable in its place

i have read about ienumerable and iqueryable i have read that iqueryable is better with linq because when you use where clauses it creates the exact query it needs but with ienumerable it retrieves all rows from database and then filters on memory


bellman-ford	floyd-warshall	1
because bellman-ford runs in time o mn the overall asymptotic runtime is still o mn + n 2 log n so if m o n 2 note that this is little-o of n this approach is asymptotically faster than using floyd-warshall


hazelcast	ignite	3
ignite is much more ram-hungry than hazelcast

i prefer ignite to hazelcast because ignite support use direct buffer

probably the most important point is that apache ignite indexing is a lot more sophisticated than hazelcast


redmine	bugzilla	1
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis


config	ini	11
since json can store arrays i can create quite complex config with it and it parses faster than ini files

ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested

because spring s xml config is slightly more powerful than shiro s ini spring users are encouraged to use full spring config instead of shiro ini

if you intend manual config it s probably better to choose something else for example ini

personally i am not a big fan of xml config files yaml json and ini being seen as more friendly

i like that ini is more for config purposes but with todays interest in json it seems more logical for the config be designed with json in mind

it is similar to incron however config uses a simpler to read ini file instead of a plain text file

does anyone have a suggestion on how we could use an ini or have a better suggestion for creating build config files

i am using zend_config_ini config adapter i prefer ini for base config

being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions

make sure your editing the right ini file select config from the control panel br


jointjs	dagre	1
then i create new data set from initial to match jointjs requirements set x and y coordinates obtained from dagre layout and render it


clang	llvm	25
i usually prefer clang llvm over gcc for my projects but it seems clang

you may notice that modules in clang llvm are faster than precompiled headers

clang llvm has much better separation between the parser and the other parts of the compiler chain

ps llvm clang is easier to port.

otherwise i d go with dodon victor and recommend clang llvm

try to grab top-of-tree llvm llvm-gcc which is deprecated by now btw and try to reproduce the issue or alternatively grab clang

first fiber won t compile with apple clang because of the use of thread_local which apple does not support according to what i found online they think they can implement it better than standard llvm and don t want to introduce it only to break abi later

note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports

good options are llvm libc++ static library fewer features more compatible with clang and gnu stl static library more features i had an issue that required me to turn the clang optimizer to -oz to prevent a segfault

i heartily recommend llvm for statical analysis see also clang static analyzer

in my box we have gcc 4.1.2 installed as root user but to compile llvm and clang i needed a higher version of gcc

beyond the license issues clang llvm builds much faster than gcc and in apple s benchmarks and my own experience creates better-performing executables than gcc

the last few sets of benchmarks i ve seen showed gcc to produce slightly faster code in most test cases though llvm had a slight edge in a few while llvm and clang gave significantly better compile times

frankly i care less and less each day as i become more and more impressed with clang llvm

essentially there s no need for gcc any more llvm + clang is more than enough

llvm compiles code faster than gcc may create code that runs faster and the clang frontend provides more accurate error messages than gcc â so there are definitely reasons for switching

i haven t read anywhere that apple llvm clang compiler produces bigger executable so my guess is that i might not be using the optimization settings in xcode properly

for an example see this online clang demo - select llvm c++ api code as the target

when i compile with clang -emit-llvm -s -o3 test.c gcc would also work but the llvm ir is more readable in my opinion i get

because they contribute to the develop of clang llvm and because source code compiled with llvm clang produce faster binary than gcc .

libstdc++ does this a lot more than libc++ and the former is the default library for llvm-g++ gcc llvm the latter for clang apple llvm which means a lot of errors will seem to go away when you switch to gcc llvm or just stick with apple llvm and switch your library but your code is still wrong

if i choose llvm gcc 4.2 or clang llvm when i hit breakpoint local symbols are not available and gdb says no symbol self in current context if i try to print self or any other local symbol

as for the next question i strongly recommend using clang to compile c code snippets to llvm ir instead of hand-crafting the latter

in the tool settings tab scroll down and select llvm clang c++ linker libraries

the reference c++ program with input 28 compiled with llvm 8.0.0 runs in 0.67s on my machine the same with clang 3.7 is marginally slower 0.68s


octal	hex	13
hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

i d recommend using hex escapes or unicode escapes rather than octal ones

of course you could do the same with octal but hex is even more compact than octal.

hex or maybe octal depending on the machine being emulated will be clearer than using decimal since similar opcodes tend to vary in bits not digits

some might choose octal or hex to go along with their program that manipulates that type of data

from what i understand octal was more popular than hex among users of 18-bit architectures since a word would be exactly 6 octal digits

hex is used much more often than octal

apparently octal format was more popular than hex format

html encoding strings and passing them into javascript variables can cause problems specially if you use hex codes as js i m told prefers octal

hex is easy octal is even easier to convert to and you dont need to do the backward thing for a quick check can reverse it by hand after you see the result

with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary

the octal encoding mechanism is less error-prone than hex so i ll demonstrate using octal


loops	while-loop	7
i would prefer for-loop over while-loop because if not used properly while-loop can go into an infinite loops

try to simplify your code and use do-while-loop instead while-loop should produce a better code do while will at least do one loops and then inspect the next condition before do the next loops but while will inspect the condition first if it is okay it will do loops

also i made this two days ago mostly as a draft to get started with and there are likely other things that can be better so excuses if anything seems somewhat sloppy in my opinion the whole while-loop could be done better but at that moment i chose it because a different approach to loops through didn t work can t really remember what exactly it was anymore

i searched a lot and discovered nice approaches of others that do solve my problem but out of curiosity i would love to know if there is solution to my problem that keeps the while-loop despite a for-loop would be more appropriate in the first place as i know the range but the day will come when i will need a while loops

is there any time that a do-while loops would be a better style of coding than a normal while-loop

it is quite likely that having an if inside a while-loop will run slower but modern compilers are quite clever and i have certainly seen cases where the compiler hoists such a choice out of loops in cases where the conditions don t change

if you re just going to loops through point use a for-loop as while-loop is more prone to dropping into an endless loops if you forgot to increment counter or doing wrongly or do it in multiple places


png	ico	10
as a side note here is the reason why i prefer png instead of ico file

file extension does not match gif | jpg | png | css | js | ico

every other button whether using an ico or png that is larger than the target size ends up blurry

because i m new in react and server-side rendering at all i want to know if there are any standard ways to fix this problem - not images only i use images png jpeg jpg ico svg sass less css

i d like to recommend two other things first prefer using png with real alpha transparency to ico nowadays

i recommend use .ico format because the png don t work with method 1 and ico could have more detail

however ico files if stored properly are not significantly larger than png files because since windows vista ico files can store png

you can use png jpg bmp as well as ico file but everyone recommend png

the first fileset selects all files that aren t vbs file so it also selects png and ico files

jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss


waitpid	fork	3
in your particular case i recommend using fork 2 execve 2 perhaps thru some carefully choosen exec 3 function waitpid 2 .

as for the suggestions in the comments keeping the fork result in a variable a then waiting with waitpid is safer when you have more processes as wait waits for the first ending process not a particular one

the main fork then drops into a select waitpid combo loop


codeigniter	pyrocms	2
the more i look into pyrocms the more i feel like it s codeigniter made easier

unless you re writing trivial apps or just like re-writing code i wouldn t start any new project in codeigniter because pyrocms is the more sensible starting point


writetofile	nsdata	1
rather than using the quite primitive writetofile method of nsarray i d recommend to use nspropertylistserialization in conjunction with nsdata s writetofile options error still better writetourl.


vbo	normals	3
when using interleaved vbo s the normals routine is that the same vertices and normals will be written more than once right

g_vertex_buffer_data and g_color_buffer_data are the arrays of data to use you will likely need to set up some shader code and the render code still has to be added but this is how to have more than one vbo texture coords colours normals etc

when i use vertex array model looks perfect but when i switch to vbo model looks worse because of vertex normals


acs	adfs	3
it seems possible to have adfs as the ip-sts send an assertion to more than 1 acs url based upon the acs url or acs index in the authnrequest as long as they are listed in the relaying party trust endpoints list

you can however use adfs in chain with acs to inject more claims

adfs has more powerful claims transformation capabilities than acs


heapsort	in-place	4
heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases

but heapsort is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard in-place quicksort

dr your heapsort is not faster because it isn t actually a heapsort it s a backwards insert sort followed by an in-place ordering reversal

of course you just asked for advice about sorting on stack overflow so i feel compelled to ask you if you need an in-place sort what kind of big-o performance you re looking for and then ask you to choose between quicksort introsort heapsort mergesort and stoogesort for what will work best for you

a more recent benchmark on 1 2 4 8 cpu cores - also made by an independent third-party - compares apache 2.2 apache 2.4 nginx lighttpd varnish litespeed cherokee and g-wan

jscrollpane	jviewport	2
even when it s bigger than my jscrollpane s jviewport the knobs will not appear on the scroll bars and i cannot scroll down on the canvas

now before you run screaming from the room swing provides the scrollable interface to allow you to provide more information to the jscrollpane and jviewport including the preferred view port size which allows the jscrollpane to be smaller than the preferred size of the view been displayed when it s been laid out and which is what you re interested in how the view should be sized when it is smaller than the view area


png	tga	1
if necessary i can switch to tga though png is more convenient


multiplying	division	20
division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract

but in normal case it takes n 2 comparison so you half the height of tree but you multiplying each merge with two so total running time is not better than division to 2 part

i read about python following pemdas that is precedence of multiplying is more than division

multiplication and division are much more complicated and the compiler usually produces some small helper functions to deal with these whenever you multiplying 64-bit numbers together

according to agner s instruction tables a single fp division is slower than a single reciprocal op and a single multiplying op

perhaps it s the case that division is much more accurate than reciprocal plus multiplying

i presume that you know that using a division is a lot slower than multiplying by decimal number 5 is always slower than 0.2

while working with integer division it s better to multiplying first and divide later to minimize the rounding error

but determining the digit and the carry by division is much more concise and for the larger factors also much more efficient when multiplying a digit by 100 the result is on average 450 requiring 45 subtractions but two divisions are sufficient for all factors

my question i would rather not use the multiplying operator as multiplicative division operators are slower to execute on my target

so basically i have this calculator where you can choose between division multiplying plus and minus

in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 ï because multiplication is so much faster than division

these can be compared to multiplying by 2 x left-shift or divinding by 2 x right-shift but it should be noted that a binary shift is much faster than a division operation

division typically uses more resources.â to avoid division we multiplying rather than divide

i believe that division would be faster than multiplying by the inverse since the inverse has to be calculated first then multiplication performed

to improve on the multiplying by this irrational number notice how the division routine gave lots more precision didnt need to be that extreme assuming 16 bit numbers using 32 bit math operations

note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that multiplying is faster than division however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs

sure that s probably compiled or jit d away but you should avoid division in performance critical code it s far slower than multiplying

division of quaternion a by quaternion b is nothing more than multiplying a by the multiplicative inverse of b

in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine


background-image	background-color	3
i understand that the background-color one doesn t require an http request and that the background-image takes more processing

a lot of answers comments are mentioning that the background-color rgba is faster and more efficient but that background-image is more compatibility friendly

you can refer the bootstrap official document you can find that the default navbar background described as background-image the priority of background-image and background-color distinct the background-image is more powerful than background-color


bluestacks	android-emulator	10
this android-emulator works better than bluestacks

yes some functionality possible only on device but you can try also bluestacks app player which has more possibilities than android-emulator

in xda-forums i read about memu - most powerful android-emulator for pc better than bluestacks

better for you to use bluestacks android-emulator it is much faster than google android-emulator

you can even select and choose bluestacks as your android-emulator through eclipse and it is fully compatible

the app that i was developing worked nicely in an android-emulator bluestacks to be more precise

2 if your host machine laptop doesn t have more ram then you might want to find alternative android-emulator like genymotion bluestacks which takes less memory than android-emulator

use genymotion or bluestacks for emulator.these third party android-emulator is better performance as compare to builtin android studio android-emulator

7 then select bluestacks android-emulator in the prompt window and finally select ok

i prefer bluestacks for speed particularly graphics but also use eclipse android sdk android-emulator for a range of phone and tablet sizes for my benchmarks free

devise	rolify	4
iâ ve made several attempts to destroy rolify with no success and cannot get past that point so that i can work with devise

i d recommend using devise + cancancan + rolify to authenticate your users and assign permissions based on their individual roles i.e admins can create delete edit or users can only view

destroy devise model generate devise model and generate rolify

destroy devise model generate devise model delete app models role.rb and generate rolify


profiler	vtune	1
if you are looking to measure execution performance over time scales where it matters if your thread has been preempted then you would probably be better served with a profiler vtune for instance


height	border-box	4
and thus it was subtracting padding from the border-box height giving me smaller height values than chrome reported

adjust the padding and use box-sizing border-box to have better control of the height

btw i d recommend box-sizing border-box for a more intuitive behaviour of widths and height for elements compare padding behaviour

in the above code #header seems to overflow out of #header_wrapper because of and which adds up to more than the height of #header_wrapper and even though box-sizing border-box has been applied its still overflowing


comparator	icomparer	1
using a separate icomparaer comparator approach is a more generic form of using a sortkey field with the additional ordering mixed into the comparator because such a field could be used by such a icomparer implementation

countif	sumifs	9
it doesn t sound as if you need anything more elaborate than a countif function and a sumifs function

you could also use sumifs with countif it s a more basic formula not as powerful as filter but just as funcitonal

use of sumproduct an array formula or conditionals such as sumifs and countif and their big brothers sumifs countif may be more suitable - in effect by preselecting only the values that would not give rise to such errors

i really need countif to work more like sumifs

bear in mind that index is the same as vlookup in that it will only return the first value if two tenders finished on the same day it will only return the first it comes across if you have more than one maybe sumifs would work better maybe along side countif to show how many there were

have a look into vlookup match sumifs sumifs countif countif

according to a couple of web sites sumifs and countif are faster than sumproduct for example

functions like match vlookup and hlookup need to match data type number or text whereas countif sumifs make no distinction


mongoose	mongojs	3
i would like to use mongo js and mongoose in the same app.i require mongo js as i don t want write schema for a specific functionality of the app as it includes nested and complex data.i tried mongoose but that just makes it more difficult.with mongojs i could directly write mongodb queries and execute.whereas for other functionalities like validation and simple schema mongoose would be better so can i use both

i prefer mongojs to mongoose because it uses the same syntax used by the mongodb client syntax

in either case mongoose is going to add a tiny amount of overhead so it s likely to be technically slower than mongojs but not by any meaningful amount like it takes 5.1 seconds to insert 20k records vs 5.0 seconds

i would recommend using suds instead of soappy but this should work

in conclusion i also want to mention that if you do a search on google you ll notice that most people recommend suds instead of soappy as a soap client so maybe have a look at that too

finally if soappy just isn t working for you try suds it s better documented than soappy


division	addition	81
it could be done via division which is much slower than addition or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version

an addition is faster than a division and a multiplication

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

i am trying to make a simple calculator using radio buttons to select addition subtraction multiplication or division

however if the result a is added to or subtract from another expression and not reused then starting with the division may be more interesting since you can group the multiplication with the following addition by using a fma thus with a single rounding

division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

so for a class assignment we are using html and php to make a form that asks a user to input two 2 numbers and to choose between addition subtraction multiplication or division form using radio buttons then to input a guess as to what the answer is

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

as far as i know the division is more complex and slower than other operations like addition so is my code incorrect then

performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

you should expect a division to be a bit more expensive than a multiplication and a multiplication to be lot more expensive than an addition

note that division has a higher precedence than addition

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

for example an addition is typically much faster than a division

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

for e.g if i do an addition vs division in a loop will the calculation time for addition be less than that for division

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

best example the division it an an addition are both o 1 but usually the division takes far more cycles time to execute than the addition

also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division

notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

division has worse latency than multiplication or addition by a factor of 2 to 4 on modern x86 cpus and worse throughput by a factor of 6 to 40

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

so even disregarding that division is more expensive than addition and multiplication we see that the number of operations the sieve requires is much smaller than the number of operations required by trial division if the limit is not too small

division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition so what this is actually doing is

i remember it says something like division takes much much more time than addition

then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

the division has higher precedence than the addition so what you re calculating is sumaverage1+ sumaverage2 5 which is integer division which is probably not what you want

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

division has higher precedence than addition

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

it is well-known that the processor instruction for multiplication takes several times more time than addition division is even worse upd which is not true any more see below

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

the division operator has a higher order precedence as the addition operator

generally the division is more costly than addition i think but not much difference in this case

for that matter 64-bit addition might be faster than 32-bit addition and 32-bit division faster than 64-bit division

multiplication and division are higher precedence than addition so they get done first - before the implicit conversion to string for concatenation

division has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction so it s really this

the division operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator + so you need to enclose the sum with brackets before dividing

if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication

in addition to that the crossing off may be less work than a division don t know about python it is for c arrays

i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

i need to find out that how much division operation is faster than addition operation in a gpu

the division operator has a higher precendence than the addition operator so your function is calculating 1 1 + e -x

i think it is a few cycles slower than addition but yes division is very slow compared to the others

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

the first difference is that division is much more expensive than addition

this happens because the division operator has higher precedence than the + addition operator

you could also have dispatched a 1d grid and wrapped it to a 2d grid yourself but using a 2d thread position can save you an expensive integer division in the kernel in addition to being more intuitive

if you are doing physical simulations things like division or square roots are going to be way more expensive than addition

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

so if your code has tough data dependency problems addition is about 12 times faster than division

on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition

knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction

the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

and division has larger complexity than addition

division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

but that s not the case here since division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition and there are no parentheses involved

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

2.the division by 2 can be done by bit - shift operation is it really slower than addition

for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

this means the work is sequential addition not multiplication not division which are much more expensive

since division has a higher precedence than addition 5 2 gets evaluated as a integer division returning 2 as an integer

the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access

division has a higher precedence than addition ergo

with careful optimization however you can make addition 61 times faster than division

put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division


stringification	variadic	1
it possible to do this a bit better by using variadic macros to do the stringification


cntk	tensorflow	1
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features

but you will find yourself banging your head to wall when the rss feed will contain less than 100 chars

the user will select checkbox from a datagrid of rss feed on my site and when pressing a button the heavy lifting will happen

there is more than one rss in hugo one for the root and then one for each section and taxonomy tags etc but it is not possible to create multiple rss feed for say the home page

if you want to query all nodes that match feed entry or rss item then you can use feed entry | rss item

if necessary i am willing to use the twitter api directly to do the search instead of using rss but for my purposes using a feed is more ideal

the content of the text is set from an rss feed that is usually longer that that can be displayed in the text box

quick question here i ve got a process running that grabs rss feed and adds them to a mysql database

this option allows the user to tack on count x to their rss feed to retrieve more records

if you just need to read articles from the website and display them in your android app maybe using the built in rss feed would be better for you www.example.com feed you can parse that feed into your app in a very simple way

processing rss feed is more comfortable

i am trying to use feedzirra to grab rss atom feed but feedzirra doesn t seem to find updates

create an alert on www.google.com alerts and where is says deliver to under show options select rss feed

the rss feed-splitter component of mule returns only a single item even if the feed has more than one items if the pubdate for all the items is same

google s services that generate feed generally do a better job at producing atom rather than rss

i just found out apple only offers select rss feed

in instant articles configuration i only see one input box for submitting rss feed url can we have more than one feed for facebook instant articles

i need all the rss feed data from multiple website should arrive on joomla administer panel first then administrator select feed from them and publish to main page

i personally prefer json over rss feed

i produce a feed reader and when scraping feed always prefer atom over rss

when browsing news sites with firefox it will display a rss icon in the addressbar if the site has rss feed which makes it easier to discover feed

from experience i ve found real world feed are often more complex than the rss parser can handle

google does this because their feed api can parse more than rss

i want to check if my pubdate i receive from a rss feed is older that now

if you want everything on your wall not just your own status posts go to your notifications page and select rss at the top where you have the options of getting either text message alerts or an rss feed of what s on your wall

and as an aside if you re trying to get the list of articles on your blog reading the rss or atom feed might be easier though i suppose it might not have all the info you need

the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number

you d gain compatibility and durability because rss is more defined things will change less but if the feed doesn t include what you need it won t help you

have a look at this rss feed it replaced the greater html sign to gt

is there any way of better dealing with large rss feed

i ve been working with rss quite a bit and have found that atom feed are typically easier to parse using the rsssyndication class

if your service already has an rss feed things are even easier with the rss reader integrated in the buzzbox api

that will result in your feed looking even more garbled than it already does because the php will be double-encoded once for the rss xml and again for the html contained in the rss xml

selects rss feed

edit .net servicemodel.syndication - changing encoding on rss feed this is a better way

on server side at meteor.startup i grab rss feed from a blog

i have an rss feed that has a larger number of objects in it than the photo frame it s destined for can handle

for example if your screen is 600 pixels wide and if the rss feed string takes more than 600 pixels to display you will not be able to see the end of your rss feed

my hunch is that you should not create a specific rss feed for apple news but improve your current rss feed to provide a better integration with apple news and other feed consumers facebook flipboard google search feedly feedbin.

as you noticed yoou cannot create an rss campaign feeded by more than oone feed

i would recommend using rss feed to extract content

those are well-known formats and extracting informations from such xml feed would be much easier than getting it from an html page with rss atom you ll just have to parse the xml feed and extract the tags that contain informations that interest you

trying to grab rss feed using the simplexmlelement but i m not fully understanding how to do this

the system still in use today from what i hear is responsible for ingesting more than 3000 rss feed probably a lot more than that now into a cms

i was just going through some ready solution to grab rss feed from urls and came across feedthefire

i have used it for several years to grab rss feed

the specification of atom feed offers more value than the rss one with internationalization content types and other things and every modern feed reader supports it

this works for personal pages but i don t think it works on other pages to get everything on your wall not just your own status post go to your notifications page and select rss at the top where you have the options of getting either text message alerts or an rss feed of what s on your wall

better than twitter feed is engator - rss to twitter and facebook

i d say the answer is having an rss feed be nothing more than another view of your data

am trying to grab rss feed from

whether you pick rss or atom it s useless to make your feed too large

if i am parsing an rss feed with php and xml how can i parse more than one feed using one fopen statement

i am scraping a list of rss feed by using curl - look at the xml from the rss feed that s giving the problem there s more than one feed so it s possible for some feed to be right and for the feed that are wrong to be wrong in different ways

i have some list of rss feed url e.g more than 100 url

by accessing this page via browser and clicking on where your e-mail will appear a small div with two options shall appear for you to select rss feed

in my rss reader app i call up a new feed in a fragment rssitemlistfragment when the user selects feed a

failing that you need to look in the old blog code to find how to set the rss feed to show more or all entries

wikipedia defines web services as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. as implementation they are more complex than rss feed and are usually used to integrate business applications like connecting an erp with a crm system

i built a simple app for reading rss feed using rails and postgresql but am running into performance issues when i try to query my feed_entries table for posts from more than one feed

your first option might be to search for a wordpress rss widget for external websites alternatively if you want to be more customised about how you retrieve the rss then one way if your using .net is to use system.net.webclient and system.web.webrequest fetch and cache the result and then you can parse the feed using xmlreader syndicationfeed classes

the atom feed option seems to load faster than the rss one fwiw

is there a program or code that i can run daily that will automatically grab rss feed subscription links and compile them in a list

writing an xml parser to parse rss feed will be much easier than parsing the html using jsoup

i m using php to process rss data however often feed have more than image in the description


ctrlp	fuzzyfinder	1
if you re looking for a ctrlp equivalent webstorm has a fuzzyfinder that s actually much more powerful than ctrlp


backendless	firebase	1
if you want a backendless solution i recommend checking out firebase storage - url for image services which shows how to use cloudinary or imgix for these transformations


uipangesturerecognizer	catransition	1
if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case


decoder	encoder	10
my question is do know any existing efficient implementation of a rice encoder decoder i am more concerned with decoding that fares better than this the ones i could find are either slower or comparable

and as many other things the encoder decoder does most of the job meaning a bad encoder will produce worse results even if the standard itself can produce much better

the reason for using this vs .nets jpeg encoder decoder is vastly greater quality and speed is essential and other libraries such as bitmiracles .net jpeg library is tremendously slow even after i added some unsafe code to speed up sections of the library such as reading in the bitmap data

make methods that use generics such as and then implement encoder decoder for each type of message and have that would pick encoder for wanted message

making an encoder seemed easy enough but i m not sure if this encoder is making it harder to build a decoder

i find that if i configure the width and height of the output format of the encoder bigger the capacity of both the input and output buffer of the encoder will be bigger too.and they are very near in values.and when i configure the width and height as the orignal video size the input buffer is big enough to hold the raw output buffer of the decoder and i get the output video file.but i want to get a smaller size and smaller bit size video

especially the lzma encoder decoder may require more memory than actually available to an android application

you can use the apache commons codec base64 binary encoder decoder to do safer url links

what about using more than one encoder to encode my code because if we take a look at ioncube you will see some people can decoder it

in the end you have a scheme whose encoder is more complex but whose decoder couldn t be simpler


qtableview	qabstractitemmodel	1
how can i force a qabstractitemmodel to fetch more or up to a specific row and then force the qtableview to show it


ssms	ssdt	1
ssms or ssdt may have installed older versions of the controls which will need to be removed from the gac in order for the report viewer control to render correctly more info on this in the help page that comes with the preview


openni	kinect	4
i use kinect 2.0 pcl and opencv in vs2012 openni is no longer supported and i suggest you grab kinect frame by this it works fine

i was trying to run opencv example to grab openni video from kinect sensor

in the beginning i tried kinect sdk after a while a choose openni

another camera that i am thinking to use is the asus movement sensor but i dont know if this is better than kinect more options i know that both uses openni or if both are the same


comm	cmp	2
db.emp.aggregate match comm exists true project ename 1 sal 1 comm 1 calsal multiply sal 1.10 cmp_value cmp comm calsal match cmp_value gt 0

gnupg	gpgme	1
i would recommend calling gnupg the gnu privacy gaurd in c via gpgme


velocity	thymeleaf	2
i m working in a spring mvc project and i want to use a template engine i originally choose apache velocity because a slideshare presentation that says it was two times faster than thymeleaf page 41 and since i m working with big tables i need to use a fast template engine does apache velocity supports html5 if not is there other template engine that supports html5 that is not thymeleaf

you can also leverage other template engines such as velocity and thymeleaf to have better and more fluid html5 pages

html5lib	elementtree	1
if for some reason you want to use an implementation that does not give you a full parse tree then i would suggest parsing the resulting html using lxml a python wrapper of the c lib or html5lib pure python both of which can return an elementtree object and are much faster especially lxml and more forgiving of invalid html especially html5lib which acts more like real browsers in the real world


textwrangler	bbedit	3
if the text editor in xcode doesn t suit you i d recommend bbedit or its free little brother textwrangler

yes i recommend bbedit or its free smaller brother textwrangler

i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more

if you to bind events and use the benefits of a normalized event system you ll use the first version for regular blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error or your custom events

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup and error

mouseenter event handler will cause duplicate handler when mousedown event fired once more

i don t think that this kind of javascript library exist you could easily build one with jquery just listen to all the event blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

this would explain why in your case mousedown or click are slower than mouseenter which in a touch device happens as soon as you touch the element being monitored

i tried changing the event but sagepay overrides all these events blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu

the available events are blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

velocity	rythm	4
rythm is a high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity pure java template which use razor like syntax

the benchmark shows rythm is 2 to 3 times faster than velocity on a normal page

rythm is a strong typed java template engine using razor like syntax with high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity and fm

probably you can take a look at rythm template engine which is much faster than freemarker and velocity also much easier to use


fgets	feof	1
recommend avoiding feof and using the return value from fgets


tidyverse	tidyr	2
we can use tidyverse extract from tidyr to split group into group and decision then replace the group value to 1 if the percentage extracted the number with parse_number from readr is greater than or equal to 90

definitely recommend using dplyr and tidyr in the tidyverse as it makes restructuring data very nice and natural


sqldatasource	formview	1
particularly with the dev stack i am using its seems the less controls formview gridview sqldatasource i use he less problems i run into


multiplication	modulo	9
multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

this has some advantages over the original method when n is larger than the modulo divided by 2 since we can reduce the number of multiplication by solving for the modular inverse

note that is equivalent to i 10 but much faster since modulo is around 10 times slower than multiplication

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

it might seem unintuitive but it has a lower precedence than multiplication addition and modulo operations

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

it appears that you consider modulo to have lower precedence than multiplication and division when in fact it does not

inverse modulo for 300 time take 1.422 seconde more than executing division sub and multiplication 10k time even the core of inverse modulo is build with same division and sub and multiplication functions and for this number it just do 150 time inside while help plz why


jlabel	jinternalframe	1
my problem is this i don t want the jlabel or the jscrollpane to stretch to the size of the jinternalframe if the jlabel is smaller than the jinternalframe


foldable	traversable	1
i thought there were quite a few more with list foldable traversable but it looks like most were made more generic some time ago as i only see the old less generic type signatures in old stack overflow message board questions


vpn	lan	1
the reason why the vpn is slow is well because your vpn is likely 50 to 100 times slower than your lan local area network


clutter	cairo	1
using the newer integration between clutter and cairo specifically the clutter.canvas this will draw a circle to the screen


uiview	uiwindow	1
uiview is more generic than uiwindow and should be preferred


ionic	angular	11
right now is quite unfortunate time to choose between ionic angular v1 and v2

i ve only done one experiment with angular material myself and i wasn t experiencing any real performance issues at the time but i did read some people writing about it being slower than plain ionic

if you choose ionic 2 now you will waste similar amount of time just trying to make it work and adopt newer versions of angular 2

about when using angular s lifecycle hooks i like to use them when working in nested components but i prefer ionic lifecycle hooks when working on pages

i think your code has no problem except that angular has deprecated legacy promise methods success and error of http after version 1.4.4 you should use standard then method instead if your ionic depends on higher angular version

can anyone more experienced with ionic angular give me a hint what is wrong here

i would recommend ionic ui framework it built on angular js

however i feel like angular ionic provides a better way of doing so that i missed

i am an angular developer i choose ionic to develop hybrid apps

i m looking for suggestions for a workable stack a good ui framework that will work well with ember.js or an alternatives â perhaps i would be better off with angular and ionic etc

the docs for ionic 2 are clear user-friendly and much less intimidating than angular 2 docs


karma-mocha	karma-jasmine	1
if it were me i d look at the code of karma-mocha and karma-jasmine to have a better idea of how to use it


eventlet	gevent	8
but this popular wsgi benchmark says eventlet is way slower than gevent

gevent intentionally depends on and is coupled to libev libevent previously while eventlet defines independent reactor interface and implements particular adapters using select epoll and twisted reactor behind it

the use of gevent is also a performant option but slightly lower than eventlet

see the design docs for details i don t think there is much to choose between gevent and eventlet personally i ve had good results from the former

gevent is inspired by eventlet but features more consistent api

under what circumstances would something like eventlet gevent be better than twisted

both gevent eventlet have more substantive examples in their documentation that what i have provided below

if for any reason you prefer gevent that also works but in my tests it does not perform as good as eventlet


ftgl	freetype	1
id recommend ftgl as already recommended above however i have implemented a freetype opengl renderer myself and thought you might find the code handy if you want reinvent this wheel yourself


svg.js	snap.svg	2
the snap.svg syntax is a bit more concise the svg.js code is more readable

if you definitely need svg and want to only use existing elements you may want to look at snap.svg which is raphaels younger sister and shares a lot of the same codebase or another like svg.js


strncmp	strncpy	2
ps i d strongly recommend using strncmp and strncpy on all data from your socket

there are also another set which you specify the maximum number of characters to copy or compare such as strncpy or strncmp


ng-view	ng-include	1
i could add the dropzone in a ng-include above the area and have it hidden when the template is looking elsewhere but have heard that ng-include uses more processor than ng-view so would prefer to keep it all together


libjpeg	cimg	1
using libjpeg inside cimg is definitely better


rubygems	bundler	1
rather than editing batch files which you may have to do for other rubygems bundler it s probably better to do this once and do it properly


rethinkdb	couchdb	1
rethinkdb is more similar to pouchdb couchdb


gcov	lcov	1
i m unable to make any suggestions on this for windows but for linux projects i highly recommend gcov and lcov


war	uberjar	1
this is much easier with war or uberjar which include all dependencies within because otherwise you need to add all dependencies on the classpath as well which will take additional effort


opera	google-chrome	79
answers in opera was checking browser support for my page and wanted to search some stuff up. i don t get this message in my default browser google-chrome nor in internet explorer or firefox

according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

in your case this code would find opera first matching opr and ignore google-chrome afterwards even though opera matches with google-chrome

why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

i already tested it and it doesn t match with opera google-chrome firefox or safari mobile

there are some browser compatibility issues but according to this post the guy says that it is compatible with ie 7 ie8 ie9 pr3 firefox 3.0 firefox 3.5 firefox 3.6 firefox 4b1 saf 4.0 win saf 5.0 win google-chrome 4 google-chrome 5 opera 10.10 opera 10.53 and opera 10.60

on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time

google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum

when using a font declaration of arial firefox and ie11 show relatively huge variations while google-chrome and opera show smaller variations.

also nice to know is the fact that the latest version of google-chrome and also opera don t know since when but longer than google-chrome supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-ons

on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome

the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

opera probably is more complete to manage canvas than google-chrome but the problem is always to exclude the finger touch if i m using the pen

much better than opera firefox and google-chrome

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

this code to date is only supported by a couple of the major browsers namely google-chrome 37 and opera 24 see more details here

fireofx google-chrome safari and opera has better css selectors support compare to ie

according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

all major desktop browsers win ie mac win safari mac win google-chrome win opera mac win firefox

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

we recommend using firefox google-chrome opera etc

we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

ie9 win google-chrome win opera win safari win safari mac

on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

as you can see in the image google-chrome is running a lot longer than opera

i did one design which works for opera win firefox win + mac ie9 safari win mac ipad google-chrome win

i have this working fine in google-chrome osx win firefox osx win safari opera osx

it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera

safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

all my other browsers safari google-chrome and opera have newer javascript versions

especially in opera there is much more green in the painting than in google-chrome

try to click on the div in google-chrome ie firefox and then compare with opera

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

the animations are slower than google-chrome and opera

google-chrome and opera 11.52 were much worse and ie9 just failed at the second click with about 1gb of ram after the first click

i m using dinnextltpro-medium font on this site and noticed quite a difference on the rendering between safari 6 google-chrome mac and the rest of the world safari 5 mac win google-chrome win firefox win opera win...

i prefer google-chrome or firefox and i know a few people who swear by opera

browsers firefox win osx google-chrome win osx ie win safari osx ios opera osx

note i recommend using opera - it is much faster than google-chrome as it doesn t have memory leaks and comes with a built-in ad blocker

but obviously this would render script less usable after google-chrome and opera start supporting unicode 5.2

look every browser like mozilla firefox google-chrome opera have thier own design for modal window

ie8 has also some issues but to a lesser extent than google-chrome and opera

5.0 win google-chrome 4 google-chrome 5 opera 10.10 opera 10.53 and opera 10.60

i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky

ie 7 ie8 ie9 pr3 firefox 3.0 firefox 3.5 firefox 3.6 firefox 4b1 saf 4.0 win saf 5.0 win google-chrome 4 google-chrome 5 opera 10.10 opera 10.53 and opera 10.60

i have the problem in firefox 3.6.13 and have tested against current versions of safari win google-chrome opera and ie where the code all works perfectly

after running a modified version of esailija s jsfiddle test to include the documentfragment it doesn t seem to make any difference in google-chrome or opera for that matter so it appears as though google-chrome is simply slower

this may not be related as google-chrome and opera are working faster but what may be happening is your server is still trying to get the content and is not done processing the html this is what a video application i wrote in php did before i fixed it

using any other browser google-chrome firefox and opera it s much quicker

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

even if you manage to mimic google-chrome s behavior it will probably not match firefox opera or even the next version of google-chrome

i test on win google-chrome and don t know how it works on safari firefox ie opera

i have used some css hacks to get the position pixel perfect on firefox ie 7 8 9 and 10 win google-chrome opera and safari however on mac google-chrome and mac safari it is a few pixels out

i am currently testing using various versions of firefox ie opera safari for win google-chrome on winxp and winvista

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

i m not sure if google-chrome has the same features but if you don t have firefox or just like google-chrome better then pressing f12 will open developer tools same as in opera and internet explorer although i personally prefer firefox with firebug plugin

google-chrome took more than 14-times more time to complete than opera

the second happened when you remove everything and starting type and hit enter different browsers behavior very differently google-chrome insert very first line as a just text node of contenteditable container and than put every new line into div opera 12.12 handle it better and it never allows remove last div node ie9-10 starting jump around and after you started again uses p tags instead of div that s not even such a disaster just inconsistency but yet the firefox is not yet even trying to change it s br behavior

everything works fine for google-chrome 26 ie9 win safari 5.1 and opera 12 all of which detect the 5px setting

but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch firefox â time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

note how browsers that use v8 google-chrome opera 20 are slower with the delete than without it

the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

i could use the google-chrome firefox opera driver i prefer google-chrome

but on all of the mobile browsers i ve tried firefox google-chrome opera it s much smaller around 25 of the size specified

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

i ve used this in ff2 ff3 ff3.5 safari 4 win opera 9+ google-chrome 2 google-chrome 3 and they all work

since you noted thoughts on other browsers would be helpful opera s kiosk mode seems more powerful than google-chrome s

firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

no more caching by google-chrome or opera

you should try to start some traffic analyzer for example press f12 in google-chrome tab network or select opera dragonfly in opera or another trafic analyzer and resolve some question

i think it doesn t work entirely correctly in ie6 but it is fine in ie7-8 firefox safari win opera google-chrome

in fact i ran some tests at dhtml kitchen and found that in firefox opera and google-chrome document.write was actually faster on the first load and comparable in speed of standard html on subsequent refreshes


activiti	camunda	1
using the same comparission above also shows more activity than camunda and activiti project_1 activiti project_2 processmaker


sequence	permutation	2
if you are happy with this sequence of permutation there is little more to do

the result of the above function will give you a list of sequence that are all less than the length which is key when considering potential permutation 100 is fairly short so there is a vast number of permutation that can be readily discarded

testng	jbehave	1
i dont think combining jbehave and testng is a better idea


src	attr	2
display attr function is better to get src attribute

if you just want change the src attribute is better you use attr


pandas	patsy	1
that fits better with both pandas and patsy s way of representing things


burn	prerequisites	1
so my question is is there a way to make burn install more than one package as a prerequisites for the managed bootstrapper or is there any other way to solve this issue


ocunit	kif	2
for kif 3.0 you must select xctest as kif 3.0 targets xctest by default unless you re explicitly targeting ocunit in which case you should follow the same steps as kif 2.0

for kif 2.0 you must select ocunit as kif 2.0 is built on top of ocunit


entities	entitymanager	5
when hibernate s entitymanager is tracking 100 000 entities it is 100x slower than when it is tracking only a few see results below

each breeze entitymanager stores a single copy of each entity by key so memory use should not expand unless you are retrieving more entities or using more than one entitymanager.

so when you ask about go about using entities to grab information from the db... what you really want to do is use the entitymanager and or entityrepositories to grab entities from the db

i know i worked with annotations to improve my entities to create a postgresql database and tables with correct behavior and modified my config file to use entitymanager to have more control over which tables tables to create but i don t know if that error comes from there as i use doctrine annotations in these entities files

is it possible to tell the entitymanager which factory to use to grab entities


vbscript	vba	4
i believe that the reports are using something more along the lines of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that

i ve written vbscript but the similarities to vba cause me more angst than ease

and since you asked for a work-around if you have access to visual studio you could whip up a little com-visible class library that exposes a .net-flavored regex much more similar to java s than vbscript s api that you could reference and use in your vba code

vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages


visualvm	jfr	1
they attach to a running jvm process and allow for thread snapshots and various other kinds of diagnosis visualvm has a lot of available plugins but that can take awhile to sort through to configure and understand if you want to go beyond default behavior whereas jfr is instrumented with more by default


strncmp	memcmp	2
you can use getbytearrayelements to get the byte array contents and then compare using strncmp or memcmp or whatever

note also the functions strncmp and memcmp which are similar to strcmp but are safer


dom4j	xerces	1
it compares jdom dom4j exml xpp crimson and xerces


laravel	cakephp	3
lets use this site data to compare laravel sympony cakephp and zend framework

instead i would recommend laravel as it s such an amazing framework but you should also try out cakephp symfony yii or something else which is still being developed

my suggestion for your application is implementing the server-side using a framework such as laravel i recommend cakephp or similar


mapping-by-code	fluent	1
i m trying to see what is supported and to compare mapping-by-code possibilities with fluent nhibernate


prepare	execute	30
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute

i need to limit invocations to execute to occur no more often than some specified interval for example two minutes but i do not want to block prepare or execute if it is not necessary

instead of this echo you can choose prepare to write to a temporary file or build a command to be execute later

performance occasionally - it is true that prepare statements are vastly quicker when execute many times but in practice this is very infrequent

i would recommend using prepare and execute call

prepare statements offer for free a more reliable and secure dynamic parameter binding which is what you want and also better performances especially with recurring queries because prepare statements are pre- compiled by the database engine and much more efficient to execute

prepare queries are more efficient when you execute a query multiple times and also obviate the need to sanitize user input

my question is how can i execute more than 1 prepare statement

prepare statements are much faster if you execute the same sql and just change parameters in it

yes if one sql statement is execute repeatedly using prepare statements is much better

prepare execution is faster than direct execution for statements execute more than three or four times because the statement is compiled only once while statements execute directly are compiled each time they are execute

you don t execute prepare statement when you select execute get_account a200

prepare statements are faster to execute if used repeatedly

using prepare and execute should be faster safer easier and it won t make you feel like you re writing php in 1999

if i didn t get it wrong prepare statements are faster because they are sent only the first time to the rdbms and then only the parameters are sent when it needs to be execute

it should be noted that doctrine2 uses pdo as a base thus i would recommend using prepare statements over plain old execute

i ve updated the answer to use bind variables so that using prepare will give you more security and then you can either bind the values or using pdo execute with the array of bind values

there s no theoretical reason why prepare execute should be slower and tired of the constant criticisms the mysql pdo php developers have worked extra hard to make them faster in an attempt to get us all to shut up

so the solution you have come up with is correct if you want to mess with the statement text between invocation then by all means use client-side text manipulations 1 but do not attempt to use the result of it as a prepare statement unless you really intend to execute the resulting text more than once

2 executemany is better than execute as it makes for you the prepare statement

is there a way to allow the number of parameters passed thru pdo execute to be greater than the number of tokens identified in the prepare statement

prepare statements are sent to the database which checks it for errors and also optimizes it so that consecutive calls to the execute method are performed faster

prepare statements are slightly faster when execute repeatedly because the mysql server has to parse the sql and run the query planner optimizer only once

if you don t want to go with dbix log4perl and the dbi trace options don t suit your needs you can write callbacks for dbi s prepare select execute methods and gather whatever you like in them

if i try to run a straight select execute on con it works fine so the connection is being made but this prepare statement does not work it s not even recognizing prepare as a valid method it seems

using a solution such as a prepare statement where it is not possible for a user to directly influence the actual sql query being execute is a safer alternative

this would be so much handy to be able to send execute statement in one shot as the prepare query are way better in term of security if i go with the query method i will have to escape manually my parameters...

if you do all of these on the db the prepare execute may take longer but usually is less than all the queries combined but fetch which sometimes is the biggest becomes 1 not n and usually has also less records that the others combined

searching around shows many people bench marking prepare as being much slower and more intensive than the using execute especially when you aren t expecting any values back also see the doc for prepare - it notes being designed to optimize calling the same query multiple times

this is adequate but as mentioned - prepare and - execute handling are better


ppm	tga	1
you could use the tga format which is more common than ppm and allows true grayscale images


printf	strncpy	6
i have look at similar topics but i just get more confused with how strncpy or printf are not good or you have to have a 0 added at the end or some other detail that makes picking what to do more difficult

but i just get more confused with how strncpy or printf are not good

i d also recommend using printf instead of strncpy so you re always guaranteed to get a null character at the end of your strings

i don t know why strncpy will do that but in this case i will choose printf instead of strncpy

when ever you do string copying do not allow destination buffer overflow make it impossible to happen one way or another note be careful if you use strncpy it is not guaranteed to add terminating n so strncat or printf may be easier to use

there s also printf and strncpy which conform to older standards


lapacke	blas	1
i would not expect a major performance difference between the two the choice of blas dictates most of that but i would probably favor lapacke + the lapack and blas implmementation of choice if i were to start from scratch today


tablet	hdpi	3
in your case whats happening is that your galaxy tablet has a lower pixel density and android down-scales the image from a xxhdpi to whatever density the tablet has hdpi or xhdpi ....so it your image is a 512px image android would down-scale it to 341px for xhdpi or 256px for an hdpi device

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

each device has a density like hdpi ldpi and mdpi tablet have even more

chisel	verilog	1
the mismatch between blackbox and module io emission is a legacy api for better integration with verilog ip where the chisel designer has little to no control over the verilog


monkeyrunner	androidviewclient	3
i recomend to use dtmilano tool androidviewclient that is easier to use than monkeyrunner

also for creating your tests i would recommend giving androidviewclient a try as a monkeyrunner drop-in replacement which allows automatic generation of tests just recording your actions on the screen try culebra -ug

i need to perform several device.touch events as fast as possible however androidviewclient seems to achieve those significantly slower than monkeyrunner


tolower	toupper	16
i can convert full string to upper or lower by using toupper or tolower .but how can i do this.hope your help with this.thank you

when performing string or char comparison is it more common to use toupper to compare uppercase characters or tolower for lowercase

toupper is better to use than tolower but i forget why

i tried solving it using the chr and ord functions but ord s signature is chars - int and not chars - int so it doesn t match with toupper and tolower s

it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs

however i recommend using toupper or tolower instead of bit hack

you can use string.isnullorempty and toupper method is in general more accurate than tolower

your intial hypothesis of toupper being faster than tolower has a logical fallacy

prefer toupper over tolower for more character sets beyond a-z a-z collapse to upper characters better than to lower

so you can t reject the null hypothesis that tolower is as faster as toupper and thus your experiment has got errors

so yes - toupper is more reliable than tolower

as a side note using toupper is more efficient than using tolower so toupper would be the way to go

and if you have to convert to the same case to make comparisons toupper is better than tolower

i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though

we uppercase this with toupper then we add on the next 3 characters of the string starting at the 4th character which we force in to lower case with tolower

similarly tolower toupper provide more information about your intentions to the reader of your code than simply adding and subtracting 32

textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris

i d recommend vim emacs or textmate

i feel like emacs is so much better than textmate

textmate or macvim as the ide gvim or vim for the linux folk usually though some prefer emacs

touchesbegan	touchesmoved	3
btw for extra credit if you are using ios 3.2 or 4.0 or later use the uipangesturerecognizer class to handle the drag and drop logic - the drag and drop motion is a lot smoother than overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended .

however the transition from the initial touchesbegan event to the first touchesmoved is less obvious sometimes the device waits a while

for some reason when the duration of touchesbegan is greater than the duration of touchesmoved my player will complete the touchesmoved actions first even though touchesbegan had to come first and then jump to a different x-position and then move with duration 4 to complete the touchesbegan


ucma	ucwa	3
a very good reason to choose ucwa instead of ucma also in case of server automation is the much simpler deployment of ucwa ucma deployment is quite tough

old thread but in my experience writing server-side code with ucma is somewhat easier than trying to use ucwa - and all that ucwa really is is a ucma application sitting on your lync s4b server with a rest wrapper

alternatively can i use something far way better and way more secure by using ucma or ucwa or any other api.


robobrowser	beautifulsoup	1
given the simplicity of what you ve described as i understand it i would recommend using robobrowser as it relies on well-documented and supported python libraries requests and beautifulsoup and thus is usually easier for beginners like me and you


caliburn	reactiveui	1
personally i really like reactiveui which is fairly unusual but does make getting things right an awful lot easier than caliburn


do.call	lapply	1

ccl	clisp	1
for informal use-- to learn common lisp ccl or clisp may be a better choice than sbcl


jtable	jinternalframe	1
i ve found that in my jtable which is in a jscrollpane nested in a jinternalframe there can be issues with scrolling and resizing when the jtable was larger than the jscrollpane


lisp	scheme	56
none of this is intended to say that clojure is better than common lisp or scheme

scheme is also a good language for that purpose and it is simpler smaller than lisp

do racket macros have more advanced functionality than those found in scheme or common lisp

t s purpose is to test the thesis developed by steele and sussman in their series of papers about scheme that scheme may be used as the basis for a practical programming language of exceptional expressive power and that implementations of scheme could perform better than other lisp systems and competitively with implementations of programming languages such as c and bliss which are usually considered to be inherently more efficient than lisp on conventional machine architectures

racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development

although if i was just learning i d choose scheme and have a field-day with continuations call-cc - it s definitely one of the more academic lisp dialects

my impression common lisp is more for getting stuff done scheme is more for education and fun

for sure it s a complication that makes it harder to explain the language to whoever is learning it and that s why scheme is considered a better simpler language for teaching but many expert lispers think that it s a good choice that makes the lisp language a better tool for real problems

i ve also found scheme ides much more user-friendly than lisp s plt scheme is a good one

common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure

on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations

if you re shaky on recursion at all i highly recommend learning scheme or lisp

i really like thompsonâ s â œhaskell the craft of functional programmingâ because itâ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme

scheme is older than common lisp

if you want to understand lisp you re better off first learning either common lisp or scheme

well scheme has a single lexical environment but older lisp can have more than one lexical environment

this is of course subjective but i think learning common lisp or standard scheme is generally more useful just for the simple fact that you then will not be limited to one compiler

i would definitely recommend scheme macros over cl macros if you haven t deal with any sort of lisp macros before

i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common lisp as scheme is simpler

the class uses scheme a dialect of lisp which is significantly cleaner and easier to use than common lisp yes this is an opinion deal with it

that said it is a scheme which has fewer batteries included as compared to common lisp

i imagine scheme and perhaps lisp could be made more user friendly by using a different syntax

common lisp of course scheme might be an easier introduction though and easier to get a stable simple common environment

i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

in a functional style data and functions tend toward having more in common with each other as in lisp and scheme while offering more flexibility in terms of how functions are actually used

that s the best argument i ve seen for scheme macros over common lisp ones if you are building a complex language on top of scheme you are less likely to introduce subtle macro bugs if you stick with the standard macro system

scheme has fewer libraries than common lisp

i haven t used it myself though as per this answer it s quite a bit more confusing than lisp scheme macros

i noted that while in languages like c variable identifiers can only be alphanumberics and underscores common lisp allows many more characters to be used like and at least scheme does

i would recommend learning haskell and a dialect of lisp such as scheme or common lisp if you master either of those you ll gain insight into how things are accomplished with the functional paradigm and it ll help out your python as well

i personally believe that it is not worth the effort because basic is a nearly dead language and there are lots of languages better than basic ocaml haskell common lisp clojure scala scheme go d ...

both because of the image-based interactive development and because of the larger language lisp implementations are usually less portable across operating systems than scheme implementations are

ever since reading what paul graham has to say about lisp i ve been intending to go back and pick scheme up again and see if it ll improve my programming in general

i don t see why sbcl should be so fast - scheme is a far simpler language than common lisp

why would anyone prefer scheme macros over common lisp macros and i genuinely want to know too i m not trying to be a troll

i suspect that the reason people write scheme style macro systems in common lisp is more for the pattern matching than for the hygiene

i recommend lisp for example it s dialect scheme as first functional programming language

i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too

but honestly all the useful macros i ve defined are stolen from paul graham s on lisp and are generally easier to write with defmacro define-macro in plt scheme

if you decide to use a language that s larger and messier than scheme try common lisp

in that regard i d recommend scheme which is in my opinion more elegant than common lisp

most lisp dialects have this concepts in scheme it is rarer since hygienic macros are supposed to reduce its usefulness

common lisp has a separate namespace for functions which makes operation like this more verbose than with scheme

scheme is intentionally more compact than common lisp and you ll find that you can learn the language very quickly

if you do choose a lisp variant i recommend scheme

because they use a different non-scheme language scheme macros are less powerful than common lisp macros in the almost-formal sense you can do arbitrary compile-time computation with them but it s hairy and convoluted

for a counterexample i think scheme programs ran faster and used less memory than the lisp programs that preceded them mdash

if you want to learn lisp paip is a better choice to start with because it will teach you a lot about common lisp and a smallish chunk of scheme

if you are even older and grew up with scheme or are younger and have read the common lisp hyperspec then you might want to write

i have decided that i prefer scheme over common lisp so that narrows it down a bit

overall common lisp is much more uniform than scheme and more radical language experiments if done at all are usually embedded as a portable library rather than defining a whole new language dialect

i ve noticed that the common lisp approach is more conservative than the approach scheme has

however gambit scheme has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common lisp s libraries

is it possible however to implement common lisp s macro system in scheme which is more powerful than syntax-rules using syntax-case

here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work

it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp


pygtk	pygobject	2
it looks like python-mpdor is using gtk 2 which would be pygtk as opposed to newer gtk 3 which is pygobject

if you are starting from scratch i would recommend using pygobject gtk3 instead of pygtk gtk2 as it is no longer developed


nhibernate	bltoolkit	1
update for our purposes bltoolkit ended up being a better solution than nhibernate


mapguide	arcmap	1
i mostly work with esri software though i ve had a little bit of work with mapguide mostly for clients whose engineering departments are using cad more than arcmap


cstdio	iostream	5
iostream is said to be slower than cstdio but i suggest you use a profiling tool here to find the best set of options here

for those commenting that cstdio is obsolete personally i like it more than iostream

slower than the cstdio ones and extensibility iostream allows

yes iostream is slower than cstdio

cuda uses a c++ compiler for compiling host code and you should prefer iostream functions over cstdio because they are less error prone and support improve diagnostics on most platforms


explode	substr	6
although this is much faster than explode without the limit it is not as fast as the substr solution suggested by the user set sail media

how could i turn this into an array easier than using explode substr explode

you don t need regular expressions at all you could use explode substr is probably better but i want to show another alternative

explode separates the string by characters there should be only one anyways so maybe a substr would be slightly more efficient and array_pop removes and returns the last one which should be everything after the and be the domain of the email

just wanted to add that using strrpos + substr is slightly faster than explode + end

which should at least perform better than explode str_replace and substr solutions


dplyr	sqldf	1
i have tried merge match dplyr and sqldf packages but either i obtain a dfmerge with the updated 75 variables only left join or a dfmerge with 250 variables old variables with nas and new variables without them coexist


qlist	qvector	12
if the size of the qlist s element type is greater than the pointer s size qlist performs better than qvector because it doesn t store the objects sequentially but stores sequentially pointers to heap copies

give better performance than qlist because qvector always

if it stores it as pointers on the heap won t qlist be much worse off than qvector

which brings me to the point - if transaction ids are per savings account they would be sequential in other words you will be better off with the qlist or even better a qvector because it will be a little more efficient since you will only be appending transactions

qvector is better than qlist in this case because it s easy to resize it

qvector will usually give better performance than qlist because qvector always stores its items sequentially in memory where qlist will allocate its items on the heap unless sizeof t sizeof void and t has been declared to be either a q_movable_type or a q_primitive_type using q_declare_typeinfo

operations like prepend and insert are usually faster than with qvector because of the way qlist stores its items in memory see algorithmic complexity for details and its index-based api is more convenient than qlinkedlist s iterator-based api

qlist code is generally less optimized than qvector one

but if you are using qvector and you call resize you are able to fit all the items in the single alloc call - so don t use qlist if you need a lot of inserting or appending prefer qvector for that

my question is basically when to choose qvector and when to choose qlist as your qt container

most often qvector is not the best container to use usually qlist is much better

size qlist performs better than qvector because it doesn t store the


cobertura	jacoco	4
similarly you might find using jacoco easier than cobertura

so you would have to configure your big build to generate a coverage report with the engine you want to use i would recommend jacoco as it is supported out of the box by the sonar java plugin if you want to use another engine clover cobertura etc... you would have to install a dedicated plugin

you are better off with jacoco than cobertura

the other answer mentions cobertura but jacoco may be easier to set up


tstringgrid	tdbgrid	1
use an in-memory dataset clientdataset as teran suggested in the question comment thread you can still present your large data to a tstringgrid if using it is compulsory but a tdbgrid is more appropriate


avplayer	avassetreader	1
measure how much faster than realtime avassetreader can decode at replace avplayer with your own metal + avassetreader path if you think that some performance has gotten lost in transit


ubuntu	freebsd	1
some aspect of ubuntu are better and some aspects of freebsd are better in terms of performance numbers


accessor	ivar	5
nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct ivar is faster because it skips the accessor call

technically accessing the ivar directly is faster than using accessor but there are very few situations in which it will make a significant performance difference and would probably be a case of premature optimization

the accessor will be faster since you ll avoid all the slogging through the runtime to find the ivar in question

there s not much to recommend one over the other except that the direct ivar access is slightly faster the properties version creates a temporary array and sends an accessor message to make the new condition create its copy of that array

if an ivar is going to be changed frequently declaring a properties and always using the accessor will make it easier to avoid memory management errors


deque	multimap	1

mp3	wav	24
now i assume you are worried your techno might not read a compressed mp3 which should be smaller than a wav from my memories

the quality difference between 16- and 32-bit wav files is nearly never audible to the human ear on most sound equipment and depending on the quality of the original mp3 will take up more space anyway

it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc

you should definitely pick mp3 because they are about 10x smaller than wav files of the same duration

wav files are about 3 times larger than mp3 files so it would need 1.8gb additional space to do the conversion

its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via os codecs and add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

i am looking for a good new component that offers more help with wav and mp3 files too but not found what i am looking for yet

if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data

if you are still having problems jdk 8 has the ability to play mp3 files which are significantly smaller than wav you may want to try this

by that i mean if i choose wav file the sound comes if i choose the mp3 it works so there is no problem with that but the problem is right now is when pressing open - browersing a file and then press play the sound should come and yes it does

just like an mp3 or something wav is probably faster

stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via

ok i am new to audio with unity but despite reading all the unity posts regarding audio adding 2 short .wav clips i heard wav was smaller than mp3 to my app has added over 200mb

first don t use wav as it takes up too much memory mp3 is better

either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file

i understand that mp3 is much smaller but it has worst audio quality when is compared to wav files

it is likely that wav is using a more compressive codec such as mp3 or ogg internally

for using a fileformat i thought mp3 uses much less memory than wav because all the formats are based on wav but just compressed

bass is an audio library to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

question iâ m seeing some compromise in mp3 quality my converted mp3 is lower file size when compared to wav but my audio quality is little poor than wav wonder if i can increase the quality of the mp3 file

when we go for automatic speech to text service i always prefer wav over mp3 since it contains high bit audio data without losing the quality of the audio and accepting by most speech engines

i have done a comparison of wav files using fft but want to now compare mp3 and wav files

so when you convert a file from wav to mp3 you get a smaller file but you lose audio quality

installation	upgrade	16
downsides are that you have to digitally sign the application assemblies and clickonce manifest so clickonce can verify the upgrade and replace the older versioning instead of creating a brand new installation clickonce only installs into a user-specific app directory not into the all users program files directory and you cannot have any user-customizable install settings like installing various components or sidechaining additional package installs besides prerequisites

as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versioning

but sometimes in my installer when i choose upgrade an installation it instead removes the files for a certain feature

you probably have authored upgrade of your install incorrectly in some way so every time you tested your installation you were adding more references to the guids tied to these registry keys

on ubuntu 12 04 the kernel must be upgrade and docker installation is more difficult

choose upgrade -option when the first installation is done

you should be able to share the system directory across all of your ci installation providing a central place for upgrade and using less disk space

if your upgrade or installation is taking longer increase the value

upgrade code must be the same product code must be different and installation versioning must be larger in either first second or third number

i m trying to update an existing installer to read a registry value if it exists and change the install settings to match existing installation settings when doing upgrade installation

this can enable the user to download an upgrade patch that is much smaller than the installation package for the entire product

does an eclipse installation perform slower after the upgrade

as the versioning of the ase in the dumped database will likely be older than the versioning of ase you are installing to do the restore you will technically be doing a database upgrade so you will want to review the installation documentation regarding upgrading databases

i just upgrade to inno setup 5.9 and i noticed that users no longer can select installation directory if the user already installed an earlier versioning

client is only upgrade if that installation has a web server setting allowing them to receive updates and their app versioning needs an update compare versioning # s

when you install a msi with abovementioned settings msi will check if any other product installed with same upgrade code if it finds a product then it will check if the new installation has a higher versioning

uipangesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer	2
if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case

uipangesturerecognizer gives you precise movement data whereas uiswipegesturerecognizer is more basic and just detects whether or not a swipe happened and in which direction

internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.


content-length	content-type	4
by default it compresses responses whose content-type belongs to default_compressables and whose content-length is greater than 200 characters

...web api relies on system.net.http library for getting request headers and this library gives a null for httprequestmessage s content.headers.contenttype in this case and web api sees that content-length is greater than 0 but no content-type header and hence returns a 415 unsupported media type

in addition if you have few data to send using get will url-encode the data this means that the number of generated sent bytes will be higher than the data size itself while post will consume more byte in general because the request will additionally contain a content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded header likely a content-length header plus the same url-encoded data as get

but like mattias said you d probably want some data in the body as well so you d want the content-type and the data as well plus content-length would be larger


scipy	pyfftw	2
edit more recent scipy does a better job of not always padding to powers of 2 length so is closer in output to the pyfftw case

i found that numpy s 2d fft was significantly faster than scipy s but fftw was faster than both using the pyfftw bindings

an two for a function like sqrt i could probably write my own constexpr but something like sin or cos would be trickier so is there away around it

select sqrt pow 69.1 user_lat - 18.5914 2 + pow 69.1 73.917 - user_long cos user_lat 57.3 2 as distance from users where not user_id 1 having distance 10 order by distance

if i want to calculate a sin and a cos is it cheaper to calculate a sin and a cos or calculate a sin then a sqrt 1-sin 2 to get the cos

i write this regular expression to match cos 0 or sqrt 0 kind of strings why is it not working

in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite costly cos is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than sqrt and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls

select sqrt pow 69.1 user_lat - +startlat+ 2 + pow 69.1 +startlng+ - user_long cos user_lat 57.3 2 as distance from users where not user_id +user_id+ having distance +distance+ order by distance

the jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still faster


django	web.py	4
also this post by the web.py author is a very good explanation of why i much prefer web.py over django

web.py is more low-level comparing with django

i m new to sever-side programming.some people told me that web.py is more suitable for beginners like me than django

web.py has a templating language of it s own it looks easier than django s

fgetc	fread	4
you might have even noticed the fgetc version is simpler than the fread version

there is no requirement that fgetc be any slower at retrieving a block of bytes than fread

the fgetc loop variant was consistently 45x slower than the fread loop

doing things like 1000 successive fgetc is much slower than doing one single fread of 1000 bytes

guava	lambdaj	1
the guava library is much more popular than lambdaj and does allow you to avoid for while loops by using preficates and filter methods


tostring	string.format	3
also in tostring i would prefer string.format string object... over creating many temporary string s - and i recommend you use the override annotation to provide additional compile time safety

i recommend using string.format or just tostring 0.00 when you only need to round for decimal display purposes and decimal.round if you need to round the actual number for example using it in further calculations

for formatting a single numeric value tostring is marginally more efficient than string.format because string.format has a bunch of overhead to parse the format string out of the curly braces and then pass it to tostring


ctime	posix	1
on a posix system copying over an older file would result in ctime being newer even if mtime is older


rdf	owl	8
owl provides more mechanisms for asserting shapes of rdf graphs as does new work on rdf shapes

i d like to focus on the initial question and compare rdf to owl

owl is richer than languages such as rdf schema rdfs

one point to be aware of though is that rdf and owl classes are more properly thought of as sets not object oriented programming classes

owl and rdfs are more expressive than rdf which means here that you can capture more complex relations for instance you can also represent the link between sets of things rdfs subclassof or use transitive properties hasancestor

my question how to connect web page and owl rdf formatted data more precisely how to ensure input through webpage to dataset and get output on page

owl has more structure than rdf

owl is a more advanced language than rdf


hive	hdfs	7
choice is not easy sometimes we use rule of thumb impala is good for queries without joins if all your data stored in hdfs hive spark has bigger latency but joins are reliable it supports more data sources and has rich non-sql processing capabilities like mllib and graphx

generally speaking hive hdfs will be significantly faster than hbase

plus the overhead of doing it is extremely costly- hive queries against hbase are on my cluster at least an order of magnitude slower than against plain hdfs files

does not make sense to compare hdfs with hive

i know hive may perform better creating new rows from existing tables or from files saved in hdfs but i m trying to avoid this

something like linq for hdfs and underneath it would figure out what s the best way to execute select hive ql or impala best way to do a where clause etc

you should see impala as sql on hdfs while hive is more sql on hadoop

scrypt	pbkdf2	10
i like pbkdf2 because it s so ubiquitous and recommended by nist even though there are very reasonable arguments that bcrypt and scrypt are stronger

and here criticizes bcrypt and recommends scrypt and pbkdf2

pbkdf2 bcrypt and scrypt are much slower

alternatively scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 provide more secure algorithms

then pick scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 determine the iteration count work factor that takes the amount of time you expect to have available during peak load use a cryptographically random salt of 8 to 16 bytes or so and store the salt plaintext the iteration count work factor plaintext so it can be increased trivially and the resulting hash in the database storage medium

as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people

bcrypt is weaker than scrypt although still three orders of magnitude stronger than pbkdf2 because it only requires 4 kb of memory

now choose pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt

also since this is a bit old bcrypt is indeed better than pbkdf2 but scrypt is even better

pbkdf2 is arguably a better option than bcrypt scrypt having been much more thoroughly studied and tested


oncreate	onnewintent	1

mpfr	mpir	1

actionlistener	documentlistener	2
firstly i wouldn t use a keylistener to monitor changes to a text field a documentlistener would provide more useful information to the changes of the underlying field but an actionlistener would probably be more appropriate under these conditions

create the text field and register the documentlistener to it...although i d be wary about using a documentlistener personally maybe a actionlistener and or focuslistener might be more suitable but hay


atof	strtod	6
you can actually switch to strtod always a much better idea than atof and ask it to give you the character position that caused it to stop parsing

it would be better to use strtod for this purpose as it allows for error-checking but atof is simpler to use and so is used here

the second form is recommended for newer code as atof is deprecated in favor of strtod .

note atof and similar functions don t detect overflows and return zero on error so there s no way to know if it failed not sure if it sets errno see also keith s comments about undefined behaviour for certain values so the point is you should use strtol for converting from strings to int and strtod for converting to double those have much better error handling

atof may be faster than strtod on one platform and slower on another

edit basile starynkevitch mentions that strtod is better than atof for this job as it gives the ending character


division	exponent	2
note that the exponent operator has a higher precedence than multiplication and division just like in mathematics

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division


subset-sum	np-complete	1
the subset-sum problem is hard more precisely it s np-complete which means that your variant is hard too it s not np-complete because it s not a decision problem but it is np-hard


multiplying	add	46
in other words hardly anything slower than multiplying add subtract but not enough to really worry about

a slightly more sophisticated approach with add subtract multiplying divide

most languages will automatically increase the precision of a variable s type in order to perform operations on them such as compare add multiplying etc

you need the functions to compare add and multiplying c double type values respectively __eqdf2 __adddf3 and __muldf3

if 50 is replaced by x a value known only at runtime there will be a multiplication before the add the multiplication canbe optimised into a faster operation if the multiplicand is simple enough as one instruction because there is support to multiplying by 1 2 4 8 and 16 - at least in some processors and even risc processors multiplication is often more complex than a few add and shift operations - small numbers are often very easy to deal with this way but 575 or 13412 may not be so easy to convert to a small number of simple operations so a proper multiplication will be needed

can someone explain this behaviour multiplying operator has higher precedence than add operator

like this you can add subtract multiplying and divide more easily

where multiplying binds more tightly than add

while it is true that a simple shift or add is often faster than a multiplication but not always â multiplication are faster than you might think the only way you could use it here inside the loop is if you first checked to see that you were supposed to be multiplying by 2 and the cost of doing that check more specifically the cost of making the decision as a result of that check is far more costly than a simple integer multiplication

if x is less than 1 add -1 to e and multiplying x by 2

functionally a multiplying will always take more time than an add because it combines a true multiplying along with a true addition step

multiplying is still somewhat more expensive than add on modern computers and compilers go to some effort to replace them with one or two shifts+add instructions

however multiplying is faster than adding even though less clock cycles are used to add verses multiplying according to what my particular cpu s datasheet says about the instructions being used

division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract

as of a few years ago multiplying was 3x slower than add

with extra braces because multiplying has a higher precedence than add - assuming these are both percentage discounts

moreover i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

the pattern is if the integer is even divide it by 2 if the integer is odd and larger than 1 multiplying it by 3 and add 1

add sub are cheaper than multiplying better throughput and lower latency

you can also try changing the node s blend mode to add or multiplying to get a more realistic flashing effect

below is what i get once i get to the part where i have to choose add divide or multiplying

on a cpu with a fast multiplier multiplying may only be on the order of 4 times slower than add but on normal hardware it s 16-32 times slower for a 32 bit operation

when you move from float to float4 the vector operation add multiplying ... is more efficient thanks to the ability of the gpu to operate with vectors

its the multiplying that historically was slower than the add

they add horizontal pairs of multiplying results producing wider elements

inversion shouldn t be anything more than a multiplying add operation

you can choose between multiplying add subtract

this was certainly true 40 years ago when it was first developed but i believe in more modern processors the difference between add and multiplying has gotten smaller

add is faster than mul but if you want to multiplying two general values mul is far faster than any loop iterating add operations

but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract

for example fp add throughput is lower than fma or multiplying on intel before skylake 1 vector per clock instead of 2

a typical implementation of rand is a linear congruential generator which is nothing more than a multiplying and add of some numbers with special properties relative primeness

this seems too deep in the original code so i won t touch it but if there s any possibility of flattening the stored array it will be a speed boost even if you can t transpose it multiplying add dereference is faster than dereference add dereference

still while it might be better than multiplying by say 17 16+1 or 12 8+4 as they only add in a couple bit-shifted copies of the original value instead of five it s a very weak hash compared to hash functions that do more than a single running multiplication and i ll illustrate that using some statistical analysis.

however lets say i want g to do something more complex than multiplying by 2 like ask the user for a number and add that like so

multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

then i think it would be the problem of precedence in most case they are left-to-right and i think multiplying would be calculated first because in c multiplying is more prior than add instruction by one level

the multiplying operation uses more clock cycles than the add on many processors

to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992

integer add subtract compare instructions but not multiplying are also lower latency than their fp counterparts

in the above example the instance of exprbinopadd is a child of the instance of exprbinopmul although precedence of multiplying is higher than precedence of add which results from the proper consideration of the parentheses

so the bottom line is after every divide do the multiplying the 5 with 5 and if the result of multiplication is less than the equals to n then divide the n with result and add the zeros counter variable

i would like to add the pow in my evaluator with an higher precedence than multiplying and divide

for the merge layer i prefer using other merge layers that are more intuitive such as add multiplying and concatenate for instance

in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

you can add higher and lower resolutions by multiplying or dividing them by 2


whirlpool	md5	1
at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5


rvm	bundler	7
i would recommend bundler for this purpose over rvm gemsets

rvm supports more then just .rvmrc one of this files is gemfile with either the bundler directive to specify ruby

you could grab rvm have rvm install ruby use bundler for your gems and then launch the script

i d recommend bundler for versioning gems although both rvm and rbenv also have this functionality

there is no need to do anything to make bundler work with rvm but there is one thing about bundler that makes it harder to use

you can also read up on how to make rvm work with passenger 3 it might be transferrable to 4 with gemsets though in my opinion using bundler deployment is much better option

bundler is a better way to manage application dependencies. there is a plugin rbenv-gemset for getting the same results as rvm s gemsets but sam clearly favors using bundler instead


mouseover	mouseout	38
also if you re setting these on mouseover and mouseout it is arguably clearer to simply use the hover event instead

i prefer using mouseleave and mouseenter then mouseover and mouseout

note without the mouseout it works better but tooltip stays until next mouseover

it s similar to the solution proposed by ckersch except that it has more overhead you re changing the dom every mouseover mouseout but is easier to implement and doesn t change the structure of your svg at all

if you don t want to repeat code in case your mouseover and mouseout functions get bigger you can set the functions separately

the id specific hotspots show an area #id-ed textarea at mouseover and then hide the textareas at mouseout note the css display hidden was remarkably faster than hide

the other one is more promising because it can detect mouseover mouseout click and more but it doesn t seem to work at all

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

if you choose you will lose mouseover and mouseout left arrow right arrow in out animation

i would also recommend using mouseenter and mouseleave rather than mouseover and mouseout since you will have child elements with your menu

the available events are blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

creating elements on mouseover mouseout is much more work on the browser then having those elements created already in the markup with display none

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

seems mouseover and mouseout are more inclusive than you might think mouseout includes child elements

bind works with almost every event you need possible event values blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

i would recommend mouseover mouseout

the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup and error

i don t think that this kind of javascript library exist you could easily build one with jquery just listen to all the event blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

i personally feel that mouseover and mouseout are more user friendly than a click but you can always change what that part very simply

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

depending on your specific situation these two handlers tend to be better choices than using mouseover and mouseout due to the way they handle event bubbling for descendants of the bound objects

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

the mouseover animation is 200ms longer than the mouseout so if you mouseover and mouseout in less than 200ms total the animations run in parallel and the mouseover one finishes last leaving the color red

i recommend mouseenter because mouseover is noisy it fires more than once as you move from one child element to another within the form and can cause flickering when used with mouseout

what you have described in your question makes the use of this function better than mouseover and mouseout

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

every time you mouseover the image the caption keeps going higher and every time you mouseout it goes lower and lower

i tried changing the event but sagepay overrides all these events blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu

ultimate function to also stop animation when mouseout maybe include more efficient coding using .wrap and perhaps pausing the image when mouseover image div

val css html text data width height offset blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout


tax	shipping	5
in display shipping prices select including tax

2 under tax tab there are tax options and tax rates links available.under tax options select shipping tax class.

if you are sending stuff there are a lot more considerations than just shipping costs you may need to fill in specific tax forms for some countries and depending on what your site is selling you may need special processing for some countries try sending coffee to thailand -- you need to obtain permission from thier ministry of agriculture

after calculate shipping and tax if the shipping + tax is greater than 15 of the original payment amount i got the error authorization_amount_limit_exceeded

click to expand the calculation settings and in the dropdown of shipping prices select including tax


lzo	snappy	4
snappy also consistently decompresses 20 + faster than lzo which is a pretty big win if you want it for files you re reading a lot over hadoop

these formats allow various data compression codecs note that snappy is now much more popular than lzo and can also provide other benefits such as fast serializable deserialization column pruning and bundled metadata

snappy is also significantly faster than lzo for decompression

in my tests snappy performs better than lzo by the way


filewriter	filechannel	1
i saw some java.nio.channels.filechannel s examples but i found filechannel was more complex to read or write string to file compare to filewriter


uiview	catransition	1
the uiview class methods are convenience methods for common animations but are more limited than catransition


stdout	stderr	31
in order to see your results i would recommend redirecting stdout and stderr to a log file

the program choose stdout or stderr in your case psexec.exe u cant fix it

this works with python 2.7.3 the command to pipe stderr to stdout has changed since older versions of python

you can also use processbuilder to redirect the stderr through the stdout to make life easier using processbuilder#redirecterrorstream boolean

preferably something where stderr is redirected to the dev server s stdout stderr redirecting stdout would be nicer

based on several so posts i was able find a way to run the script and ignore select stdout stderr lines but its cumbersome

it also allows you to redirect the stderr into the stdout which makes it easier to read

i m using to grab stdout stderr

note that capturing stdout and stderr combined is actually easier

the dualconsolehandler looks like this found in another so question the idea being to print info or lower to stdout but warning or higher to stderr

because unlike cat more is an interactive program that requires more than stdin stdout and stderr -- it requires a terminal which your system call cannot provide

regarding capturing errors in files you can redirect stdout and stderr to your log files refer dario s answer at log4j redirect stdout to dailyrollingfileappender for more details about that

i use two subshells when i m attempting to destroy stdout but keep stderr

to save both subprocess s stdout and stderr is more complex because you should consume both streams concurrently to avoid a deadlock

check airflow webserver or scheduler logs for more details as stderr or stdout goes there

many programs would just use stdout and not care but i would prefer stderr on principle

in a bash call i want to put some constant parameters to a variable and don t lose stdout stderr inside a pipe

in other words instead of mis-using stderr like this - look into ways to gain more control over stdout

stderr is better than stdout for errors for a couple of reasons

either way my observation is that reordered stdout stderr output is more prevalent with an eclipse console than when you are using a native console

to grab stdout and stderr threads are also used

also the way assert_output works is that the block will write to stdout stderr and the arguments will be checked if they match stdout stderr

the under the hood of stdout and stderr can be easier to visualize in the c c++ perspective

a reasonable default to stdout or stderr would make more sense

sometimes this way is a better than stdout stderr but you have to use openlog closelog

i would like to test in my bash script where stdout and stderr are directed or more precisely if they have been redirected

edit now allows to select stderr stdout or both as in

stdout and stderr are nothing more than

what you need to do is grab stderr and discard stdout

turning comment to answer i suggest you add error checking to all your system and standard library calls except printing to stdout stderr that s more clutter than it s worth for almost any app something like

also why is so hard to grab stdout stderr from wpf


width	text-align	10
when the total width of the inline-level boxes on a line is less than the width of the line box containing them their horizontal distribution within the line box is determined by the text-align property

i have a bxslider which is full width of the page when theyre is not enough slides to make it slide i want the slides to center inside the wrapper i have tried using text-align center and margins etc but i still can t seem to get them to center as bxsliders wrapper width is alot bigger than the screen width

when i specify text-align center for an element with a width that is greater than the width of the text the text is centered within the content box of the element as expected

to text-align center the text inside a floated div the width of the width should be greater than the containing element

if the total width of the inline boxes is less than the width of the line box the direction and text-align properties control how the boxes are distributed inside the line box

the has text-align center so the will be centred if the size of the is less than the width of the

but i don t need a perfect width even if the width is wider than the longest word it is ok as i will text-align center to enhance visibility

you just need to use text-align right on the labels with a width that is slightly greater than the label text as the text will be lined up at the extreme right end

margin-auto works for elements with a width that is less than the page width in this case the ul is taking the entire width so there is nothing to center text-align center for the ul and display inline-block are the solution in this case

when i specify text-align center for an element with a width that is less than the width of the text the text is aligned to the left edge of the content box and overflows the right edge of the content box


bitblt	direct2d	1
the thing is that gdi is still faster than direct2d if i draw to a bitmap and after it s done i bitblt the result back to the form it paints at 35ms and with the same graphics quality


tunnel	packets	1
tunnel udp packets is somewhat more difficult


greensock	tweenjs	1
i highly recommend greensock for tweening instead of tweenjs as it supports better and have more features


pow	sqrt	10
select sqrt pow 69.1 user_lat - 18.5914 2 + pow 69.1 73.917 - user_long cos user_lat 57.3 2 as distance from users where not user_id 1 having distance 10 order by distance

first of all sqrt x should be faster and more accurate than pow x 0.5 why do you think it s in the library

using sqrt gives the correct answer plus using pow function takes more time

one naive way to do this would be to select sqrt pow tablename.x - x 2 + pow tablename.y - y 2 + pow tablename.z - z 2 as distance for each row in the table and then select the row that has the smallest distance

is used in having clause sql select sqrt pow x - 860.0000 2 + pow y - 105.0000 2 as distance from poi where status 1 and id not in 1 having distance 6 order by distance asc

my question is is fast implementation of pow x 0.5f faster than fast sqrt x

select sqrt pow 69.1 user_lat - +startlat+ 2 + pow 69.1 +startlng+ - user_long cos user_lat 57.3 2 as distance from users where not user_id +user_id+ having distance +distance+ order by distance

explain for select sqrt pow 69.1 subsidiaries.latitude -

so it s just one more legend at least in c# that sqrt is that slow one should prefer pow substitution

and as tom karzes mentioned sqrt is also better than using pow for calculating square roots


vfork	posix	1
both old and some modern systems implement a special vfork call which has somewhat strict limitations although less strict than the posix requireemnts for vfork but avoid this copy for performance reasons


bokeh	seaborn	1
what is the best way to get the better visualization with bokeh or seaborn


cocos2d-x	corona	2
i would recommend cocos2d-x as it is in my opinion equally or even better than corona and it is free

the consensus seems to be that corona is easier to use but that cocos2d-x has the advantages that come from being open source easy to customize merge with other code community etc


flex	robotlegs	2
parsley is more robust and adds a lot more features than robotlegs which is why its been used in the world s largest flex applications

any large scale flash flex app can get pretty unwieldy without a micro-framework adobe has pushed cairngorm but i personally prefer robotlegs there s also puremvc which i used before robotlegs i prefer rl because it uses native as3 events as well as dependency injection which is easier to test


onchange	onsubmit	1
onsubmit event can silently kill onchange event if called simultaneously


modifiers	sealed	2
nowadays however the rationale behind the sealed modifiers is far more about design choices controlling how client code interacts with your library

in scala you can choose between public access public package-private access with inheritance package-private access without inheritance class-private access private object-private access inheritance access protected access whatever you may call it and additionally you have some kind of file-private access modifiers sealed


qlist	qmap	1
this relates to another question i asked a while back at size of qt containers is qmap much larger than qlist


jboss	weblogic	12
in weblogic and glassfish you ll be better inspired by deploying the native ibm jca resource adapter and creating jndi resources then referenced in the spring context as above in jboss a direct mq client bean declaration suits best as below

if your application is self-sufficient i would recommend going for tomcat as jboss is much more resource intensive as well as weblogic moreover weblogic costs some money

if the solution can support both weblogic and jboss will be better

if money was not part of the equation and i had an employer that insisted on spending money that wasn t mine i d still choose weblogic over websphere or jboss or glassfish or anything else on the market

another reason we should choose jboss over weblogic

personally i would choose jboss community version over weblogic server because it s free you know like in freedom

i had worked on jboss for a year and on weblogic for more than a year now my experience with the web logic is good compared to jboss weblogic is more stable and robust it can handle more than 3000 concurrent requests without throwing a single exception where jboss failed to do so and admin console for the weblogic is excellent but i think weblogic is more complex then jboss

well glassfish is more right than jboss and weblogic business-bean-classes should all have their own ejb-local-interface

the problem i am facing is that in jboss tomcat it works fine.but as soon as i move my application to weblogic i get xif.createxmlstreamreader source

i am running an application on jboss 7 and weblogic 12 when i make a soap call on weblogic is more restrictive than jboss

unless you want to implement your own transaction manager you d buy weblogic websphere or jboss to do it for you

regarding weblogic and jboss i d prefer jboss weblogic is more complex


column-count	height	2
try with 1 column-count and as text get bigger than available height it will auto split in to second column - columns 1 150px

the problem is that when there is some fixed height opera generates more columns than specified in column-count instead of adding scroll


gridview	rowdatabound	2
selecteddate is a datetime property so you could either set it in codebehind i would prefer rowdatabound of the gridview or on aspx via inline tags

i have a gridview and on rowdatabound i use this code to change the background of every second row so the gridview can be read better


iboutlet	ibaction	6
something like enterbutton for the iboutlet and enterpressed for the ibaction would be more appropriate and prevent confusion or a naming conflict

iboutlet and ibaction are nothing more than special pre-processor directives that tell xcode that you can wire these things up via interface builder

as stated by mark adams iboutlet and ibaction is nothing more than a void typedef and will only be used by compiler

then you should be able to pick between iboutlet and ibaction

ibaction and iboutlet are nothing more than metadata that tells the interface builder that this is a possible connection

then in the connections inspector link the iboutlet and ibaction we created earlier to the button and that s it


textmate	aptana	1
in studio 3 much of this sort of functionality is still coming as aptana is going more of a textmate bundle route for a great deal of their features which i think is really cool


virus	botnet	1
obviously very similar to the virus answer above the difference being that while viruses usually replicate spread do a preprogrammed inconvenient thing a botnet is more of a take control of your machine for a future usually nefarious but dynamic purpose. i think the hosts your agent can more easily change with a botnet too


jlist	jtable	16
probably using a jlist or a jtable is a better choice than display records using text fields

and for showing all the selected values you can use jtable or jlist i would prefer jlist it s easy for using

should i go further and make a custom jtable class of sorts and jlist can have a bigger panel size but they are only painted and not intractable

you have got implements own editor never tried in jlist because there are missed importand methods in compare with jtable

or for that matter a jlist or jtable might be better suited to displaying the user input

a thousand fields in a scroll pane is possible but jlist or jtable would be considerably more efficient

it seems like you only need one column of commandeditors so jlist would ve been easier to use had it support cell editor like jtable does

the advantage of swing is that it has many more components available such as jtable and jlist which are more graphical and extensible than the components provided in awt allowing for more graphics-rich applications to be developed

for most complex output to the gui or array is based on java.util.list map hashmap then to use jtable with one column based on abstracttablemodel because jlist has implemented reduced methods or features in compare with jtable

i d be use jpanel with jbuttons instead of jlist as containers required to change getscrollableblockincrement getscrollableunitincrement for natural scrolling in compare with jlist or jtable

not entirely sure what you are after but a jlist or jtable might be more appropriate to display list information

a jlist would probably be better than a jtable

have look at jscrollbar.setunitincrement beacuse bunch of jpanels in the jscollpane has un_natural scrolling in compare with jlist jtable or jtextarea

it seems a jtable or jlist might be better than a bunch of buttons as well

i don t really think that jtable will help you here anyhow better than jlist - it has the same rendering strategy

i think jtable would be better jcomponents as jlist because there you can implements tablecelleditor maybe example with similair output here


geocoding	geocode	5
if this code challenge is for a uwp app then it is possible that the built in geocode may return more decimal places as it currently uses a different geocoding engine at the moment

the geocoding api works better than geocode normally but has usage limits and the implementation is bigger

2 location + reverse geocoding - seems more reliable but requests location services on the device does it work on wifi only tablets and for it to be enabled and requires time to a fetch location b server call to reverse geocode

i had a similar problem using ggmap geocode for a batch of locations where roughly 20 of locations gave the over query limit error even though geocodequerycheck would show more than enough geocoding queries remaining and the errors were sporadically spread throughout the locations not just the last 20

can the geocode gem support more than one geocoding step


sidekiq	actionmailer	1
you should try installing one of the background processing solutions you mentioned i recommend sidekiq and take advantage of the actionmailer + activejob integration


jsdom	cheerio	6
jsdom jquery offer complete set of tools but cheerio is much faster

i had the same problem with jsdom and switcht to cheerio which is much faster than jsdom and works even after scanning hundreds of sites

if you don t need a full dom available and just want to parse and scrape manipulate html elements there is cheerio which is more lightweight than jsdom and still gives you a jquery-like api

there s also jsdom but cheerio is simpler and comes with jquery-like goodness

i find request + cheerio to be easier than jsdom for tasks like this

if it is unavoidable node.js has good options - try to use the module cheerio which is faster than heavy weight jsdom


uilabel	nsstring	2
i tried this grab nsstring from parse.com and paste it into uilabel but it doesnt seems to work

but the problem i am facing if text is doted inside the label it calculates nsstring size less than uilabel size in the below code


uitableview	reloaddata	1
why uitableview reloaddata is more efficient than reloadingsections even there is only one section


nunit	mstest	27
sriwantha mstest is a simpler framework than nunit

example with nunit i have better experiences with nunit than with mstest

nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases nunit is faster and in other cases mstest is faster

if you want to compare mstest to nunit you can check this topic nunit vs visual studio 2010 #39

if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest

mstest is missing a bunch of features that nunit has and nunit has been around longer is more mature

thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar

attributes are used in a more meaningful manner than mstest or nunit

since there are still lacking features in mstest even removed features since vs2010 i would still recommend using nunit for unit tests

nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

i strongly prefer nunit over mstest

the best testdriven.net disables all instrumentation that mstest does so it makes mstest blazing fast - much faster than nunit for example

although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using

as a side note i prefer nunit because of the fluent syntax but also things like assert.throws and its opposite assert.doesnotthrow as well as convenient assertion classes such as collectionassert and stringassert none of which are present in mstest

i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

we did all the above with horrible mstest but you could use any testing framework i recommend nunit

for example nunit offers more assert methods than mstest

unit-testing frameworks like mstest and nunit provide little more than the environment in which to run a suite of programmatic tests

nunit has better support for parameterized tests than mstest

i also recommend nunit as a great starting point for your unit testing because it is free it has integration into visual studio if you wish but also can run standalone as well and also can complement other testing frameworks like mstest if you decide to use buy later

i do prefer nunit to mstest but mstest seems to get the job done just fine

he concludes that nunit wins for unit testing but mstest has much better abilities for integration based testing and team testing with team system

nunit is faster as compared to mstest

mstest comparisons and the developer community seems to pretty much overwhelmingly choose nunit

from my experience mstest is much slower than nunit

lastly i would recommend using nunit with testdriven.net - a very useful plugin whether you re doing nunit or mstest


capitalize	uppercase	4
as a rule of thumb it is recommended to write labels as capitalize and relationship types in uppercase thus achieving a better readability

for some purposes lowercasing everything is better because it lowers the sparsity of the data uppercase words are rarer and might confuse the system unless you have a massive corpus such that the statistics on capitalize words are decent

i can do the substitution with but i could not make downcase 1 as per my reading of the docs work for some reason the case of the word is untouched although substituting capitalize does work as expected and i am at a loss as to how to match uppercase words

based on what i ve thrown at it names with first letters capitalize will become lower case only if it isn t followed by another by another uppercase letter


strncmp	strlen	1
strncmp command compare strlen command -1


ng-switch	ng-show	2
however i would prefer using ng-show ng-switch or ng-if

note that some people feel that ng-show is a little faster than ng-switch and ng-if for file-based templates


ubuntu	debian	33
reference from here link for ntp commands as i am more familiar with ubuntu debian based commands

i highly recommend debian or ubuntu server for domain-0

but if your team has ubuntu experience maybe debian would be better choice for server infrastructure if you do not need the bleeding edge set of applications

the main advantage of the debian image is the smaller size â it clocks in at around 85.1 mb compared to around 200 mb for ubuntu

both use debian packages and ubuntu is based on debian but is more user friendly

if you choose debian you will have a choice of distribution series unstable testing that may get you newer releases of pre-packaged software a few months sooner than ubuntu

this is because ubuntu 15.10 uses a newer version of libc and libstdc++ which is not available on debian 8

if your default audio subsystem is pulseaudio common for fedora ubuntu debian it is better to properly recompile pyaudio and underlying c library portaudio with pulseaudio support only without jack and other subsystems

i m in debian wheezy which is much more recent than ubuntu 10.04

ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian

on my debian should be more or less the same on any debian based distro like ubuntu

i believe ubuntu is smaller debian wheezy smaller still or even alpine for tiny start point

these are also kept up-to-date much better than the ubuntu debian repositories

and people do install on their ubuntu system some external libraries so you need to search a lot more than what ubuntu contains and i won t be surprised if ubuntu or debian are large enough to already have conflicting libraries

you need to control many logging configurations i think the logging agent on ubuntu debian is better choice

i like the browser ssh feature not having to use putty prefer ubuntu over debian due to experience

i haven t decided which one yet but my understanding is that they ll give me a base os install i d prefer debian or ubuntu an ip address a root account ssh and that s about it

possible solution is building ffmpeg it s rather simple - i really don t understand why debian ubuntu prefers libav without alternative

as for debian being more stable than ubuntu for using as server it can be true in very rare occasions where the package is very obscure

this also might be fixed solved in the git add mechanism in more up to date versioning i vaguely remember them adding their own .gitignore files to empty directories so i d really recommend trying to upgrade to the highest git versioning you can for that and other benefites your distro may provide by default an older versioning as ubuntu and debian do

i prefer ubuntu or debian choose one of the two and make a thumb drive on a fresh thumb drive

ubuntu debian with gnome or xfce need more than 50 alpha in its background the alpha value of 128 255 gets the event while 127 255 doesn t

people tell me i should choose between centos ubuntu or debian

ubuntu is far less conservative than debian so you will get closer to the bleeding edge

ubuntu has nicer frontend and could be more suitable for windows emigrants while debian is more for backend guys

since ubuntu 10.10 is newer than debian squeeze if you can do it on squeeze you can certainly do it on ubuntu

i have installed these two tools with the official package of ubuntu and also with the package of debian that seems more updated

recompiling ubuntu kernels is harder -- it will require working with debian build tools

debian ubuntu and centos these are less of the lightweight base images each coming in around 50m give or take

you just need very basic functions mostly the standard toolchain. you could pick centos ubuntu fedora debian whatever

anyway for the past year i ve been using fink and apt-get on leopard because i m more familiar with debian ubuntu

your average debian or ubuntu user is more likely to be familiar with apt-get than with cpan

for newbies i recommend debian or ubuntu but it depends on personal preferences


mutators	setter	1
these methods which give us access to private members are known as getter setter or better knows as accessor mutators


getlasterror	findwindow	1
if findwindow fails a call to getlasterror after the call to findwindow may give you more information


uialertview	uiwindow	1
the internal view hierarchy of uialertview is much more complicated than it appears and starting from ios 7 it is not even added to any uiwindow so it s no big surprise that it doesn t participate to the responder chain as you expect

gedit	aptana	1
scratch be as close to just a text-editor as possible i use gedit for everything and i d recommend aptana in a heart-beat


sikuli	selenium	4
we are trying sikuli for automation but we prefer selenium if it would be possible

or selenium combined with sikuli to have even more power.

sikuli would be a better platform for gui related stuffs other than browser ie for any applications in desktop but regarding browsers selenium would be the best tool rather than sikuli

it will integrate with any other ui testing framework you choose selenium sikuli etc


uiview	calayer	14
this does not work because the uiview you are subclassing i assume it is a uiview already is the delegate of its own calayer it cannot be the delegate of more than one calayer at once

if all you need to do is animate something moving from point a to point b uiview and calayer are more than able to handle this

this is possible because calayer s expose more drawing functionality than uiview s doâ layers are lower-level than views and designed explicitly for the purpose of highly-configurable drawing within the layout and like many things in cocoa are designed to be used flexibly as a parent class or as a delegator or as a bridge to other drawing systems or just on their own

i want to add a calayer inside an uiview and this calayer will be smaller than the uiview

i noticed calayer had worse performance than uiview

i am using calayer s because as suggested in documentation calayer s are lighter than uiview and i have hundreds of them

a uiview is no more than a fancy wrapper for a calayer â bringing uiresponder events animation conveniences among many other things

does that mean the the view controller has multiple uiview or that the uiview has more than one calayer

a uiview is no more than a wrapper for an underlying calayer

i m able to composite my colors using quartz to draw an uiview but i want to separate each component into calayer uiview consume more resources

maybe prefer calayer over uiview

this is better than using a second view a bit larger as a calayer is lighter than a uiview and you don t have do modify the frame of myview which is good for instance if myview is a uiimageview

in fact each uiview has even more than 1 corresponding calayer

is calayer better than uiview in terms of performance


imagemagick	libtiff	1
ghostscript and imagemagick convert should also be able to do this for you although libtiff is supposedly quicker


webmock	vcr	1

by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also scite editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than notepad++

i prefer sublimetext 2 but notepad++ or scite might suit you better


phpunit	codeception	2
if you still want to involve some of the other classes directly something like codeception or phpunit might be more appropriate since you can control your testing environment more

1 split those tests to unit and acceptance and use a tool like codeception to help you do acceptance which is way more elegant than phpunit for this kind of test

rythm	freemarker	1
probably you can take a look at rythm template engine which is much faster than freemarker and velocity also much easier to use


bottle	flask	14
i d totally go with flask unless one dependency bottle is better than three flask jinja2 and werkzeug

in this approach you won t get much from django you are better of with bottle flask

i definitely recommend bottle or flask

i used to favor bottle over flask for this very reason flask has a different way of doing it though

if you re looking for something less heavy than django perhaps try flask or bottle

it was the first framework in python i ever used but it was really simple to use really no more than flask or bottle

i am using bottle but i am going to want to use https and support for https under flask seems much more straight forward

i m building an application in both bottle and flask to see which i am more comfortable with as django is too much batteries included

you might be better off looking at something more usable such as flask bottle etc

i d recommend bottle or flask both of which are very minimal and impose no constraints on you whatsoever

if you re looking for small implementations you might get better results with bottle or flask

bottle is rather faster than flask

either will do the trick but bottle or in my preference flask will be faster as it is much more lightweight than django

and if you need to manage lots of routes easily you can use klein or flask microframeworks or even bottle to make it easier and simpler for you a simple minimal usage example for using klein would look something like this


jquery	anythingslider	2
this way you can select with jquery the anythingslider element you want to change and do something like

in the anythingslider documentation there is a reference to getting anythingslider to work with older jquery libraries but i can t find any place to download old versions of anythingslider


wsimport	wsdl2java	1
wsimport is better don t use wsdl2java


yourkit	jprofiler	3
with java 7 update 40 oracle included java mission control originally part of the jrockit jdk - a very powerful performance tuning tool which is able to compete with yourkit jprofiler

which java profiler is better jprofiler or yourkit

having used both jprofiler and yourkit recently i find that yourkit is far superior for memory problem analysis and strongly prefer jprofiler for performance analysis


textwrangler	textedit	1
textedit is not the best tool to search and replace styled text for example the free textwrangler has more powerful skills to do that


arraylist	treeset	4
note using treeset instead of hashset would give directly sorted arraylist and above collections.sort could be skipped but treeset is otherwise less efficent so it s often better and rarely worse to use hashset even when sorting is needed

so arraylist and sort is more effective than treeset

so i expected that treeset would be more effective then arraylist

the following snippet illustrates the difference in behaviors between collections that use equals such as an arraylist and collections that use compare compareto such as a treeset


cpu	processors	78
the simultaneous use of more than one cpu or processors core to programmatically execute a program or multiple computational threads

processors intel core i3-4005u cpu 1.70ghz 1.70ghz

newer processors have other faster ways to do it and which ones are available depends on whether the cpu is from amd or intel and on the specific cpu model

as soon as you go beyond single processors it s much more effective to add another cpu or two to system than to struggle with gpu calculations

i find using system monitor that consistently 100 of one cpu is used when i run the program directly in terminal whereas when i run it in bash in a loop a maximum of 60 of cpu usage is recorded and seems to be linked to the longer completion time although the average cpu usage is higher over the 4 processors

binding threads to cores prevents the operating system from moving around threads between different processors cores which speeds up the executing especially on numa systems machines with more than one cpu sockets and separate memory controller in each socket where data locality is very important

one addition for embedded cpu architecture they have to be usually cheaper than mainstream processors so that they do not raise the product s life considerably

rise cpu frequency set more powerful processors s

processors intel core i7-6700hq cpu 2.60ghz

i would like to use more than one cpu to run ubuntu 14.04 32-bit in virtualbox but when i stop the machine and go in settings - system - processors the processors s slider is grayed out as you can see in the screenshot image

having data structures that start on 4 byte word alignment on cpus with 4 byte buses and processors is far more efficient when moving data around memory and between ram and the cpu

yes i know that browsers can take advantage of it and that putting the other stuff on the other processors can provide more cpu power to the javascript thread but i have an app that is mostly raw javscript internal processing where the main thing that is going on is search and array manipulation

processors intel core i5-4440 cpu 3.10ghz that s to mention if speed matters

how would i make python use only 7 of the processors to free up more cpu

the intel amd processors are much cheaper and faster than what you can get with these until they go in every cpu everywhere

if a task is cpu bound calcuating something making it multi threaded will only improve performance if you have more than one processors to run the calculations

may be the debugger is slowing down the processors cpu running in lower frequency compared to free run and you are getting the interrupts properly

the cpu processors could care less it is just bits they have no meaning other than for a very brief period of time as an instruction is executed

however cpu cycles aren t a great way to measure performance with modern processors which run more than one instruction at once pipelining have multiple layers of cache etc

multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can execute multiple instructions at the same time.

i have a quad core processors and the threadpoolexecutor is set to 4 core threads but when i submit my callables hundred or so to the threadpoolexecutor java never uses more than 25 cpu

i have created a window application in c#.now i want to set the cpu affinity for this application.i may have 2 processors 4 processors 8 processors or may be more than 8 processors

in general when used on single processors single core machine this should be sufficient assuming int size same or smaller than cpu word like 32bit int on 32bit cpu

the lock or on the first case makes sure that the data has been updated before any other cpu can read any more memory in the second case the xchg instruction has an implicit lock so all other processors cores will have to release their value of ptr before your processors can update the value

parallel processing is by far a more strict mode of execution of the code-units tasks threads... than just a concurrent run of code-execution simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually absolutely independent computational units

with current hardware at about twice the number of active threads as execution units cores ht logical processors however the architecture handles multithreaded execution your cpu starts spending more time scheduling thread execution and managing thread states than it is actually executing the threaded instructions

the application has far fewer threads than the cpu has processors cores

on a system with more than one processors or processors cores you can normally assuming you do have a smp-enabled system cpu affinity doesn t prevent it expect those two processes to use both processors but you do not strictly have a guarantee

is opencl just there to make multi processors cores just more portable meaning porting the code to either gpu or cpu or is opencl faster and more efficient

processors intel core i7-4790 cpu 3.60ghz x 8

i have read a superscalar cpu architecture implements a form of parallelism called instruction level parallelism within a single processors superscalar cant use more than one processors

processors intel core i5-4440 cpu 3.10ghz x 4

for if your solving algorithm size is greater than the processors cache size the cpu must retrieve pieces of code from main memory or l2 cache which is a slower operation

this function will check if the cpu argument is set to work_cpu_unbound and choose cpu to be the current processors

processors intel core i7-4770hq cpu 2.20ghz haswell processorcount 2

processors intel core i5-2500k cpu 3.30ghz sandy bridge processorcount 4

not only is it more expensive in terms of developer costs designing a cpu is vastly more difficult than writing user-space assembly code but it would increase the transistor count of the processors

this is because some compilers or processors will use more bits of precision in a cpu register than in memory msvc has 3 different floating-point behavior options for example

multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time

if that processors has more than one cpu can the interrupts run on different cpu cores at the same time

on a better machine 8 x intel r xeon r cpu e5-4610 v2 2.30ghz 256 gb ram much to my surprise i obtained an average 3 milions increments despite the fact that processors is much better

cpu speeds matter less than they did in the past thanks to the advent of multi-core processors

the operating system will give your program all the resources it needs the reason your process is not consuming all the cpu is probably because it s waiting for the io sub system more than the processors

notice also the the cpu cache is much more important than processors registers today

if it needs to be more specific with processors and stuff let s just say this is for raspberry pi 2a 900mhz quad-core arm cortex-a7 cpu on the latest raspian os

should i just look for more than one cpu core and how do i detect that or maybe the processors speed or total system memory

since these are typically orders of magnitude slower than the processors from the cpu s perspective this takes forever

the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 times slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processors

a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors

to the operating system a single thread which i assume is what you mean by java process essentially cannot use cpu on more than one processors which may or may not mean a physical core-- see below simultaneously

windows 7 home premium service pack 1 processors intel core i5-2410m cpu 2.30 ghz 2.30ghz

because the time taken to migrate a cpu or a cluster is shorter than the dvfs change time and an order of magnitude shorter than the os evaluation period for dvfs changes big.little transitions will enable the processors to run at lower operating points more frequently and further be completely invisible to the user

since registers are closest to the heart of the cpu a.k.a the brain of your processors they are higher up in the chain and ofcourse operations performed directly on registers take the least amount of clock cycles

multicore means that a single cpu can have more than one core capable of executing tasks and has all execution units connected in some way depending on the architecture of the processors

a concurrent run of a code-execution happens simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually independent computational units tasks threads et al

given that you re seeing extra tasks causing a slowdown you likely either have resource contention via locking or your tasks are cpu bound and having more tasks than processors cores will cause slowdowns

processors intel core i7-3930k cpu 3.20ghz

and in fact modern processors often have a built-in virtualization feature which even allows virtualization software such as virtualbox or vmware to run the instructions natively while the virtual part is done by the cpu itself allowing much faster execution speed of virtual machines.

if the processors is loaded enough then my thread works fine but when the processors is more or less free i rich quickly my cpu limitation 50 and finally the pool terminates and needs to be recycled

some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processors

many current processors chips incorporate more than one cpu and a cpu may itself be able to interleave a couple of threads

vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s

elapsed time is generally higher than cpu time with the exception of a multi processors environment

cannot sleep run atomically in soft irq context and are guaranteed to never run on more than one cpu of a given processors for a given tasklet

i have read that the number of threads cannot be more than the number of logical processors your computer has or at least there is no advantage to be gained since your cpu cannot handle more

since downloading web pages is network bound rather than cpu bound using more threads than my number of processors cores is very benificial since most of the time in each thread is spent waiting for the network to catch up

real mode seem to be different from cpu to cpu maybe latest processors provide more functions to this mode

processors intel core i3-2120 cpu 3.30ghz 4 cpus

now the x86 family of processors go back a long way to the 1970s when cpu architecture was simpler

for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processors it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encoded in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime

so whether or not method 5 or 6 is faster depends on the cpu i can only surmise this is because the branch prediction in the command processors of the cpu is smarter on the new processors but i m not really sure

the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

that is enable to your program to use more at least than one thread more than one processors if necessary that is by definition capped at 1 single virtual core of full use thus 100 of cpu that you see on top on linux or equivalent in other system

on a relatively modern cpu this will also cause the processors to enter a lower power state and should have noticeable effect power usage and the noise generated by the cpu fan

processors intel core i5-5300u cpu 2.30ghz 2.30ghz

the point of this cache is to store data that the cpu is using quite regularly to speed up transfer time since the cpu cache is physically closer to the processors then ram is

the difference you notice is very small but i think the multi-thread processors is spending more time because the concurrency for the cpu resources between the threads


wcat	loadrunner	1
microsoft s free application for stress-testing wcat is underpowered and buggy but the full blown test edition goes up against products like loadrunner but is easier to use better-integrated with vs asp.net and for much less money per virtual user


fortify	veracode	1
though it has a couple of rules that check for specific security issues it s far less advanced than veracode coverity or fortify in this respect


icmp	udp	3
in fact icmp especially the ttl excceeding message has even less limitations than udp on nats for the error message can be sent from every corner of the internet and routers with nat cannot be aware that these messages are not the true ones

an icmp packet has a header that is 20 bytes and is probably going to be slightly slower than udp

mere algorithm has something to do with ttl on udp packets old school and icmp echo in newer implementations


viewdidload	viewwillappear	9
also probably unrelated to the problem here i would never recommend calling viewdidload from viewwillappear

in your viewdidload on the second view or viewwillappear is probably better set the background image to the image you put in the property

yes you can query it in viewdidload but if you do it in viewwillappear will be more good because viewdidload calls once when view loading first time and never called again until unless view will deloc but viewwillappear call every time for example you have one view and it have navigation view inside and you navigate inside the other view so when you press back button viewdidload will not call but yes viewwillappear will always call

actually as per view life cycle the methods are called in following manner init loadview viewdidload viewwillappear viewwilllayoutsubviews called more than once viewdidlayoutsubviews called multiple time and lastly viewdidappear

important note placing these calls in viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear instead of viewdidload makes this easier to handle as it will work reliably even for multiple pushes and pops of the same view controller and you won t have to clean up after it in the previous view controller

you may find using viewdidload rather than viewwillappear or viewdidappear may work better in this case you can set your view up with a loading holding graphic or animation trigger your asynchronous networking call and then once complete display the required information

i d nevertheless suggest you register as observer in viewwillappear and unregister in viewwilldisappear since viewdidunload is called only when memory has to be freed meaning viewdidload get called much more often than viewdidunload and then you might have the problem of getting the same notification more than once

if you insist on having the location before viewdidload is called viewwillappear would be a better place then you have to hold off pushing that viewcontroller until you have a sufficient location

which describes using viewwillappear method instead of viewdidload called earlier and incorrect values for bounds


awt	swing	78
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they require tended to require too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash

swing is far better then awt and should be educated to people who is writing gui-based java for the first time

in general avoid awt for swing which has much greater power and flexibility although it too is showing its age just less so than awt

use swing follow the threading rules which are hardly likely to be more onerous than awt and enjoy

also you re mixing up awt with swing - use more light-weight jcomponent instead of component

you ll also want to see how maven poms select awt and swing source 4

start by having a read through painting in awt and swing to gain a better understanding of the painting system

i have a program an awt frame yes i know that swing is better but i am restricted from using it that has 2 moving objects

swing is far better than the obsolete awt library

ps i m not set on swt if anybody thinks a different library technology such as swing awt is better

in swing has more features than the awt components

for example javafx the reason why it is much faster than awt swing ever were is because it contains uses a huge amount of native code

for swing typically use key bindings over the awt based lower level keylistener

the only problem is that we don t know what to use our very own engine with awt or if we could use swing to make it easier

i m doing a project at university which i decided to do in javafx as it is more stylish than swing but i m having difficulty to find an alternative to the filledoval library for the canvas awt as i can t use the canvas awt in javafx

awt is really out of date people have more experience with swing no days and even javafx

nobody uses awt anymore because swing is much better

if you want to ditch the zero awt and get with the hero swing read more at creating gui with swing

it has functionality the same as a canvas but swing is more advanced and has better features than awt

i personally would just skip using awt and move to swing which provides better built in functionality for this type of thing

use a swing gui not an awt gui since swing is much more powerful and flexible than awt

if you want a java gui that actually looks nice well nicer than swing or awt then you want to check out swt from ibm

i suggest if possible that you not code in awt but rather code with swing which is much more robust and flexible

swing is better and few people remember how to use awt components

if your intent is to create an awt game i d recommend swing instead you should probably use canvas and its createbufferstrategy

i imagine this is caused by the awt layer which i understand is a primitive foundation for swing not understand swings more advanced events

yes swing has newer and better api s than awt

well swing is richer in terms of out-of-the-box components than awt

consider creating a swing application not an awt application since swing apps are more flexible powerful and robust

the keylistener is an older interface from the awt days its still ok to use it with swing but is more of a general listener

are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa

i know you re thinking why did i use awt instead of swing but at the moment i am more comfortable with awt

as i prefer swt over swing awt i d point you at hexapixel s swt based implementation

as a general tip for swing typically use key bindings over the awt based lower level keylistener

i haven t worked with awt much but swing is much better from the gui developer s point of view

either is capable of doing it but swing is more modern and supports components jtree jtable .. and functionality double-buffering built-in key bindings plafs support for rich text that is missing from the awt apis

now go and read performing custom painting and painting in awt and swing to gain a better understand into how painting actually works in swing

you should not use awt except you are confined to an applet otherwise prefer swing or swt

swing is relatively similar to awt apart from the fact that swing has more capabilities awt is probably the simplest form to start out with and has most if not all of the tools to complete your project hope this helps

which java framework awt or swing makes more sense for something this simple

habit is everything..they will do in which they have practice.but i prefer swing but we eventually need awt for event handling purpose or layout

the awt approach seems closer to bare metal but since jdk 6 brought a lot of improvements in swing rendering pipeline i would go the swing java2d approach

instead of using awt components like canvas i would strongly strongly recommend using swing or really any other graphical library

these two are completely different logically speaking and you should choose only one of them to go further with note that swt is more customizable and tries to combine the best from awt and swing while swing is more limited and uses the platform s native widgets

awt was the first try on ui for java later swing provided a better alternative because they use light components the component draw the ui them selves instead of relaying on native code and those light components were way lot flexible and maintainable then awt

swing action is most scalable in compare with awt listeners

swing is a lightweight framework provided by java while awt relies more on native libraries and is considered heavyweight

i find that the swing library is easier to use than awt although you do still have to use awt for listeners

swing has newer and better api s than awt

note first there is no combobox item in awt there is jcombobox in swing which is better to use than choice of awt

swing will save your more time than awt as all the code of components of swing are purely written in java whereas of awt code of components are written in native language that is other than java thus compilation time of awt is more than swing

the swing library is much more portable than the awt library

performance swing components are generally slower and buggier than awt due to both the fact that they are pure java and to video issues on various platforms

also for my money i d create a swing gui not an awt gui as swing is much more robust and flexible

i would recommend using swing library instead of using the old java awt library unless you have to

furthermore it is inadvisable to mix and match awt components like button and swing components like jbutton

i have used both and i prefer swing over awt

swing or javafx would be better than awt

consider using swing which has much better performance over the old heavyweight awt

i m more familiar with swing but the article painting in awt and swing distinguishes between system- and application-triggered painting

years ago before i got more familiar with the awt swing model and the edt i used to write code that violates many many java standards code that ll make any reasonable programmer recoil in horror

it seems unfortunately i am stuck using awt to do this assignment seeing as swing would be better

as far as when awt may be more useful than swing -

instead of awt consider a more up-to-date means of representing your client such as swing and also deploy as a jframe based application on java web start

i believe it will eventually surpass awt swing and swt

alternate way is to use awt - which is an older and worse technology than swing and in that case you can t use flowlayout - it puts all the components into one row

first of all i prefer swing over awt

if you can you should favor swing components of awt components

swing has more or less deprecated awt so you should extend jframe instead of frame

awt is a thin layer of code on top of the os whereas swing is much larger

the advantage of swing is that it has many more components available such as jtable and jlist which are more graphical and extensible than the components provided in awt allowing for more graphics-rich applications to be developed

generally swing is more efficient and advanced than awt

as already mentioned by others better to use swing over awt since swing is more advanced

i mean by light weight i thought maybe the swing components occupy less memory than the awt components

you can read all over the web that awt is old and deprecated and swing is old but newer than awt and should be preferred over awt whenever possible

the article painting in awt and swing goes into more detail

its was said that awt is faster than swing as it uses the platform component but due the arrival of faster processor etc ..

due to that swt looks more native than awt swing


getdate	datepart	30
you can get the current year from select datepart yyyy getdate

select dateadd d - datepart weekday getdate + 1 + datefirst

then i get the current week in the year by select datepart ww getdate as currentweek to make this example easy lets assume this will be week 2

select datepart year getdate datepart year getdate - 1 datepart year getdate - 2

select datepart iso_week getdate

example select datepart hh getdate

if i want day of year i am using select datepart dayofyear getdate

select datepart dw dateadd m datediff m 0 getdate 0

select datepart dw dateadd ms datediff ms getutcdate getdate dateadd ss timeval 1000 1970-01-01 from student

select dateadd m -5 getdate - datepart d getdate + 1

select datepart dw getdate this will return day of week as integer

i mean dont use this select datepart mm month getdate

select datepart month getdate

i found this select datepart dw getdate --6 in this site but i do not know how to use it

have you tried using select datepart weekday getdate

select datepart dd getdate

case cast convert current_timestamp dateadd datediff datename datepart getdate isdate left len lower ltrim replace replicate reverse right rtrim space str substring substring expression start length sysdatetime upper

select dateadd m -5 convert date 2017-01-04 - datepart d getdate + 1

select datepart week getdate

for example try select datepart y getdate datepart w getdate

you can check if the current day of week is friday or greater datepart dw getdate and then call select dateadd wk datediff wk 0 getdate 0 +4 or select dateadd wk datediff wk 0 getdate 0 -3

select datepart dw getdate

select datepart month getdate -- gets month number

in sql server do this select datepart month getdate

declare totalwaitingminutesoverall int select sum datepart mi isnull departuretime getdate - arrivaltime

select datepart week getdate as currentweekofyear

is 1 based following will be used select datepart dw getdate -1 to get a 0 day based day of week starting on sunday sunday being 0

select datepart hh getdate --current hour

you can use select datepart week getdate to get the week number of the year ideally i d say you need a calendar lookup table to build from

i prefer using these short forms because to me year getdate is shorter to type and better to read than datepart yyyy getdate


jfreechart	achartengine	1
android plot and other free chart solutions mentioned here doesn t support annotations the only one is afreechart which is a port of jfreechart for android i am currently using it and it is awesome and has much more features than achartengine


datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn	1
it works perfectly when i use datagridcomboboxcolumn but i d like to use datagridtemplatecolumn to add some more features in future


swt	swing	61
wpf .net represents more functionality than straight swing or swt but the eclipse netbeans spring rcp projects provide a much more comprehensive foundation for complex and modular gui applications

in the end - you have to choose between swt and swing or even javafx as each of these ui frameworks offer totally different sets of features and options

ps i still prefer swt over swing -

into swing application i like to avoid using it with swt but is its more easier its ok

hosting windows swing and its redraw optimization outperform swt significantly

give swt a go the api is a lot simpler than swing

is swt faster than swing

swing is the weaker of the gui technologies relating to accessibility in java compared to swt at any rate

i m writing an application that has an swt gui currently but would like the end-users to be able to choose between swt and swing

also swt is actually newer and more actively maintained than swing

i can t really compare swt to swing since my experience with swing is limitted

briefly after my swt eclipse rcp experience - on next project i would choose swing

in my opinion swing is easier to learn and to use but the results of swt are often nicer - you can often feel that a swing application behaves not completely right

i worked with swing and prefer it over swt as it has a purer component model with swt you have to worry about freeing resources as you re using native widgets is truly multi-platform swt works on windows macos and linux and is not even very well optimized for all three and it s more customizable

it s require a installation for each so linux windows | 32 64 swing no have this problem and is cool but i prefer swt jface

ps i m not set on swt if anybody thinks a different library technology such as swing awt is better

if you don t need anything like that you may use swing or swt it s more of a matter of taste

for eclipse i recommend windowbuilder you can build swt and swing applications with wb

even though i liked many design aspects of swt and it is simpler than swing imo swing is the one to learn because imo it has far far better documentation examples etc

my criteria to choose between swt and swing

i would recommend using swing or swt if you have to use java

i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation

fixing bugs in swt is much harder than in swing most classes in swt are final or contain hostile checks in the constructor to make sure no one extends them the package is signed so you can t simply replace classes and so far i tried several times to compile swt from sources - and failed

it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory leaks you adding component to panel instead of constructing components with parent panel information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look and feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro

if you want a java gui that actually looks nice well nicer than swing or awt then you want to check out swt from ibm

personally i prefer swing but you can do the same thing with swt

there are further libraries abstracting swt and swing to make them more ruby friendly

hosting windows swing and its redraw optimization outperform swt

keep in mind that the point of swt is to use native controls so if you desire the ability to completely customize your controls perhaps using swing would be a better option

having used it myself in my opinion it s also far nicer than swing in its api more like swt in that respect looks far nicer by default and far more flexible in what it allows you to do

swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui

if you plan for long term i don t see more options than swt or swing for gui development in java

i get the impression swing swt seem to more like winforms

probably you should start with something simpler than networking swing swt and android

you can directly compare swing and eclipse rcp swing equivalent is swt and they have comparable features

as i prefer swt over swing awt i d point you at hexapixel s swt based implementation

you should not use awt except you are confined to an applet otherwise prefer swing or swt

what criteria should i use to choose between swt and swing

if your only goal is to let users choose between swt or swing drawing their ui then swtswing would have been an option

like eugener i prefer swing to swt but both are rich well-maintained frameworks that will serve the purpose

these two are completely different logically speaking and you should choose only one of them to go further with note that swt is more customizable and tries to combine the best from awt and swing while swing is more limited and uses the platform s native widgets

which framework would you recommend swt swing java fx or some other

in java if you want a graphic user interface you can use swt or swing and swing is better than swt

swing is a pretty good gui framework architecturally although some prefer swt

due to that swt looks more native than awt swing

it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing

as for swing vs swt netbeans gui considerably faster than eclipse.

swt became slower than swing because it uses proxy to os widgets

swt community is smaller and it doesn t provide that many tools as swing does

swt has a more platform-specific look about it but java ships with swing built-in there s no messing about with external libraries as with swt although the use of eclipse may make that much easier i still develop quite a bit of my stuff from the command line unfortunately

i find swt to be an uglier api than swing in general though but not really a deal breaker

depending on who you ask it is either wonderful or evil since it competes with swing and makes use of native os widgets swt

where swt would outperform swing or

i believe it will eventually surpass awt swing and swt

swt is claimed to be faster than swing although in modern versions swing is also fast enough

which technology i should choose swing or swt jface

so in my view using swing is simply easier unless you have more experience in swt

however there is a desktop application framework called griffon that uses the same language as grails groovy which should be easier than using swing or swt

i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and native-feeling swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app

i m not too eager for using swt though since i m more familiar with swing

it is hard to give a rule-of-thumb where swt would outperform swing or vice versa


xuggle	vlcj	3
apart from that you might want to give xuggle a try - it works on a much lower level than vlcj but this should give you much more control over what s happening and unlike jmf it s a good actively maintained project.

i heard xuggle is fine but i really couldn t get it to work after trying hard for a few days so i would recommend vlcj which works great and its really easy to set up

so after my research and findings i d recommend going with vlcj but definitely using out of process players if you just want to play record stream video stuff and xuggle if you want to do any low level video work with the codecs themselves


cloudant	couchdb	5
in couchdb cloudant this is usually better done as a view than an ad-hoc query

proper handling of the last case is more complicated under cloudant and probably couchdb 2.0 due to its totally broken quorum handling but that s a different topic.

one step up from that would be using the ccurl couchdb cloudant curl tool that wraps your curl statements to cloudant and makes them less verbose

due to many improvements to couchdb and that cloudant has more features than vanilla couchdb my suggestion would be to use a c++ http library to communicate with cloudant

regarding cloudant it s more or less just couchdb so to connect you can use these libraries from the couchdb wiki


mri	rubinius	4
in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices

for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri

something where the app is about serving different pages you want low memory and good context switching things like preforking unicorn or running on the rubinius version of ruby with puma that makes concurrency easier to code because it will perform well with threading as opposed to something like mri with a global interpreter lock

works on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock


scatter	graphing	5
be sure to select scatter graphing with a line option

one way that has been suggested for this in the core plot framework was to create two scatter plots within a single graphing have the higher one use a colored fill then have the lower one use a fill of the same color as the background of the graphing

when i record my macro i simply select x f x and the twenty values below for each column select scatter plot and it outputs the graphing i want with f acting as a function of x

using line graphing types would work but i d rather not as i have potentially hundreds of series and scatter points are clearer

graphing by adding one more scatter plot let me know if there is better idea


phpunit	simpletest	11
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up

phpunit is more popular and up to date as simpletest hasn t had a new release for some time though for testing webforms it s still very useful as phpunit does not have good support for that

simpletest is slightly easier to grasp but phpunit is the best in my opinion at least so if you want to start learning and using a framework start with the one you re going to use when you ll be a master in tdd

i ve used both phpunit simpletest and i found simpletest to be easier to use

i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line

which one goes better with netbeans phpunit or simpletest

subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest

i would recommend phpunit but there is also simpletest which i know some people prefer

if you prefer phpunit i think you can fairly easily use simpletest s browser from within phpunit

is there any easy php testing framework and may be simpler than simpletest and not command line based like phpunit

i would recommend phpunit for your testing as it seems to be the most complete package for php imho many are fans of simpletest as well .


nstextview	nsscrollview	1
select nstextview doubleclick in ib on it because nstextview is in nsscrollview by default or select it in document outline and go to attributes inspector - linguistics - and uncheck continous spell checking here


highcharts	canvasjs	1
also with refresh time of 5 seconds canvasjs rendering was allot more responsive then highcharts


qevent	qobject	1
posting qevents to qobject is faster than using signal-slot invocations because there are no copy constructors called and there s no marshalling done except directly by you upon construction of a qevent


ocaml	sml	4
edit for those of you coming later i also learned that like sml in f# the order is specified and deterministic--unlike ocaml which is even more crazy considering how close the two are in syntax

more generally sml tends to be rather more elegant while ocaml has some more advanced features quirks and users

i also highly recommend trying ocaml or any sml implementation to get a feel of that central feature of the ml language family

depending on what you mean with suitable for concurrent programming i would recommend ocaml or sml standard ml


pop-up	dialog	57
it pop-up a file select dialog it even displays the selected file name

use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up

generally a pop-up is a better option for a login dialog and a pop-up would allow you to easily navigate to the main page

if you don t specify any user ids then facebook pop-up a friend select dialog and the user can select up to 50 friends

is there a way to allow the pop-up window to expand beyond the dialog but be bounded by the window and thus provide scrolling when the pop-up is larger than the window

in the dialog choose show hide a dialog pop-up up

or you can add a pop-up dialog which is more customizable

because of datebox pop-up z-index is less then your box mean dialog box s z-index it shows behind pop-up panel

i am using jquery ui dialog to show more than one pop-up on one page each pop-up will have its own id and it will be triggered by an anchor with a attribute

one of the button as you can see in the code below is a preview button where if clicked another dialog will pop-up to display more info about the intended operation consequences

note that this is not a listview but a regular web browser select pop-up dialog

the native browser select elements overlay the page in their various special ways and even the non-native select pop-up which you get when specify the data attribute data-native-menu false in html or nativemenu false in the selectmenu options is absolutely positioned as a dialog

my scenario is that i have a pop-up dialog which are nothing more than subclasses of skspritenodes with a lot of children on the dialog

a custom chooser dialog pop-up will be better for you in this case

because there can be more than one pop-up dialog active

from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows

in the xcode 7 commit confirmation dialog you can use the mouse to select pop-up menus in the central gutter to exclude specific changes by marking them as don t commit or discard change

and i want something simpler faster than creating pop-up dialog

right-click on the start group and select add dialog from the pop-up menu

when user long click the item and choose delete dialog will pop-up to confirm the action again and item will be deleted after confirmed click

it does work but i think a pop-up dialog will be more user-friendly and it will give more space for the xpage

i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying

if i do not touch the screen letting the screen dim off and then turn the screen on the pop-up dialog is no more there

when i select a value for group and click on search and select dialog for division field the searchandselect pop-up has both group and division fields as search criteria as defined in my view criteria

when a user clicks on the browse button which is part of the control the control displays a file select pop-up dialog box

the user should be able to click on a row in the grid and get a pop-up dialog showing some more details about that row

trying to build a page of charts asp control objects that are smallish and then when we click on the image a styled jquery modal dialog pop-up that displays a larger version of the chart

however if you re making a pop-up dialog it s better to detect if the user is not on a mobile device then use the css position fixed

one of the reasons why your picker is not showing is because of pop-up dialog having a higher z-index value

the bug is the following if the user shares a gif in windows firefox the facebook s dialog pop-up will open much bigger and without a scrollbar than it would be necessary and most importantly hiding the buttons on the bottom making the share literally impossible because the dialog window is not able to be resized manually

is there a method to pop-up a file select dialog

however when i run my program on windows 8 dev preview it always pop-up dialog that asks user to enable .net 3.51

the purpose of this parameter is to tell the dialog what setting it will be shown in â and if thatâ s pop-up then the dialog elements are rendered smaller than they would be in the full page version

but i dont like system pop-up and think more userfriendly will be customized pop-up section for instance jquery ui dialog

code like the following .after it running for about half a minute then close the window then the python has stopped working dialog pop-up you had better try more than once

dialog is designed for more interactive pop-up where-as a toast is really designed to display a quick text message

my problem happens when the user returns to the main screen before the confirm to purchase dialog pop-up then cancels

when typing in the text box the autocomplete pop-up but is bigger than the remaining space in the modal dialog

the pop-up windows are very easy to implement and the modal dialog boxes are even easier

note that if you re giving some sort of bonus for users accepting the requests you should also implement logic in your own app which tracks the number and ids of the sent requests to corelate them later when processing the acceptances as users could conceivably trigger the dialog themselves via javascript or the pop-up dialog and send more requests than your app allows

i realize this is an older post but we just ran into the same issue and resolved it by setting the z-index of the bubble pop-up to something higher than the dialog window

the issue i m having is that when the height of the page is smaller than the pop-up it opens a dialog instead of a pop-up

when a user clicks on a particular image a dialog window is supposed to pop-up and display a larger version of said image

when you press print in calendar print preview the print dialog that pop-up has more options cross browsers

some possible options that might be nicer than multiple dialog pop-up

when i invoke the click event without using the mddialog everything works fine but using with the dialog the upload file choose pop-up never show

2.on the pop-up menu choose dialog

it works well if nothing goes wrong but when i close the pop-up dialog and click more radio buttons even if the count is higher than 3 the facebook dialog doesn t pop-up

dialog makes it easier for you to create a pop-up window with customized contents

the dialog pop-up is bigger than the browser window when opened

i encourage you to upgrade jquery mobile to 1.3.x and take a look at jquery mobile 1.3 s pop-up widget which is different from the dialog and works more like what you want than dialog does

of course the println would pop-up a dialog or do something more useful to the final user

my guess is that this same behavior occurs when the confirm your in app purchase dialog pop-up

feed dialog is more intrusive in the sense that it has a facebook pop-up window

this will allow it to pop-up like a dialog but give you more flexibility and easier to manipulate imho

anybody please help to focus the file select dialog to the current pop-up window

i am trying to make a dialog pop-up that displays more information about an entry in a listview


devise	cancan	2
i personally prefer devise with cancan

devise is mostly used for authentication but cancan is better to deal with user privileges


bluecloth	rdiscount	2
rdiscount seems to be much faster and more reliable than bluecloth

consider rdiscount which substitutes for bluecloth but is faster and better maintained


postfix	dovecot	2
i found that postfix dovecot is much more robust and it seems imap is the best way to work with it from php please correct me if i m wrong

if you have dovecot running too i can recommend having postfix authenticate via dovecot which is very configurable when it comes to sasl authentication


wxpython	pygtk	5
personally i favor wxpython due to its cross-platform nature but pyqt and pygtk are also equally good as far as i have heard

now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice feature

thanks to opencv i managed to rewrite everything with wxpython which i know better than pygtk

also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the script performance

in case of python wxpython documentation leads over pyqt and pygtk whereas in case of ruby ruby-qt4 leads over ruby-gtk2 and wxruby


glut	glfw	8
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle

or if you re really focused on only doing opengl i may suggest using glfw which is the better glut but you ll have to draw the menus yourself using opengl

opinionated note i prefer glfw over glut

you can use glfw sdl or glut for getting those personally i recommend glfw if you need only one single window

if you are a noob then i don t think that starting with mesa running on any kind of vm is a good idea.mesa setup is pretty complex in general.also mesa opengl is outdated.it supports up to 3.2 version atm.if you want to get started with opengl the right and clean way you should better setup context with libs like glut or glfw and load gl extension with glew there are more

i also prefer glfw before glut mainly because glut isn t maintained actively

edit explained as i m guessing you are somehow forced to use glut but i agree with other posters glfw is a better option if you can choose

i really prefer glfw to glut and want to get its golang binding working under windows 64-bit with go 1.0.1 64-bit


d3.js	c3.js	2
but i don t want to use d3.js because some other feature in c3.js is better

c3.js sits on top of d3.js to provide more accessible charts because d3.js while powerful is a wily beast to work with for common use-cases


qgraphicsview	qwidget	2
i ve read that painting to a qwidget is sometimes faster than qgraphicsview but it would by a lot of extra work for the mouse handling i think

plus the performance was much faster than on qwidget because of qgraphicsview optimizations


strtok	getline	1
to parse the input data i recommend getline with strtok to break the line into the proper data


svg	vml	4
classes in svg aren t quite the same as classes in everything else - and in raphael which deals with svg and ie s vml things get even more hairy

i think as soon as there s libraries for svg vml we ll see more stuff move to the web

i m writing a bit of javascript and need to choose between svg or vml or both or something else it s a weird world

ie s vml is slower than other browser s svg


scalaz	combinators	1
is there a more straightforward solution with scalaz maybe with an existing combinators


setinterval	settimeout	97
i find setinterval is a little cleaner than chaining settimeout calls

instead of using setinterval at a fixed 5s interval which is not dependent on the rest of the calls i would recommend using settimeout every time that the method actually is successful

also i think you d be better off with setinterval in this situation instead of using an infinite settimeout loop

settimeout is more relevant than setinterval since the first method just waits for a delay and executes a logic whereas the second function is meant for repeating a logic on periodic intervals

now a routine to initiate once per second - settimeout is usually more useful than setinterval

the setinterval and settimeout ways you have shown are identical except that setinterval is more clear

use the ajax send xmlhttprequest per 2 seconds settimeout or setinterval may be more good

here i also recommend using settimeout instead of setinterval

using settimeout for such purposes is better idea than setinterval as you don t have to clear them and they won t get crowded - if your fight takes longer than period then this won t run into next fight

i thought about using the setinterval function instead but because i am dealing with multiple functions i thought settimeout would be better

the function settimeout is intended for a single timeout so using setinterval would be a more appropriate option

rather than using a recursive settimeout i recommend using setinterval

a variation that uses settimeout rather than setinterval and uses the more cross-browser secure document.location.reload true

it seems that settimeout has bigger priority than setinterval which could be delayed

in cases like this however where monitor sync is not that critical setinterval and settimeout are probably better choices in regard to load

it compares raf with settimeout setinterval

though i would recommend using settimeout recursively instead of setinterval for better performance and the intended effect i guess

btw when you use settimeout or setinterval it is better to pass it an actual function instead of a string with the source code for a function

logic points that settimeout would be more proper solution for spawning and such but setinterval gives me possibility of providing progress bar while settimeout does not

if there is a long execution time the execution time is greater than settimeout or setinterval to set the time

i also recommend using setinterval for this rather than settimeout and passing it a function rather than a string

i prefer using setinterval over settimeout

i d prefer settimeout instead of seinterval since the latter has a disadvantage if there s another script blocking the execution of timed calls set by setinterval these calls are stacked and when the blocking script is finished all stacked calls are executed as fast as possible

setinterval is better than settimeout for this task

i prefer using settimeout instead of setinterval as it allows for user-interactions as well in-between

instead of a setinterval here settimeout will work far better

this in effect would traverse the comment tree linearly and would allow the setinterval or probably settimeout would be more appropriate to have a noticeable affect

the delay for setinterval and settimeout can be longer than the specified time

settimeout is used in lieu of setinterval which is more cumbersome when it comes to killing the cycle

also in my experience at least settimeout offers a much more aesthetic experience than setinterval or requestanimationframe

should i use settimeout or setinterval which is better

setinterval vs settimeout i used settimeout instead of setinterval which gives more control over timing

setinterval is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since settimeout only runs once and you need to keep on calling it

i have read about settimeout and setinterval however need more experienced developers advice and help

the use of one settimeout timer is more preferably than several setinterval timers

i recommend using settimeout instead of setinterval as a general best practice

well setinterval and settimeout essentially try to do the same thing but for your case setinterval method will be more accurate than settimeout

also i advise you to take a look at javascript s setinterval since it is more appropriate than settimeout for what you want to do

i would recommend using setinterval instead of settimeout

i would prefer settimeout over setinterval

if so then you can just pop lines off the array using settimeout which is better than setinterval for most animations

my solution was to increase the settimeout to create a bigger delay before the next part of the script commenced but also to add an additional clearinterval as the top line of the script running within the setinterval

instead of using a for-loop and settimeout would setinterval work better for what you need

it uses settimeout however settimeout is a better solution than setinterval because it will only queue a new one if the previous one is complete

so for scheduling purposes i suggest you to use the setinterval approach while the settimeout approach is better for delayed execution and asynchronous work

and else is explained why requestanimationframe is better than setinterval or settimeout

to make it infinite loop you have to wrap all these code inside a function and use only one setinterval because using more than one can damage your program and use a settimeout to delay the second pragragh bb class changes this is the function that i came up with

setinterval would be the better way than settimeout

this is also one of the few places i think you d be better off with setinterval rather than settimeout

the above delta timer is better than setinterval method 1 makes use of settimeout method 2 but also corrects itself starts the timer using a function method 3 and doesn t pollute the scope with a special clockstart function method 4

you can use setinterval instead but for most animations settimeout is easier to control and more importantly.

note that both settimeout and setinterval may take longer than the given delay to run though that shouldn t be an issue here

i d also recommend using settimeout rather than setinterval clearinterval since it doesn t need to be run on a recurring basis

this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right

i understand from searching on so that setinterval is a better way to approach this that settimeout which i was using initially but i haven t figured out how to specify that the function needs to repeat

instead initiate all the settimeout s you need for the entire animation at the same time with increasing delays in a loop and let them run their course or better yet use setinterval which is the better way of doing animations and how for instance jquery s animations work

settimeout evaluates your function once setinterval is more suited to call your chrono at specified interval

then again it s better than settimeout setinterval which fires only once per second if the tab is not active in google chrome a common use case for audio file listening

i also faced the same problem and i fixed it by writing a new controller and a view for the div to be refreshed and then used setinterval actually settimeout worked better for my requirement

and im not shure about this statement javascript likes settimeout more than setinterval which gives a little performance boost

also settimeout is a better approach than setinterval as you explicitly reset it on each round trip

i always recommend settimeout over setinterval for reasons better explained by bobince while my answer is close to extramaster s i dont advocate the use of interval just to have the ability to clear it

i recommend using setinterval above settimeout in your case since you want to have the function executed repeatedly

i ve replaced settimeout with setinterval which is more appropriate for repeated tasks

also setinterval is often better replaced by settimeout

in general repeated calls to settimeout are better than a single call to setinterval for a few reasons

i don t want to dive too deep into that topic but if you are interested in why to favor settimeout over setinterval i recommend john resig s post on the topic

i read that settimeout is less cpu resources intensive than setinterval

keep in mind that using setinterval is less efficient for this case then using settimeout which doesn t require comparing times at all as it schedules the alarm to occur at a particular time as setinterval will use more processor cycles to both schedule a check and then to compare the times

in order to do some heavy calculations in parallel i recommend using settimeout or setinterval to achieve your goal

this allows for perfect synchronization with the monitor update rate as well as being more efficient than settimeout setinterval you could throttle it so you only update per 1 30 frame to match video rate by using a simple boolean flag that alternates

i think using settimeout is safer than setinterval

you could achieve the same result with setinterval but i prefer settimeout in this one

using setinterval may be more readable to some eyes but i think the settimeout approach you have is fine

if however in your app you can ensure that the tab is active while listening then settimeout or setinterval is better as it can fire as often as 100 times per second

we could still do this with settimeout but setinterval is better suited for this job

that s better than setinterval or settimeout

in any case raf will enable the drawing to be synced to the monitor so in any case it will be a better choice than setinterval settimeout in cases such as these

for intervals like polling i recommend using setinterval instead of a recursive settimeout

lastly because it is a clock i would recommend using setinterval instead of settimeout so that you can be sure it runs every second

using settimeout is considered better than setinterval because of the screwy ways that js s event loop works

when animating on a browser always use resquestanimationframe it gives far better results than setinterval and settimeout by only moving new pixel data to the display in sync with the refresh time

it works super well initially but over the course of about a minute the sounds become noticeably out of sync as i ve read happens with setinterval i ve read that settimeout can be more consistently accurate

you made the right choice using setinterval instead of settimeout here as in this case settimeout would have been less efficient with memory resources

if you d like to see stack trace that spans over settimeout setinterval calls then more sophisticated would be the way to go

i recommend using settimeout over setinterval since if the browser takes a while to execute loses focus and stops executing js gets paged out etc. then you will still get the time spacing between events that you want

i prefer using settimeout than using setinterval

but settimeout would be better than setinterval because with setinterval if your previous ajax request is not complete and you start another request there will have multiple requests which would sooner be problematic

as a matter of personal feeling i tend to prefer settimeout over setinterval -- to the point i don t use setinterval at all

i would also recommend using settimeout within the callback of load as opposed to setinterval

setinterval or settimeout are the better way to do this but you can also use jquery delay

for simple effects like this i always prefer settimeout since it s easier to end the animation sequence compared to setinterval

as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array

what i observed on inactive tabs in chrome all your settimeout must be the same for setinterval waiting less than 1000ms are rounded to 1000ms

you may want to consider using jquery timers instead which abstracts away many of the ugly details of settimeout setinterval and makes them easier to use in your code for things like what you are describing

setinterval is more useful than settimeout here as it recurs automatically and you don t need to keep setting it

settimeout is better than setinterval here because setinterval will start at every 5 secs but settimeout will start once each time your job is done and wait for 5 seconds which will make your script adaptive to server response timings


connect	geddy	2
so what makes geddy significantly better than connect

geddy is not better than connect express the big thing that differs is the structure of it


h.264	h.265	3
h.265 and vp9 are both better codecs in terms of compression efficiency than h.264 but are far less widely supported and take more cpu time

edit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for now

4- for comparison purposes between h.265 hevc and h.264 avc intra-prediction the total sae of a reconstructed picture by hevc should be less than avc


multiplying	subtraction	3
i wanted to find out if a solution using multiplying and subtraction would be faster and it seems to be on my computer

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

grooveshark	soundcloud	1
i used soundcloud api and sdk and it is better than the grooveshark api which till now i don t know how to embed songs and use my own player anyways soundcloud is good just try it goodluck


scalacheck	quickcheck	2
my guess is that scalacheck being initially written as a 1-1 mapping of quickcheck makes it easier for haskellers to jump into scala

scalacheck s api is also a bit richer than quickcheck s api


scrypt	salt	3
then pick scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 determine the iteration count work factor that takes the amount of time you expect to have available during peak load use a cryptographically random salt of 8 to 16 bytes or so and store the salt plaintext the iteration count work factor plaintext so it can be increased trivially and the resulting hash in the database storage medium

the simplest form of this is to add a salt to the user s passphrase and then feed it into sha-2 to get a 256-bit hash but ideally you want to use something like scrypt to make it harder to brute-force the passphrase

as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people


groovy	gsp	1
if i had to recommend something that i would believe would fit you perfectly i d recommend gsp on top of spring mvc using plain java for backend stuff and such but this combination doesn t actually even exist since gsp is the view part of grails a groovy based web application framework


erlang	elixir	9
please note that you can use erlang or elixir which is much easier

this is an unfortunate flaw in the design of elixir and the sole reason i still prefer erlang

my question is if i choose elixir will i stumble on something that i cannot do in it but can do in erlang

i agree some mechanisms in elixir are slightly more verbose than erlang function definitions being my personal pet peeve and vice-versa

i mean i could just write microservices with elixir and use them as if they were written in any other language polyglotism is one of the benefits of microservices anyway but then i m not getting the full benefits of using the otp platform i guess that pure collaborative erlang applications are way more optimal that using intermediate queues to communicate between microservices written in different or not languages

for some reason registering names on global module makes me feel uncomfortable because global states are often considered evil especially in a highly concurrent environment which is why you choose erlang elixir

i m doing a comparison of erlang haskell elixir and es6 and i m less farmiliar with erlang and elixir but i want to represent all of these languages fairly so is this good erlang code

as well you can mix and match elixir and erlang packages in an elixir project

erlang has a steeper learning curve compared to elixir


mvvm	delegatecommand	1
for mvvm scenarios a relaycommand or delegatecommand is a better fit than the routedcommand which is provided with wpf

to not having too much trouble with the maven-release-plugin and the multi-module parent project be sure to put your parent pom.xml one directory upper all your child pom.xml it s the designed recommend by maven but unfortunately sometimes eclipse users don t follow it because eclipse don t like hierarchical projects


jasmine	qunit	5
i want to introduce js testing in a project and i want to choose between jasmine or qunit or something third

aviran made a great suggestion with qunit but i think jasmine is better suited for new developers because of its readability and bdd -ness

performing this asynchronous testing is actually possible in qunit but is handled better in another javascript testing framework jasmine js

i recommend jasmine because it fits the way i like to write tests but if you are looking for more of an xunit clone qunit is also very well made

jasmine is clearly more bdd focused than qunit although i could see doing bdd with qunit by describing the tests in a behavior-oriented way


dbi	log4perl	1
if you don t want to go with dbix log4perl and the dbi trace options don t suit your needs you can write callbacks for dbi s prepare select execute methods and gather whatever you like in them


nltk	lingpipe	2
lingpipe probably also has something built in but nltk is much easier to use

alternatively the stanford parser can do the same stuff and might be a bit quicker being java based or lingpipe but nltk is waaaaaay more user friendly


decltype	auto	7
whereas auto and decltype c++14 are more concerned with types that are unknown until run-time

decltype is significantly more versatile that auto and can always be used in place of it

i just guess decltype auto is designed for more complex situation when auto cannot work

in the cases where auto can be used it is more concise than decltype as you don t need to provide the expression from which the type will be inferred

with perfect forwarding and decltype auto overloading becomes alot easier but still will take time to implement and would have to be modified if ever another function was added

you could of course just wrap the function in a decltype to figure out the return but an auto is much cleaner to write

is there a situation when decltype auto would be a better choice than auto possibly with or cv qualifiers when using range-based for loops

vsto	netoffice	1
i recommend netoffice over vsto because the exception handling is far superior and you have access to the source code but it does have it s quirks


opencv	emgucv	5
the results end up very close but the emgucv image comes out a little bit blurrier than the opencv image

granted i am learning opencv emgucv and actually prefer emgucv as the wrapper is quite nice

i do not know any good signal processing libraries in .net but emgucv opencv is wrapper around opencv which can do advanced signal processing

unless you re doing very heavy processing working with a single frame is probably faster than transferring it to the server as far as i know emgucv in c# isn t considerably slower than opencv in c c++

since i don t know emgucv i would recommend opencv


flann	surf	4
its however best to used flann based matchers for sift or surf since they extract a higher number of keypoint as compared to orb and flann is suited to large sets of keypoint read more about it here

program firstly shall find key points and descriptors of the database of the images using surf and try to compare them with flann matcher

are there any other metrics than bruteforcematcher and flann that may be used to match surf and sift descriptors

i just want to match surf s from a query image to those with an image set by applying flann


snap.svg	fabricjs	2
my speed test claims that svg is significantly faster than canvas at least snap.svg seems to be significantly faster than fabricjs

i made a speedtest to compare snap.svg svg to fabricjs canvas


thin	unicorn	12
memory optimizations - phusion passenger uses less memory than thin and unicorn

i personally prefer passenger over thin unicorn having run nginx to thin backends for a long while just for the convenience but your proposed setup is fairly standard

but it seems like heroku choose thin web server instead of unicorn

in most cases though you will probably want to choose between thin and unicorn

my personal experience is that webrick is faster in my development environment than unicorn and thin os x in a pretty big rails app lots of gems routes etc

i m running unicorn which is about 40 faster than thin on celadon cedar

jruby support - unicorn s a better choice than thin but it doesn t support jruby

thin and unicorn are significantly faster at servicing requests

if you have a production linux server and want to use unicorn there but prefer using thin locally you can edit your gemfile as follows

i often use it in development to choose between unicorn and thin for my rails server

in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

it compares thin unicorn passenger torquebox glassfish and trinidad


profiler	btrace	1
in my experience btrace overhead is far less noticeable than any profiler depending on activity of course - if you want to trace execution of all methods this will be expensive no matter what


wxpython	qt-designer	1
as far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pyglade


processors	hyperthreading	11
you may find that hyperthreading helps more on code that is using large amounts of memory so that the processors is regularly blocked on fetching from memory

vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s

in computer 1 the eigen3 performance is worse because the number of total processors virtual + physical - â due to hyperthreading is greater than the number of physical processors

first step would be to investigate why a processors with hyperthreading simultaneous multithreading could lead to poorer performances than a processors without this technology

first amdahl s law is older than hyperthreading so the law itself assumes you have physical processors

the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

processors with hyperthreading can have more than one logical core per physical core

more modern processors handle hyperthreading better than older processors

it might be that latency of various instructions is much better covered by the processors thanks to hyperthreading or cache behavior as sizes differ

however often laptop processors will have more logical cores than physical cores due to hyperthreading or other technologies


accurev	cvs	2
we still use cvs for some projects and even it is so much better for normal operations and workflow that i d pick it over accurev

i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths


profiling	instrumentation	36
so my question is beyond instrumentation and the profiling using memory leaks which tells you the location of creation of the leaky object but not the root cause are there any other tools i could run that could give me any more info than instrumentation re tracking down the root cause point

you can launch instrumentation from xcode using the product menu and select profiling

in xcode rather than running the app select profiling with instrumentation open

1 start instrumentation from finder and choose profiling zombies

i would definitely recommend using instrumentation to profiling what message is taking the most time so you can really break it down

in general you don t or i won t recommend profiling that instrumentation your application

in terms of finding leaks in your app you can use the leaks tool in instrumentation when you profiling the app choose profiling on xcode s product menu

again though the time profiling instrumentation is far better suited to the job and it definitely works

you need to profiling your app in instrumentation to get more detail - there s a button right there in your screenshot

in my experience normal execution on iphone is much faster than profiling with instrumentation

select profiling from the product menu in xcode 6 to launch apple s instrumentation tool

i worked around this by going to product- scheme- edit scheme select profiling app name and select an instrumentation allocations under the instrumentation drop down instead of ask on launch

i recommend using instrumentation performance profiling tool that is bundled with xcode and the developer tools

if you are experiencing performance issues i would highly recommend profiling with the time profiling and core animation instrumentation

to launch instrumentation click and hold the play -button in xcode and choose profiling

in addition to instrumentation which i also use heavily to profiling my apps is the xamarin profiling to gain more insights of what is still alive and keeps some references

next choose profiling which will open instrumentation and allow you to choose what you would like to profiling -

personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time when it matters

i guess profiling might need more permissions so it can reflect instrumentation

just select profiling from the product menu instrumentation will start select the zombie instrumentation then run the test scenario which causes this problem and you should see a zombie pop up that shows how an object is still being used even though it s no longer valid

if you re writing a mac app the opengl profiling tool profiling opengl code better than instrumentation

tracing profiling are slower but more accurate they also require that the program be changed the instrumentation process which could potentially introduce bugs not that i have heard of it happening.

paulw11 s comment helped--the time profiling template is better suited for this task than the system trace instrumentation

if you just run your application in profiling mode click and hold the run button and select profiling or do command-i it will open instrumentation and you can choose to profiling memory allocations from there

if it were visual studio you would just select profiling method sampling instrumentation and vs would run application for you and collect data while program completes

the behaviour i saw was that xcode would say finished running - profiling app name before the instrumentation window was even shown the choose instrumentation window

this is due to the fact that profiling need to instrumentation the code to keep track of invocations - this can interfere with the jit s ability to inline those methods and the instrumentation overhead becomes significantly larger than the time spent actually executing the methods body

if i m opening xcode choose profiling and choose one instrumentation let s

you can run the zombies instrumentation on your app in the instrumentation tool select profiling from the project menu then in the resulting dialog select the memory group of instrumentation and look for a zombies instrumentation

select instrumentation as the profiling method as that will give you the function call counts sampling may miss method calls that didn t take much time

the time profiling instrumentation is more efficient at gathering data

to get elapsed time you can use performance wizard invoke debugging start diagnostic tools without debugging performance wizard start and choose instrumentation as a profiling method

the difference between the two approaches is when you choose profiling from xcode instrumentation records all the memory allocations from the start

use the core-data profiling instrumentation to get a better high-level overview of what s going on with core data

these options are available when you select instrumentation profiling

in xcode choose product and then select profiling after the compilationï¼œit will open instrumentation


adplus	procdump	1
if you have a customer who is willing to work with you a bit it might shed some light on the situation to get a crash dump with adplus or maybe simpler with sysinternals procdump when the error message is showing


lodash	underscore.js	44
if you have access to lodash or underscore.js it is even easier with pluck

or you can use library like underscore.js or lodash to make it more readable

i can help you with lodash which is a superset of underscore.js and much better than underscore.js when it comes to performance and consistency see lodash vs underscore.js

if you re open to using lodash which is a better version of underscore.js imo this can be expressed fairly simply using flattendeep on each element of your multi-dimensional array

my early impression seems to be that it is an attempt to extend and improve on libraries such as underscore.js and lodash while sticking more strictly to a purely functional style

based on why lodash is faster than native foreach post maybe it s justifiable to use lodash in favour of both underscore.js and native foreach to loop

lodash is more modular than underscore.js underscore.js around 5kb lodash around 17kb but is generally lighter because you only include the specific modules you need

i think a tool like lodash or underscore.js is more suited for something of this nature

then when you extract the keys of each object you can compare using _.isequal function by provided by lodash instead of underscore.js usually lodash has better performance

this is apparently no accident if these are left out of underscore.js lodash composability is better than features

i typically recommend lodash rather than underscore.js

in general and underscore.js are slower native bind is fast on some browsers slow on v8 and lodash can distinguish between the two

i have grown fond of the lodash underscore.js when writing larger projects

apparently almost completely compatible lodash runs quicker apparently but underscore.js has better doco imho

basically collections are things that implement some kind of iterable interface and they internally use the same iteration method though lodash source is a bit more convoluted than underscore.js

also if you re bound to using underscore.js - you can grab lodash s underscore.js build at

you can also use underscore.js but lodash is faster more complete and you can create custom build with only what you need

if you re not using ecmascript5 i d recommend using underscore.js s or lodash s bind function

keep in mind that i am using lodash by john-david dalton instead of underscore.js because lodash provides better performance and a custom build process

this is easier with lodash underscore.js or even with es5 array and object methods but since you asked about pure js

underscore.js or lodash may work better for you

the easiest solution is to just replace underscore.js with lodash which has even more features than the latest underscore.js

underscore.js is good but i prefer lodash

if you have a very very particular data set where your own library would have insider knowledge on how to manipulate it then sure maybe your library might trump lodash underscore.js

for working with arrays i recommend lodash or underscore.js

i would probably wimp out and grab underscore.js or lodash so that i could use _.isempty

the solution from charliefl is approximately 100x faster than underscore.js depending on browser in this case and lodash being up to 2x faster than underscore.js

i would prefer lodash and or underscore.js

because lodash is updated more frequently than underscore.js a lodash underscore.js build is provided to ensure compatibility with the latest stable version of underscore.js

ps i d suggest using lodash instead of underscore.js if possible as lodash development is more active but that s my opinion

given that this is 4 years old and lodash has more or less taken the place of underscore.js i thought i would share this solution using lodash

if i remember correctly lodash argued they were faster than underscore.js because the use non-native functions for key operations

note previously this answer recommended underscore.js but lodash has done a better job of getting bugs fixed and addressing issues with consistency

but really feel this can be done much cleaner with underscore.js or lodash functional programming

i highly recommend underscore.js or lodash libraries

i am stunned right now seeing a lodash performing 100-150 faster than underscore.js in even simple native functions such as array.every in chrome

but if you re going to all this work i would recommend using lodash or underscore.js instead and get all the benefits those libraries offer

i believe lodash is a better choice over underscore.js more details in this blog post

if you are interested in more verbose javascript utilities for arrays objects and more check out lodash or underscore.js

lodash is another faster implementation of underscore.js that will provide a lot of utility methods for working wit arrays objects functions etc

i prefer lodash or underscore.js

lodash is definitely not slower than underscore.js

edit as pointed out in the comment lodash is likely to be a better solution than underscore.js

i prefer using underscore.js lodash for data processing and reserving jquery for dom stuff


nunit	moq	1
in terms of tools i recommend nunit and moq


jax-ws	saaj	2
one could use saaj soap with attachments api for java which runs at a lower level than jax-ws

compared to jax-ws saaj is operating at lower level with all pros and cons that this approach brings


x509	openpgp	2
both x509 and openpgp are more than a file format for keys they add incompatible options for key management and certification metadata identifiers .

openpgp is simpler than x509 but more limited especially if you wish to have a strong legal meaning behind the certificates


woocommerce	buddypress	1
since you are after something that is more social portfolio management and selling i definitely recommend buddypress and woocommerce


awk	ksh	1
4.c i am working on aix so i only have sh and ksh no bash therefore i cannot use the array tools provided by the latter that s why i thought of awk that and the fact that i think awk is probably stronger though i might be probably


nullreferenceexception	objectdisposedexception	1
an objectdisposedexception will be more informative than a random nullreferenceexception but unless you re cleaning up unmanaged resources it s not usually necessary to set a bunch of fields to null


bash	subshell	3
running with debug option -x seems to imply that command substitution is similar to subshell since bash outputs a deeper nesting for it

moreover because read is built into bash and this usage requires no subshell it s significantly more efficient than approaches involving subprocesses such as head or awk

when working in bash it is generally more efficient and better suited to use the tools that bash provides rather than spawning subshell calling 3rd party tools like grep and cut


docx	.doc	1
i am using google drive api in my application i am able to pick .doc docx .pdf in my case file from google drive till now everything is fine


trie	dawg	10
however that space overhead can be reduced by compressing the trie using the patricia tree representation using a more efficient data structure to store child pointers or building a dawg from the trie

if you have a large number of items in your ignore list and need to lookup the list often it would make more sense to put your ignored items in a trie or a radix trie or a dawg these are more or less the same thing

i would suggest that given your desire to also search through the stored string values you should consider whether either a trie structure such as a patricia trie or for even better memory amortisation a directed acyclic word graph refered to affctionalty as a dawg would work better

it is a structure similar to but twice as space-efficient as the dawg that is more efficient than the trie which only compresses prefixes

use a dawg which is more efficient than a trie in terms of space waste

a dawg is ideal but a trie is simpler and a decent starting point

using a dawg could save you more space as compared to a trie

it combines efficiency of a trie trie can be seen as a special case of dawg but is much more space efficient

a dawg has better memory performance if the strings have many common suffixes but they are more expensive and difficult to build and update so start with a trie

if you re interested there is another data structure called a dawg directed acyclic word graph that is similar to the trie but uses substantially less memory


background-image	background-size	3
instead using css you have a lot more control with background-image background-size and background-position

however for some reason ulkit is making a background-size larger than my background-image

in chrome when you use background-size cover if the xpos of background-image is no less than 50 you will meet that problem


texreg	stargazer	1
yet from my point of view texreg is more efficient that stargazer and easier to customize than xtable


dplyr	broom	2
for that i recommend dplyr and tidyr though perhaps broom has utility here as well

i recommend dplyr and broom for this sort of task


openssl	libcrypto	2
since apparently all those packages mentioned require that specific versioning of libcrypto which again does not seem to be present inside the rpm you are trying to install this leaves only one solution you d have to upgrade all those packages to versioning accepting the newer openssl versioning themselves

i want to encrypt decrypt a long file with rsa i know aes is better but this is just for a comparison in openssl libcrypto


mapply	lapply	1
the map or mapply functions are more natural to use than lapply when you have multiple lists of corresponding objects


lift	wicket	4
even dave pollak once suggested this combination if you prefer wicket to lift or have an existing wicket application you want to retrofit scala with

however i strongly prefer wicket and or lift especially the latter

why did would you prefer wicket over lift

lift s ajax support is far less verbose than wicket s


webstorm	aptana	1
if you re focussing on pure client code then i find webstorm to be an excellent javascript html ide - even better than aptana


maven-shade-plugin	appassembler	1
for the uber-jar applications i use maven-shade-plugin for merging jars into one + proguard for shrinking but appassembler is much quicker and stable to use


profiler	yourkit	12
attach a profiler i recommend yourkit and watch what happens to the threads after each reload

for commercial profilers i will recommend yourkit profiler

i would recommend you to use memory profilers i highly recommend yourkit profiler to connect to running virtual machine and then analyze memory usage

now get some profiler with memory profiling capability i prefer yourkit

i can recommend yourkit java profiler however its not free

i personally would recommend yourkit java profiler i ve found it much more user-friendly than tptp and while i haven t tested it it should work on os x

one option is to use visualvm however a commercial profiler like yourkit may handle larger memory sizes better

which java profiler is better jprofiler or yourkit

hard to beat yourkit java profiler

you need to use a java profiler i generally prefer yourkit

i can recommend yourkit for .net profiler which has a 30-day free trial

you need to get one that suits you i prefer yourkit but it is commercial product with a trial period modify emulator s command line in order to allow the profiler to connect that should be covered by profiler s documentation it is basically about adding -agentlib or -xrun.


xfs	ntfs	3
extfs4 or xfs are between 25 and 40 faster than ntfs or refs depending on the optimization

actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job


nhibernate	queryover	2
right now queryover is much more robust in the nhibernate community mainly because it is based on criteria queries which have been around for quite some time

i have now to do the following select with nhibernate and queryover


dateadd	datepart	10
select dateadd d - datepart weekday getdate + 1 + datefirst

select dateadd m -5 getdate - datepart d getdate + 1

select dateadd m -5 convert date 2017-01-04 - datepart d getdate + 1

select datepart yyyy dateadd year 1 current_timestamp

select dateadd day 1 - datepart dw 3 24 2013 3 24 2013

case cast convert current_timestamp dateadd datediff datename datepart getdate isdate left len lower ltrim replace replicate reverse right rtrim space str substring substring expression start length sysdatetime upper

select dateadd d - datepart weekday 2014-02-13 + 1 +

select datepart dw dateadd m datediff m 0 getdate 0

select datepart dw dateadd ms datediff ms getutcdate getdate dateadd ss timeval 1000 1970-01-01 from student

you can check if the current day of week is friday or greater datepart dw getdate and then call select dateadd wk datediff wk 0 getdate 0 +4 or select dateadd wk datediff wk 0 getdate 0 -3


profiler	perf	2
a profiler gives you more detailed information which can help to diagnose and fix perf problems

i would recommend using profiler on your actual code the one with global write to see if there s anything like unaligned access or other perf problem


torque	slurm	1
i performed survey on torque slurm loadleveler slurm is better than torque in handling large nodes but in a single cluster


qt-creator	kdevelop	1
in addition you can use kdevelop but if you prefer qt-creator you can use it with a cmake project without problems


createelement	classname	1
on the other hand passing an element and its attributes like maps to a call to document.createdocumentfragment which is slower than createelement followed by a write to the classname property


arp	tcp	2
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time

if you are using linux check out netdiscover this uses arp i think arp is lower level than tcp udp and with java you can only create apps from tcp udp and above


gulp-sourcemaps	gulp-sass	1
if that doesn t work i ve had better luck with gulp-sass and gulp-sourcemaps


jsf	tapestry	4
and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt

in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s ioc container makes it more powerful than wicket

since tapestry is actually an alternative mvc framework to jsf you can choose jsf or tapestry but not both so the answer is no you either go with jsf as your mvc framework + primefaces as component suite or choose tapestry as your mvc framework

one framework that tries to do more in the template while remaining less bloated than jsf which isn t that hard anyway is apache tapestry


indexof	hasownproperty	1
however i ve seen that object s hasownproperty is much faster than indexof


interpolation	splines	12
if you are doing more than three points however i would strongly recommend using interpolation as using guassian elimination scales incredibly poorly o n 3 and splines or another interpolation technique are less likely to fail

the n-dimensional interpolation routines i have found are not quite good enough i would prefer splines over linearndinterpolator for smoothness and i have far too many data points often over one million for a radial basis function to work

whether splines or linear trapezodial interpolation is a better fit will depend heavily on your problem

of course you could do fancier interpolation with a splines being the next step

edit2 you can try to make a coarse sin grid and use gsl routine gsl_interp_cspline_periodic for splines with periodic conditions to splines that table the splines will reduce the errors in comparison to a linear interpolation you need less points on your table less cache miss

with a lower order splines that works better but then you lose the advantage of cubic interpolation

in comparison to a previous implementation that was purely in python evaluating the c-code is so much faster than the splines interpolation that the evaluation of splines is the bottleneck in the ode function

higher-end scaling algorithms like sps_spline for splines interpolation will be more computationally intensive and lower-end scaling algorithms like sws_point for nearest neighbour interpolation tend to look worse so the exact value you choose here depends on how much cpu you re willing to spend versus how much you care about visual quality of the end result

splines are used for smoother interpolation that ensures curvature continuity

splines interpolation is probably more useful for you than polynomial interpolation if you fit a polynomial it must inevitably head off to + - infinity outside your data range

but to use cubic splines interpolation you need more than two data points

let s choose splines interpolation to have some smoothing in between each keypoint that is produced in the final result


trigram	fuzzy	1
best and fastest way is to use n-gram approach for fuzzy matches trigram fuzzy match is common


qtableview	qtreeview	1
qtreeview is known for being slower than a qtableview and consume a lot of memory and you are using a plain table model anyways so try with a qtableview


notepad++	jedit	2
i have found that jedit has better plugins for providing some of the more ide-oriented capabilities but like boltclock said notepad++ is really just a powerful text editor and does not try to be a one-stop-shop ide

i think jedit is equal to or better than notepad++


put	get	154
from the count you will get the number of sequence and those which have more than 2 put those in a different series and then add that series in the dataframe

i resorted to split the two in swagger list-without-search as get and list+search as post just to put the page in the swagger documentation also if the latter actually works also as get

hash table if get put are much more frequent than getrandom

use ef to create json object and use web api controller to get select put update post insert delete delete data

bowler is pretty much scalatra + scalate with some enforcing nudging of the developer towards good restful practices such as proper use of content-type and accept http headers for responding and emitting html and json and dealing with get post delete and put in appropriate ways and making bad uses of get and delete harder

to get your code to run more than once put it in a while loop

the closest you can do would probably to get the list in your application to make it smaller if you prefer put the last n items in an array and do a

also i can do a single ingredient but how would i put together a query to get recipes given more than one ingredient

and then i saw that they put functions under transform that did much more than just get data

so select post instead of get in postman and put your body to the post body instead of address line

2 in my office there s a lot of lack of line spacing because you get to see more of the code on one page that way. they also put multiple statements on one line and over imho use

that it would perform quicker with get put calls

the idea is that the server generally has more information about the resource than the user and so get might return more information than is required for put

i m trying to unit-test my controllers every test that uses the get request works fine but the tests where i use other calls delete in destroy post in create and put in update fail with a

if you need to do anything more complex than put file or get file take a look at edtftpj free

if you want to get more out of infowindow and put html content in them i would recommend trying infobox

for example if i put 40 as value there will i get charged more

if you want to do more than just get the uniq output you could put your own java class or command line program rather than use usr bin uniq

rest is a way to model an interface to an application as a collection of typically http resources on the web that respond to standard web verbs in expected fashions get to read delete to destroy put to update

and i m just having trouble saying if the image original file s width is greater than the height then we need the height to expand to the height of the surrounding element and put the width at auto so it doesn t get squished but keeping in mind that the client can upload any image size they want with no restrictions of must be 350x350

the refresh token lasts 14 days when you pick put the request from the queue the refresh token will allow you to get new access token

at times the get rate is slower than the put rate and we see messages backing up

where 404 may be suitable for get and put update but less suitable for post inserts

get and post are relatively common put is less common so may not be covered in your server implementation

but the slider won t work well it doesn t get activated is a better way to put it if i insert the code from slider.js into the chrome console hit enter - booom works perfectly i ve been looking for what the problem might be tried adding the type text javascript in the script tags added the document .ready in my jquery still nothing.

the problem is that when i try to publish the articles i get the no route matches put articles error regardless i ve added resources articles in routes.rb

you need to put all of your code in your get do block or better in a helper file module

are you expecting some devilishly complex scheme that hold locks for smaller granularity than put or get

to put this in perspective the current project i am working on involves comparing the width and height of an image to get a number to determine if the width is longer than the height or the same

allowed http methods ensure that you select get head options put post patch delete

i get black image and if i put start more then 0 i got white gradient but no image

i need to form a layout in which i want to put an image in the upper 50 of the screen two edittext two button in the lower 50 of the screen and also it should be device independent so that the view doesn t get disturbed on smaller or bigger screens it works fine on minimum 3.2 hvga device but everything goes overlapped if run on a even smaller device

i believe what s happening is that odata uses merge verb that is more efficient than put put requires sending all fields while merge sends only changed data but in your model field b is marked as required so you get a validation exception on the client side

i found sikhttprequest but i cannot find inside demo to choose between get post and put

i basically know zilch of java but i m hoping someone can help me put something into that .parse function that would get me post that have dateupdated newer than 5 days

in our case this one matches get word - this header could use get post put or delete words

if generated by the matches for this regex was not the whole capture - then a single-call replace would not be possible - and your question would probably be asking why doesn t the whole match get put into instead of the other way round

if it matches get the corresponding column c value and put it in column d like this

using perl s dancer module if you have an any method which will match get post put delete how can you determine which actual method the browser used

you can change the http verb near the url parameter to get post put delete or more

i m currently in school and usually spend my time here on stackoverflow looking for answers to homework this time i d thought that perhaps i ll put my code here and maybe i ll get help more precis and quicker

with get and put it is more likely that the media-types are symmetric however that is not a hard rule

if you will only use put remove get it s better to choose map

here i just put the code within each case and the code doesnt get called more then once

as long as the dataframe is small your assumption that the put process is faster than the get seems true we can fetch all 5 items within one loop of while not q.empty

i m concerned this is going to get worse as we put more tests into the specflow project

what is the proper best way to get the value of all these selects put together

the elements that the user selects get put into a vector

i think put and get on ignite cache would likely to be slower than native put and get on my inbuilt key value store

however if i attempt to put or paste with more links than currently exist i get the following error

what implementations allow me to put a limit on the throughput that is guarantee that a certain actor does not get executed more than n times per minute

if i used put admin update in my routes i would get no route matches get admin update.2 error but when i used get admin update i didn t get any error but my reputation wouldn t update

there are a lots of reasons to choose between post get put and delete methods or http verbs

please edit your distribution and under the behaviors tab please select get head options put post patch delete for allowed http methods

but i get compiler warning c4309 truncation of constant value in vc++ 2010 whenever the argument to put is greater than 0x7f

i am trying to submit a form but if i just put form_for classroom i get a no route matches post error

at very high speeds amazon s3 does have some recommended request rate and performance considerations but this is only when making more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second for a particular bucket

to get 1 or more matches put a + after the closing bracket

we even setup replicas outside aws using stunnel and put ssd drives as the primary block device and we get ridiculous read speeds for our reporting systems - literally 100 times faster than we get from rds

from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

if it is something that is used in more than one place or even something that might get used more than once then put it in app.xaml

the main method does little more than to get the program running here to create a jframe to put the main gui code s jpanel in and then display that jframe

pre-aggregation with counters requires 1 get + 1 put which is more expensive than just puts

i m not sure if this is the answer but states that if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

is there any easier way than put all in set and get set size

this could mean that put is now slower than get and we have to wait

i always get errors such as no route matches put galleries 1 photos

if you put donald trump on it as sender you might get sued for more money than you can imagine

i have been thinking about something after the master makes de inquiry and paging process when up to 7 devices are set as active members active member address and the rest up to 256 are put on parked more 8 bit parked member address or hold or sniff this two last ones doesnt get a mac

the go language datastore reference states that the actual types passed do not have to match between get and put calls or even across different app engine requests since entities are actually just a series of properties and can therefore be stored in an appropriate container type that can support them

sorted vector resizable array if getrandom is much more frequent than get put

you ll get it done much faster by just looking at the sample project i put together

i m try to host videos on s3 and to put data transfer limits so i don t get charged for more than say 20gb any way to do that

it s no matter what limit i put it create more less pages i can navigate between them with next and prev links but all this stop working when i trying to get 31+ item

if you put -c lower than 80 itâ s going to make it less likely that you get

given the explain plan you posted i suspect you ll probably struggle to get it to run any faster unless you put run on better hardware with faster cpu

so since it is only semantic you can do whatever you want in the controller once you get the request and i suppose your rest-api does not include complex updates of say a part of a list or specific fields in nested objects - i believe put would be the better choice

need to issue more than just get and put commands

you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever

if you can still get the object after i don t think i would use delete but put may be more appropriate

when i put my loop counter variable pagessent in the watch window it gets optmized when i declare as volatile it still gets optimized but when the max value is set to 4 the loop exits properly but if max value is higher than 4 get stuck..

if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

i m struggling to know how to put it back together with the multi-index and then how to get the 2016 values that were either higher or lower than the min max already recorded

to count the occurrence of a string you can search for a match put the matches in list context and then assign them to a string to get counts

removing this from the url get list post create delete destroy put update i get this error

put and delete are often not used leaving get and post to map to select get and create update and delete post

restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit

now when i convert this code into keras i get confused as to what parameters do i put in for num_filter and kernel_1 kernel_2 to match with tensorflow

if you want to get a reference to a text view in your layout i m assuming so that you can set a string resource based on the selected spinner item the user selects put this code in your oncreate method that has the spinner

q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t

you can also do it manually with put and get which is more c-ish

first get request shouldn t be used to alter states on the server so for your vote service i would recommend post put

put the string in strings.xml set it to a text view inside a scroll view so that it doesn t get hidden on smaller screens set autolink to make the links clickable

first thing that came to mind was that it was caused of too many entries in the hashmap which caused every put and every get to be slower every time

you should also put the more detailed route first so it will not get swallowed by more generic one

addendum i didn t get to add earlier this little bit is what i would have put before seeing barry houdini s answer

you could manage more than get or post like put delete...

but its a good practice to always put the brackets to help making your code easier to read so you wouldn t get confused in more complex algorithms

so it s really odd because google penalizes the apps that do put all their code files in and update frequently because these get checked more often

the app.all means that the route will match get put and post request

as i understand hazelcast put and get may work much faster if it was not inside actor

one way is to just output the content of the article and put a read more tag in the text and you ll get the text outputted with the read more button after it

when i put in select get an error ora-00911 invalid character but if i change page 2 from modal to normal everything is fine

when i click on the submit button i get an error that says no route matches put and i feel a bit as though i may have missed a step somewhere

buggy plugins -- even if the plugin exists across all operating systems like flash generally they work best on windows and then linux and mac fight it out for second place usually more effort put into the mac port but on linux there may be wiki guides to get it working better and the distro packagers may use these tricks when auto-installing the plugin for you

however a linkedhashmap is faster as seen here treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each.

i recommend put session monitor to execute 5 seconds before finish the session to prevent run dologout after session end and get the viewexpiredexception

you have mentioned that we can t use actions more than get post put delete which is not true

this should be producing a topological sort but so far i consistently get one value less than i put in as far as number of vertices and none of the number match those i ve inputted

anything you put in a header is likely to appear twice when compiling a single file because headers often get included by other headers so they get included more than once

on the one hand we can say let s put 20 threads and get it done faster

for some years now i ve just stuck to the thought that since directbytebuffer s are a direct memory mapping at os level that it would perform quicker with get put calls than heapbytebuffer s

clearly the first option is very inefficient get put operations are much more frequent than activity fragment life cycle changes

as select has it parameters passed as pointer and those data structures get altered by select put

i put dummy joptionpane pop-ups in various areas to confirm my code was getting there and it appears it is all executing but no balls ever get drawn much less drawn over and over to make them move and bounce around the screen

other point is the select outside form in that way it will never get the value of the select put inside the form like addie said

will create standard default restful routes for post and pages get post post get put destroy post 1 get pages 1 edit and etc

apart from this you should also make sure to implement the four verbs correctly so that they match the sql commands get select post insert put update delete delete handle encoding negotiation correctly return proper http response codes and all the other things that are expected of a restful api

the client post scores and fetches highscore lists from the server and everything seemed to be working perfectly we had been testing it for a month with no problems and the code is really simple with not much more than a put get

i looked at the angular-django-rest library highly unsupported and couldn t get puts to work for the life of me b c there s only a save method which somehow automagically selects post put

however i m not sure how to get these working or more importantly where to put them

the issue i.m having is that when i try to submit this form as it is i get a routing error which says no route matches put

you mustn t change the relevant values within a key after adding it to a map - it will potentially cause false positives and even false negatives you could use the same key reference you used in put and not find a match with get if you ve made a change which affects the hash code for example

i am trying to compare put request xml and get response xml

given http supports various methods like get put post delete and more like patch head options etc

type book why do we need anything more than http get put post

from the results get all the user_id s that match put them in an array

from this point of view if a class has members which don t need to be protected for example a boolean which its corresponding get set functions can be freely changed by the user is better to put that attributes as public and remove the get set functions more or less these are the bjarne stroustrup words

i ve tried to put a documentpicker to get a file from icloud but actually my app opens the documentmenu to import a file icloud dropbox and when i choose icloud i present the document picker with my files

as some of these messages get processed more messages presumably get put on the queue instead of being dropped

while this isn t recommended as it means get requests don t match put requests it is possible to do this in a way to makes everyone happy

i have put a button for each row which i want to create on click event for it to get the id of that row and be able to send user to second page to edit that row info but i have problem with checking this multiple button if it were checkbox it was easier

data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post

network latency is ruled out because get requests take more or less same time as local machine whereas time taken to first byte is more for post and put requests

both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url

right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work

when i submit the form i get this routing error no route matches put update_profile 1

what i would like it to do is when a user selects the services all the services that user selects get s put into the services column to look like

since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage

if you are uncertain you can always put an if statement and check if the number you get back is highter then int.maxvalue

just to get closer to the solution write a javahelp.bat or .cmd if you prefer put it on the path and call that from ruby

how can i get rid of the post put data getting exponentially bigger

the reason why you get the exception mentioned is because when you call byte.parse but the string that you put in is greater than 255

i was digging through the flask pluggable views documentation and while i find the methodview to be very helpful for making restful crud endpoints usually i end up wanting more than just get post put delete methods under a base route with common decorators and so forth

if i put the order outside of the selects i get table from one of the selects cannot be used in global order clause

now don t get me wrong regenerating the session id on login or more accurately as oswap put it on privilege level change is indeed a very good defense against session fixation

the data collection and storage parts of that stack are already done and i just need to get querying done made more difficult by the fact that the new system queries can take 10+ seconds to complete but can be queried on any dimension and a tool to process the historical data and put it into the new storage engine

is that better than just get the .js already compiled and put it on vendor folder

any information i can get would be better than nothing so please feel free to put in partial answers

if you get a #n a error value then you did not find a match put 0

get select put update post create and delete delete

any rules that do match get put into an agenda and then fired

as i am benchmarking my cluster i discover that for large file my get command is actually slower than put command

the other obvious problem is that there s a data race between get and put


arp	udp	1
if you are using linux check out netdiscover this uses arp i think arp is lower level than tcp udp and with java you can only create apps from tcp udp and above


strncmp	strcmp	14
the only case where strncmp would be safer than strcmp is when you re comparing two character arrays as strings you re certain that both arrays are at least n bytes long the 3rd argument passed to strncmp and you re not certain that both arrays contain strings contain a 0 null character terminator

i could see only one advantage that strncmp will take slightly less time to execute than strcmp as we will always compare prefix of string to comapre rather than entire string

after looking at the parts of configure script checking the library versions it seems that it compares versions with strcmp or strncmp

you should use strncmp to compare your strings it s safer than strcmp

in few words strncmp is safer then strcmp but it is slower too

also have a look at strncmp which is safer version of strcmp

is strcmp slower than strncmp as one can give pre-calculated string length to it but strcmp does not receive such information

what is the reason people discourage the use of strcmp and recommend strncmp instead

then you can not compare char arrays with string literals like this you have to use string compare strcmp or strncmp

note also the functions strncmp and memcmp which are similar to strcmp but are safer

strncmp is a little bit safer than strcmp because you specify how many comparisons will be made at most

but even in that approach i always prefer to use the safer strncmp than strcmp

note strncmp is safer than strcmp

strncmp is more secure than strcmp


wildfly	undertow	2
from the wildfly console i understand that the undertow subsystem is receiving more or less 20 requests per second and using the application in chrome i see the requests pending for more than 30 seconds

i m working on a wildfly swarm project using wildfly swarm version 2017.8.1 maven 3.5.0 openjdk 1.8.0_141 where users will often upload files way bigger than undertow s default 10485760 bytes 10mb max-post-size setting


jcl	rexx	1
3 if you don t want to prefer rexx here s a little brief into how you could create the jcl dynamically using cobol


nsoperation	nsprogress	1
but i ve had difficulty implementing this it seems as though nsprogress is meant more for long operations that execute all their code on one background thread but have separate sections that make it easy to determine when progress has been made if this is the case then the use of the term suboperation is a bit misleading as it brings to mind the use of nested nsoperation


illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	1
one more note consider extending classes that are more specific than runtimeexception illegalargumentexception illegalstateexecption etc


arcgis	proj	3
different solution that worked for me right click on the proj and select arcgis tools - conver to arcgis for android proj

assuming you re in eclipse right-click the proj and choose arcgis tools fix proj properties

then right click again and this time select arcgis tools - fix proj properties


uptime	reboot	1
yesterday i needed to reboot production server on debian 6 with more than 3-y uptime and 3rd party configured billing system on it


snappy	lz4	1
lz4 is probably better though snappy was developed by google with protobufs in mind so you might want to test both on your data set.


equals	compareto	59
compareto method returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

note that equals takes into account decimal positions so compareto is safer

and my guess as to why an element is being dropped is your compareto method never returns a 1 in any case so elements are always considered to be less than or equals to other elements which is probably screwing with the treeset

if this works it seems that u are still comparing the strings in your ordered list and u should now check if the return value of compareto is less grater equals to 0

compare compareto and equals will not take a tolerance for the comparison so cannot used this way

looking at the implementation of equals and compareto in java.lang.string on grepcode we can easily see that equals is better if we are just concerned with the equality of two strings

compareto defines whether your base student is greater than less than or equals to your studenttocompare and you can define these with any criteria you please

put your greater than equals to and less than logic in compareto

date object extensions - datejs.js today compare between compareto equals isafter isbefore isleapyear parse parseexact validateday validatehour validatemonth validateminute validatesecond validateyear add addseconds addminutes addhours adddays addyears addweeks addmonths clone getweek getisoweek setweek toisostring

java equals compare compareto

the interface defines one method compareto that must return a negative integer zero or a positive integer if this object is less than equals to or greater than the other object respectively

in the compareto method you can decide which fields are used for the comparison greater less than or equals

we can call its compareto method to decide whether it is bigger than equals to or less than any int

most likely hashcode will be faster unless for whatever reason calling hashcode + equals once is much slower than calling compareto log n times

note that in both cases you can take advantage of the fact that int also implements so you can use its compareto method to determine whether corresponding values in each instance of your class are less than equals to or greater than each other

i wonder how to compare two datetime objects in .net using datetime methods compare compareto or equals without comparing ticks

compareto returns a number that is less than equals to or greater than zero corresponding to the first string being before the same as or after the second string respectively

if you are using a collection class that uses compareto or compare rather than equals then you clearly don t have to override equals

i am using the min value because i read that the compareto method returns negative 0 or positive whether the first string is less than equals to or greater than the second

the reason why the java specification claims that the compare compareto method being used must be in line with equals is because the set specification makes use of equals even though this specific type of set the treeset uses comparisons instead

compare using compareto equals isbefore and isafter methods

if compareto returns a negative int it means less than 0 means equals 1 means greater than

or is it compareto returns negative numbers 0 and positive numbers respectively indicating whether the calling object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

if you want them to compare equals use compareto

the short answer is that by definition -0.0 is less than 0.0 in all the methods provided by the double class that is equals compare compareto etc

with this rather than needing to implement a comparator all you need to implement is the int compareto class o method in the class which returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

in the compareto method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the compareto method

is a generic type at compile time java will require that an instance provide an implementation of int compareto t o which from the javadoc returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

implement compareto in temporary temporary.compareto left such that it returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as temporary is less than equals to or greater than the left

compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than

according to javadoc compareto needs to return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object

i am trying to compare two strings in vb but compareto compare equals etc all give compile errors

the compareto method returns one of -1 0 1 depending on whether or not the argument is less than equals to or greater than respectively

you shouldnt be using for string comparison if i remember correctly use compare compareto or equals

per the page i linked to compareto returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object.

so in your compareto add an if to check when wins are equals and then inside that if do the check on losses

i m using the random class in my struct s compareto to pick with equals probability one of the structs when both have the same field values

implementing icomparable is a more fine-grain way of comparison as it provides the compareto method which is a greater-than less-than comparison as opposed to equals which is simply a is-equal-or-not comparison

this interface defines the method compareto t which will return a negative number zero or a positive number if the first object is less than equals to or greater than the other one respectively

you need to call the compareto method which will indicate the result of the comparison by returning an integer less than greater than or equals to 0

all i changed was the first compareto comparison to be less than instead of less than or equals to

the compareto method returns 1 0 or -1 depending on whether value a is respectively greater than equals to or lesser than value b

in your overridden compareto method you would simply need to catch when the wins are equals and then assign it a preference based on losses so

implementing the equals and the compareto methods sounds easier than it sometimes really is

it s not clear to me what you want but i ll mention that the date class also has a compareto method which can be used to determine with one call if two date objects are equals or if they aren t equals which occurs sooner

the only significance of a compareto return value is if it is greater less than or equals to zero

i know that in java there is a compareto method that you can write in a class that will compare two variables and return a value -1 1 or 0 signifing greater than less than and equals to operations

you should be using compareto method for less than or equals or greater than

generally compare compareto and equals methods shouldn t use tolerances because tolerances are inherently intransitive

equals can be more efficient then compareto

the following snippet illustrates the difference in behaviors between collections that use equals such as an arraylist and collections that use compare compareto such as a treeset

for example if you create a hashset and add new bigdecimal 1.0 and new bigdecimal 1.00 to it the set will contain two elements because the values have different scales so are non-equal according to equals and hashcode but if you do the same thing with a treeset the set will contain only one element because the values compare as equals when you use compareto

icomparable declares the compareto method which returns an integer that specifies a less than equals to or greater than relationship between two objects of the same type

when one of the strings is a prefix of another the performance of compareto is worse as it still needs to determine the lexicographical ordering while equals won t worry any more and return false immediately

i am using the compareto method in java to try and check if a certain date is greater than or equals than 24 hours after another date

however your compareto method is always returning 0 so all your circle objects will compare equals to each other and only one will make it in to your treeset

you should compare bigdecimal with compareto instead of equals as advised by the other answers

compareto return a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object


kohana	yii	1
depends i came from php4 and didn t really touch the level of oop needed for the php5 kohana framework i ve used classes and functions but the hmvc is a process on it s own to learn when it comes to kohana vs yii i d have to say kohana is easier to pickup


qtkit	quicktime	1
you can do it with qtkit but works better in 32bit quicktime framework


ccmenuitem	cclabelttf	1
if i create the same cclabelttf once then i can t add it to more than one ccmenuitem because it will give runtime error about label already added


freebsd	netbsd	4
but freebsd dragonfly bsd and netbsd define issetugid more strictly

tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally

iirc freebsd s benchmarks returned consistent results under any load whereas netbsd started off quicker and gradually got slower

with low load as you mentioned in the comment netbsd will probably outperform freebsd


xslt	xquery	31
xquery is more amenable to static analysis than xslt because it lacks the very dynamic template despatch mechanism

unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt

what you try to achieve is certainly possible with xquery or with xslt which is more convenient for transforming xml trees especially for multiple transform passes

xslt has proven itself to be both a powerful and adaptable language but now we can also choose xquery

setting the xhtml namespace as the default namespace might be useful though sadly in xquery this also makes it the default namespace for the output - xslt does this better

if your output is going to be similar to your input with small changes then the xslt solution is often a lot simpler than the xquery solution

my usual rule-of-thumb is that xquery is better than xslt for simple tasks whereas xslt is better for complex tasks

i think xquery would be more convenient if you had all of your xml in a database but on the filesystem xslt may be simpler

as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries

once your xml source becomes more complicated if your task is to make small changes to a large xml document then i would strongly recommend using xslt rather than xquery

probably more popular than xquery is xpath which is the basis of xslt transform

using xslt or xquery would be much better

a solution in xslt would work too but if you are not already using xslt then using xquery makes more sense here i guess

xslt is significantly more appropriate to use than xquery for such kind of tasks

xquery works better than xslt for this because it s more amenable to static analysis as it lacks the polymorphism of xslt s template rules

generally i know it sounds banal xslt is better at transformation generating a new document from each source document while xquery is better at query extracting a small amount of information from each source document

as dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquery

xslt or xquery would be more appropriate tools fix errors found in the xml

to make small changes to an existing document leaving the rest unchanged i would normally recommend xslt over xquery

the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml

nowadays with xquery there is no reason to use xslt anymore xquery is much nicer

xquery or xslt are much more suited to this kind of thing

the xdm model used by xslt xpath xquery is much stricter it allows a free-standing zero-length text node but as soon as you try and add such a node to a tree it disappears

saxon-ee supports streaming of large xml documents using xslt or xquery streaming is better supported in xslt than in xquery

also with xquery you can re-use your existing skills with xslt + xpath as the languages have a lot in common but xquery is more geared towards database access

many serious users of xml would i suspect generalize your list of xslt s strengths in that spirit and prefer xslt or xquery whenever the input data are in xml

if structural change is part of your agenda i think you should seriously consider not using jaxb technologies like xquery and xslt are much better suited to this scenario

i hate to answer a request for a solution in language a by suggesting a solution in language b but what you are doing here falls into the class of problems which xslt handles much better than xquery

generally working at the c# level is appropriate if your application is 10 xml processing and 90 other things while xslt xquery are more appropriate if it s 90 xml manipulation and 10 other things

i use and recommend xquery over xslt

this kind of processing is most easily done with xslt which is more expressive than xquery


jar	.war	1
if you put the jar to lib folder write the ant code to exclude the jar for the .war file


phpdocx	phpword	1
i choose phpword because the free version of phpdocx has very limited functionality plus it has a footer that it is only a free version


width	margin	127
so when your window width is less than 959px your image will have width 100 but also the padding and margin pushing it to the right

if you specify a width to the table centering with margin 0 auto will also work as long as the specified width is less than that of the containing block

#content has a left margin of -500px so when the width is less than 1000px it get moved off to the left

when i add a margin to the divs the width becomes smaller and the height stays the same so the aspect ratio changes

but i don t want to put a margin on every 2nd item because when the browser width becomes smaller there will be 2 or even 1 items in a row

aside of the left floated div i have another div article with a margin a little bigger than the width of the floating div just usual for a two column layout

so that on ipad the view is not stretched but on smaller devices the view can be less than 320 width and have 20 pts of margin

setting the datatemplate s grid s width and height to be larger than the cell with a negative margin can produce a close result but if you resize the column the problem shows itself again

on release the drawer should slide open if its margin is greater than half its width and should close if its less

adding margin adds more width making the total width of the two elements and their margin greater than 100 pushing the elements onto separate lines

give the sample text div a right margin greater than the width of the right-floated element

when i launch it with firefox or internet explorer the box gets immediately to a huge distance from the margin much bigger than the width of the screen and now i noticed that if i run it with stackoverflow s snippet function the box does not move

a common solution is to float your fixed-width column left or right and give the other column a margin equal or greater than the width of the fixed-width column

essentially my logic is when the window is re-sized and the width is less than 810px then remove all css styling and add margin top items 2 through infinity

i just made the left margin of div2 greater than the width of div1 and it worked for me

the .content class has a white background adds padding and a margin all around the span10 offset1 div to make the width appear smaller

margin auto when used in conjunction with a width that is less than 100 of the screen will center an element

the div s width is smaller than the images width so i have used overflow hidden and by the images margin 0 -100 but this way only the first image is set middle the second

50 width is more than enough for the images to fit even with the image margin

for example let s say width of one image you want is 200px then also you d like to have some space as margin between images too so let s say if browser width is more than 700px then we ll have images on the same row else we ll have them one below the other

if browser width is more than 768px then set a 110px margin

you will have to set the width of #divmain to be smaller than 720px 500px - the only way for a child to be centered horizontally within its parent using margin 0 auto is for the parent s width to be larger

the divsquare width is define 48 less than 50 because the 4px margin and 1px x2 border occupy space too

gives a way to make the margin transparent but they are still there and the plot is smaller than height and width i set in the saved file

the padding and margin are added to that width which makes everything wider than you would think

i would recommend adding width height and margin to your code

the problem is when i use margin it will affect them both since they have same class so the second div will go below the other because the total width will become bigger than the container width

at the beggining i d like to explain my problem well i ve got main container body where width is auto and min-width is 960px width of screen can be bigger than children width there s child container where margin is auto and width 960px

this will take the margin away and your total width will be less than or equal to 1000

the width and height are little less because my printer doesn t support zero margin

anyway i just set the margin to a value a little bigger than the width of the image and overlap is eliminated only in the very specific case we want

i m using the function window .resize to detect if the total width of all open windows plus some margin is greater than the window s width then hide the first chat window or show the last one if there s space for more windows

in that case the uilabel s width must be smaller so the left right margin will always be 30

the body width is smaller than page width left margin right margin which according to this link can be an issue how to get rid of blank pages in pdf exported from ssrs

the box is never too small infact the margin of the adjacent div is bigger than the width of ul div

but the third button doesn t seem to add the margin on the right and so loses width

use min-width and or max-width to give the element a defined width which is more flexible than a single width value and then give the element a margin 1em auto style to centre it horizontally within the unused width available in its parent element

i tried debugging firefox debugger and explored all the attributes to see if i mix match margin padding width etc to get the width displayed by the firefox s layout width

you can try giving an id to each one of the divs or style them for margin that is greater than or equal to the image width.assuming you image width is 50px this code shall work

.slide-container-content has a width that is greater than its containing element - set it to 100 or whatever width you want the text to be and then set your margin autos

i expect the section can always keep in the middle and leave the margin until the width is reduced to less than 480px

your report s body s width plus the report s left margin plus the report s right margin must be smaller than or equal to the report s pagesize s width

however the margin issue isn t specific to the example when width is less than 340px it s the same on any width

then give it a width that s less than the width of your li and add margin auto to center it

it looks like i can t set left margin to be less then 42pt width

once the negative margin is equal or greater than the width of that element further negative margin has no effect

i want the uilabel to have a width of 300 unless the left right margin becomes less then 30

for width i can use margin 0 auto but height is trickier because it would need to make a div absolute

so it would also be possible to have all three textblock columns starsized but that means width clipping does occur earlier and there is more margin

there s no margin in fact table cells share the entire space of the table which has a width of 100 so that the computed width would be greater than 250px in large screens wide

the div width of 50 plus the margin made it larger than 50 so they just stacked

where each image will be right-centered and displayed in margin area on the right which height will match height of the font width should be scaled to height

edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

just so you know you want the total width object width + padding + margin + border of both columns to be less than the width of the container

you need to center position of .panel_big by using margin auto and better use width 100 with max-width of 670px when browser width will be smaller than 670px .panel_big will start to fit its width to browser width

what i want it to do is to center a given image from a database into a div for example if the given images width is bigger than height it echos it with a left margin

since you float the content to the left and the sidebar to the right changing the margin won t have an effect unless maybe it gets bigger than the available width of the gap but certainly not while the margin is smaller than the gap that is already there

the browser automatically sets a start-margin and end-margin etc to like 40px that s why when you scale down 45 width 2 90 and the browser margin would be much more than 10 that s why it didn t work

what i do not understand is why the size of the point and the text is not the same and why the margin can be bigger than the width of the figure

my guess is that they are technically happening simultaneously but that the margin animation takes longer to complete than the width animation

play around with it and see what happens if you change the children class width or put more less text in it careful with margin margin is bit odd with flexbox this is beyond the scope here though

provided that the #topnav s width is greater than the width of the or else you can t center it you need to set a width to the in order for an auto margin to work

the width of the span content plus the left margin is greater than 1000px and so it wraps spans to the next line

this might be made smoother by setting margin 0 mpx where m is a magical number of pixels that might be close to 1707px - page layout width in px 2 but you would have to try it to see

how to place 2 div side by side one div is of 75 width and the other is 25 width.one more div with margin 0 auto

therefore assuming the container s width is greater than the image s height margin -50 0 should be enough

i have this code for when an image loads in our app and then when the height is greater than the width add a class to bump up the margin

the star printer s margin got even bigger when i decreased the page width to what it should be

by giving the middle indicators div a left and right margin slightly larger than the width of the left and right button divs you allow it to float up between the two and take up as much space as possible

set its imageview right margin to negative value so the width of the image is greater than width of the screen

the first-child column has 10 pixels or whatever the margin size is greater content area width than it s siblings

in order for a block level element to be centered on a page you need to provide a width that is smaller than the width of the parent element it is nested in and then set the margin to be auto for the left and right sides

when i check the following code in the chrome devtools device toolbar responsive and the window gets smaller than 1040px width the .wrapper suddenly get s an increasing right margin until 60px

instead of the reaching 100 width the margin is causing less width for them due to the 20px x 12

but the margin is more difficult to include in the width because it is on the outside of the box

how to calculate element s width and height with their padding margin values using less code

the width padding and margin together make it so that the total width of the element is larger than the width of the screen

one way of doing this is checking if left margin of the inner div is lesser than the width of sidebar and then only add class adjust

they appear to scale on the width ok but grow in height leaving more margin between the text and the border

if report width is 8 inches and 0.5 inches margin on both sides body width should be slightly less than 7 inches 6.95 inches

i want these items widths to match width of parent th minus some margin

now if the div with has margin 660px from the left it should be hidden because it s margin is higher than the maximum width of the main container

however instead of doing that why not use the dynamic layout and just define your child container with a margin - in your example 50px - so that its width would be 100px less than the parent container

when the screen width becomes larger than 500px the contents of the media query are ignored and the margin becomes 20

your mobile screen is less than 1000px so your margin set in percentage is relative to the screen width which is less than 1000px in this case

it happens because you are using layout_width 100dp for every image view and 20dp of margin so the final width of your layout bigger than screen width of device

span is an inline element and the margin 0 auto for centering only works on non-inline elements that have a width that is less than 100

and if they aren t next to eachother that means your padding and margin is more than the 5 width of total width so reduce them

you have given width of 50 with additional margin of 5 to each of the element which is greater than 100 width

i added a margin so that the iframe will stay centered in the div once the width is shorter

image s width is less than div s width i can use margin auto here

the width and height you provided should be greater than amount of padding for example summing top and bottom margin 18 + 18 36px so height should be greater than 36px same goes for height

this means they won t float next to one another unless you set the width of each so that the combined width + margin + border + padding of both blocks is equal to or less than the width of the container

it seems a good idea to set the width of the body a little less than page width - left + right margin

to render in pdf correctly body width + left margin + right margin must be less than or equal to page width

margin auto won t center an element horizontally unless you also set a width that s less than 100

you re negative margin is more than half the viewport width of an iphone therefore it is dragging it out of view

the sidebar overlaps with main content is because the element .logo has fixed width 150px and fixed left right margin both 40px so the the whole width of the .logo element is 230px which is larger than width of #sidebar element when the page is narrow enough so #sidebar element is expanded

if the content leads to a width that is less than 100 of the table s containing block then setting the left right margin to auto will center the table within the containing block

why is css adding more than 2.5 margin from the top when only the width is increased

if i have clearly understood your requirements then you wish to have gray margin left and right side of your main content when the width is more than 800px

the the main content div needs to have left margin larger than the width of your sidebar

margin using percent doesn t work cross browsers on flex items so if your margin s is more related to the viewport use viewport units vh or vw else you can combine px with css calc width calc 33.333 - 20px to match an equal gutter between the items

because of the margin the width is more than 100 and the last -element goes into a new line

or by ensuring the width of your split container is less than the width of the user control after subtracting the margin from each side

your exact code but in full screen you will see the 20px margin if your screen width is higher than 850px

on the linked example they used a wrapper outside the nav .navbar-wrapper with an absolute placement and a top margin of 20px when the viewport width is larger than 768px

but if the screen width is less than 200 then it will be from left view edge margin to right view edge margin.

in this example media query if the window s width is no greater than 200px .wrapper will be given an absolute width of 160px and a 20px margin either side

it is a much better way than fixed width and margin auto

i would like that if the width is smaller than 540px the input fields automatically resize to full width with a margin of 10px at both sides

the title goes in a h1 for example and the text in a p or div so set these two elements to have a left margin greater than the width of image a

i notice that when the arrow block is rendered when width is less than 296 px inside the carousal there is some space between the left border of the carousal and the arrow block even though i did not add padding or margin

it must also have a width that is smaller than its containing block for the auto value to make sense - because #container is spanning the width of its parent the there is simply no margin to distribute

but in general this wouldn t work because of the specified width is bigger than the real one and exceed it so there s no margin to auto it and center the content which found in div

first one margin auto is better if you can know width of container list and you don t want centre content of this container

the elements are sized relative to the entire viewport but the body width is less than this because of the default margin on body

assuming this is the fix you are looking for your container needs to have a width greater than the width of the button and from there you can add margin 0 auto

the yellow box my basic goal was to make the heart a bit smaller than the width of the yellow box center it horizontally within and give the heart some top margin

basically if it can scale to 100 height of the parent container margin padding included without the width becoming bigger than the parent container s let it scale up

you have to take into consideration that borders take up width and that the margin of 1 of either side of the large container means that it can only be less than 100 width

the reason why your website is x-scrollable on all devices is that you forgot to add to and the row inside it has 100 +15px left margin +15px right margin which is bigger than window width

if you have a div that takes up most of the screen except for the 20 margin on the left and you want that margin to be no less than 100px then you can use a media query to set the margin to 100px when the frame width becomes less than 500px 20 of 500px is 100px

to do that the div must have a width smaller than the width of the parent container of course it must be display block and have margin 0 auto

note that the left margin must be less than 2 of the width minus all of the borders 4px or the body div will be too wide and flow under the sidebar

1 first of all the width of your two select boxes are bigger than the width of the column that contains it you need to take into account all padding and margin used

another option is not to float the main content column but instead assuming it s the right column to give it a large left margin that is slightly wider than the width of the left column


openfeint	scoreloop	1
further to this i m still opting for scoreloop and i can confirm this behaves the same regarding one score per user but it offers a lot more functionality and does seem to respond much quicker than openfeint did for me


subclass	accessor	1
the indirection has some costs and is kinda ugly so if you want to keep this functionality you might be better off by implementing accessor methods and only log in a subclass of core


fabric	rundeck	2
tools like push jobs fabric and rundeck are possibly better suited and all have direct integration with chef s node catalog like you describe

another option is to use some kind of central orchestration personally i prefer fabric but rundeck chef push jobs and mcollective are all options


apache	cherokee	1
a more recent benchmark on 1 2 4 8 cpu cores - also made by an independent third-party - compares apache 2.2 apache 2.4 nginx lighttpd varnish litespeed cherokee and g-wan


firebird	dbisam	1
something like textolution s proprietary add-on for firebird looks like it could accommodate constructing single complex nested query that would apply both regular and fulltext criteria but dbisam does it more elegantly


debian-based	linux	1
if you have a choice i would definitely recommend using linux especially a debian-based distribution which has excellent support for rmpi


vmware	virtualbox	31
because of compatibility with vmware infrastructure esx i would prefer vmware for headless server operations and virtualbox for anything that requires user interaction photoshop gui etc

i really miss this feature on virtualbox because i find vmware to be bloated and it slows the host system down much more than virtualbox does

im trying very hard to like virtualbox but so far i find it so much worse than vmware in so many ways

between hyperv vmware and virtualbox there are much better alternatives available

my experience is that you should prefer vmware but that s only because i had some crashes and memory loss with virtualbox

even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

virtualbox free but less powerfull than vmware

vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details

i have tried both vmware and virtualbox and found virtualbox to be better for my setup

however i found that vmware is much more stable full screen resolution much much better to handle the iphone connection via usb and i didn t have yet any crash when on virtualbox it s quite often

everyone seems to be suggesting virtualbox but in my opinion you can t beat vmware at the virtualization game

you have to buy vmware 64bit or you can use virtualbox from oracle for free

virtualbox no vmware because virtualbox is more user friendly

using a virtual machine such as vmware or virtualbox makes this easier

as for virtual machine creation i prefer vmware workstation however there are free alternatives such as virtualbox and vmware server

fwiw i have never gotten freebsd to work properly under virtualbox perhaps if you need that you would be better off with vmware which does

i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox

from my experience vmware 5 is faster than virtualbox 4.2 rc3 and has better smp performance

i have successfully set up vvv on virtualbox in the past but i ve been told vmware is much faster

i would recommend vmware for business use and virtualbox for home use

it was developed with only various versions of windows in mind and from my experience there s always some sort of problem running any linux distro under it. i would recommend vmware as suggested above or alternatively virtualbox which has worked very well for me in the past it runs certain linux distros best though i can t remember which ones

in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up

i managed to use andlinux + wine to get this working but honestly i think the vmware virtual pc virtualbox route is simpler

virtualbox is slower than vmware

virtualbox compares directly with vmware

and in fact modern processors often have a built-in virtualization feature which even allows virtualization software such as virtualbox or vmware to run the instructions natively while the virtual part is done by the cpu itself allowing much faster execution speed of virtual machines.

i am not sure if vmware server will be much better than virtualbox

if you don t have the cash for vmware if you do it s the best money can buy try virtualbox

the vm mentioned in here is not like in vmware or virtualbox it is more like java virtual machine jvm as well as python and ruby

after aquiring a copy of virtualbox or vmware either is great personally i prefer virtualbox because the display settings are more customizable

i can recommend virtualbox for this purpose you can download the free version and it s easier to use than vmware


folder	directory	249
under select folder location put your directory for the shared code

in every profile directory there are more folder and files

it might have been faster for listing whole directory but when filtering out files and only accepting folder it takes far more time

i have tested on mp3 files in different directory it takes less than one second with over 6000 files stored in different folder

and using visual studio online i can build and deploy the site into root folder but i couldn t figure it out how to deploy into a virtual directory i have created earlier

i find the best way is to create a cache session folder in your systems directory is more safer i put important things like logs and cache in system rather than application folder

4.1 additional library directory - find your armadillo directory and select folder examples lib_win64

it removes files and folder from a server directory that are older than 8 days

if you are comfortable with the terminal app you can switch to the project s folder directory and do ls -lf .git

for example in app1 directory i have some sub directory misc fragment master detail and in detail folder i have a subfolder detail--- form

next go to the top level folder in the project view of intellij the same one you copied to tmp current then right click and select compare directory with select tmp current as the target to compare against

there are more than 1000 folder inside this directory which are mainly celebrity name like angelina joulie etc and inside that folder several images are there for that celebrity

this grabs each folder the -directory switch ensures we only grab folder in c prod that does not match the filter and pipes it to the foreach-object command where we are running the copy-item command to copy the files to the directory

i moved that file in the content folder of my project and changed the copy to output directory to copy if newer

i guess it was misleading because if i choose folder it also puts it under the server directory at least according to the parent label under the parent children section

it seems when lotus notes domino thread creates folder a and some files in it using lotusscript mkdir rmdir and other io methods and then executes java vm which tries to delete folder a with all files in it parent thread lotus notes domino gets corrupted and loses directory structure handle which results in error above

what you need to do is in the tfilelist put your main folder choose check box include sub directory and in the filelist type drop down list choose directory

select include directory for the type and click the folder icon to browse to the correct folder

so if you were to assign a variable to executenonquery and the results show a value higher than 0 then you will need to set copy to output directory to do not copy and then manually copy the database into the bin debug or bin release folder or set copy to output directory to copy if newer which means unlike copy always this value will only copy the database to the app folder if you make any changes to the database in the project folder

i d recommend folder directory or even dir

after i ve done all that when i choose commit directory on the project the build folder still shows up

utils folder in my windows directory is created with lower case

in my case user can select folder to extract and i want to make 2 progress bars one for overall process step is the completition of extraction one of selected directory and second for extracting from subfolder

another tip if you want to add more folder to ros more folder where it can look for packages just set ros_package_path ros_package_path new directory you want

if you always show all the files i suspect the single folder may be faster since you will have to run through the whole directory listing doing multiple file listings

i did a little snooping on each of the machines to find that the temporary asp.net folder in the .net installation directory was taking up more than 10gb of space on each box each folder comprising of about 5mb each

on windows xp however it works fine on local file systems but when watching folder on a mapped network drive it throws an ioexception when trying to watch more than 50 directory

found a dirty solution the preferences list .globalpreferences.plist located in library preferences folder of the user home directory contains preferred languages of the user default home directory is users user and if the user is root the path is var root but this path can be configured here method form nsstring can be used to get home directory

a directory or folder is nothing more than a location on a disk used for storing information about files

i m starting in the base directory and i know that the the directory goes no more than 1 folder deep past the base directory

instead i want those scripts to look in a custom directory let s say dependencies folder in the main project first so that i can directly put those externals in that folder which is much easier than putting them into the vc folder or manually setting the paths

there is another lib folder in home username directory which contains older version of pythons also

due to this i create a temporary directory and use createfromdirectory but i don t want copy the same folder to other location in the disk almost the zipped already folder is better

which parallels the directory folder you created earlier

i like many developers got an email from apple recently that stated we should move our data from the documents directory into another folder to permit more streamlined backup to icloud

i have login.jsp forgotpass.jsp files in webapps directory i have 2 more jsp file under web-inf jsp folder

note that once the cache installer is done then it seems there is a service that is sweeping this directory and putting older files into the logsbackup x directory which is also in this folder

you can just simply set the working directory to be the user select folder and you can read or write with file names only

there is an option to compare directory folder which will show the files with changes

in future if they add more than one directory at the root level i will handle it but for now you can assume they will only put in one top level folder

the 1 directory does not exist i select folder 2 from dropdown box

if any of the folder in this directory are older than 14 days it will then delete them and their sub-directories

usually choose directory window have button to make new folder but cant find option in tkinter

many thanks in advance i am using advanced installer 12.1 the scenario is we have already installed application with some custom location feature and is extends the default application location this installation creates some folder to store temporary files like temporary folder this folder is used by the application on every minute basis and hence there are some files in this folder now issue is when i run a new build or try to install the new version of the application i again select the another custom location before finishing the installation the installer deleting all the folder installed with older version but not deleting the folder which contains files created by the application e.g the temporary directory above is deleted if it is empty but when it is non-empty it is not removed

i m trying to create a script that deletes all files and folder that are older than 24 hours but it should not delete a directory until all the files in it are older than 24 hours

ideally we would like to find the names of every image in a directory so users can just throw some images in the folder to add more logos

i set the property of copy to output directory to copy if newer for the node js file cmd.exe and the node modules files and they are being generated in the bin folder

3.1 include directory - find your armadillo directory and select folder include

rm -rf directory also works faster for billion of files in one folder

i need help in a vba macro that ll delete files in a directory that contains more than 2 _ and is older than 3 months old however there are some folder sub folder in the directory that must not be touched or modified

when i moved the project folder to the new directory the file directory names became longer and some particular files names became longer than the character limit for the windows file naming system

i am trying to have an easy way to update a program i am working on by being able to just place replacement .py files in a folder which i then put at the top of the sys.path list so all import statements will first check that folder and not my top level directory importing the newer .py files and not the ones used to build the program originally with pyinstaller

verify working directory section check selected working directory all required files should be present in there - if not click on workspace button and select folder from workspace

so currently i have two loops running within another i don t know if this is like taboo or something d but what i m aiming for is if the number of files in a directory pages are more than in another directory posts i want it to delete the corresponding files in the pages folder

but this was restrictive as all calls to the repairs folder were redirected to index.php so thought renaming the folder would be a better way forward as a user would be able to navigate to other files within the directory

linux server how can i copy overlapping files from backup folder with subfolder directory with all subfolders and files to newer folder directory withhout touching newer pre-existing files

unfortunately this means i need to manually create each folder then import the two files then for both files set the build action to none and copy to output directory to copy if newer

it is because u select the root of facebook sdk folder go futher one level on facebook sdk directory and select facebook folder then you will not get androidmanifest.xml error

if i run ls folder | head in a directory with a lot of files the execution time is about 50 times faster than ls folder | tail

select one of the ts files that resides under your dist directory that corresponds to the directory that ng serve is serving from and select add folder to workspace

i did first try deleting the .svn folder from the bin directory but all that did was cause it to complain that the bin dir was no longer under source control and halt

i m trying to write a script that deletes all folder that are older than 60 days and create a logfile with the folder names in the directory where the folder have been deleted

now select from drop down tomcat v 8.0 and if needed accordingly change server runtime environments below it browse installation directory and here select folder named liked this tomcat 8.0

the problem is that the dropbox folder is no longer in my user directory so r cannot find the directory.

to navigate to f you must go to c users folder a b c d e f within each directory there are a number of .html files and potentially more than one folder also

if you need to add more than one folder for searching see the msdn for documenation on adddlldirectory for the steps required to allow for multiple search directory

actually adding a new resource folder does nothing more then adding it as a resource directory in build.gradle

without cygwin on windows you can right click on the root directory select search type .svn in search for files or folder named check type in the search options and then select folder in the drop-down menu

my cygwin installation is now in two directory c cygwin64 and my windows user folder which makes backup more complicated and is tied to my username another user couldn t use it

also when all the code is under one top-level folder the trunk src folder you can notice that all the other folder bin lib include doc and maybe some test folder at the top level in addition to the build directory for an out-of-source build are all folder that contain nothing more than files that are generated in the build process

obviously as a result i need two folder in the directory folder one called bad which contains all the folder containing one folder and one called good which contains all the folder containing more than one folder

i would recommend placing the common files in the same directory as the solution file or no more than 1 folder deep

i strongly recommend you to first have a closer look at all the directory and folder under system-images folder to have a better understanding and easier solution

the better way is to actually drop the file into a tmp folder echo a link to that file and then delete all files in that directory that are older than x minutes

i know that this command works for removing all folder in the directory that are older than n days

since it is impossible to know for certain how many files or directory which themselves could contain additional directory containing still more files or folder will be selected and dropped by user the a single or recursive calls to traversefiletree require some mechanism to determine when all asynchronous operations have completed

to keep it short i want to create list of folder in a directory to make it easier for the user to pick a folder

change your paths to relative paths which mean they just have the bit of the path from the current directory in this case the projecta source1 bit if you ve set your current directory to your dropbox folder or just source1 if you ve set your current directory to the projecta folder which is a better idea

do i just add it under the resources folder in solution explorer and set the file properties buildaction to content and copy to output directory to copy if newer

i have created a node app which has the folder node-android node-modules.so here inside the node-modules directory i have one more directory bson ext index.js open this file and you can find inside the catch block

but mine is large and spans across a maze of folder directory and grows even larger as the development team adds to it

i ll then copy the file to that folder run my command against it provide a link to the file and i ll have some service that runs every now and then that deletes directory that are more than a day old

if you choose create folder xcode will create folder in your project directory and the structure will be like the structure of the imported folder folder

select directory button right besides jre home and point to the installed folder location

lets change the root directory of the repos to the repo folder we made earlier

i assume you have all your package files in some folder so you can pick existing directory in the dialog box and then select your directory

i have a folder named documents within that i have 3 000 text files and two sub directory which contains more thousands of text files

i wrote this function and it seemed okey but it fails if there are more than one folder in the current directory and no files

and before copying the directory it is better to zip the entire stata8 folder - that will significantly reduce copying time since there are plenty of small-sized files

so my question is how do i determine what the last modified file is from more than one directory actually need it for four different folder

if you haven t deleted the download folder yet you can select install from local directory to make things faster

i had kept all my testng jar files in a separate folder to organize better in eclipse project s lib directory while the rest of my jar files were directly in the lib directory

i need to make sure that each of these top mail directory sa44-3 is not larger then 8gb so the script should calculate the size of each top level folder and if its over 8gb create a new one called eg

file must be in the same or higher directory as target folder

wildcard with subject matches directory subjec1 2 3 and folder

3 open file - new - import project - browse directory of folder - select folder

the above assumes you are in the same folder as your docker-compose.yml and the directory is all lower case characters

i had a parent directory which contained two more folder

other account directory that have more than one media folder need to run a test against the log for success or fail and depending on the string to move a single file from all other media media2 media3 media4 etc. folder over to media1 unless failure is read in the log

if you really need to enter the sub-directory however you can create recursive calls and in the call you can check if the directory has further deeper folder by using directoryinfo.getdirectories

navigate to the directory that is your website root and click select folder

when i choose folder it shows all the directory and sub-directories in treeview

it s faster to the operating system reach the file when you have 100 folder with 100 files inside i see a lot of improvement when i split one directory that had more than 20.000 files inside

i have directory with many folder each mail folder has more folder into

my main domain is tied to my public_html folder but i use an .htaccess redirect to change the root directory to a sub-directory in the folder to make it easier to host multiple sites

this folder has way more than 1 directory and has a bunch of files so apparently it snot reading something correctly

in assets folder are more directory in some depth

assuming your solution is winforms and your user is selecting a directory i m not sure how to interpret your use of path -- the file s path or a path to a directory a folderbrowserdialog might be more appropriate than a openfiledialog as it allows you to choose the folder directly

1 to check if file exists select file path by searching folder enter file name select directory and assign depth depending on the directory mentioned

i have an asp.net mvc controller action that is designed to give access to specific files in select directory and sub-directories in my app_data folder

if address of directory is correctly give c mydirectory mysubdirectory select folder and check the extensions of the files

on the open dialog i have set the optionsex to ofexnoplacesbar and that removes the bar that would let them select folder and directory to go to quickly but the user can use the bread crumb address tool to go up a level and type a different directory into the filename text box to change directory

to compare your latest changes between project 1 and 2 select the folder in the project tool window right-click and choose compare directory

looking at the gulpfile i see no transfer of css files from source directory to target directory happening only less files from the src less folder are handled there

in my project folder i have a directory called less which i include in brocfile.js

i am running into an issue where for some of the folder there are too many subfolders and it spits out the directory name k really long path blah is too long not the actual dir- the actual dir is longer than 260 chars

if you want your shop to be in a sub-folder of your domain name you must first create a folder through filezilla right-click and choose create directory then upload prestashop in that folder

if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder

unfortunately looks like it requires uninstaller and reinstall as the locations seems to have changed drastically from some subsubsub folder off of appdata to something higher up under user directory

the relative path approach works in my circumstance although it isn t exactly equivalent to the full path approach because it may also match folder lower down the directory hierarchy

iterate over the directory and skip the folder which are in text file and remove other folder which are more than 30 days old

how can i check the date of the folder in the directory and delete those older than a certain date

what i thought is that if i can configure launchagent or daemons then i will provide path to mongod of bin directory of mongodb folder and provide --config and path for .conf file as argument and then i need to just launchd mongod using launchctl with name mongod and it will start

but is it at all possible to write one using an already made directory structure with files and folder that must remain as they are the web folder i described earlier

but if you have lots of disk activity in your folder and you have large projects you ll want to select directory

i need to create a simple program which goes through a user-given directory on sharepoint and finds all the folder which are older than 1 month and then it copies them to some local hard drive

obviously in this case the call could return more than one item if there was more than one folder named test in your directory tree

clicking the button under the location dropdown will bring up a directory selector -- note that the prompt says choose folder containing... rather than choose file and location

if you only want to go to a single specific depth try sys.glob - these patterns match folder and files and these examples work from the current directory

you can either prepend a dot to your image address which means go to parent directory meaning get out of css and then look for images or you can move your images folder to your css folder whichever is more comfortable for you

in tfilelist give the parent folder path c logdetails and select directory in filelist type dropdown

you can get a filtered list of files in a folder directory using file#listfiles filenamefilter

| grep directory | cut -f2- -d selects folder and trims off directory

what i would like to know is whether there is something in php that could check test in some simple way whether a folder directory contains file older than sometime or even how many of such files are there without any kind of manual go-through

in the solution directory create a directory with the same name as the solution folder solution folder do not normally match directory at the source code level but this will for sanity sake

first the sub-directories of your src directory should mirror the sub-directories of your include directory this is just to keep things intuitive also try to keep your sub-directory structure reasonably flat shallow because deep nesting of folder is often more of a hassle than anything else

but then the user of my cms has to include multiple folder into multiple directory which makes everything more complicated.

so now i just want to forget this virtual directory system and make the solution explorer to be nothing more than a folder tree as it is in real just like a windows explorer

however now i m trying to get this same dialog to accept only directory the select folder button instead of the open button

i need to create installer which would consist of standard pages + would contain one additional page which allows user to define folder where files needed for application would be stored this page should go after standard select directory page so i created the following script

2.create a .txt file inside the raw directory folder you created earlier and give it any name eg.articles.txt...

go to your user directory c profiles youruser there should be a folder called .m2 may be hidden

i have a directory which has more than 10 folder

the idea is that if any files in the bin debug directory are newer than the corresponding .nuspec file found two folder above bin debug then the mainbuild target should execute

what if i want to get all the contents of the x y and even other directory internal contained in deeper layers of the other folder y as sd

you risk filename collisions by putting your files directly in the static folder vs adding one more directory and putting them in there

i then placed my less file with the same name as my css file in a folder named less in the root directory of my project

1 if i copy more than one folder to the watched directory one of them will get handled none of the others will get processed

remove the directory if the date contained in the folder name is older than 3 months

i have the base directory mentioned for bower components in .bowerrc but need some one dependency in specific folder in the project

the alteration to swap the functionality of the page navigation of divi is done in a file titled frontend-builder-scripts.js found in the divi folder directory includes builder scripts frontend-builder-scripts.js

right-click the root directory in repo and select add folder

is there any way to tweak select file dialog to make it able to select directory on win-pc and folder on mac

i m just writing a little batch script that is supposed to look in a specific directory for folder that were created more than x days ago

the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for

i have tried writing this into my config file to match folder only in that example directory and no further sub-folders.

select the folder where java me sdk is installed in the choose directory to search for platforms dialog box and click open

in the properties of those files you could set copy to output directory to copy if newer and so everytime you run the application they will be copied to the bin debug folder alongside with the executable and in your application you could access them as relative files file.readalltext myfile.txt

but my directory structure is more organized its more like app lib mypackage folder

we all know there is option of select file files in html html5 but i don t want that i want to select folder or directory on windows linux macos in html jquery

my directory is applications mamp htdocs website - i have other projects in the folder htdocs but if the modrewrite works in all folder would be even better

the genisoimage man page suggests using -r or -r which has better defaults for ownership in addition since the rock ridge standard supports 255 byte file names and folder depths greater than 8 directory and is a real standard unlike joliet

for mac - take checkout from server side and a new window will open to select directory from your local machine than put your all code in selected folder then open svn local side and add and commit the project

i want to prevent errors by ensuring that if a new set of folder containing more subfolders and files is copied to the source directory for processing my program will not start operating on the target directory until the copy process has completed

i fixed the problem by copy and pasting android sdk apiv23 copying full sdk folder may take more time so you only need to copy android-23 under android-sdk platforms directory

i have a directory containing more than 1000 folder

jquery supports file select capability for uploading files below code but i just wonder can we do something different to set a download directory path to a specific folder by using the windows select folder box

if you are using a linux mac unix machine most of time i have had to either start from the root folder such as users .....to the source folder or when using a directory that is closer just use in front of it

i have makefile .mke on windows and i need to count directory in a folder which start with install and then make if clause to throw an exception if there are more than one directory like this

the first option is easy with one directory but becomes much more tedious with multiple folder not to mention that windows will likely create an object in the target directory before it has finished copying and i am compressing files potentially over 10 gb so that solution won t work

to do that you need select folder location where placed ignored files or folder usually it s root project directory

as a result each folder may contains 4 images along with 4 sub directory that contain the smaller more detailed images

condition is i need to move all folder which are older than 30 days inside parent directory

if you wish to know where those files are actually stored so you can edit them with your favorite ftp editor rather than through joomla login to your home directory with ftp or sftp select the folder templates then the template folder name then edit index.php to edit your html or select folder css and edit template.css usually the default name to edit your css

to set it to copy to the output folder right click on the ssdl file in solution explorer and change copy to output directory to copy if newer

i run stat64 for 1000 files in a folder and took less than 1s but when there were 5000 in the same directory the time increased to 15s

i know i could go to every solution folder and add a .tfsignore file there with .vs or something similar to ignore the folder but what i m looking for is how to add a .tfsignore at the root that will ignore all .vs folder and the files under them no matter where they are located in the various sub directory

please note that if you don t fix umask and create more than one directory with os.makedirs method you will have to identify created folder and apply os.chmod on them

then just compare folder directory and filter out specific files for each patch addon mod

if you d like to have xcode show a direct translation of the directory structure you can drag the fish dictionary folder into the project navigator and select create folder references rather than create groups

personally i create a tests folder in my source directory and try to more or less mirror my main source code hierarchy with unit test equivalents having 1 module 1 unit test module as a rule of thumb

if directory folder atob has more than 1 item aaa.xyz let prune other folder file in same way

i had the same issue when i deleted all the bin and obj folder from solution directory to make a smaller backup file of the source files

4132808 so it shows that under images directory there are more than 5 million sub folder.is it ok to keep that much folder under one directory

but another possible cause for your problems may have been simply caused by the output directory being missing or more likely write protected either by security policies or folder settings

for more understanding with folder directory

would need monitoring on below folder for respective directory sub directory to see if the files in the directory are greater than 100 files

btw microsoft azure storage explorer in my case showed only some subset of folder which is much worse than displaying duplicated directory so i switched to azure explorer mentioned above and it s worth recommending

if you need more information you can either calculate the value based on the mail folder or save some more on nsuserdefaults or even create a plist file on your document directory

unfortunately including .class only goes two directory deep and does not copy any files that are deeper than two directory inside of the bin folder


drawimage	putimagedata	12
is putimagedata ... more performant than drawimage ...

using drawimage canvas is much faster than using putimagedata

that beeing said putimagedata is much slower than drawimage at least when i tested them earlier this year

the only problem that as far as i know using drawimage is slower than using putimagedata and it was required in old browser versions like firefox 2 or such

if you get curious and discover the putimagedata function in the canvas 2d api please note that drawimage is much faster which might be unintuitive

don t use getimagedata putimagedata for clipping since drawimage is easier and faster.

if you don t intend to do pixel manipulation you should only use drawimage without getimagedata putimagedata which are slower though

right now putimagedata is much slower than drawimage as you can see here

i have seen that the drawimage function is really faster than the putimagedata

drawimage seems to be much faster than putimagedata

as of right now drawimage is much faster than putimagedata

using the clipping version of drawimage will be faster than putimagedata


trac	mantis	3
i d recommend mantis or trac

try the mantis it s free and easy php solution.i cannot compare with trac or others because mantis is good enough

i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis


distance	pdist	2
pdist implementation was always slower than cython and takes much more memory because it explicitly creates a distance matrix which is slow because of sqrt

also note that in my code above manually calculating the euclidean distance is much faster then calling pdist


lua	moonscript	1
note that there several advantages to leaving the lua code duplication generated by moonscript in your lua files at least for oft-used operations class definition is probably not one of them but moonscript does way more than that


gmail	outlook.com	1
in outlook.com hotmail it looks closer to the results shown with gmail


grepl	substr	2
therefore vectorized substr by david arenburg is the best answer while sapply grepl by sixiang.hu and significantly better than grepl by david arenburg

finally i also made a benchmark test which shows that substr operation is slightly better than sapply grepl and significantly better than vectorised grepl alone


tiff	png	12
choose png or tiff which support alpha channel

jpg or png should get you smaller than tiff

the resulting png compression may produce a file size larger than your tiff compression

tiff â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than png

other than that it s up to the uses of the images quality compression etc. in terms of whether you choose png gif jpeg tiff etc

for my senior project i am trying to find the best way to create a grid of up to 1000+ x 1000+ images and save as a png tiff psd bmp etc i prefer png with the ability for the alpha transparency

the resulting file from this png approach is smaller in size than a tiff file and i guess may rescale better

if you check the description of imwrite you will see that if you want to save your image as binary you are supposed to choose bmp png or tiff

tiff can beat png by about 2 1 43k vs

today png is much more popular than tiff so if you re writing files outside of your own data store png would be a more common choice and you d need to work through nsimagerep to get there

a 1 x 1 image in the other common formats jpeg png tiff are larger

i would prefer tiff or png files as pdf and ps files do not support all graphic objects today


portrait	landscape	157
instead i added a field to my models for the admin to select portrait or landscape

it s because you re using and orientation portrait so once the width of the window has a higher value than the height none of your css will be taken into account because it s considered landscape orientation at that point

phone choose between portrait and landscape layouts automatically

the amount of spacing to the right of the uiview when in portrait mode is greater than i want for landscape mode and the distance from the bottom is less than i want for landscape mode

i know from a performance point of view it is not a good idea be having nested linearlayouts so i want to ask you which other way i can do that which scale well between portrait and landscape and have a better performance

for example when rotating from portrait to landscape the collection view bounds value still has its height greater than the width

portrait mode sets the smaller side as the width and larger side as height for example 9 16 landscape the sets the larger side as the width and smaller side as height 16 9

if you set the width to lower than the portrait width and set the min-width to 100 then you sill get width 100 but this time a version that actually works and now the iframe takes the actual container width and not the landscape width

this is a conflict on tablet ipad portrait width 768 and mobile phone landscape width 768 but height is smaller around 400 only in which cutting the height of images co z i need to keep the images width 100

the bug occurs if the input has a width that makes it wider than the portrait width when in landscape mode

there is no setting here for the iphone on the right side with the ipad i can choose portrait and landscape

but user should be only able to select video with landscape orientation if user select portrait video she he would get alert message saying that its portrait video and hence can not import to edit

in portrait the spacing is decent but in landscape mode i feel like the graphs should be bigger and take up more space than in portrait mode which is simply not possible with the tab bar and navigation bar

switching between landscape and portrait changes nothing the width is still larger than the screens

the program s label changes dynamically so when the width is greater landscape mode it s label has a different text then when the height is greater portrait mode

configure the layout select portrait landscape

but the only thing i get is that the activity is still in landscape but the rectangle now is smaller with the portrait dimensions and the camera becomes weird because the image is rotated 90 degrees and moves down when i move the phone left and up when moving the phone right

it s a bold meaning that its width is greater than its height which makes its portrait view a landscape

without more detail it s hard to say why your approach doesn t work but my guess is that you are seeing the sprite positioning you describe as a result of the fact that if you don t change orientation the lower left in portrait is the lower right in landscape when rotated left it s the same point in gl space 0 0

your imageview in landscape is smaller than portrait

web browser print dialogs default to portrait so for every print job the user has to manually select landscape

however if you want to redesign your layout or make adjustments based on wether the screen is in landscape width is larger than height or portrait height is larger than width mode you can definitely use css media queries

so as stated in the title i have an issue with the different designes between landscape and portrait i have been trying to make landscape look better more like the portrait design but no matter what i do it turns out ugly small imageview and smaller movie details field here is the picture of the looks and the xml code if there is anything that can be done id love to hear you re advice

and then while loading each page i am checking orientation if it is portrait then adding two more gesture up and down gesture if landscape then removing up and down gesture

i have to set it to 4em to make the h2 approximately twice the size of the 1em p in portrait but in landscape it is much bigger

these are neither portrait or landscape and your code always picks portrait when the orientation is not landscape

topbar portrait height is bigger than topbar landscape height everywhere except iphone 6 plus

when i draw a 3d cube in opengl es for android it seems to look fine as long as i m in portrait mode but when i switch to landscape it looks more like a diamond

now my doubt is when i rotate it to portrait mode from landscape mode since the width of the textblocks present inside the itemtemplate of listbox is already defined when i rotate the it to portrait i am not able to see all the data present it cuts off since the width of the portrait mode is less when compared to landscape mode

with all of these declared transitioning between portrait and landscape is much smoother with much less lag

can t i set landscape by default so the user may choose portrait if he judges that s what he needs

and then each device you can choose portrait or landscape

if all you need is a different layout for portrait and landscape there s an easier way to do this

i am trying to provide a draw space that is 16x9 but i want the user to be able to choose portrait or landscape orientation

the android screenorientation setting means that it ll always be in portrait mode but of course you can choose landscape

i have this doubt i have a menu in which i run a javascript code or another depending on whether its width is greater or less than its height works me well the first time the screen resolution is detected but if there is a change of resolution or a change of orientation does not detect it and despite for example of having changed to portrait orientation still executing the landscape orientation code

so in the case if i upload 2 images i want to check if the images are portrait height is greater the width or landscape and need to show the images accordingly

you have this issue because height in landscape mode is lower then in portrait

you may try to listen to uideviceorientationdidchangenotification within your subclass cell to rotate the webview and within your view controller with the table view and run a -reloaddata on your table view in order to properly resize the cells assuming the landscape webview is way higher than the portrait webview

there is an orientation drop down that allows you to select portrait and landscape

i would recommend to check which of width or height is bigger in order to know if you are in portrait or in landscape and adapt your math to this parameter

obviously i want in portrait view the content area of this iframe to be smaller than in landscape

this also happens on smaller devices between portrait and landscape modes which is really my concern

because in landscape your height is smaller than in portrait you need to have a value smaller than 1.0

what is the actual browser width portrait and landscape for example samsung galaxy s3 has 720px resolution but i normally find that browsing in portrait showing much less than that

but this code give portrait even if i select landscape from setup

in an app we are developing we have an option to let the user choose preferred orientation i.e if they choose portrait the app will be locked to portrait orientation and the same for landscape and if both is opted the app will work on all orientation i am sharing the code for what i have tried and i m not sure whether this functionality is feasible at all

i would have hoped to see that the landscape can fit more content than the portrait but this is not the case see below that is all it allows me to add

if window height is bigger then window width the we have a portrait or in any other case we have a landscape orientation

there is a dropdown within the layout editor that allows you to select landscape or portrait orientation

one page is a page of which the width is smaller than the height sounds like it s a page in portrait but as there s a rotate value of 90 added to the page dictionary it is shown in landscape

the image display ok in ios6 simulator auto select portrait or landscape for non-rentina and rentina

it is quite interesting since you are in portrait view but when keyobard is shown width of the available screen is higher than height and that change orientation to landscape

you are using the screen size to generate your placeholder image and the width of the screen in landscape is bigger than portrait

well you have two options you could either pick portrait or landscape and block screen rotation or you could automatically rotate your object and stretch it according to the screen boundaries

if you resize your browser window to still have a viewport with a with equal or less than 1024px but have an height greater than your width the viewport is no longer considered to be in landscape mode but switch to portrait mode

it s important that i can mix and match portrait and landscape images but keep everything centred horizontally and vertically

when user selects landscape printing from print setup it is printer in portrait again anyway

in order to do so you need to find out if the svg is portrait or landscape - meaning if the width is smaller than height former or not latter

the following works perfectly with my phone in portrait the width fits but when i flip to landscape the width still fits perfectly but the images are longer than the height

when i choose landscape orientation in the print dialog the resulting page is rotated to landscape but the actual content stays in portrait mode and is clipped

cocos2d currently only allows to choose between landscape or portrait but doesn t allow to specify the orientation more specific

it will adapt the video frame height to landscape mode and it will play the video in the landscape mode whether or not a portrait mode is more suitable

the only problem with that is that it over-rides the 980px to 1024px media queries designed for ipad landscape and forces ipad landscape to display the smaller layout i designed for ipad portrait the 768px to 979px layout

this gave the uiimageview a portrait size greater height than width even though the app is locked in landscape mode

the third url works fine when the image width is larger than the height landscape but when the height is the largest dimension portrait it resizes the height correctly but the width dimension does not get padded to fill the 600px width but instead becomes whatever size is calculated to maintain the aspect ratio

in portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes false

consider whether you want to support both portrait and landscape view - if you do want to keep a left-hand column constantly visible then landscape might be more usable

this results in each landscape photo occupying less than half the area as the portrait photos and basically treating them with less importance

i have report with width size is bigger than height size like landscape but set to portrait in format - page format ireport

changing your phone s configuration from portrait to landscape would mean more options menu items could be displayed on the action bar thus items present in the overflow menu could now be moved to the action bar itself

if the height is higher than the width then you can say it s portrait or else landscape

i m trying to shy away from using max-width because some android devices in landscape are wider than an ipad in portrait and i was getting collisions where a device would incorrectly identify as an ipad based on a set width

portrait is taller landscape is wider

i am trying to make all a row of 4 images all have the same height size i already tried to play around with the width and height using css but nothing seems to work the portrait images always end up taller than the landscape ones here s the code

issue you re experiencing with a video working in landscape but not portrait sounds more like an issue with the email client than your code

i want all of the images to fit inside the width of the text area which will change dynamically with the window size and i want them all to be the same height meaning of course that landscape images take up more horizontal space than portrait ones etc

first go to target s setting - general tab - deployment info section in device orientation select portrait landscape left and landscape right

portrait mode can display more rows than in landscape mode

if uiscreen mainscreen knows that i really want the height to be greater than the width whether or not i actually do how can i either query the actual dimensions or query whether the device is in portrait mode or landscape

its because the height of the screen in portrait mode is more when compared to height of the screen in landscape mode

or what happends if we swap from portrait to landscape we have much more space yet it won t be used since we hardcoded 300.0

i would advice to check if the width is bigger than the height of the picture taken landscape picture and if that is the case show an alert to the users to explain that just portrait pictures are supported

i encounter the same issue and notice the crash happens if the original shared element is no longer visible on the previous screen when you go back probably it is the last element on screen in portrait but once switched to landscape it s no longer visible and thus the transition has nowhere to put back the shared element

i want to create a dynamic widget for ibooks 2 but i can not dynamically resize the widget to match portrait or landscape mode

my problem with this is that the calculation works fine in the portrait mode but as soon as i switch to landscape mode the distance between bottom and button is bigger than in portrait mode

the action icons are centered in portrait mode whereas the toolbar in landscape mode is higher and the icons are not centered

and the rest depends on you you can scan barcode in portrait mode but it take time longer or you have to change orient of screen to landscape to get result faster

then i d compare width height of each image to know if it s a landscape or portrait format and add a corresponding class

the printer sees and feeds them as portrait no rotation but the report viewer prints them landscape because the width is greater than the height

however for some reason google chrome not only responds to this but will actually select landscape and portrait depending on the dimensions of the viewport the window itself and has nothing to do with the position of the screen itself

also your css for .character has the width 170 narrower than the height 245 which would be a portrait view but your example shows a landscape view

on an iphone compact in landscape mode the status bar is hidden and the navigation bar height is less than in portrait

and i want to show the video in the landscape mode if the height is greater then the width of the phone otherwise to show the video in the portrait mode

to support this properly go to launchimage click on the attributes inspector and select portrait or landscape under ios 6 and prior

i had an outlet of a viewgraph which was a subclass of uiview in which i drew some graphics.in landscape mode the size of the viewgraph is larger than in portrait mode

the difference between a min and max dimension can be very large as the given area covered by a landscape cell is much wider and shorter than a portrait cell

select portrait then landscape left and landscape right order is important

if you have a main report choose landscape or portrait using subreports you can apply for each subreport its layout with property orientation in root tag jasperreport as follow

on most devices the portrait view is perfect but when i choose landscape view the styling is messed up

i check to see if the window s width is greater than its height in order to determine if the user is holding the device in landscape or portrait mode and i translate the data that the accelerometer provides based on that fact

now even though i m dismissing y and getting back to x in landscape mode i have it set to prefer portrait so shouldn t it just force portrait mode regardless of my having the device in landscape

take screenshot of rotated screen and while uploading turn the dimension to portrait if their dimension is landscape i.e width is greater than height

right-click the white space area of the design surface choose report properties page setup choose landscape portrait

i guess you are able to see the complete layout in portrait just because portrait layout is having more space and your complete layout is fitting well but landscape is having lesser space

my issue is that even after i select portrait to be the viewcontrollers mode it still changed to landscape when i the ipad is turned to landscape mode

ideally user would be able to choose portrait or landscape image though

anyway if you want to disable rotation without forcing the user to choose landscape or portrait you can use in each activity in the manifest

hence as you are tipping back it goes to orientation face up and your code picks portrait as it is not landscape but face up

as long as landscape means wider than taller and portrait viceversa it means to read the image into memory and check width and height

if you switch between portrait and landscape when viewing this on an ipad3 you ll need to refresh the browser window between switches you can see that portrait mode is choppier than landscape

or the tableview is covering it up because the landscape view has less vertical room than the portrait view

you will probably want scale with screen size using your reference resolution with match width or height and a full 0 match by width 0.5 match equally by both w and h or a full 1 match by height as that is what works for most games but it depends on your target orientation portrait or landscape and on your game

there s usually no need to add a ipad at the end because you can only choose landscape or portrait loading images for the ipad

in your project settings app target general deployment info device orientation select portrait landscape left and landscape right

should i force the user to select landscape or portrait mode if he enters this special activity

if the height is longer than the width the screen is in portrait mode otherwise it is landscape

if you think about a moment this is exactly what you want - to know if width is smaller than height portrait the opposite landscape or if they are the same square

then you can write separate css for width less than 650px portrait more than 650 landscape

for example in portrait mode height will be large and width will be small when compare it with landscape mode

i m trying to make a div which takes 100 of a4 page when printing no matter if you choose portrait or landscape in the print dialog window

currently i m using only the portrait orientation for all devices but the portrait orientation looks better on phones meanwhile landscape orientation looks better on tablets

but i am getting prob for landscape and portrait states..so its better to get useragent than by css

but the screen always gets rotated to landscape instead of being set to portrait when the width is smaller than the height

the differences between layout is the content.when i am in landscape i display more informations than i am in portrait

i have developed all views for my application in portrait mode now we are planning to give user flexibility to change between portrait and landscape mode i have read some documentation related to that in which they have given option to adjust controls position x y in xib based on the orientation but it will not enough in some case i need to make a new column because landscape will have more width compared to portrait in such cases do i need to make new view

the table cells in portrait took up the width of the view and in landscape were made somewhat higher but less wide

and also it works successfully in portrait and landscape view but if during playing mode of video i select landscape mode and stops the video then the status bar remains in the same position while the whole app moves to portrait view

sometimes the chart is instantly visible but when i rotate the screen between landscape portrait it keeps getting bigger every rotation

as you can see the bottom two photos landscape so have been rotated are narrower than the portrait ones at the top

navigate to general tab in your project settings iphone device orientation section and deselect checkboxes beside landscape left and landscape right and select portrait orientation

if you right click on your report go to design- page setup there will be an orientation tab to select landscape or portrait

you select landscape or portrait

i noticed that when i flip my phone from portrait to landscape everything gets bigger

there may be a better way to do this but a quick and dirty method would be to inspect the display s width and height with display.getsize point point - if the width is greater than the height then normal mode is landscape otherwise portrait

i know in xcode you have to select portrait or landscape at the beginning so i am a little confused as to how to make all pages in the app portrait except one

by default new android project have basic folders for portrait orientation .create a folder layout-land and drawable-land for landscape screen.put your layout xml file in layout-land and required image for that screen in drawable-land

such that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300

or continuously check the stage width height in onenterframe update and if height is bigger than width portrait else landscape

because in some devices it may possible that portrait screen size is less than 1024 and landscape have greater than this limit

i m designing a soft keyboard and i want to change its height at run-time as the user choose between landscape and portrait mode

if you want provide different layouts resources for landscape and portrait add the qualifier name -land or -port respectively

if i print a document and select landscape orientation in print dialog or in code as shown below windows 8.1 truncates it on the printer as it would be portrait

as landscape has lesser space than portrait you are able to view only top scrollview so only that portion would be scrollable

this demo illustrate the change from landscape to portrait using css orientation when the window height is higher than its width

in landscape it has more buttons in addition to what is there in portrait mode

portrait has an aspect ratio greater than 1 1 and landscape is less

when phone is in portrait mode entering more than 10 lines does not hide the button behind the keyboard.however when phone is in landscape mode entering around 3-4 line hides the button behind the keyboard.can anyone help me explain why this is happneing

to determine whether the image has landscape or portrait format simply check to see if width height is larger or equal to 1

it works as as desired for landscape image width greater than height however for portrait it automatically rotates image and interchange width and height without any flag to get if any rotation has been done

in crystal report if i set a user defined size as 4ã 6 it sets the page landscape as height is less than width due to this printer prints page on landscape mode i want it in portrait

some images are portrait orientation some are landscape all are larger than the desired render size

everything works ok on almost all phones and tablets graphics on landscape are smaller and when i back to portrait graphics are again bigger

when i change device mode to landscape i want larger ytplayerview then in portrait mode

first block match portrait and landscape clears 3n+1

however if i choose landscape when in portrait mode it automatically switches to landscape

landscape pages can be created in 2 ways set a width larger than the height or set the page rotation to 90 or 270 degrees for a portrait page


udp	mtu	27
so for example if you send a 63k udp packet and it goes over ethernet it will get broken up into 47+ smaller fragment packets because ethernet s mtu is 1500 bytes but some of those are used for udp headers etc so the amount of user-data-space available in a udp packet is smaller than that

my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can gurantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet

if udp payload size is bigger than mtu size udp will silently segment the packet

i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

my lwip can send udp packets to pc but my pc would fail to reassemble when the udp packets are larger than mtu

ideally your udp frames are smaller than the mtu for your architecture say 1500 bytes so the messages won t get chopped up in transit

3 you are sending messages that are bigger than the udp max message size 4 each device in your network has a max message size mtu so you might be exceeding a limit there

if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented

in practice each payloaded buffer will represent 1 udp packet unless your network mtu is smaller then what you have configured on the payload see mtu property

if there is network congestion rate limiting or traffic profiling or if the udp message size is larger than the mtu

when send a udp datagram larger than the mtu size only the last fragment of the udp datagram is putted out to the destination

in addition to the suppositions in question 4 supposing that my message is no bigger than the mtu - udp header - ip header size is the udp datagram that results guaranteed to fit into 1 ip packet on my local network at least

in real life udp packets size usually is equal or less than mtu size

udp packets greater than the mtu size of the network that carries them will be automatically split up into multiple packets and then reassembled by the recipient

ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a udp datagram is larger than the mtu for the segment allows

the mtu is closer to 1500 and this applies to tcp not udp

i am working on udp socket programming and i have to stop the transmission in application if requested data is more than mtu value

my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can guarantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet

what would happen if my udp package is larger than mtu

for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it

note that udp packets bigger than the mtu s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip

they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu

to send large blocks of data via udp you need to chop them up into pieces smaller than the mtu for the network segment across which you re transmitting them

when udp data size is smaller 1452 than ppp mtu no error

udp uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story

udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500


kate	kde	3
i recommend kate part of kde as an editor

i ve used it before but i definitely prefer kate on kde using the fish protocol

i prefer kate part of kde as it features a built-in terminal as well as many features you would expect from an editor inside an ide like code folding and regex search replace


voip	sip	2
almost all sip voip providers allow you to forward calls from an attached did telephone number to more than one sip device so your request could be satisfied by a basic account on your friendly neighbourhood voip provider

even simpler purchase voip service from a voip provider like phonepower or any other one that will provide sip credentials


viewmodel	caliburn	3
with caliburn it is even easier since you just need to bind a property on your viewmodel to selecteditem

how can i connect a method and not a command with a binding from the viewmodel to an attached event to ask in a more general way with caliburn micro

for wp7 apps i prefer caliburn micro because it does a lot of work for you like making it easy to navigate pages in the forced view first approach but then makes using the viewmodel first approach on sub pages easy as well


setinterval	clearinterval	10
you need to match setinterval with clearinterval not cleartimeout

but for your purposes i think setinterval and clearinterval would work better

i find this method simpler than using clearinterval to pause and setinterval again to restart

as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array

i also recommend using setinterval and clearinterval which are builtins designed to call events at a specified interval so you don t have to re-schedule a timeout on each call

but with setinterval combined with clearinterval it is more straightforward

this is perhaps a bit cleaner with a setinterval instead of a clearinterval

i know it is not perfect and could use setinterval and clearinterval to be more efficient but this is a start demo

i d also recommend using settimeout rather than setinterval clearinterval since it doesn t need to be run on a recurring basis

my solution was to increase the settimeout to create a bigger delay before the next part of the script commenced but also to add an additional clearinterval as the top line of the script running within the setinterval


subscript	superscript	2
since you need to match superscript or subscript characters you can use the corresponding range source

the solution below is a hack in that it uses a superscript or subscript to get a smaller font size for the second line of the facet label


switching	screens	49
when i click the play button in the main menu screens i want to switching the screens to the level select screens but what happens is that it does change the screens but the old one is rendering behind that as well

choose task manager select my app shown in the list and select switching to to bring the app to the front instead of activity 2 it ends up on the activity screens 1

if the sum of all the listview item s height is greater than the screens height you switching the layout type for one where you have a viewgroup relative layout with a listview without the footer on the top and a linearlayout at the bottom the desired footer

for example open preview and choose file grab timed screens then switching back to the iphone simulator and hold the mouse button down on the row in the table view until the screens flashes

the people i m working with don t like that the css kill switching makes the screens black and have asked for a kill switching that remotely redirects to a subfolder once activated

if the screens become smaller it switching to the next row but all the buttons are centered in the middel

for certain constellations switching from a 4-column to a three-column layout when screens size decreases more complex measure may be needed

the trick is to hit the switching direction button between your source and target entities in the schema compare screens and rerun the compare - then you will see the action on that difference has changed from a delete to an add and when you execute the update the table will be added to your vs database model

i ve already built a view that can take a drawable can use focused pinch-zoom and drag can auto-scale images can switching images dynamically and takes images larger than the screens

after switching to windows 10 i ve noticed that when selecting a lower than normal screens resolution the panel fit mode will default to maintain aspect ratio meaning black bars appear

when the switching gets bigger than a couple of screens full split it into functions that handle each state using a state table to look up the function directly

i can switching between these two screens easily.at the beginning first screens is fully displayed.when i click a button second screens will come from right and first screens goes to the left.but i want to keep the second screens and remember..second screens has less width a portion of the first screen.that means a half of the first screens disappear

and then switching their display-properties when the screens is smaller than x px

i am developing application which requires many more than 80 screens layouts each layout having different image views buttons textviews and so on and i have to be able to switching between them upon button clicks

switching between landscape and portrait changes nothing the width is still larger than the screens

i understand you are trying to load more events that are currently shown on screens so that they are cached and prev next switching works faster

it s highly recommended way to implement screens switching with navigation drawer and you ll experience much less pain and see that screens switching is way faster

but then i noticed after changing a mobile to landscape it would switching back to the desktop mode due to the width of the media query being less than the screens landscape width

by pressing home screens then android might more likely kill your app process to reclaim its resources mostly memory - this is more probable if you switching to several other applications

however my mobile site has an option that allow user to switching to desktop view if there are not fond of the mobile site but how should i do that since the javascript in my homepage will block any screens that s smaller than 1024

we can do a bit better if the virtual screens coords are higher resolution than our pixels which means we already get a sub-pixel position for the mouse cursor but the math won t change because we have still to switching to the gl s convent where integer means border instead of integer means center

i am using view flipper to show bunch on images like a slider where i implemented the functionality of swipe left and right to switching images now some of my images are larger than the screens size in terms of height are getting hidden

switching from the full nav-bar to the hamburger menu when the screens is less than 1200 px wide

at this point there is nothing i can do since the switching is no longer there... the external screens is just a blank screens for the sake of the exercise

if you want to show more than 2 screens you might have to use a number and extend a handlebars function that can be use a switching statement to test for different values to show different content

i would highly recommend switching to a launch screens storyboard

how can i make my webpage switching buttons from on hover to on toggle when the width of the screens is less than 769px

switching to 2.2 framework which has better compatability with screens resolutions and densities

the alternate screens switching is much older and as you indicated there was not much to be done i did not investigate further

when the screens resizes the longer elements in my navbar switching to two lines to take up less space

a better word than screens is activity you switching between activities in android

also if a user is currently looking at a screens in my app and they hold the power button and choose switching off do the events called not called coincide with when the battery is depleted and shuts down automatically

i am using flex to centre and position my element on my layers but when switching to a small screens size the element just get smaller while in bootstrap when i use when the screens get smaller the div take the whole width i wanna do something similar when the user switching to a small screens size i didnt use bootstrap because its realy hard to centre 3 div of in the middle of the page

i ve got a responsive ad unit on my page and for some reason it has a height of 60px while i really need it to be 90px and switching to 300x250 when screens gets smaller

when the screens size is smaller i have it switching flex-direction to column which works well except i cannot figure out how to make the 2nd row trending down start where the trending up stops where ever that may be

the advantage of this dual-natured solution is that the tabbed approach will work the way you want it to work for the majority of cases but for users with say two screens or who prefer switching between browser tabs they will still have the flexibility to work in multi-window mode

am i better off storing my screens in variables and reusing them when i switching screens or is it better to dispose of each screens when i m done with it and then create a new instance of the screens type i intend to switching to

- in my code sometimes i use px for imagens and sometimes dp but i ve tried switching all to dp in this screens and had even worse results

therefore i would firstly recommend switching to the new dashboard bottom left of the parse screens

but when the screens is smaller than 900px we switching from fixed to liquid via media query switching to a liquid width will allow our images to scale down our text to wrap and a whole bunch of other great things

and would the answer be different in a case where screens switching is more frequent like between an overworld screens and a battle screens in a game like final fantasy or pokemon

however when i switching to landscape mode the listview is taller than the screens

the point of such an architecture is because i have news with some text between which i want to be able to switching with paging effect but the news text can be bigger than the screens

content height is smaller than screens height is because of the virtual key back home switching app

but if i switching to my 24 monitor there is no longer this problem since the screens is wider and therefore the table rows are wider too

i m looking to see if anyone has a workable solution so i can basically switching between this big banner and a smaller format for mobile browsers where the screens size is smaller and doesn t break my responsive site

the panels must be side by side for a large screens but they must be responsive and as the screens gets smaller and switching to vertical orientation

how to make textures appears above each other as the shapes in color switching game when i touch screens there s one more shape is appear such as circles sticks and other shapes so how can i do that in libgdx

question is there a way i can switching these two col-md 6 s around when the screens is less that x pixels across


arduino	avr-gcc	2
opted to use arduino from command line because it suited my needs so far i know avrdude and avr-gcc is a more complete or better way to compile upload from command line correct me if i m wrong

edit my original answer made some assumptions that arduino ide was closer to avr-gcc than it actually was


swift	objective-c	153
in case it s helpful since you seem perhaps more familiar with objective-c than swift here s what your swift method would look like if we translated it back into objective-c

swift also prevents us i believe from overriding a parent class s property but also still lets us observe changes to that property--this is much better than objective-c s approach

self is a type constraint not an actual type. this is a side effect of the type system in swift being much more strict and static than that of objective-c for example metatypes aren t just a special flavor of otherwise normal objects

if you haven t used cocoapods before it is a cocoapods is a dependency manager for swift and objective-c cocoa projects. more information is available on its website here

may be because vvcospif it is wrapper under objective-c runtime and converting data structures copying of memory from intel simd - objective-c - swift runtime is slower then tiny cos

i prefer swift but objective-c solutions are welcomed as well

better if you have a code swift is better but is not problem objective-c

if you are using something like paintcode or have large chunks of uikit code in swift change it to objective-c it compiles far faster

those attributes let you create objective-c code which is more understandable by swift and complier warn you when you break the rule for example

this is because the swift dictionary is more strongly typed than the objective-c nsdictionary

i prefer objective-c but swift is also okay

if it even possible to mix and match objective-c swift from a framework swift documentation suggests it is

after clicking next the xcode template doesn t offer an option to choose swift as a language but automatically creates the project in objective-c

in general when writing swift code i would recommend using swift types as much as possible not objective-c types

if you have 0 knowledge of swift or objective-c and you wish only to develop for ios i would choose objective-c

even i m using swift i had to choose objective-c in the crashlytics dropdown to be able to complete the initialization of the sdk

i admit javascript isn t my strong point and have a much easier time with objective-c and swift

3- there are different ways to catch errors on different versions of swift and objective-c as described earlier in this answer

after thinking about playing with it some more and reading some other posts using objective-c typedef in swift here is a better solution i think

i don t know objective-c all that well and swift would be an easier transition i feel

apple seems to claim that the optional type in swift is safer than nil in objective-c but i don t understand why this is so

if you select objective-c then you will have two separate files h and m like previous xcode versions they didn t have swift

objective-c print is more readable compared to swift

objective-c has been updated to enable it and swift to work together more easily and efficiently

my view is that if in some cases objective-c is faster than swift it doesn t mean that all over performance of swift is slower

it depends on the language you select if you choose objective-c you ll have viewcontroller.h and viewcontroller.m as well as you choose swift you ll have viewcontroller.swift file simple as that

so i ve started learning swift because it looks way better than objective-c

i m trying to make the conversion from objective-c to swift and have had better days

the swift one is dramatically slower then objective-c implementation

with objective-c i was able to catch all the exceptions thrown by the parser found on github but with swift we are no more allowed to do so and therefore my question

i did a couple of benchmarks between swift and objective-c and i found that in certain cases swift was faster and in other cases objective-c was faster

i suppose it sort of makes sense to do things this way except for the fact that metal appears to play better with objective-c even though it looks like swift

you will notice that swift bundles are always about 4-5 mb larger than their objective-c counterparts and this is precisely why

specifically it makes it possible to write objective-c code that plays nicely with swift which is more strongly typed than objective-c

early this month i started learning swift as i found it fun and easier than objective-c

or is it merely a hint to whatever tool converts between swift and objective-c to better deal with swift optionals

objective-c blocks and swift closures are more than loose equivalents

i find that objective-c is much nicer for working with core audio than swift

and it does not matter if you prefer objective-c or swift i am grateful for all notes remarks comments solutions etc

objective-c s relatively lax type checking makes this easy to deal with but swift is stricter

swift is neither easier to read nor understand than objective-c

i feel a little less than swift asking this one but i have become exhausted going in circles on the swift objective-c function calls

the perf hit will be ridiculous i know apple say swift execute faster than objective-c but this is low level so it will be harmless

the only reason i can think of why you might wish to choose objective-c over swift would be if time were of the essence and you were already totally up to speed with objective-c and had no time to learn swift

on the other hand swift is easier to learn especially if you have objective-c background so it can be adopted during the time slowly and paralelly with using objective-c

while objective-c was good at dynamic type inspection swift is much better of you allow the compiler to do the type checking at compile time

java tends to be much more verbose than swift so i doubt what i m asking is too broad it is more likely that i don t know how to use the objective-c messagecomposer object because the documentation that i linked to above is unclear with regard to usage in swift

in swift as objective-c there is far less emphasis on subclassing than other languages

so it should have always been gkagent under objective-c in order to be strictly correct however objective-c is less type-safe than swift so you could get away with it with the possibility that you d get an unrecognized selector exception if a gkagent object was ever passed to the delegate method and you assumed it was a gkagent2d

i have a objective-c application working fine and smooth to be more comfortable with swift i decided to write the unit tests for this app in swift

objective-c -documentary provides more content than the documentary for swift

with swift the code is much more readable than with objective-c

swift is stricter about runtime type correctness than objective-c so duck typing alone is not enough

but swift is less dynamically typed than objective-c and has less support for reflection

also note that i use objective-c more than swift

this article seems to suggest that this is possible by swizzling a fake location into apple s cllocationmanager class to be used by other apps but i am unfamiliar with the objective-c code more familiar with swift

i have tried many things already changing up a few things wrote in swift differently alternatively using a for instead of the built in contains in swift to see if that might be the problem but objective-c was still faster

it is possible for swift to be faster than pure objective-c in things that you would traditionally use c or c++ for anyway

swift won t allow you to do absolutely everything that objective-c does but it will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that swift is more modern language with stronger typing than objective-c

i can work with an objective-c snippet but prefer swift

wouldn t swift be slower than objective-c in this case since it is layered on top of it

the swift compiler is doing a lot more and is quite a bit newer than the objective-c compiler so it unlikely it will be as stable fast for quite some time

however when i switch to swift 4.0 the methods declared in swift is no longer visible in objective-c

you can use mix and match objective-c and swift in your app project

swift s compiler is also doing a lot more than objective-c s compiler considering swift is more strongly typed and does not required specifying imports among other things

you can only select swift or objective-c and to use or not core data

edit although this answer works it is little more than objective-c transliterated into swift

swift comparing to objective-c has it s own benefits like swift handles strings more easily swift tuples offer compound variables and also coders don t need to spend time annotating variables with type information and risk making mistakes

i m writing some swift 1.2 code that calls an objective-c library transcribing some earlier objective-c code

what is the correct way to mix match swift objective-c in code that is shared between multiple targets

in ios regardless of whether the app is being written in objective-c or swift afnetworking makes life easier when writing requests

enumerations in swift 2 are much better then in objective-c

choose cocoa class in the new file sheet and you ll still get the option to create both .h and .m files together as well as the new option to choose objective-c or swift

and of course the objective-c swift bridging header ss-bridging-header.h

bottom line i would personally hesitate to draw any simple conclusions of swift is faster than objective-c or vice versa

usually i find swift s method naming to be cleaner than objective-c s but init methods can be an exception

then the buffers won t need to be treated as arrays of pointers and passing arrays of say floats between objective-c ++ and swift is easier

i would recommend objective-c doing this in because most of these classes are written in objective-c and lots of the methods starting with an _ swift mistakes for ivars and it just gets really messy

adding lightweight generics to your objective-c api makes it easier to interface with swift because your api gets translated more precisely

swift will incur this penalty in fewer situations than objective-c will for instance method calls to swift-only protocol methods do not hit objc_msgsend but if the protocol is declared in objective-c or if the swift protocol is decorated with objective-c such that it can be adopted by objective-c objects as well then method calls to methods in that protocol adopted by swift objects appear to be dispatched via objc_msgsend

the swift designers went through a lot of trouble to make sure that it s more than just objective-c without the constraints of c in fact i almost wish they hadn t said that since it s so often misquoted

as craig revealed within the announcement of swift it is said to be faster than objective-c by far

as you can see the swift example is more complex and error prone than your objective-c code

and also apple does might not confidently announce that swift is more faster than objective-c in all the cases

the swift runtime is smaller than the objective-c runtime

i m learning swift and much less familiar with objective-c but for the life of me i can t figure out how they are trying to achieve the goal stated as build list of encodings sorted and including only those with human readable names.

after reading some related articles i don t think swift is more effective than objective-c

swift is more strictly typed than objective-c

so this comparison is incorrect because it compares objective-c weak with swift unonwed

furthermore swift is stricter than objective-c when it comes to initialisers

to learn more on how to mix and match swift code alongside objective-c i recommend reading apples official documentation

one of the reasons we want to move is because swift is more secure than objective-c

mainly my entire node class needed objective-c property on the variables which the second option match swift 3 behavior did do and my desktop application ran without any crashes

personally i prefer objective-c because you can use c very easily as anything that is legal in c is also legal in objective-c added to which swift is a more procedural in style where objective-c is quite clearly object orientated

i n the long term every objective-c interface ought to be explicitly annotated so that swift can import them more precisely

i would be very interested in seing the solution in objective-c also but swift is more important for me here

i m more familiar with objective-c than swift and haven t had a chance to test this yet but this should be close

as mentioned in the comments although its possible to use objective-c libraries in swift i wanted a more pure swift solution

this guide covers how to use objective-c and c code from swift and vice versa and has recommendations for how to convert a project or mix and match objective-c c and swift parts in an existing project

i m just adding this below in objective-c to make it clearer to beginners and those of us who refuse to learn swift syntax

we ve seen that swift uses a more static method dispatch than objective-c which unless a class dervices from foundation nsobject prevents the style of swizzling based on remapping method implementations at runtime

still technically yes it appears that an all swift solution is roughly 2x slower than a swift + cocoa solution which should be roughly the same than objective-c + cocoa when compiled with equivalent options iirc

in my limited experience using objective-c code from swift is a more common use-case and fairly trivial

as one is supposed to be able to mix and match swift and objective-c in the same project whats wrong with my implementation of this

swift is lot smarter than objective-c about singleton class

as objective-c is the older programming language for ios or macos applications swift allows you to use those classes structs in your code

i don t think that as of today you can run these tests and determine with any certainty whether swift 1.0 is faster or slower than objective-c

however i read that swift was the successor of objective-c and i would feel more comfortable with swift syntax

so in swift just as in objective-c you had better make that delegate property weak because it would be terrible if one view controller suddenly took memory management ownership of another view controller

im new to swift but i like it more than objective-c as it looks a bit like java does to me from syntax wise compared to objective-c

be sure to pick objective-c as language - now it lets you pick either objective-c or swift

i know that swift is buggy as heck i run into bugs everyday but ill bet objective-c was even worse when it started out benefits of hindsight so in a couple of years swift will be equal or greater than objective-c keeping its basic simplicity as well

i feel swift is better than objective-c in many aspects but my major question is - will swift dynamic libraries support older version of swift

i saw this swift vs objective-c and it does lead me to believe that swift is more accurate in terms of timing that objective c but i wanted to make sure that was accurate

select swift as a language only because objective-c seems unpleasant to me

i also use objective-c more than swift but here s what my guess is as to what the objective-c code would come to

download xcode free and learn objective-c or swift swift is easier to learn than objective-c

no objects come magically into existence in swift any more than in objective-c

i use objective-c more than swift

it al has to do with pointers which were very present in objective-c but are much more hidden in swift

compare swift and objective-c in the same project in the

swift is clearer on versions releases and i keep asking myself if i am missing something related to objective-c since i can t find this information

i need to call the objective-c wrapper functions from within the framework -- as best i understand based on documentation on how to mix and match objective-c and swift within a framework target i must import the objective-c header s within my umbrella header to expose the objective-c to the swift code within the framework

note that swift s arrays are much more sensible than objective-c s

some esoteric things you are used to with objective-c are harder to implement with swift

writing swift 2.0 in my professional work my personal opinion is that it s indeed ready for enterprise applications -- maybe even more than objective-c ever were

swift seems to be less dynamic than objective-c in these stuffs

it seems to me that swift would be way simpler to learn then objective-c for beginners i know because i learned it in like 2 months and swift is less complicated and better laid out then objective-c

most importantly for your image processing app the compiler will optimize swift code to run faster than objective-c

but we can assume that generics in objective-c were introduced for transitioning to swift and in that regard using swift directly is even better

any swift corrections are more than welcome i m still an objective-c guy for now

for example exposing the students property in swift means different places can all modify it and the delegate would be notified also it s not clear to the coder that setting students property would trigger a delegate notification for averagescore whereas having a dedicate method in objective-c makes it more clear

injecting code in a swift application is harder than it was for an objective-c application but it s still possible

executable size of swift application is much bigger than size of objective-c application

however i suspect i m having a larger issue with using objective-c interfaces with extensions in a swift project or my understanding of how that works

there are multiple reasons why the swift code is slower than the objective-c code

if you get a difference between swift and objective-c it s more because swift is probably better on optimisation

i prefer swift answers but objective-c is ok too

in case you choose objective-c library here is how to call objective-c code from swift

swift in that case would not be safer but less safe than objective-c

although this is only for ios the main app portion will be built in react-native as i am more familiar with js swift objective-c are very new to me

ps i wouldâ t mind getting an answer in objective-c but i prefer swift

would prefer objective-c but swift is welcome

as you can see defining a singleton class in swift is much easier than in objective-c

while i think the move to swift is prudent but i think it overstates the case to argue that swift is significantly more secure that objective-c

update i also tried swift 4 objective-c inference match swift 3 behavior with the same results

i think you are checking versions of swift if you select objective-c you should see version 10.0+ which i think should work fine for your need

i greatly prefer objective-c to swift thx

fwiw the objective-c compiler also mangles names but swift s mangling is more intricate to allow for method overloading etc

hence based on our experience i will recommend objective-c over swift

i know that swift enums are much more powerful than their objective-c equivalents

for the code dealing with movement of data you might choose objective-c over swift warren moore recommendation

objective-c is much more free and easy with types and compilation checks where swift isn t


suppressfinalize	finalizer	1
calling suppressfinalize on an object implementing a finalizer does nothing more than set a bit in the objects header which the runtime checks when calling finalizer which will suppress your finalizer from running


sticky	affix	1
so instead of playing with the bootstrap affix it was easier to create a custom sticky navigation


uitapgesturerecognizer	uibutton	1
the first thought is that you could build a uiview showing image and text then attach a uitapgesturerecognizer to it which would be more flexible than uibutton


memcpy	memcmp	2
i wonder if there are any optimizations something more efficient than memcmp memcpy maybe just using a for-loop or breaking it down to fast assembly instructions that can be done to this subroutine

also if one of the structures were initialized with the other using memcpy then they will compare equal with memcmp


autocomplete	multi-select	1
i m aware that there are different styles of multi-select widget eg an available list and a selected list vs a single list with select deselect checkboxes vs autocomplete combobox.


draggable	droppable	38
i have a draggable parent element ice cream wrapper which is bigger than the droppable one teeth

p.s this will only work if the draggable is smaller than droppable which is true in this case

it seems like the draggable element including the margin is bigger than the droppable element and therefore the dropped status is set although the element does not seems to touch the upper droppable yet

i was able to remove the unwanted behavior described above by turning the droppable into the parent of the element and added a margin padding that is slightly larger than the draggable snaptolerance

the draggable is covering more than one droppable element and at this point there are multiple event.target.id s being covered

and the size of the draggable div s should be smaller than the droppable div so that they fit in the droppable container

when the ajax call completes and the status code is a 200 you do some minor css tweaks and then disable the ability of the droppable from receiving any more draggable items

when i made dimension of draggable div smaller than droppable div then drop event triggered successfully

in the real case the draggable can become taller than the screen height and the tree control with the droppable is almost the full page height

but it contains what i want draggable stuff with html injected that renders content on an iframe or a div or whatever and that new content is also droppable to insert more stuff inside that code

when the draggable is dragged over the droppable you change it s snapmode option from outer to inner and then when it s dragged out and the droppable is no longer active you change it back

the draggable div is 3 times bigger than one droppable

for draggable set higher z-index than droppable so that draggable will always be visible over droppable

how can i make the droppable to not accept more than one draggable div

this overlap is somewhat forced when the draggable is bigger than the droppable

perhaps you find it strange since the target droppable s size is much smaller than the draggable

append draggable to droppable to make things easier

to know on which droppable the draggable was dropped the higher droppable added a class to the draggable when it was dragged over it

alternatively you could set a width on your draggable which is less than twice the width of your droppable area or combine a set width with one of the above options for a better user experience

the draggable div is greater in height and width than droppable div

but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable

because you have not set a width on your draggable they are much wider than double your droppable width

once a draggable is dropped onto the droppable remove the ability for both the draggable and droppable to be futher dragged and dropped in the drop event

apparently the draggable li element is bigger than the droppable div because the li is block size and the div has a 150px width

it works nicely but from the rich ui perspective it s boring so i was wondering since the draggable image is bigger than the droppable how could i do assuming it s possible to have the droppable container suck the bigger image until if fills its dimensions

grab draggable 1 again and drag it onto the inner droppable of draggable 3

this means that your draggable is the full width of the container which is much wider than the droppable and thus can t possibly intersect by 50

the problem you outlined is that the droppable is allowing more than 1 draggable item to be placed inside of it

as the width of the draggable element is greater than the placeholder i can t get the placeholder to accept the draggable element to be droppable

how can i make the two droppable div s to not accept more than one draggable elements

when the draggable item is larger than the droppable div for some reason it will always place the appointment in the droppable div box that is directly below the one i am targetting

i can make this work if the z-index of the droppable is less than the container but then you can t see where the draggable is since it s hidden behind the container

without draggable seems more like it but then i can t use the droppable

trying to hack draggable droppable is possible but not very easy especially with complex elements if draggable and droppable have more complex html structure than just flat divs

it s just a hunch but maybe it s only a matter of the size of your draggable being too big and being over more than one droppable item

i have a validation on the droppable for not adding more than one draggable per droppable

you likely aren t using appropriate plugin and would do better with droppable and draggable

i want when draggable div dragged into droppable div the droppable div color get another color then draggable div width height get bigger and exactly fit to droppable div


std	ostream	2
and the compiler does the rest about finding an operator overload that matches std ostream days parameters like mike hots says

so if using std ostream is more limiting than std basic_ostream


rsa	aes	33
for encrypting large files i d recommend aes over rsa any day

rsa is much slower than aes

execution of aes is more faster than rsa for same key sizes

like you heard asymmetric cryptography like rsa is much slower than symmetric cryptography aes but it does have it s advantages simpler key management a single private key to protect

the whole purpose of using aes to secure the communication or any symmetric key encryption is that it s a lot faster than rsa or any public key encryption

i want to encrypt decrypt a long file with rsa i know aes is better but this is just for a comparison in openssl libcrypto

that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

but if you use public key encryption to encrypt messages you are a limited to small messages -- a 1024 bit rsa key encrypts less than 128 bytes and b going to pay in performance because public key encryption is much more costly than symmetric key encryption such as aes encryption

you could use rsa but a symmetric algorithm like aes is faster if you can find a way to exchange keys in a secure way

so the 115 seconds will be reduced to 3-4 secs plus the encryption decryption time used for aes which is much faster than rsa

this is one of the caveats of rsa which is why things like aes are better suited for longer streams like files

considering most rsa moduli are at least 1024 bit this will be much larger than an aes key

generally public key algorithms rsa need much larger keys than symmetric key algorithms aes because they rely on different mathematical properties

the aes key is encrypting much more data but is much faster than rsa encryption

there are two reasons for that performance aes is faster then rsa and resources aes is less resource hungry than rsa

it shows that rsa encrypt is faster then aes encrypt

algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

rsa will be slower than a symmetric cypher like rijndael or aes

one of the reasons to do so is that rsa is much slower than for example aes

as far as efficiency rsa is going to be orders of magnitudes slower than aes so the trade-off you make is that you give up simplicity you give up the simplicity of using aes in favor of some rsa chunking in return for poor performance you get the slower performance of rsa.

from what i could gather so far people either recommend aes or rsa for this

note however that doing so means that each encrypted chunk has its own padding and that rsa is much more computationally expensive than aes

asymmetric encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric encryption ex aes

you could for example generate a random aes key encrypt it using rsa and store it in the output file and then encrypt the file itself with aes which is much faster and doesn t have any problem with large inputs

how is aes less secure than rsa in this scenario

if the message you re encrypting is large enough not only will it take more time to process but the rsa encrypted message might be larger than an rsa encrypted aes key plus an aes encrypted message

rsa is not ment for bulk encryption as it s quit slow compared to symmetric algorithms like aes it s more than a factor of 1000 slower

in your particular case an rsa key of 2048 bits has a lot less strenght than an aes key of 256 bits

while 256-bit aes might sound less secure than 4096-bit rsa they might actually be quite similar from the offered protection

and regarding your first question it is definitely possible to encrypt decrypt messages directly using rsa there are only technical and performance reasons aes is much faster than rsa why rsa is used only to encrypt a session key and aes is used to encrypt decrypt the messages themselves

if you want the entire communication to be secure not only sending username password you can use a symmetric cipher algorithm aes because asymmetric cipher algorithms rsa are much slower and consume more resources

asymmetric key encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric key encryption ex aes


kate	kdevelop	1
i m using it on linux so i cannot compare it with visual studio and the like but i do prefer it over kdevelop 3 kate which are my main points of reference


control-structure	break	1
e.g. break with labels as in java or even a more generic goto. continue does not seem more special than other control-structure mechanisms except that it is present in more languages


comparator	comparable	17
this solution is cleaner than implementing comparable by your dto because you can create and use many comparator acording to your needs

we compare objects by comparator your movie class must implement comparable interface in order to compare its objects with one another

if you didn t implement comparable and didn t supply a comparator it is much better to error out than to just silently sort your list in semi-random order

that said using a standard sort with either comparable rows or a comparator is much better than mixing up the sort logic and the comparison logic

comparator does everything that comparable does plus more

it s implements comparable interface so you should be able to compare them with comparator

using comparator instead of putting all the logic directly in the comparable gives you more flexibility in the order that things are compared in

treeset uses comparator defined by comparable or compare defined by comparator

your case sounds like one where creating a comparator would be more appropriate than implementing comparable the latter is specifically for modelling a natural order of instances of the class

very comparable as a string comparator that accepts o and o and ã³ to be equal

both comparable and comparator work for you but i suggest comparator because it doesn t require you modify person class you only need the write an implementation class based on the sorting attribute therefore comparator is much more flexiable

in conceptual sense a comparator is the comparison operator the logic used to determine whether a comparable is greater lesser than another comparable

to compare comparable s strings are comparable just use comparator

using just the keyfn return a comparable value that matches your requirements is much easier than implementing comparator

returns a comparator that compares comparable objects in natural order

a comparator class is better since use of comparable would mean using

you can either choose comparable or comparator for your sorting


debian-based	ubuntu	1
in my experience ubuntu and other debian-based oses are much more trouble-free developer environments for almost everything except c# and .net stuff


rank	max	21
you can select max rank per a_id in the cte and use it to select the corresponding columns

you might replace the max subquery with a rank max is usually slower only when cus_id is the pi rank might be worse

abs acos and asin atan atan2 average choose columns concatenate cos count counta countblank countif date datevalue daverage day dcount dcounta ddb degrees dget dmax dmin dproduct dstdev dstdevp dsum dvar dvarp error.type exact exp fact find fv hlookup hour if index int irr isblank iserr iserror islogical isna isnontext isnumber istext left len ln log log10 lookup lower match max mid min minute mod month n na not now nper npv or pi pmt power product proper pv radians rand rank rate replace rept right round rows second sin sln sqrt stdev stdevp substitute sum sumifs sumproduct syd t tan time timevalue today trim trunc upper value var varp vlookup year false and true

you have to select max rank and self-join to get the associated description

so i want to generate rank for second set of values but starting with value greater than max from first set

if no rank is lower than its number there are no gaps in the table the query returns the max number + 1

due to the select max rank from temp in the answer it takes the max rank from the temp irrespective of the product number and assign the max number as rank for the remaining products

in the case of ties this will take the average rank you can also choose min max or first

normally i d use rank for this and just select rank 1 but that seems pointless when i know i just need the max of a column

select from student where rank select max rank from student or rank select min rank from student

every time a rank finds a larger number than that stored have it send its new max to the root rank

select rank of first second record and highest max rank in table which offhand will probably require a union

or you will be able to select max min rank for any user with aggregation

if your rank is less than 4 it takes 0 instead it s the max part

while i think gbn s answer is probably sufficient i m wondering whether use of an over clause to establish a max date per id attribute with which to reduce the select in a where clause wouldn t be faster than a rank

i would like to return those where column clickedairbnb contains empty values and the max on the column rank is less than 2

i use select max rank from test

you can rank records and then select max value with the rank before percentile cutoff

essentially the query would be select max week from datatable where rank 0

alternatively you could use a select max rank from rankings where memberid

i think you can use rank and then compare it with max value of df1


ogre	irrlicht	4
i have built a few games using various engines in js html5 and even in c++ using irrlicht tried ogre but i prefer irrlicht s simplicity

irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than ogre in my opinion

irrlicht is no way better than ogre 3d or am not trying to prove that

i then exported the recognized camera-parameters and transformed them to fit the matrix s used by the irrlich-engine i also tried ogre but irrlicht seemed nicer to me and then rendered my object with it onto the image


ostream	istream	1
you don t need file streams here just streams so istream and ostream are better choices


emacs	jedit	1
jedit is still pretty good but emacs is quite better


next	except	16
in both cases you may also have to shift one or two elements off the start end of some blocks to the end start of the previous next block again at most o n 1 2 times to maintain an invariant that no two blocks differ in size by more than 1 except for the last which is used to take up slack

the next example does more or less the same except from an oop perspective

from the mozilla perspective the purpose of these changes except for adding more capabilities for use by web developers is to lead up to javascript 2.0 that is being developed as the next revision of ecma 262 revision 4 tc39 workgroup

it works except for in the case of the next number being greater than the current one

you d use a similar pattern for ignoring all lines after a given line match except you wouldn t have to process any more lines so instead of using next you d use last

the next solution is faster than using in and except clauses

for such numbers as 54321 the else statement will be executed never because any next digit is greater than max1 except the first two digits

moving iterator from one element to the next is an o c operation both in the list and in the multi map except c is slightly smaller for the list so it is unlikely you ll gain much by combining the two

for me they serve pretty same purpose to hide complexity except accordion is imho better for continuous-reading it s easier to quickly go to next section while tabs seems to be more random-access

now nothing matches except for the default rule so the next three characters get matched one at a time against it

it looks almost ok except i can t make the a1 cell to align right next to a2 on wider screens

once i did that all went well except for being slower than molasses which begins my next adventure

for music like what i am using it for the synchronisation didn t really matter except that it s nice having the next song come on sooner than later when changing tracks

now i would like to take the ceiling of this number except in cases where the amount it is greater than the next lower integer is smaller than some epsilon

it compares every item except the last - it will be checked by the second last item and checks whether the next item is smaller

not totally sure what you want to do but using a while checking if the user input is equal to next and if not trying to cast to int using a try except is a better idea


fgets	strtol	7
also your get_int would be better written with fgets or getline if available and strtol

in general i find it better to use fgets alternatively if you are using c99 gets_s -- although i still prefer fgets for maximum portability to older compiler environments for all user-based input then if necessary use sscanf strtol and the like to convert the string into other data types as this will read data by line in a way that is buffer-safe and you won t have to worry about things left in the input buffer

using fgets strtol offers better error handling than sscanf

this way the option_1 will be initialized and reading it would no longer cause undefined behavior but checking the return value of scanf allows the program to validate user input altough recovering from it is really difficult and i would recommend fgets + strtol instead the same functionality but a lot easier to recover from bad input

rather than read a text file using fscanf strongly recommend using fgets and then parsing via sscanf strtok strtol etc

if you want to guarantee that people can t mess up the input like that i would recommend using strtol and strtod in conjunction with fgets instead

in general i find it better to use fgets than scanf getchar alternatively if you are using c99 gets_s -- although i still prefer fgets for maximum portability to older compiler environments for all user-based input then if necessary use sscanf strtol and the like to convert the string into other data types as this will read data by line in a way that is buffer-safe and you won t have to worry about things left in the input buffer


onenote	ms-office	1
if you would like to see onenote add-ins supported on more platforms i strongly suggest adding this to the ms-office uservoice


multiplying	addition	13
we don t actually multiplying it s slower than simple addition and as you can see we destroy temporary register t0 but don t touch s0 s1

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

if multiplying is slower than addition then case 2 is slightly slower than case 1

you didn t provide a full code sample that includes the surrounding loop presumably there is a surrounding loop so it is hard to answer definitively but the main problem i see is that the latency of the dependency chains of your fma code is considerably longer than your multiplying + addition code

since you want to do same thing couple times writing your multiplication num1 num2 function yourself with only addition and using that when multiplying would be much better choice

the boilerplate code would multiplying rapidly when the express get more complex than addition of two terms

so the compiler can t make the optimization because it can t tell if you wanted the exact behavior where multiplying is better or the implemented behavior where the scale of sum affects the result of the addition

functionally a multiplying will always take more time than an add because it combines a true multiplying along with a true addition step

you can try x1 c1 and then x1 + c1 but i don t think the addition is much faster than multiplying on todays cpus

however multiplying is a more complex operation than addition or shifting

so we must show that a gradeschool multiplying circuit is o log n times deeper than an addition circuit

in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

for instance to achieve addition you would scale the larger value to have the same exponent as the smaller one by multiplying it by 10 largerexp-smallerexp then adding the two values and rescaling


daemons	systemd	9
modern unix-based systemd have better timers clock_gettime than gettimeofday that are not subject to changes made by the network time protocol daemons

your daemons could use memory_get_usage and call out out free uptime and friends to throttle the number of workers to match systemd conditions

error response from daemons cannot start container d13b8aa28d383a3ca54b39ce74f5a81d80030a2ad0dde52966293ced9ef26663 8 systemd error exec mesos-master executable file not found in path

as a new newbie programmer i find that making daemons over systemd is much easier than over init.d

if you can t get it to work try get your daemons to provide more verbose logging about why it s not starting or resort to adding usr bin strace to the beginning of your line to get detailed logging of the systemd calls that the binary is making during startup

on my systemd i have more than one web daemons running one of them is apache which is listening on ports 80 and 443

so me and a friend are coding a small systemd monitor learn better fun the code has 2 sections the daemons and the command line interface for now when i compile the cli section all went great the daemons is particular one because when i compile and i execute it in the compile directory it works without error

use daemons mode and then simply touching the wsgi script file when an atomic set of changes have been completed isn t that hard and certainly safer than a systemd which restarts arbitrarily when it detects any single change

in my case i have the daemons doing more than 1 thing so it s very helpful to have systemd keep track of all the timers for me so that i can effectively poll stream_select for the xmpp connection


didreceivememorywarning	dealloc	1
remove dealloc reference in didreceivememorywarning will be better


int	double	474
double is better than int though as it will help you keep precision

i think that you are trying to compare double and int

an int can be widened to a float and a double but a float 4 bytes is smaller than a double 8 bytes so java will choose to call m float

the most urgent one that comes to mind is that a double is wider than an int on your platform and garbage memory is read

and the second calculation 33 5.0 the result is actually promoted to double which has greater precision than int and resulted to decimal

so overloadedsingleparam double a is less specific than void overloadedsingleparam int a when an int value is passed as argument

on a 32-bit machine doing addition and comparison on 64-bit int types takes more instructions than doing the equivalent on double s

so no arguments after the 1st one get automatically converted except as defined by default argument conversions basically any int type with a rank lower than int to int and any floating-point type with a rank lower than double to double thank you pascal cuoq

on a modern cpu if you restrict your int values to the range +- 2 52 then using a double will be barely less efficient than using a long

you might also want to compare double arithmetic to int arithmetic on your target machine

in the c standard and therefore in the abi implemented on intel platforms all values of integral types smaller than int chars shorts are passed to variadic functions as int on the stack and all float values are passed as double

actually when you are trying to compare any numeric value to chars value its not giving you any compile time or run time error because chars is actually represent int16 or 16-bit int value so when you try to compare double int or long with it it will simple compare its ascii value of that chars with it

so i asked myself can a double be faster than a int

you can also use math.floor double to get the closest int that is less than the double

because a double which f expects probably is larger than an int on your platform

it s that or generated code be it the fact that you can fit less 64-bit int in a sse register or round a double to a 64-bit int is slower

if so is there some correlation such as 40 digit double int is 50 more efficient as a uid than using 20 chars string

it is not exact on rare platforms where the range of int is wider than the range of a double s exactly representable whole numbers

you compare int double float long and boolean with

i think the problem is this value is bigger than an int or a double

i figured out this was happening because i was storing the wall coordinates in double and although double are certainly more accurate than int they still aren t exact

double can in a way be seen as a more general type than int

as soon as the int needs more than 29 bits the atom is changed by the vm into a number type which is really represented as a 29 bit pointer to the actual 64 bit double precision float

note that the double is much trickier than the int s

decimal is 128 bits and int64 is 64 bits and perform much slower than float double int

the range of representable int is restricted to about + -2 10 9 double can hold much larger int exactly.

there is a proposed fix described here but it will not work at least because it applies the int abs function to the double parameter number which will only work if the int part is less than the even more restrictive max_int

note that types bigger than double and int are not converted such as long int long double long long etc

since every possible byte short chars int float double can be represented as a double its is much more efficient as its a primitive instead of any object and simpler to use double instead of number you would need specific types if you need long accurately or bigdecimal or biginteger

int multiplications however are only 1.5 times faster than double multiplications

is simply a hard error because f int is a better match than f double even though the f int overload causes a hard error further on

how comes the operator after beiing overloaded like this can still be used to compare int floats double etc

most likely in this case the exercise wants you to compare int with double

math.random returns double values between 0.0 and 1.0 so even when you are multiplying it with kids.size if size is 1000 there is a great possibility that the multiplication result is still less than 1 and so converting to int would return 0

note if all you want is just a result with one decimal the solution you choose is pretty heavy handed calculations on double are slower than those on int and double math has its own challenges - just look around here on so

most commonly it will be exactly 8 bytes more generally sizeof int or sizeof double whichever is larger but compilers are permitted to add unnamed padding to structs and unions

second the reason to prefer int or decimal arithmetic to double arithmetic is that a double can only represent with perfect accuracy a fractions whose denominator is a power of two

typically an int will use less memory than a double that is why one doesn t just use the largest possible datatype

public int compare double c1 double c2

when you load the double and int values into the array they lose identity as double or ints--they are autoboxed and stored as instances of the abstract number class

what you see when you output x and probably some garbage data because a double may be longer in memory than an int interpreted as a double

sometimes you may want to specifically store a vector as int if you know that they will never be converted to double used as id values or indexing since int require less storage space

converting a well-distributed random number from int to float double is harder than it looks

when you compare a double to a 64-bit int however there will be potential roundoff error if the int is greater than 2 52

i would also recommend that you use double for both the array and any place where you have an int to have a more precise value

i don t understand how an int 63823 takes up less space than a double 1.0

you could try in this way get the int value of the double subtract this from the original double value define a rounding range and tests if the absolute number of the new double value without the int part is larger or smaller than your defined range

in your ghci session different types work but in your main program int doesn t work so it chooses double for both

you can use this to compare double with float and or int

byte takes less memory than double and int and provides better performance than bigger datatypes especially better than double

while both double comparisons and hashes are more expensive than int s the number of comparisons is theta n log n while the number of hashes is o n

the largest double value is also larger than the largest int so it would have to be a long

when the result of math.pow i j a double is larger than integer.max_value and you cast to an int then the result is integer.max_value

other than int and double taking up more storage

i suppose i could do this cleaner with int and or double using instead of like

if you tell it the top of the stack has a double and double is bigger than int you ve now just told it to take extra bytes off of the stack which is terrible

iirc for things with a num constraint it picks int for fractions it picks double and for everything else it picks

you re getting the outofmemory because if you declare int 1000 the memory is allocated immediately additionally double take up more space than ints-an int representation will also save you space

now how can we predict in advance if there are more than one int whose logarithm is 123456.78 up to the precision of system.double or if there is in fact no int whose logarithm hits that specific double the precise result of an ideal pow function being an irrational number

passing an int is easy to imagine passing a double is just bigger and passing a struct or class could be very big indeed

the problem is that i need to draw some simple objects points lines especially rectangles with double float decimal precision it doesn t matter with more precision than an int on a windows form i m using visual studio but i can t find anything

datetime values don t have formats any more than int or double values do

furthermore the representation of type double is probably larger than that of type int in your system 8-byte double s and 4-byte int s are common

looks like you ll need to use int or double whichever makes more sense for your data are you using whole or floating-point numbers

by contrast void doitagain int is more specific than void doitagain double because int is a subtype of double according the the jls

if one of the operands is a double the result of the multiplication would be a double which allows for a much larger range than an int

first of all you cannot cast it into a double without allocating more space matrix since a double is 8 bytes in memory while an int is 4 bytes

it seems to be that double is much more flexible than int

this shouldn t come as any surprise - there are more long values than double given the nan values and plenty of double aren t int so we can t expect every long to be exactly representable

if you are not storing infinity nowhere and use it just for comparison you can use double infinity which is larger than int and long max value

i don t understand why since int 8 16 32 64 and float and double all are real why does it say it can t match int with c

why does f double is a better match than f long int 0 for f long

also bear in mind that the cases in which int or decimal floating point types are used typically don t need to concept of infinity or not a number results - whereas in scientific applications where float double are more typically useful infinity or at least a number which is too large to sensibly represent is still a potentially valid result

never use to compare int objects or float double short chars byte long bigdecimal... for equality

you should be using math.ceiling which will return the smallest int value that is greater than the double passed in

i should point out previously in the code the double is less than 1 i.e 0.987 and is then multiplied by the number of decimal places to make it a real positive int though it s stored as a double still at that point

why did you choose double and not an int datatype

i know that there s another way to check if a double number is bigger than maximum int value but i m curious as why it s happening this way

firstly do not attempt to compare double s or to compare float s or to compare double s to float s exception comparing against 0 is ok and arguably all int

using the first method you change the way the program stores your data you choose int or double double precision floating point number

and it shouldnt be too surprising that copying a double 3 strings and an int takes more time than copying a single double

if they are double it takes much longer until w w 2 is 0 than with int

however the conversion from int to float is better than the conversion from int to double according to section 7.5.3.2-7.5.3.5

and then cast it to an int but obviously double can represent far more values than int so be careful about that

biggest int that can be stored in a double this makes exponentiation easier use the pow method

your nummines calculation will always return 0 because when you cast a double that is less than 1 to an int it will be set to 0 which means that the statement in your while loop will only be run a single time hence only a single mine being placed

it works for primitive types like int or double but with object types like string or int things get more complicated

int would take up less space than a double

on many systems int is smaller than double so if that s the case on yours this is very likely to be the cause of your crash

an implicit conversion from byte to int is indeed more specific than an implicit conversion from byte to double according to widening primitive conversions rules

you need to use 2 even if the number of bits in your int type is larger than the precision of a double since the number of used bits in the most significant value might only be 1

double is much bigger than int

converting it in php between int and double will be slower than storing double in the database

generally a number has an exact representation if it equals a 2 b where a and b are int whose allowed values are set by the language specification and double has more allowed values

you used the double to calculate an int result the double is more precise than the int so you lost precision

the problem with your case is that you have two calls to isdigit with two different arguments which might confuse the compiler when it creates the implicit declaration of the function and it probably selects int isdigit double to be on the safe side

however if you have large enough number the limit checking does not work because 64bit double precision has less bits usually 54 but this is not defined in standard for the fractions part than a 64bit int

1 int range is much smaller than double and for pow 2 100 that fails

the widths are positive int not wider than the double significand 53 bits

incrementing the value might be a special case but it s possible that on your machine incrementing double is slower than incrementing int

also after the first coercion from a side effect of a benchmark as noted above r will operate on double s and that contains slower manipulations than on int s

maybe you want some keys to match up with int and some keys to match up with double

but if the int part is larger than the maximum 64-bit int it s not that simple and you need to convert biginteger to float double which hardware doesn t support

if a value in the double array is less than the int value at the same position of the two dimensional array then in that part of the boolean array the value would is true

you really might need to up cast everything into a double and then check to see if the result is greater than or less than an int

if your int consume less than 52 bits then it should be convertible without problem to ieee 754 double

in this since division has greater precedence than subtraction therefore x 10 will execute first and here we are dividing two int irrespective of the fact that the variable where final answer is stored is a double so answer will be an int i.e 5 10 0 and then subtraction of an int and double will be done here int will be promoted to a double

afaik there s no standardized way to get fixed-width floating point types as of now - i think because unlike int types float and double are more or less everywhere the same 32 bit float 64 bit double with separate types for strange fp types

double is much slower than int

you can t compare int and double

about the inexactness problem you should be aware that double can be more inexact than int

if you need to compare double i suggest that you use the double.compare double d1 double d2 method and if you need to compare int then use the integer.compare int i1 int i2 method

surely a long long would be superior since it can store bigger int than a double can without loss of precision in the same space and helps readability by conveying at declaration time that the variable is an int

i don t know for sure but i assume that int longs and double are given more space because they are pretty large as it is

any type smaller than int so chars or short is promoted to int and float is promoted to double simplifying slightly

int types shorter than int short and chars in their various forms are promoted to int and float values are promoted to double

using string int double etc is more expected and therefore more maintainable

int and string are really quite different certainly more different than int and double

you can convert your object into double and then into int but you should take care as double value is much bigger than int

even dividing int is slower than multiplying floats or double in some cases

you ll want to use a different type instead of int i d recommend double in your case

double is a different data type and generally much slower than int

as far as i m aware so long as the spacing between two double is less than 2 then int values stored as double should be exact - and though 10 14 is pushing it this should be an exact int since 10 14 2 46.507 2 53

this conversion is legal because double are wider than int

converting between double and int might be faster or slower for you

the largest int that can be stored reliably in double is much smaller than dbl_max

the versions using diff are especially impacted ave_diff with int constants is about 2.5 times faster than the double contants version

this can t help performance either since pow double int is significantly faster than pow double double in general

in general casting from long to int is simpler than from double to int

the c standard that defines difftime choose double and that accommodates an int accumulation of seconds as well as other os implementations

also in the earlier days of computing floating-point formats and sizes were generally far less standardized ieee 754 didn t come around until 1985 which is why float s and double s are even less well-defined than the int data types

the math.round double a method returns a long which is a larger type than int

then float as float has less precision than double but more than long or int

indeed fact is limited by the range of type unsigned int which is much less than the precision of type long double

i believe the following works as a sort comparison function for positive int provided the int type used is substantially narrower than the double type 32-bit int and 64-bit double and the log10 routine used returns exactly correct results for exact powers of 10 which a good implementation does

similarly when i cast a double that is less than the minimum possible int i also get -2147483648

extract generically returns double precision int seems more appropriate for the number of days so cast to int int and use int for the out parameter

matlab favors double over int operations

anything smaller than an int such as chars is first converted to an int and float is converted to double

it will probably take either about 1 second on a particular implementation floats may be somewhat faster as fast or somewhat slower than double or forever depending whether or not float can exactly represent all int values from 0 to 1e8 inclusive

the log base 2 of the first value that fails 38508450670424585 is about 55 but a double has only 53 bits of precision so an int that is larger than 2 53 can t necessarily be represented exactly

if a 64-bit long is written as an int and is greater than 2 53 ieee double has a 52-bit mantissa then reading it as a double will lose precision

in the third case double precision loss is much smaller than the int and you get something like

reading and writing raw arrays of int and double will be faster than converting to and from text but then you need to worry about byte ordering differences in sizes for different platforms compilers structure padding etc

double can hold more precision than int

assert.areequals is overloaded to compare int double object etc

can be false when int range is wider than double uncommon and dx is a rounded value whose next higher representable value to 2 greater

this prints derived.foo double - even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type int and the argument is type int and the conversion from int to int is better than the conversion from int to double the fact that only the foo double method is originally declared in derived means the compiler ignores foo int

it doesn t matter if second member would be int short or whatever - as long as it is smaller than double sizeof struct will be 16

if you need support for point values just choose double or single instead of int

put simply a primitive that can be widened to another primitive int - float - double is more specific than another

a double is a more precise type than an int in a general manner of speaking

the command if compares double quoted strings always with including the double quotes as strings and never runs an int comparison on using double quotes on any side

the results would be buy int double

you need to make sure that still fits to int or use bigger type and when you compare output correctanswer you still need to handle double properly

please note this is not the best version of this program eg. what if the user doesn t pass an argument or doesn t pass a number as an argument or passes a number larger than an int or passes a number that is a float or double instead of an int

the problem is that the precision of the data type int is smaller as the precision of double the function pow returns double therefore the value of binarychar i will be implizit converted to double and so on.

this imply that result of pow x y converted to int will be truncated because of double arithmetic and exponentiation that will return double value slightly smaller than int

on my machine the double swap loop completes 11 times faster than the int swap loop

1 if your data are int or some data form that takes less space than a double float

the compiler will stop right at the first clause complaining correctly that int doesn t match double

int arguments narrower than int are promoted to int or to unsigned int if the type is unsigned and its maximum value exceeds int_max and arguments of type float are promoted to double

if you use int between -128 and 127 you will get much better results than double from -128 to 127 because the former uses caches values the later does not

double s have more bytes and check against int values

32-bit platforms have a greater disparity between double and int

i already found a similar question with answer best way to compare double and int but a and b could be any type of number or something else than numbers

if you assign an int to a double there s no loss of precision because double is wider

i would recommend using int type keys long long for the map in first place and trim them for double representation using a fixed precision for division

this causes a referencing to a memory area that was not completely initialized with value passed as parameter to the printf because double size memory buffer area is greater than int size

if you want to being able to compare double float int int and chars then use ord

clearly calling int x on a double is asking for trouble since double can store bigger numbers than int

a double is also probably bigger than an int

i m using a simple regex to match int float double value in a string

field length create your fields as large as you ll need them but don t go over - for instance if you have a number field and the value will never be over 1000 for the sake of argument then don t type it as a long int something smaller like int would be more appropriate or use a single instead of a double for decimal numbers etc

bear in mind that if the double returned is larger or smaller than that which can be held in an int then the program behaviour is undefined

at least it is not fair to compare int dword 4 bytes and double qword 8 bytes on 32-bit system

btw do you really want to compare double with int

the int part is less than 2 and the double part is less than 3

a normal 3 will be treated as int but in the test function you are retrieving double which are bigger than an int on most platforms and you might end up reading wrong locations which inturn leads to exc_bad_access run time signal being generated

this is because joins on int types are faster than on double types foverlaps performs binary joins internally

if common though different sizes for int are more common than for short double that gives us

however since you are converting temperatures from celsius to fahrenheit it is better to use double or float values instead of int to yield more accurate and meaningful output

as double can represent more values that int you get the problem indicated

as for the last question floating point arithmetic particularly double precision is much more complex than int arithmetic so on a reasonably modern pipelined processor each instruction will take longer to execute

int will be converted into double when we compare int with double

int are probably faster then double but may not be big enough for actual math

also you can t compare double int with strings in your for-loop

a double will move farther then an int so you will get more interations with an int pointer anyway

a double has a range that can be greater than any int type

i understand that the compiler isn t happy because a double might be larger than an int can hold but this particular control is guaranteed to be a value from 1 to 10 so i know that it will be okay

maybe division between double and int is faster than it between double

any type smaller than an int is promoted to int and floats are promoted to double

because 1.0 has type double and compiler really doesn t know what type to choose between int and float so it asks you to give it a hint

note atof and similar functions don t detect overflows and return zero on error so there s no way to know if it failed not sure if it sets errno see also keith s comments about undefined behaviour for certain values so the point is you should use strtol for converting from strings to int and strtod for converting to double those have much better error handling

also i recommend using double rather than int

by the time you get outside the range of long all double values are int and separated by more than 1

for example when developing geometric engine for a well-conntrolled range of scales would you prefer int coordinates in the smallest feasible units or float double coordinates

that means if you pass an int type smaller than int it ll be promoted to int before being passed and if you pass a float it ll be promoted to double

double are harder and usually converted into two int the values depend on accuracy requirements

but assigning float or double values to int variables is not always good idea because int has smaller range

from this other question they talk about how bjarne stroustrup said that just as integral data-types narrower than an int short are promoted to an int float s are promoted to a double

concerning your original question if your int values are smaller than 2 51 then they fit exactly in double with 53 bit mantissa so one simple option is to cast them to double as in

another reason is that the range of double is far greater than that of int

and because it can not compare int and double it generates type mismatch

since double has more mantissa bits than int can have significant bits comparisions between double and int are precise in that regard

also int are more appropriate than double numerics for this case of logical coercion

if you need to parse very large numbers larger than int double and don t need the exact value then a simple regex based method might be sufficient

now i would like to be able to use + and - with numbers too double or int to write more simply

how would i implements this or change it so i can compare double int

int takes less space than double on ram

this is java detecting what you are doing and thinking it may be a mistake on your part - int s are less specific than double s

this may help in case you have a real nth root precision problem but my experiance is that the builtin math.pow double int is more precise

the tablemodel column visibility boolean and column width int or double had better be somewhere in your model

in fact it is incorrect to compare float with double of long with int etc

in addition it could be an endless loop because you compare int and double

if int is not possible but double is pick double

add documentfilter to jformattedtextfield and determine if int double value is less than 0 and more than 255

casting to int should be fine so long as it s within the appropriate range - but be aware that a double can t represent all 64 bit int exactly so you may also end up with errors when you go beyond the point at which the accuracy of double is such that the difference between two consecutive double is greater than 1

if you are using int values using a double may be a better choice and have less rounding error

that wouldn t work on platforms where a double is less than 64 bits but it would work on many platforms without 64-bit int

consequently it is deemed to be a function that returns an int and its arguments are subject to default promotions â float is converted to double and any int type shorter than int so short and chars are promoted to int

b takes a double and casts it to an int which is more like a conversion than a coercion

another option would be to add a cast not recommended due to the same loss of information the error warns you about - the fractional part will simply be removed from the value and double can hold way larger and smaller values than int

if both int can be exactly represented by the floating point format for double they are less than 2 53 then yes you will get the exact value

it always chooses floating-point over int calculation if a floating-point value like a double is involved

the ratio should be a double not an int since double s have more precision they can be decimals.

faster than inplace_add after compilation with gcc -ofast and directly writing a c function taking a int double double is more or less as fast as addlocal with or without #openmp simd

i d guess that when calling mymethod 5 5 could be a double or an int as well and double has higher priority

and since float is typically promoted to double with varargs calls if your int is smaller than your double this will break

if your numbers are larger than int long or double

what i need to do it iterate over a list find the first int which is greater than 3 and is even then just double it and return it

this way you can ensure that you don t lose int precision by just parsing a double double have a different range of possible values than int and you can handle the cases where neither a valid int or double was entered

extra arguments to variatic functions with types smaller than int are promoted to int and passed as such and floating point types smaller than double are promoted to double and passed as such

in vararg functions such as printf int smaller than int are promoted to int and floats smaller than double are promoted to double

don t forget that the range of int is much smaller than the range of double

i made the array double as that s what is in the question but it seems int would be more appropriate

personally i prefer int string double etc

in contrast accessing the bits of a double as an int is usually in-practice safe even though it s formally ub because 1 an int is typically smaller or equal in size to double and 2 an int usually does not have any invalid bit patterns

i d recommend int if that number does not contain a decimal point float or double if it does

please be aware of double long have far higher range then int which might be enough in your case to avoid an array

when the unities of the int part of the double are bigger than five round does what i expect but it doesn t for unities 5

note that i want to include the possibility of comparing two different types of triples since someone might want to compare int with double for instance

with gcc 4.9 it prints error because the second overload isn t discarded and int is a better match than double

i thought when i pass 1 as the argument java would have picked the first argument because int is more specific than double

the float class knows how to compare itself with int bignums double etc etc

you will get 24 if pow 10 2 returns a double that is little less than 100 99.9999999998765 which when cast to int would be truncated resulting in 99 and thus you get

so if you input large values for j and i you end up with the double that are passed through at getvalue double x double y being larger than the maximum size of int at that point when you call

but he then casts a long into a double so b is violated as a 64-bit int is obviously bigger than a 32-bit type

edit actually my solution does not work because double can be very big much bigger than int and also very small like fractions

the int portions of the logarithms of 31 and 310 use different numbers of bits so there are different numbers of bits left for the significand so they end up being rounded to slightly different values. as long as the int type is substantially narrower than the double type the calculated limit will be much larger than the error in log10

so it s not specified which instance of tostring we should be using and note that you ll get different observable behaviour with your existing instances based on whether you choose int or double

however one must then remember that default type promotions will then take place float are promoted to double and all int types smaller than int are promoted to int or unsigned int

this is the reason for which if you use printf to print floats you don t need to say lf int the format strings and f is enough lf is needed for scanf however because that function stores a result and a float can be smaller than a double

three fields a string for name of the purchase int for units purchased and a double for cost per unit

given an int value above this threshold the next possible double will be more than 1 greater than the previous number

you are assigning a double value to a int value that is the reason since double can store larger values and have decimal part it could lead to lose of data .

yes it is absolutely valid compare int datatype and double datatype

int subtractions are 2.5 times faster than double subtractions on my machine

a solution using int only calculations should be quicker than float double calculations is

if you need only integrals - use int if you need more precision use non-integrals double takes more space in memory and since you don t have any specific requirements concerning precision float seems to be the most reasonable choice

to store a 12-digit int you need to use either a long long up to 18 digits or perhaps a double up to 15-16 digits though a double is less desirable

all arguments but the first to printf are part of a variable argument list which is a bit complicated but basically means that all types smaller than int are converted to int float is converted to double and all other types are left unchanged

this one s an overflow but i think it illustrates the unreliability of isnumeric in general especially for int - for double it s much more reliable

also given that double has a wider range what would one return for those out of range int values

further the precision of double may be less than int introducing other problems

when you introduce void dosmth int obj there are three candidates - object double and int - but since neither double nor int is more specific than the other - the compiler can t choose between then and you get an error

this implies that at the least the type signature of this function in the documentation is wrong as it accepts more than just double and int

the double has a bigger mantissa the int bits of the real number

i need to match int and double

imho int looks better than double in your task

num is a of type const int which is of lower rank when compared to the type of z which is double

for example if you compare double and int values

the parameters will not match int vs double so you ll get undefined behavior

this behaviour is due to the fact that int is more specific than double while there is no such comparison between int and boolean

2 unless you have a strong reason to use int it is more idiomatic to use double for spreadsheet values

and there is no need of double use int which is more than enough and restrict to 4 digits which is according to specification 1900 or 2016 - not more than 4 digits

the assertthat signature is different in hamcrest using which allows matchers to be super types like matcher to compare int and double

with it is nub on and comparing big int is slower than comparing double

above 2 53 the double are spaced more widely than the int

secondly why would someone choose bytes over double or int

if you want to match double or int values separated by

if we use float data type in java we have to add f at the end of floating point literal as java assumes it to be double data type and gives an error why not do the same for short and byte as both have lower ranges than int

a double is 1 typically larger than an int and 2 has some internal structure

you are doing linear programming on int which is more troublesome than with reals double

please note that you would not want to use an intermediate cast to int as int supports a narrower numeric range than int that are exactly representable by a double

the undefined behaviour as identified in other answers is explained on my intel platform with vc as that the f format specifier expects a double on the stack which is larger than an int so when it retrieves the value it retrieves more bytes than of an int and now assumes the next parameter at a diferent position on the stack causing z to be printed wrong it is not z that is printed

if such a hardware unit is present floats double can be faster than int unless there is also hardware int support

so in your smartadder interface the method with signature add double a double b does not override the method add int a int b of your adder interface because double is wider than int

today i noticed that when i cast a double that is greater than the maximum possible int to an int i get -2147483648

to put it simply since int are a simpler form of double we will use the more complete type of both

when you get up into huge numbers the double are spaced more widely than int

either use int or see this answer or similar on how to compare double values in java

i m writing a c# class to perform 2d separable convolution using int to obtain better performance than double counterpart

it should be always string if its int value is greater than 2 32 unsigned simply cast by string uid is not work and sprintf .0f ... will only works when int value less than 2 52 because on 32-bit os when a number is greater than 2 31 32 unsigned php will assume it is double type and default precise is only 14 decimal but fbid is 20

in case of primitives memory comes into play.if you are going to store double into int as in your example double takes more memory as compare to integer.so there is chance of data lose.so compiler throw error.if you cast yourself then you know what you are doing so compiler let that do

for doing this the int value of the constant is implicitly converted by the compiler to a double value using more or less customary mathematical rules and this value is assigned to the variable

in summary i guess the first sentence of the answer was a little misleading - you don t need the double to be spaced more widely than the int for this effect to occur

now if i choose a double as a type of primary key then it will store unnecessary 6 bytes since double is 8 bytes and int is 2 to only support two double numbers and i can t choose int

simpler with no double and no division but be careful of int overflow

you can compare chars byte short int long double and float with without any issues

for historical reasons and to make the compiler s job easier any corresponding arguments of types narrower than int are promoted to int or to unsigned int and any arguments of type float are promoted to double

because we like to be professional and also the byte uses less memory than int and double can include decimal places

note that when float values are passed to printf they are automatically converted to double just as numeric types shorter than int are promoted to int

the problem is that a positive double very slightly less than an int casts to the next int down but rounds to the closest int

you could try using double which is bigger than a long and use only the int part

for historical reasons you can not pass an int argument of smaller rank than int or a floating type of smaller rank than double to a variadic function

is it normal for a cast from int to double to be much more expensive that a cache miss let alone a floating point multiply

if you are just using the double as a loop variable and only incrementing it in int steps and you are not counting above 4 503 599 627 370 496 then you are fine to use a double and to use to compare double

in general maths that naturally fits as an int will be faster than maths that naturally fits as a double but trying to force double maths to work as an int is almost always slower moving back and forth between the two costs more than the speed boost you get

i want to know why int double etc have 1 more negative value than positive value

if you want the modulus use as it gives an int and would be more efficient than double arithmetic

these conversions promote float to double and anything smaller than int to int or unsigned int

a double has a higher maximum and presumably lower minimum than an int so there s no conversion necessary so you shouldn t experience any side effects of assigning a double an int so there s no need for an error

the reason is simple double has different handling than new - mql4.56789 float the more than int et al

i guess the question is then why does the compiler choose int instead of double in the first example

using and at the same time to check equality on a int results in slower code because it takes two comparisons instead of one taking the double amount of time

int can hold a smaller range than double

you don t usually get such errors because there is a defaulting mechanism for polymorphic numbers that in ambiguous cases picks whichever of int or double is more appropriate see the haskell report for details

on some real-world architectures double has stricter alignment requirements than int

the method uses the fact than null is lower than numbers int double long in the comparison order of bson types values

will match int or digits before dot in double

the conditional operator can only have one type so it follows the rules in the jls and picks double as int is implicitly convertible to double but not vice versa

the difference is that int are still faster than double because it takes very few clock cycles to do arithmetic operations on int

double has range more than a 64-bit int but its precision is less dues to its representation since double is 64-bit as well it can t fit more actual values

to compare int with double you have to implicitly or explicitly convert one of the two operands

you could check if the value in question is a type you know you can compare int string double etc

this will work as long as the double is not bigger than what can fit in an int

in addition to having different semantics from double int arithmetic is generally faster and the smaller size 32 bits vs

my linq query return type would be more adequat with ienumerable int it works when i do this but i was wondering if i could mix in the same array list queries that would have handle strings double or whatsoever.

your upccode int is larger than the long data type so i tried it with double which is a float but works

for very simple objects int strings floats double which are represented more or less as simple c-language types you can simply calculate the number of bytes as with john mulder s solution

we could check that void mymethod int i is more specific than void mymethod double a if any invocation handled by the first method can be passed on to the other one without a compile-time type error

the range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit int which is why std floor returns a double

except that double is much better than int for storing the join_angle in radians

i wanted to check if a double value is bigger than maximum int value but because converting function does not return an optional value i am not be able to check by using optional binding

with float x the conversion is commonly inexact on many platforms over the range of int as float has not more range than double and is commonly narrower

you don t need an explicit cast going from int to double because double is wider

for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

i am guessing this is because modifying a double is a more complex operation than modifying an int

after some point consecutive double are more than an int apart and conventional rounding won t be able to smooth out the difference

so pass an int and a floating point number double is a higher precision floating point number

the things might go more complicated if the int s are long s or the double is float since there are long values that cannot be represented by double s so loss of accuracy might happen for large double values in this case and in any case - large double values are less accurate

to prevent the code from overflowing the int value space you should could change the type of res to double long anything that can hold higher values than int

double s length is way more than int that s why you should be checking int first

i have read a great deal of commentary on why int and double are less precise than decimals but the short answer is to use decimals

note how i cast the result to int which is better suited for years than the double precision returned by extract

change your local-variables from int to decimal - when working with currency values always prefer decimal over double because simple values like 0.1 cannot be accurately represented

int are slightly faster but you d have to be microbenchmarking to notice. there s a small percentage difference between int and long and float and double but basically if you can afford one you can probably afford the other

since double is greater that int and long int and long will be turned into double in double long and int double

this becomes cumbersome with a nested vector since you can only send more than one int double etc

if you want to parse double value to int then add one more line

one of long long and double is bigger than 3 int and a multiple of 8

you could try to add some value to the double to make sure it s bigger or smaller than an int can be

the conversion from int to int is more specific than the conversion from int to double so your second overload wins in both cases

use int or in this case where the int were larger than 2 31 giving rise to the coercion to double and loss of accuracy iiuc chars instead

since int is less precise than double i thought i needed to cast it when parsing it into a method

often using int math is faster than double

on modern hardware floating point multiplications may run way faster than int ones so you might want to change the entire algorithm and start using double instead of int

a 64 bit double can hold many more int values precisely than a 32 bit int

the double literal 99.9999999999999 can be represented as a double which is less than 100 so the cast to int truncates the decimal part and 99 is the result

i m pretty new to java but as you can see in this example int follows buy double

you need to select double not int s

but beware that long double multiplication is already much slower than the multiplication and division of int unsigned long or size_t

then make changes to that choice either as an optimisation float takes up less space than double so if you are storing a very large number of them that might be a reasonable choice to better match some outside-imposed criteria or because it won t suffice when you need to use long rather than int

for platforms where int is larger than double it s obviously false

simple fix make sure your attribute knows you want to compare double s and not int

in addition to it i think you may consider changing the type of object angle from int to double and adding more logic to handle the negative and none int values

public static int compare double d1 double d2

then it will be unserialized as a double giving you more bits per int than a standard 4-byte per int 32 bits

since an int is representing by a non-decimal number 1 and a double is represented by a decimal-number with precision 32 bytes more than that of a float 1.0 we can say that int s are less than or smaller than double s and by that logic int s can be promoted to double s and double s can be demoted to int s

note also that cancount should be an int not a double since int are more accurate and it is unlikely that you ll need to deal with a fractional number of cans

so if i try to convert a double number bigger than maximum int it crashes instead of returning nil

i have a decent understanding on why there is an error because of how double has a higher precedence than int and how an int cant necessarily store a double value

to me it s fairly intuitive that comparing double is slower when taken into consideration that double are more complex and take up double the memory of int but why is it so much slower

well in multithread the performance of the int version is 2.6 times better than the double precision

if i write an int instead of a double it is still more than twice as fast

double has a greater value range than int

public static int compare double d1

but there was this legacy thing dating all the way back to k r c called default argument promotion that essentially says the compiler will implicitly convert all int types narrower than int to int if necessary to match a function signature and all floating point types narrower than double to double ditto

you are guaranteed that double is never smaller than float and that long double is never smaller than double - similar to the guarantees for long long long int short

compare int to float or long to double to get fair results

we started off using objects int double and had less than desirable performance both in terms of memory and speed

not really considering that a double can be a much higher magnitude than an int

c++ doesn t have such kind of automatic casting facilities even if you could build a class that mimics such behavior by having an int and a float a double would be even better iirc it lets you get up to 170

i have a similar problem to this question only i am not learning generics so want a practical solution and my method is returning more than an int or a double

that means a float will be a double and anything smaller than an int will be an int

int is like floor but floor only accepts types decimal or double where as int has more overloads

you can t convert a double to int because the double has more information than the int

if you want to compare double and int it may be tough

4 + 4 since int is smaller size compared to double padding of double size is done

one way to check whether or not a double is a whole number without knowing the calculation type this works for more than just division would be to subtract the int part to get the fractions part and compare to zero

edit here is a piece of code that reproduces the effect of double being faster as float for uint32_t and both cases being equally fast for int

but then i found that number is not comparable i can t compare double with int with it

3 4 prefers int int over double double

or math.ceil double which returns the closest int that is more than the double

operations on float and especially double cost more than on int

we use it for a game where we have health based on int hitpoints but calculate the damages based on double to be more exact

if you know in advance the number of elements and don t need flexibility an array of millions of int or double will be more efficient in memory and marginally in speed than a list because indeed they will be stored contiguously and accessed instantly

or more general how do i compare two types so that compare double1 double2 will evaluate to true and compare int double will evaluate to false

i changed double to int because if anything it doesn t make sense to compare double values for equality because of floating point precision

or a value for int a that is 6 less than double c

a double variable can hold larger values than an int and is able to store an approximation of the value 4000000000

because a double is larger than an int this accesses the 4 bytes of the original int and an extra 4 bytes on the stack

and then use it to generate a random int or double that is greater than or equal to 0 but less than 10

the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long

i need a regular expression that matches only double numbers and doesn t match int at the same time

the conversion from float to long double is no better than the conversion from float to int since they are both not promotions

my problem is that select with double requires a long type as the comparison but the scalar relational functions isgreater only return int for double

code should use abs with int or narrower fabs with double fabsf with float labs x with long etc

it implicitly converts an int to a double gets the double form of largest int that is less or equal to that double and converts that back to an int

even though a standard conversion sequence converting from int float double to long double is better than a user-defined conversion sequence converting from myclass to long double your operator version is not chosen because your other parameter long double requires a conversion from the argument which is worse than what the builtin operator needs for that argument perfect match

the only difference in the two loops is the one if statement in the second double for-loop and loops is slightly longer but in the game the second for-loop is only rendering 3 things as there are only 3 platforms being rendered at this point int time

this is important because if the int needs more precsion than 52-bits the precision is too low for a double

so i am looking to change the group d+ to something that will match against int or double

many processors and or compilers implement long double types larger than any int type regardless of name and there are processors with 32 byte pointers

int needs less memory comparing to double numbers

but that seems like a ton of redundant code i m using squants to track units so there s more than just int and double to worry about that i d like to avoid if possible

here for what it s worth is a pipes-csv variant which just compresses each parsed row into an unboxed vector of int s by hand this easier than finding double which is what this csv is really storing using readint from the bytestring package.

lastly you might consider using float or double you might think int would be faster however that is not always the case as floating point operations can be more heavily optimised both in hardware and the compiler

if you want to use double instead of int it s an easy change but int is more natural if we are just counting occurrences

is not that there is no conversion from int the type of -9 to double but that the compiler does not know which conversion to pick int - float double long double since there is a std fabs for each of those three

for test scores you might choose int unless you expect someone might get half a point deducted for something then you d choose double

typically a double is 64-bit ieee floating point with roughly 52 bits precision and with range much larger than 64-bit int so magnitude is no problem

a double can hold larger numbers that an int can represent

the surprising thing is that a single matlab data type may match different java data types logical matches boolean byte short int long float and double in that order of precedence

also long is slightly better than double for int with 63 bits compared to 53 bits of precision assuming positive numbers

there is also the wrinkle that typically a double consists of more bits than an int does - so by printing in this way your code is interpreting random memory to the right of x as data

if the first number is bigger than int 32767 or is explicitly converted as a double long single then it is ok

but this isn t true because double is more general than int and therefore int is the most-specific option in this case

variables that are larger than a chars like int or double are often allocated at an address even dividable by their size

looking at the cmath header from gcc s libstdc++-4.8 one can see an explicit pow double int is no longer present this case is handled by the following template which promotes the int to a double

now processors as a rule do not have mixed-type instructions add float to double compare int to float etc. because it would be a huge waste of real estate on the wafer -- you d have to implement as many times more opcodes as you want to support different types

about comparing double - since they are double not int it is better to compare the difference below half-tick or something like that but need to be careful with that

you can assign the int s returned from integer.parseint string s to your double variables because double s are higher precision than int s and so type conversion happens automatically without the need for an explicit cast

because double can contain larger numbers than int or long

it s likely that you will get better results by using int math.round ... math.round returns a long if you pass a double

identical for retrieving random double but here the int results are much closer

i think you ll have to either fit everything into one type meaning forget about int just use double or define a more generic base type

by using 2l and 1l instead of 2 and 1 you keep the result as int instead of forcing a coercion to double which is slower and takes more memory

the floating-point unit fpu on modern x86 is natively double in fact it s even bigger than double not float the 32 in 32-bit describes the int register widths not the floating-point width

obviously the order you try them in matters - if double comes before int then you ll never pick int over double

long long has a larger range of exactly representable int values than double and therefore there is little reason to prefer double over long long for int if the latter is available

in a compiler with a 64 bit double and a 64 bit int you ve got more problems of course...

it would appea ryou re using an int where a float or double would be better

for example an int is more specific than a double because 1 can be promoted to 1.0

int or int32 has a much smaller range than double

the range of exact representation of int by the double type is wider since the value occupies 64 bits and there are 53 bits reserved for the mantissa

so the question what s the best way to compare double and int

you can work around this issue if you ll advance to big int floating point numbers that store more bits than a double precision number

i want to do a loadcheck shell script that can compare double instead of int as i want assured the load return is less than 0.01 which is 0.00

it would really depend on the processor and the range of the int which is better and using double would resolve most of the range issues

so your compiler picks the double constructor as a better fit than the int one

i know that in k r c prototypes didn t exist and all arguments smaller than int or double underwent promotions

alternatively if fieldsize is equal to sizeof double and sizeof double is greater than sizeof int then you are writing off the end of d_buffer and then something is corrupting your data

because a double is higher it will merge the int into the 0.0

in the actual data-processing code one would not normally use any types smaller than int or double with few exceptions

a double is bigger than an int

specialization is unable to guess that for int or double is something more specific than that

and if the value of your double is higher than the range of an int then this can produce undefined behavior

first with any variadic function such as printf all int values of a type shorter than int are passed as int or unsigned int in some cases on some platforms and all float values are passed as double

double doesn t have infinite precision and you can t gain more precision than a double has by converting a double to a bigdecimal like you can t gain more precision with an int when you do which is 0.0 because it widens an int to a double

if your resulting double has higher int value then simple int math sometimes stops working

int arguments of types narrower than int are promoted to int or to unsigned int and arguments of type float are promoted to double

with the cast that bad stuff is undefined behavior most likely double is bigger than int and it overruns the memory for i

with double there are more digits and it may well be that when the calculation of 0.58999999999999 times 100 the last bit is a one instead of a zero so the result is a 59.00000000001 or something like that whcih then becomes 59 as an int

i used a list of int to make it easier to test so every int there should be a double

double is larger than an int hence the overflow

because all int s can be upcast to a double without loss and the pow function on a double is no less efficient that that on an int

i am supposed to write and algorithm which uses recursion divide-and-conquer to multiply two arrays.these arrays hold big numbers that are greater than long int 64 or double capacity

note that current implementations of r use 32-bit int for int vectors so the range of representable int is restricted to about + -2 10 9 double can hold much larger int exactly

you do explicit type casting to get your result in int because double is a larger data-type than int

since sizeof int is very probably smaller than sizeof double this is going to lead to horror

the range of double is wider than int

your double arguments are larger than this causing an int overflow when they are converted to int


rational-numbers	zero	1
is there any way in haskell to get the constant that is the largest and smallest possible positive rational-numbers greater than zero that can be represented by doubles


bionic	glibc	3
you will get the answer if you just compare bionic and glibc sources of rand function and

porting runtime libraries to work on top of bionic instead of glibc may be more interesting

note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports


children	parent	498
the css level 4 selectors specifies the relational has selector which effectively is the replacement of the parent selector as you can select children without descending in the dom

you could use body as a parent element and select children of it using the child selector

in case of min heap when you insert the element which is less than some nodes in the tree the data structure now doesn t follow heap condition in case of min heap value of parent should be less than its children so you have to shift up and up

tip when i place parent blue here higher vertically than children orange here and i notice the bird body with raised wings pattern of a parent on either side then i recognize a many-to-many relationship exists between the parent

i also want the parent to be no wider than it needs to be to contain the children

i need a query that will only select parent products that don t have any children related to it

i don t know react so can you make any parent element with reactid not accept more than certain children

the parent element has overflow scroll and when the parent become thinner than the children i don t want the children to break line but the parent to overflow them horizontally

so parent children are slightly less performance on read query than nested

but when i was watching videos about heaps i found a totally different definition of heaps which says in a heap the parent keys are bigger then the children

i would like to delete all children that are older than a month but need to keep a minimum number of children for each parent regardless of their age

it selects all direct children children exactly one level deeper than the parent

this is because the secondary sorting orders by id and if the parent id happens to be higher than any children the parent may not show up on top of the children

even though all of the parent and children had a higher z-index

i have a simple parent has_many children relationship and i m trying to get all parent that have less than n children

i guess it was misleading because if i choose folder it also puts it under the server directory at least according to the parent label under the parent children section

i stumbled upon the above where someone answered a question regarding implementing a tree that has 2 nodes and i just wanted to get someone s thoughts on how best to implement a family tree with parent nodes which have more than two children nodes

this is a common issue when centering taller children than the parent using the absolute vertical centering method

where the parent can have one or more children many but the child can exist without a parent but it can never have more than one parent zero or one

in other words if a parent row can have more than one children when sending the fields to each child the parent data will be duplicated in each children

how can i achieve that my container will adjust the height accordingly of the children items when the height of the children elements is larger then configured minheight of their parent element

i believe that some parent will have more than 2 children

here a child will be having more than one parent and a parent has more than 2 children

what if both children are equal and smaller than the parent

this is a very simple case which will do that asuming your children always have a higher id than their parent

i wrote one query but it will fails if a particular parent has more than 10 children

at the very least this will get the children to exit closer to when the parent does

that is exactly what the point of the documentation example model tree structures with child references in it s structure where it makes it easy to select parent and children within one query

some parent links have more children than others

the max-heapfiy method of a heap bubbles up the max to the top such that any particular node s children all have lower value than their parent

edit in other words if the parent is larger than the total width of the children that s fine

i can order by id but this doesn t feel reliable as even though i know in this case that children will have a higher id than their parent i can t guarantee this will always be the case in every circumstance i want to use a cte

i have parent themes in one select box multiselect and child themes in the second select box multiselect .initially all the child theme are disable.when any parent theme is selected the children of the selected parent theme gets enabled.so what i want to do is when i select parent theme all the disabled theme should be removed and the children theme should be enabled

if the current child s bottom is lower than his parent take it and all the following children and put them in a new div content

after determining the location of our element we move our element up in case it has a greater priority than its parent in a similar manner to insertion or down if it has a lower priority than one of its children in a similar manner to deletion and update the modified elements locations in the hash map

is there a way to target only certain children of select parent without duplicating the children selectors and making the selector go off the charts in terms of length

any attempt to reuse a single parentedtree as a child of more than one parent or as multiple children of the same parent will cause a valueerror exception to be raised

height width are taken to show that if you 2 such children it will scroll horizontally since height of child is greater than height of parent scroll vertically

this works because a parent thread will always have an id which is less than its children

the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node min heap

i will use my enum integer values to conclude which state is on parent nodes none equals or contains by adding int values and compare with children count

so the problem i have now that the parent div height is larger than his children s height

by giving .artist-container a higher z-index you are placing it higher in the stacking order than the child image though children always have a higher z-index than their parent

another acceptable solution would be to to select parent whose children s text are in a list

...in other words how to select parent if there is no children or the newest child if those children exist

basically i m trying to select parent categories and their first level children

there are relatively simple solutions if the parent always have an index greater than the children but that is not the case here

in a heap when there is any change in the heap insert delete update then the heap is restructured in a way such that the common priniciple is maintained in above case the parent remains always smaller than its children

although you can directly access a vue instanceâ s children and parent it is more convenient to use the built-in event system for cross-component communication

according to reference docs the children of tablerow take match parent as their width

i used to think heaps have this property but it just seems that the only requirement is for the children to be less than the parent

from a parent i can have multiple children and each of those children can have more children etc

if the actual size of the parent s list of children is less than the parent s expected number of children originally read from the file push the parent back onto the stack

you can t use not to select parent and not specific children instead you need to define specific rule to get default pointer on child element

i m trying to stop dragging the children div when his position is equal or higher than the parent position

in that case the update is done directly on the child table parent has more children .

i m a little confused about your count properties since the count for parent are sometimes smaller than the count for children

by the properties of the binary search tree you already know that all children have to be larger than the parent 15 therefore using one of them instead of the 25 is valid

i ve got a simple 1-tier hierarchy where the parent includes a number of attributes and the children include more of the same

because in this case both the parent element and children elements are belonging to a same stacking context #root in your demo and negative z-index order let children stay lower than parent in the z axis

without adding any extra complexity to the rockauto site it appears to structure it s tree view as make-year-model-variant but year doesn t really have any attributes or children or parent it s more like an attribute of model

the problem chrome does not expand the parent when the children take up more space

i don t want to hide overflowing part by overflow hidden i want to force parent div.alert height to be not lower than its children

so far i ve done this but it only selects children who are dead not parent status 5 is deceased

when such individuals are subject to crossover their children are likely to be worse than either parent

i have a table person that represents parent and children there are really more columns and names are not actually named this way but the rest of the information and accuracy is not pertinent

use router-outlet in the parent component and make more than one children route in the routing file

the invariant is that each parent is less than both its children

i modified the _searchnode function so it will hide matching nodes greater than the level delimiter but will show parent node even non-matching as long as the term matches within its children

your fixheap2 fails to consider the case where both children are valid but have keys smaller than the parent s

.find selects children of the parent element you need to use .filter which will give you only the items with the select attribute

but it seems being able to do it by targeting the children of the parent would be more efficient

but it s natural if we have 2 or more children with a parent to move them into parent block

when you build the max min-heap you don t need to heapify percolatedown the leafs as they can t have any children which are bigger smaller then their parent

you can do with refs what you can do with dom elements using dom api select children find parent assign style properties calculate innerheight and innerwidth

another question is why the height is filled while the children elements width is larger than parent element

but if you re dealing with children that have more than one parent then you re dealing with graphs and for that reason mysql it s not suitable for you

i have three radio buttons and two sub radio button will be available initially if user select the first radio button and user select children first second radio button one div will be shown in the second scneario if user select second radio button third radio button from the parent and sub radio button second div should come

i guess the reason you observe this behaviour with just a guess it could be wrong is because the parent process is terminated earlier than its children so your terminal s prompt is printed before some of the children s output

max heap in which parent node is always larger than its children

solution inspired by tim s answer to a sql question here select parent if all children meet criteria

this works fine as long as i don t put children in it that match parent

i am using the id in order to compare changes between parent entities children so it s fairly fundamental to the current way i ve designed it

select children which have class ifthis then select it s parent using parent or closest

to the linearlayout that holds the two textviews the linear layout is defined match parent so you need the children to be gravity center

whatever the parent of the first ul is use that and then this means immediate children learn more here

i want to select children when parent selected

pushing and popping any item on a heap simply updates the elements in it in such a way that there is no node where its children are larger than the parent for max heap

the naming of parent and child classes sometimes is counter intuitive as we often think as children as being smaller than the parent but in programming the child is the same as the parent but with extra funtionality

now the children have a lower z-index than the parent

this has been boggling my mind all afternoon how do i get my jquery statement below to only select parent who have children

specifically you compare the new root with the left and right children and keep swapping if the parent is larger than at least one of the children until the heap property is satisfied

i want to prevent the two divs to be placed under another if the parent width becomes smaller than the children combinded width

of course there are a few other small details to take care of such as make sure the children width is smaller than the parent make sure the left and right margins and paddings are equal etc...

i d say that the array must first be built into a heap using a typical buildheap function which starts at half the length of the array and calls a minheapify function to ensure each parent is at least less than its children

i d like to select parent rows and the children of those rows

also for a binary search tree if search is alphabetical then the left children should be earlier in the alphabet than their parent

so the issue previously was because that children always have higher z-index values from their parent because it is considered as another stacking context just like div#5 and div#6 to their parent div#3 in the above example

if a node has two children then the left child has a smaller value than the parent and the right child has a bigger value

when the children s line-height is smaller than parent s it looks like the children s line-height is ignored because parent s line-height will hold up the line box when the children s line-height is smaller

if you need to do more with the parent like paging or fetching the children you could split this problem into a sub query note that the line is not required it s just an example what you can further do with the query

insert parent or children read more here 9.6

on webform when i select parent it should populate children below dependent drop-down

sub-selectors matches children of the parent match

the where clause basically includes only the parent who have less than 4 children or who do not have any children at all b.employee_id is null

here a number of methods are described to fix the parent which collapses to smaller than its floating children

the child upon completing its task deletes its row in the table freeing the parent to create more children

make sure that the parent container has a width and that this width is at least larger than the children elements

the n-th child selector only selects children that are the nth child of the parent

code is almost working but children divs are a bit wider than parent and i am getting a wrong value of offsetwidth

once you have chosen a root node it is already easy to construct a bst taking into consideration the fact that left children are less than the parent node and all right children are greater than the parent node

how would i go about creating a formula by which to traverse a data tree stored as a one dimensional array in which the root has k children and where each child has one less child than the parent

the immediate children children .box that are display table-cell will take the height of the parent that is display table

another gotcha is that you must make sure that an instance cannot be a child of more than one parent or else destroying a parent could also destroy children belonging to another parent

as you are always swapping it with the larger of the two heap property means that the parent is always larger than its children

index for children will always be greater than the parent as shown in the vector above

as we use less i was thinking about using a condition where i could specify that if the height of the children is higher than the parent s height the background-color is different

you need to just change the siftdown function so that the parent is always the smaller than the children

this would generally be the wrong inheritence structure if your saying what i think you are the reason being that children should not be less restrictive than parent

i need to set image-type children position to absolute in their div parent and keep the lower section under this parent

only solution i have now is to select children filtered by key and ordered by property and then fetch parent in java code one by one which is not efficient even with fetch parent set

what would be the proper way to select children of the parent div

remember the only guarantee a max heap makes is the the top element will be the max in the heap and every parent will be greater or equal to it s children

why is the parent smaller than the children on narrow screens

i would like to stripe the rows so that odd and even parent rows have a color and their respective children will have a lighter shade of the parent color

which run configurations of python kill children when the parent are terminated

parent can have more than one child and children can have more than one grandchildren

ok if we say that the parent is always bigger than the children because it is above them we write

basically you make your cells float with 20 width so 5 per row and height 100 of the container then you can change this height if the parent has more than 5 children cells

i think the idea of having a single event aggregator for parent module and its children is cleaner

i have a similar requirement as this select parent record with all children in sql

if the ratio of infected children will be greater than the amount of drugs then also the parent and all the other children will be infected

this really helps keeps parent branch more stable than children

how can i prevent this flex parent from shrinking to smaller than the height of the children

because of this i m not sure if traditional crossover algorithms will work well for instance i tried ordered crossover and the children it created were generally worse than its parent

try using .is with selector to select parent .m1wrap and children of .m1wrap

under a nested set representation each node has two indices assigned in the following way imagine that each node is a house with two windows east and west and the tree is like a bifurcating road where all children are more or less to the north of their parent

i found something that works here but if the index number is higher than the children count the element goes out of the parent

either the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node max heap or the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children min heap

i understand that children cannot have a higher opacity than their parent but is there a possible workaround for this

however it is not possible to rotate in the current situation since both children end up in becoming lesser than a parent

i can t find a way to stop non-flex divs to become larger than their parent when their combined children s height gets too tall

in inheritance the father should not access the methods of the children it is better to inherit and implement new methods that have nothing to do with the parent in the child class

child components have weaker connection with its parent than subcomponents it was expected that parent has no idea how many children it can have which is appropriate for most controls

a subform of assigned children would be safer or an assign form listing only unassigned children that includes a combobox based on the child table parent id foreign key to select a parent

new h i is guaranteed to be the smallest of the old h i s children which is still larger than old h i s parent

this way you don t have to select children parent etc.

to prevent children divs to become larger than the parent you have to set an overflow

i need to know because i want to use this to initialize my scripts and i have to initialize the parent first and then the children becasue lower hierarchy components use their direct parent calculated values

remember you can select children element inside a parent element with space like this in your example which is .shop_table .product-price

are the nodes in order like in your example where the children have a larger id than the parent

left children are less than the parent node and

in jquery you can select children by giving an space between parent and children

for example with your three div s if all are alike then it should be possible to select them as children of their parent for instance

this results in the children getting more height overflow the parent

one of the two children will have an older parent

so wouldn t this print names of the parent where it matches with children s names

a heap is a tree satisfying the heap property parent are always less than or equal to their children min heap or parent are always at least as large as their children max heap

however if the keys are not comparable how are we supposed to tell whether the children are greater or less than the parent

i bet you got the answer from the other posts but i d prefer using parent when selecting the parent through the child direct parent instead of travelling recursively than using closest and children over find when selecting a direct child of the parent s no traversal over descendants of children because td is always the direct child of tr

off the top of my head you could split up your suggestions based on length and build a tree structure where children are longer variations of the shorter parent

a heap is a data structure that maintains only the property that all parent are less than their children or all parent are greater than their children

it may have more than 2 children and one child may act as a parent for the next level and another may not. not binary tree

the table can contain two or more headers where the parent header gets a bigger colspan and the bottom header conforms by giving the equivalent amount of columns i.e index 4 has two children indexed 1 and 2

if set to true checkboxes will be two-state only meaning that you will be able to select parent and children independently and there will be no undetermined state

is there any way to select children without any parent of a specific class in css

also it seems this is only the problem when there are a lot of duplicates the heap doesn t seem completely capable of staying in order the parent is smaller than the children

2 kill children and keep the parent in this case you remove all the children and send all of their attributes to the parent

the widths of the children is often larger than the width of the parent

what if a parent has more than 100 children

they seem to be trees in which each parent is strictly greater than its children

if the parent becomes smaller than the total width of the children as numbers 1 2 3 and 4 dictate the children should shrink to stay within the new parent width

to select parent and their children immideately to display like in tree example

select all parent which are not referred to by children who are younger than 8 years

in the same breath i would also like to be able to run a specific number of child processes at any given time say for example n children running concurrently whenever one exits the parent process starts another child if needed but has no more than n children at any given moment

i want to match parent s height with the total height of its children so the content does not flow out from parent s border

if your query was parent .child and there are many parent that have no children then parent .child would probably be faster than parent .qsa .child

in the worst case you d have to explore the whole dag because git doesn t forbid parent to have more recent dates than their children

search for documents that match parent criteria + children criteria

is a child selector that selects children that are directly under the parent

insertng in search binary tree you need to keep track that children are stored in the specific order child smaller than parent on the left and greater or equal on the right and parent has at most 2 children

so the drop-down menus will stretch to fit the width of there parent and if any of their children is longer than that width their width should increase to adapt

is there any option to prevent parent element be overflowed by children element when children element position is absolute and hight of children is higher than parent

the binary-min-heap you have implemented only guarantees that the parent of two children is smaller than both children as chtz has commented

my children views have their height set to wrap_content i know that the behavior of wrap_content is to fit the content size unless its bigger than the parent

parent can have more than the defined children but the defined ones must exist

i mean i want the children to display very close to each other vertically less space between children as compared to two consecutive parent on closing the the tree parent

so long as the nodes in general have more parent than children this direction will be much faster

as a side note the children can t have a higher z-index than their parent so everything inside .codbg is -1 behind the page then you need to fix the tab images the problem is not that they re behind the background it s that they re transparent and look darker on top of a darker background

then children have one more depth than their parent and children s path starts with the parent path

with cte i could select all children or parent but i could nt select children and parent with just one query

assuming the highest priority is at the top each element must be no higher than its parent and at least as high as either of its children

parent are always at a lower index than their children so it is ordered

just calculate the parent width and children container width using jquery and if the parent is wider than children container make a transform across x axis to shift all thumbnails to the left

the weight is used to distribute the remaining empty space and your first element has match parent therefore it tries to occupy the highest space horizontally and remaining lesser space is distributed among two other children

i thinks when using to select children elments you forget to specify the parent scope

of course two parent can generate more than two children

because the parent has lower z-index than the .modal-backdrop everything in it will be behind the modal irrespective of any z-index given to the children

there is a parent table he can add more than one children email ids no

all children will have higher z than parent

i suppose that once we start adding elements from h2 as children to elements of h2 then we will have to start checking whether that child is less than the parent and if not we swap them

this would select parent children

as you can see its a tree that has a parent and first 2 children can have more and then those children have their own children and so on

the basic requirements would be the ability to select parent values as well as children values and the table setup i have currently is as follows

it looks like all the children have an id greater than the parent

you have to use pointers for qt objects qt maintains parent-child link for its objects via pointers and destroys children on parent delete

the children created more than one for same name of same parent

i ve also tried searching the trees for a match updating parent children explicitly but everything point to the fact that it s either not a solution or i m doing it wrong

i have an issue when the player is small the children combine width is greater than the parent width

the heap property that the parent node is greater than it s child nodes 2i + 1 and 2i + 2 using zero-based arrays holds for all nodes that have children

if your table represents id_1 is a parent of id_2 then both a parent can have many children and children can have more than one parent this is known as a many-to-many relationship

note that children nodes have value larger than the parent

i think that in short the second answer to that question covers it all the heap constraint which is that children are greater than their parent does not completely specify the heap so there is usually more than one possible arrangement

both listbox parent and children can add more items

if the parent however is not larger then its children you won t notice any difference between those alignments

what i have shown is children should have smaller width height than parent because when using floats they spill out

i want to be able to select parent that don t have any children matching a particular set of criteria

there are also different types of trees -- i am going to assume that you are using a normal old tree any number of children no more than one parent one root node

rather than myset and have children be more restrictive than their parent elsewhere in the code

could you just show an example how do you select parent table along with it s children

all other pages will be children of their parent to give you more control over the hierarchy and to allow you to trickle down save and close events

we don t want the children to grow bigger than it s parent right

the parent container have a width of 100 and the children containers are obviusly bigger well then appears the scrollbar that can be disabled enabled but i want the third block to jump down i mean 2 box in a line each 50 2 100 but i can t realize that also i ve tried the same with is that possible to do

i guess as soon as my parent get more children or have different amounts of children this approach won t work anymore since i sum the children s scores up

an item can have multiple children and can also have more than one parent

presumably you know that it is precisely that no node has more than one parent or more than two children

the heap constraint which is that children are not greater than their parent does not completely specify the heap so there is usually more than one possible arrangement

both children are greater than the parent

the myfile can have one parent and parent can have more than one children

it s supposed to kill children processes first then the parent later but i only get parent killed

the problem here is the parent z-index is lower than the mask so any children are always behind the mask

an entity can have more than one children but a single parent at most

by promoting the mating of more similar parent the children are less likely to be much worse than the parent because the parent just were compatible

also removing the m from a parent directory is trickier than it might seem so we need to make sure we move from the bottom of the tree the files first and not rename the directories till we re done with all the children

i have observed that when opacity of parent is set to less than 1 the children objects become less opaque even though their opacity remains at 1 as seen when printed to console

this assumes that the id of the parent is smaller than the id of the children as is the case with the sample data in the question.

these children may be bigger then the parent container and may be moved with the class .move-to-right-border to the right border to take up full width on the right

this does not work if any parent has more than one children

as for inheriting opacity - children cannot be less opaque than parent but could be more

i need to pull in an array of any type and make it into a heap where the parent is always greater than or equal to both of its children

applications need to present a view of the data that shows the entire tree for a given parent and all its children where the children may be more the 1 descendant away from the parent resource parent - link - resource - link - resource child

select on the parent then iterate through the matching parent and make more queries to gather matching children

min heap in which parent node is always smaller than its children

i like to use closest and find more than parent and children respectively

i ve tried a bunch of other things as well one of them being hook elements with insertafter but stay in parent - jquery which worked perfectly but if the position was higher than the children inside the parent it didn t know what to do with it and causing a lot of unwanted behavior

but my code only works if the parent element is always higher on the list than the children and i want to make that work universally

im trying to take an array of type t and switch its values around so it correctly corresponds to the rules of a heap where the parent is always greater than the 2 children

i d send an action from the child to the parent it s always easier to communicate upstream than it is downstream due to the fact that parent don t always have children

yet i have parent arcs with few children that are proportionally larger than their peers with far more children

i am not filtering by parent user types but bringing up those users which have the children count greater than 1

for some reason the second children class .main-body lightseagreen color of a column-layouted flexbox container .content-main plum color has a bigger height than its parent which i do not want it to

this is a draft i made and where i m stuck at - from the fact that we have distinct elements and the heap property we know that the parent is always greater than its children

as harypyon suggests storing the children is a more efficient way of viewing this problem than storing the parent and then computing the children

this example is ok if i want to add both parent and child and make relationship between them.the problem is that i want to add parent and then or never add children.i also want to add a children then take a list of existing parent_ids and then store them to my association_table.i know i can select parent with the given ids then add all together but it will take a long time.any better solution

rails 3.0.5 doesn t seem to destroy children of a parent object using accepts_nested_attributes_for unless the children are loaded

so i ve come up with a way to center children in a parent that is smaller than itself

what i want to do is to search for all parent who has more then n children in other words i would want to get all user records that had an activity more then n times within given period of time eventtimestamp

i have a logic when user select parent i want to disable children nodes so with below implementation when i select parent checkbox all parent and child are disabling

if any parent has more children than there are parent the application crashes if any of the excess children are selected

i use nodes table to represent a tree how to select parent with 4 or more children

query all parent which have more than 80 naughty children

if you want to track the completion of these children more closely then you can have the parent become current more frequently with a smaller unit count

remember that you need keys foreign keys to be selected in order to let eloquent match children to their parent

to say select parent before you select the children please note following is just the logic explanantion

if you want to select children with the .sum class you should add a space between parent and children

one or more purchases children will tie to one person parent and one item parent

i was expecting the parent widget to have a little larger sizehint than the children layout

also your parent invocation will only return the yet you need the to select children from there

as a general rule of thumb i keep the parent bigger than the children

parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children min

you would think that you could simply increment each element s z-index by two but that does not work due to the fact that children elements cannot have a higher z-index than their parent if the parent s z-index is set

oracle always selects children by evaluating the connect by condition with respect to a current parent row

the parent can initialize more than those two attributes and you would have to copy it into children s __init__ which is highly error-prone

yes it will have multiple parent not children it is actually the same but parent are more fitting here as we ll see

i know that it would be easier with the parent knowing it s children using a list but that s not what i m after

parent have a lower id then their children to make sure the script creates the array to put the children inside

present the user with the relevant information # children confirmation of parent to delete let them select a radio button or whatever to destroy children just parent cancel then destroy the appropriate records

the details will depend on exactly how your n-ary crossover works but intuitively the more parent you have the less genetic material you are likely to have from any one particular parent and the less likely the children are to inherit and thus improve upon any beneficial multi-chromosome traits of their parent

each parent can already have more than 1 children

according to the sources that s the only form it checks watch how it collects a list of children then matches parent s method names against names of the children

in a similar fashion use to match parent documents and return their children

a parent part can have multiple children and a child part can belong to more than 1 parent

and i would like to have a clean rails route to destroy children from parent

the problem i have is that some children have more than one parent but because in order to use the recursive parent nicely i need to group the results by id i only see distinct entries

the above query only works if the parent id is a lower number than all the children

i want to select parent that their 1st-level children not all descendants have some certain styles

a topic can be a sub-topic of more than one parent topic and itself have one or more specialized topics as children

imho - if breaking up my components to parent children means less testability - then something is wrong with this framework

since stronger parent are more likely to create strong children the type of selection plays a big part

i would prefer the 1st one since maintaining 1 value of parent is easier efficient than maintaining list of all children

i want to select children groups separately for each parent one must stay left others must go to right

consider that position relative will preserve this z-index for its children so if the topmost parent is lower than another element competing for the same level it will be placed beneath even if a child claims to have a z-index greater than another element outside of the element chain

this gives me but when i loop through it i get duplicated parent when this parent has more than one children

i made arrangement that parent process kills children manually using os.killpg also children uses some delays to possibly finish current requests

do you keep the parent if they are better than the children

if still not then think of it as a min heap represented in array guarantees that parent is smaller than its child but says nothing about are all children arranged in sorted order left to right

any ways if you want to know what sql to use checkout select parent record with all children in sql

keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children

the second one select parent tbody and select children tr as an argument

the max heap is an array that could be more easily represented with a binary tree where the parent node is always greater than it s children and every time you add a child you added it towards the left so that every time the tree increases it s height it is a full tree

my children views may be a different width but it not be bigger than parent view

the second table has children linked to their parent passport id i only take in account one parent -either father mother- per family

in case 1 the node at which we stop is the local min because i it s smaller than both of its children and ii it s smaller than its parent which is the precondition of our deciding to check this node

if user select parent how display children then click children display siblings

ios 8 introduces ask to buy which lets parent approve any purchases initiated by children including apps or in-app purchases on the app store

the children iframe will always be bigger than parent div and parent div overflow will be hidden

the other option would be to make the app lion only and use the parent child nsmanagedobjectcontext design and then your children will be more aware of each other

is the only solution to ensure children cannot be more restrictive than their parent using generics ie myset child

the reason we only traverse a tree from the parent to the children is because we are usually searching for a specific node and as long as the binary tree is implemented such that all left children are less than the parent and all right children are greater than the parent or vice-versa we only need links in one direction to find that node

1 if we select parent node then children also be selected.2 if the parent is not selected the user should be able to select a single child without changing the checked state of parent

as with all the cases when weight is involved be sure that the needed space for width for the 2 children is less than what the parent can offer otherwise you will have things off screen

if there are two rectangles and the parent is wider and than it is high then the children should be placed next to each other

that tree is a binary tree in the sense that each node has only two children but the child nodes aren t less or greater than their parent node

modify your dataset so that parent and child documents would have a specific distinguishing field in particular childdocuments to indicate children see more at this question

pstenstrm has provided a good solution that appears to display correctly however the actual height of the red div in this case is equal to its children the text rather than the remaining available space of its parent while the inner and outer height take up more space due to the padding margin

i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do

from what i ve got if the parent have a bigger z-index it will be more important than all its children but apparently it s not that

i want to select all parent divs and these parent divs have children divs inside i don t want to select children divs

so once you select children there is no turning back to the parent level or once you select next sibling s there is no turning back to the current element

when i choose parent it should display all the connected children of it in splunk

right now you have more ol elements as children of parent ol elements

when you design a container you create explicit parent-child relationships between your container the parent and other view controllers its children - tell me more

if you have children that have a smaller height than their parent floats will bring them to the top whereas inline-block will screw up sometimes

either the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node this kind of heap is called max heap or the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children min heap

then siblings .date will select children of the parent of div.headline which are called siblings that have the date class

i realize that not on it s own should select all elements that do not meet selector conditions so my question is why does the default behavior only select parent elements and why then does not over-ride this behaviour and select the children

the parent establishes a stacking context and the children have higher z-index than the parent and cover the parent up so that s all fine

which works fine except it triggers multiple calls to select children when they are accessed off the parent

i have 4 entities and let s say i have a parent match with children team player and event

basically i want to select children records that have distinct parent or parent records that have distinct ids

now since the pseudo-element is below all of the floated children the parent div happens or better yet seems to contain the floated children as well - which is really what you want

i know mysql has to choose for either mandatory or optional but mandatory seems the illogical choice for me as this is 1 much more difficult to implement in sql and 2 less common than a parent with optional children

on the start drag event make the parent item have a higher index so its children stay ontop of the rest then on the drop event set it back to normal workds great d

if there are more than one parent div elements that have three or more such children then all of the 3rd children are selected

let s say a filter to list parent objects that has children named x older than z live in y city and has no children named x who is younger than z live in y city

the result you are getting is also a valid heap - each parent is bigger than its children

manytoone if you plan to have a tree as a parent can have more than one children

unless the rounding goes the other way in which case your grandchild has less width and or your parent has less room to hold its children

if its children are wider than the specification says they should protrude out but they won t affect the width of the parent

but when they get bigger than their parent client width the variable elements suddenly start fitting their children instead of their parent and i m not sure how to force them not to

multiple child entities to a single parent is even more simple because then each child has a reference to its parent but as compound columns and list types are not defined in sql a parent can t contain a list of its children

more than 1 parent have children referenced in the database this exception

my question is because outermost framelayout has height as wrap content and its children has height as match parent wouldn t it create a dilemma on calculating the height

so i took accepted answer here select parent and children with mysql for my submissions_comments schema which looks like

when the browser window is smaller than the min-width the child elements are the correct width but the parent keeps getting smaller causing the children to overflow

the problem is if the parent s width is 100 and the sum of the children is more than 100 they start a new line rather then cause a horizontal scroll

if smallest state of all children is greater than parent s state then update parent

since parent have a higher z-index than its children you need to change the default browser stacking behavior

children is faster than find for example just like parent is faster than parent

i ve thought in using a pairing function but that makes children exponentially bigger than parent so after a few splits there is an integer overflow

as long as each parent is smaller than its children - it will work

my tried query which children does match parent node

now the max-heap property holds for the root node its children are indeed smaller but not for the other nodes 3 is still the parent of 7 and violates the max-heap condition

please notice how the family cell stretches to house more than one parent rows and the parent cell streches to house more than one children rows

ultimately i want to filter all parent objects that have less than 2 children

see jquery dynamic binding .on select parent or children

in min heap a single insertion is o logn in the worst case as that cost is only incurred if the heap property that the parent value should be smaller than the children is violated

so in this labelling scheme left children are 2 i+1 more than their parent where i is the height of the child while right children are 1 more than their parent

i have an expanding contracting table view.my parent cells have a different style than the children cell parent cells have bigger font children cell has smaller font

i have a div which contains three child div s and for some reason the first child div is properly positioned within its parent but the other two children are positioned lower from the first child

if you don t you should start to inspect the children of the element to see if any children are wider than the number you specified for your width property as children expanding their parent is a fairly common issue unexpected result

you may need to also add another bit to the child2 join to remove the possibility of parent having a higher rating than the children

i have a collapsible panel that was designed in a way that the children green are wider than their parent red

either the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node this kind of heap is called max heap or the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node min heap

simply put a max heap is a heap where the value of the parent is greater than the value of any of its children

expected result select parent who has their all children participated in something

it looks like you have navbarbox set to wrap content height and navbardirection height to match parent which means it won t try and calculate how high it should be and just match it s parent which starts at 0 and increases as it s children does so it stays at 0

the z-index for the children should be higher than the parent

it looks like the parent will become a zombie too if children aren t handled and a child runs longer than the parent

check if any of the children are greater than the parent node

as the title says the children are more important than the parent so in my example code the most important is the article title than the sub title and the least important is the section main title

in other words if the parent div is wider or narrower than a multiple of it s children unused space remains within the parent div

however if for example you have two parent sibling elements where one has a higher z-index than the other no descendant of the parent with the lower z-index will ever have a higher z-index than children of the parent with the higher z-index even if you set the former s children to z-index 500 or something like that

as in you can select children but not parent

disadvantages again if a parent can have a row that relates to more than one children data will be duplicated as there will be one row per each of them so there is a limitation in this solution

if that won t help use a small script to add a class to a parent if its children is more than 4

the only problem is when i hover the parent the children is blinking more like fading out and then fading in again the jquery is doing this but i dont know to fix this

am passing the word asdasdasd to the text area with the id source and triggering the click event.after that trying to check whether the result value which is wrapped under the newly created span tag or not.for that am checking whether its parent with the id result_box has more than one children

where the parent node is a smaller value than that of its children

but i want to select parent ids which can be the id column or the parent_id column from children records

now when you iterator over you have all the parent nodes and subsequently you can iterator over any of their children to dig deeper into the hierarchy

children smaller than parent

it can handle parent with more than two children and with a more complex input data set we could leverage the graph approach to do even more cool stuff

let s again use parent and children but like in real life children do have more than 1 parent

when you zoom in google chrome some zoom levels cause the children elements to be larger than the parent element

and since the children in your home block start their own stacking context one level higher than the parent your home li can never be above the items inside it

the best reason i know of for not destroying dependents is that more than one parent model has_one or has_many children

but if you simply want to feed some content that will be displayed through its parent render method then using the children is more appropriate

i have one parent resource which can have more than one children of one attrbiute and one than more children of other attribute

assuming that the parent has a smaller id than any of its children and that the default value of the parent column is null could you order them this way

i suspect you mean something like which will match parent elements that don t have element children but it doesn t take into account their text contents again for the same reason i mentioned

so i will start with commit 1 find all the parent ie commit 2 and try to check if there is an branch for this commit ie number of children is more than 1

also if you don t want the boxes to wrap when the page is too small for them to fit on one line you will need to add white-space nowrap to the parent or make sure the width of the parent is wider than the two children

the css selector .about .sub will select children sub with a parent about

and the reason why the subtree isn t reached is because you only call heapifyhelper for the children if one of the children is smaller than the parent but when you call heapifyhelper 1 the two children of the node 5 are 9 and 11 both larger than the root value

the children still do not need to know about the parent and the parent gets a more direct event as opposed to a signal connection

can children have more than one parent

the parent would contain three fewer digits the siblings would have different last three digits and the children would have the exact same code plus any number of additional digits in the form .xxx.xxx

on mac os x dwarfdump shows this relationship with indentation - children dies are indented a little more than parent dies

then if i select parent spartacus then the view showing the children should have as a title children of spartacus

if you have a table parent that joins to table children a parent with two children will return more than one line

i subscribed to the main canvas sizechanged event and applied a scale transform so that the canvas and its children would shrink and grow in a zoom like fashion when the control is resized which is working but for some reason the parent canvas is shrinking at a much higher rate than the children making the children fall off of the canvas at a certain point because of the scale rate

i thought of using before and after pseudos to display top-to-bottom and bottom shadows on the containing element but these pseudos display within their parent element and positioning parent z-index higher than these children has no effect

everybody knows how to select children by parent but i need to select parent by child

i think i d prefer children over parent as that s the way the hierarchy is set up in those .xml files admin user user visitor

i have also brothers for the children and i can make queries for example if i want all children that have parent that are more that 35 yers old and a sister named sisi i will have each children have his brothers on the value brother

mybatis collection purpose is to map multiple result rows nested in an object e.g select parent and children

another downside of this angle is that querying the updated time of the parent will still give me too many children and is less efficient

when you select parent you use an actual object but with children you have quotes list of symbols as children

just remember in a nested set all children s left values are greater than and right values are less than the parent

assuming that the binary tree follows that all left children are smaller than their parent and all right children are larger than their parent you could use this property of the tree to reduce the amount you need to search through

when i click on new content and select folder and enter a folder name checked under parent children and it said parent resources server directory so i hit save

ok so your parent are fixed width the children are bigger than the parent element also min-width 150px

if your tree is not binary that is a node can have more than 2 children it might be worthwhile to introduce a virtual parent node that has all the real roots as its child nodes

in a heap the parent is always less than all of its children or greater than all of its

some children have more then one parent

also the inner children div have to be wider than the parent div for the scrollbars to work

this children height can be greater than the parent container

children can belong to more than one parent

i m trying to write a sql query in ms sql server 2008 that will match parent rows where the parent match and all their children match

the invariant here however is that the parent s index must always be lesser than its children

if you want to move directives attributes from parent to children this is way more complicated

here s what it looks like if the parent is bigger than the children

then i thought of putting each integer from s into a binary search tree and searching for first occurence where one of children is smaller than query and parent is bigger than query but i don t know if this will work

however that does not match children with their parent for some reason

all select parent that have children but have no children with non-male gender

you could similarly make children the transient field if explicitly recording the parent relationship is more helpful

basically a given branch of the tree may be found under more than one parent branch but wherever it is found it has the same children

and parent being killed with int does kill children with usr1

these 4 children contain higher resolution data of its parent

you can use children and parent in jquery to select children and parent elements

i should implement a logic for a treelist which consist from a single parent and more children grouped into more groups by id s

firstly select parent then go for children

if one parent has fewer or more than two children the tree is not binary

i would like to have the parent totals above the children and add more levels

this class assumes that nodes have numeric values for id and pid and parent node has lower id than its children which is common in tree structures

the problem is caused by the fact that in your 80 layout not all children specify a weight and some of the ones that don t do it - they have a preferred size that makes the sum of all children being bigger than what the parent can offer

i do fine getting the program to calculate fitness values select parent produce children then mutate the children

i will assume that this data structure represents a tree and that nodes are numbered so that the parent always has a lower index than the children

children can t have a higher opacity than their parent as their opacities multiply

there seem to be some issues in the windows phone framework and in the windows store framework in fact related to elements that are children of other elements and how when the parent element has been destroyed the framework thinks the child element still belongs to it elements can t have more than one parent

whenever a top parent reply tile goes out of the viewport it is disposed as expected but when trying to bring it back into view it scrolls right to the top and looks very jumpy even worse whenever a bigger thread with multiple children tries to come back into view it doesn t scroll at all

get all the parent that have more than two children

in this case a parent row can be linked to more than one children without duplicating data

i would like to be able to let children have more than one parent

i am having an output that we need to edit so we can have it with removed repeated entries it s more like being a tree we have the parent device with its child devices and each children have more than another child

it s too hard to scroll pages to match children to parent even wrapped with tags

parent typically have no more than to 4 or 5 children but rare and even extreme cases have to be supported as well

if the parent has lower z-index than the modal everything in it will be behind the modal regardless of the children s z-index

when i want to select parent and grandparents while selecting children which of following two queries right

if the left children must be strictly less than their parent then duplicate keys form a linked list that works like a single node since you can t have any left children in it

i need to write a query that selects parent objects in a one-to-many database where the value of a data column on a child object differs from the value on other children of the same parent

use rgba instead on the container div to set the opacity as the opacity properties is inherited by all children elements even text nodes meaning a descendant of any kind can t have a higher opacity than its parent

with parent child groups how do i only trigger the main page with image to break on the parent when any of the children items is greater than 9

you can check for each of those divs if it s parent has more than 3 children

updated to include when parent would have higher id compared to the children

when opacity on a parent container the #contentborder div in this case is set to less than 1 any children inherit that and cannot be higher than the parent

so the children must be of type nodetype but the parent can have the more general tgraphnode type

how to select parent that don t have children in hibernate

fair enough but there is no point of keeping it around when the children have become more relevant than the parent and for whatever reason the parent no longer is required to be kept

nth-child is used to select children of a particular parent tag without regard to a type

i understand the heap is a structure that the parent node is always larger or smaller than its children nodes

again if the parent view is not larger than its children the expansion suffix does not make any difference as well

so if one of the children b have a bigger child c it will cause overflow on the parent a

also if you are willing to change your layout a bit you could achieve this through weight and linearlayout note however that this will work only if the desired combined width of the 2 children is less than what the parent is willing to offer

notice that a children choice solution can have more than one parent and that choice can be either an array or one element.

for static points those that don t move it s trivial to make a tree such that you just have to walk a few parent nodes and check its children children that are closer together are closer in distance

keeping a list of children in the parent makes more sense from this aspect

when you destroy parent gameobject all children will destroy automatically

if an element has only 1 child then the child is placed below the parent on the same x co-ordinate if the parent has more than one child then the children are placed with equal spaces apart and the parent needs to be in the middle above the children to two equal length lines join to both the children from the parent

the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node this kind of heap is called max heap ..

you allow children on either side of a node to contain keys that are neither less than nor greater than the parent

if children height is greater than parent i need to set height of children to parent

if any of the children also has -webkit-filter npx the filter gets applied twice once for child and once for parent

unfortunately this doesn t work as children can t have more than one parent

but if you have for example a binary search tree arrows going from parent to children make more sense given that you start at the root of the tree

you could do something similar using the score values in sorted sets giving children a score just lower than the parent

this query lists all parent sharing the same children where there are more than one parent

if a parent has more than 2 children

but its parent is greater than or equal to w so at some level of the tree one of the children of the greatest element is w

the parent process always can keep track of its direct children easily as fork returns their id grand children gets more tricky ... and send a signal to any of its children on exiting gracefully

problem a parent can have more than one children and parent table is dependent on child table

my tried query which children does not match parent node

you are using a relativelayout as parent container in app_bar_main.xml where all children will occupy the entire view if set to match parent

we chose to not do cascade since it is easy enough to traverse your own model and do deletes and when the other use case pops up where you just want to delete the parent entity but not children it is easier to code and not have to undo the cascade logic

the parent should be li.trigger then we want to select the children .plus .minus to change visibility

or generally speaking is it possible to add the same children to more than one parent

select parent node if all children have assigned class

since the parent #wr has more children #con_bottom does not fit

this way it is not ok if the parent has more children let say they are input s

the children are inherently more complicated than the parent and it wouldn t make sense to store all the fields like cuisine for restaurant on place

i have a table in which i have columns dataid and parentid so for one parent root i can have children and those children can have more children and so on

since all level_0 divs are children of parent container just select parent container s children

suffix expand if the parent view is larger than the combined size of all its children additional space is available then the space is proportioned amongst child views with that suffix

the children svg does not apper in its parent but is shifted to the right and the more i scale the parent svg the bigger does the children get and never appears in its parent

all right children are greater than the parent node

how can i prevent the parent from getting bigger and at the same time make all of the children the same size


glassfish	resin	3
it compares jboss glassfish and resin

i have previous jsp experience but with using tomcat and resin and i would like to connect to a mysql database using glassfish and hoped that more or less copy and pasting the code would work

glassfish seems to be slower than resin


lisp	racket	3
do racket macros have more advanced functionality than those found in scheme or common lisp

on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations

racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development


fontfamily	font-size	6
the actual visible size is determined by the font-size and to a lesser extend by the fontfamily

here s what is happening someone chooses a fontfamily and change font in div1 then they choose font-size and want to change size of font in div2 however both fontfamily and font-size are applied because value from fontfamily is stored all the time

as for the slight overflow this could either be caused by the font-size being larger than the line-height or due to the fontfamily you are using

also the type of font styling matters if the initial font styling was just using a font such as fontfamily and font-size are more specific already so using

if the fontfamily is the chinese fonts you can set font-size to be bigger

i recommend doing fontfamily helvetica neue helvetica arial font-size 20pt and setting the font weight to the lowest possible 100


floating-point	fixed-point	9
but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic

anthony williams fixed-point maths library provides a complete analogue of the standard maths library for a fixed data type that is typically around 5 times faster than software floating-point on the same target

if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead

fixed-point can be much more exact than floating-point as long as the number s exponents remain in range

floating-point calculations are more expensive time-wise than fixed-point which is why fixed-point remains popular in microcontrollers and embedded systems

0- less than floating-point less than lt fl for fixed-point compare

addition happens to be exact in fixed-point as long as it does not overflow but fixed-point multiplication is no more exact than floating-point multiplication

armv7 is usually better but for arm fixed-point arithmetic is usually a lot faster than floating-point implementations

it s not necessarily true that the matlab fixed-point arithmetic provides less precision it can be used to provide more precision than ieee floating-point types


apk	dex	1
so the solution for you would be to have static contents contents of apk like its manifest file jar file dex file res folder etc ready in a folder create a copy as a temp folder modify resources contents and not names as per user needs then finally create zip of this temp folder and sign it to have the desired .apk file no need for java complier then


telerik	radwindow	1
telerik has a control called radwindow which is more or less a modal window


laravel	phalcon	1
laravel phalcon have more able to compare ok dealing with your questions


kdtree	octree	1
kdtree needs less memory than octree and sometimes is even faster


folderbrowserdialog	openfiledialog	2
you can t select folder with openfiledialog as well as you can t select files with folderbrowserdialog

assuming your solution is winforms and your user is selecting a directory i m not sure how to interpret your use of path -- the file s path or a path to a directory a folderbrowserdialog might be more appropriate than a openfiledialog as it allows you to choose the folder directly


keras	tensorflow	15
more than this methodology i would suggest to you to do the training directly in keras as it claimed that keras optimizers are 5-10 times faster than tensorflow s optimizers

is keras consumes more gpu memory than equivalent tensorflow model training

should i be surprised that the keras theano backend is about 18x - 19x slower than the keras tensorflow backend

keras provides a simpler quicker way to build and train models in tensorflow at no performance cost since the models are still being run by the same tensorflow engine

i created the exact same network with native and backend tensorflow but after many hours of testing using number of different parameters still couldn t figure out why keras outperforms the native tensorflow and produces better slightly but better results

it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features

is there any way or i have to choose ubuntu linux instance and manually install libraries such as keras tensorflow etc

should i choose tensorflow or keras

is keras faster slower than tensorflow during training

i suggest you to use keras i find it easier to use than tensorflow

i can certainly use tensorflow s optimizer to manually configure this but i prefer using keras s inner function here

don t know whether you prefer tensorflow keras torch caffe whatever

i can recommend keras for beginners and tensorflow for people who know how neural networks work

now when i convert this code into keras i get confused as to what parameters do i put in for num_filter and kernel_1 kernel_2 to match with tensorflow

i prefer tensorflow over other backends but the answer must be compatible with a keras model using lambda layers or other suitable layers for the task


neo4j	arangodb	1
it feels like arangodb is focused on graph operations and neo4j fits more the needs of using graphs if you have more relations than rows the reason to use graphs instead of relations with joins


jax-ws	jax-rs	5
there are other approaches such as jax-rs and jax-ws which are better at that

people typically find jax-rs easier to start with and the more modern approach although jax-ws has more build-in type-safety features which is also exactly where most of its complexity comes from

when compared to jax-rs jax-ws makes it easier to support the ws- set of protocols which provide standards for security and reliability among other things and interoperate with other ws- conforming clients and servers

jax-rs is much younger than jax-ws jax-ws had a final draft in 2006 jax-rs came out in 2008-9

how to choose between jax-rs and jax-ws web services implementation


html2canvas	jspdf	1
if you are okay with lower resolution of the pdf you can try using html2canvas library along with jspdf which is quiet easier approach


lxml	elementtree	16
lxml -- 100x better than elementtree

to build xml response i would recommend lxml with his cool elementtree modul

while celementtree is fast the world standard lxml library which also implements the elementtree is faster still

mostly i have seen people recommend lxml but given my parsing requirements do i really stand to benefit from it or would elementtree serve my purpose better

if for some reason you want to use an implementation that does not give you a full parse tree then i would suggest parsing the resulting html using lxml a python wrapper of the c lib or html5lib pure python both of which can return an elementtree object and are much faster especially lxml and more forgiving of invalid html especially html5lib which acts more like real browsers in the real world

note please do tell me if lxml is more easy or this elementtree

but in general you will find that lxml is faster more effective and has an api which adheres closely to a python standard the elementtree which comes with the python standard library

with those step i can import lxml and got no more problem with from lxml import elementtree

i would normally recommend lxml but since that uses a c-library libxml the alternative would have to be as aaron has already suggested elementtree as far as i know there is both a pure python and a c implementation of it available

lxml is faster than elementtree but i ve never found an application where the speed boost paid for the hassles of distribution

for xml documents it may be that the elementtree offered by lxml is more productive

although lxml has better documentation better xpath support and better code for technical reasons i cannot use lxml so i am forced to use elementtree

i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well

i personally prefer lxml to elementtree

elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster

lxml uses libxml2 and provides a nicer interface the elementtree so you get most of the benefit of libxml2 s speed and all of the benefit of it s xpath evaluation


freertos	ecos	2
there are a number of resources available free and commercial for implementing a file system and usb on a bare-metal system or a system using a simple real-time kernel such as freertos or ecos which have far smaller footprints than linux

in 2009 for example freertos was downloaded more than 77500 times and ecos has extensive support for file-systems and networking etc


cairngorm	robotlegs	1
any large scale flash flex app can get pretty unwieldy without a micro-framework adobe has pushed cairngorm but i personally prefer robotlegs there s also puremvc which i used before robotlegs i prefer rl because it uses native as3 events as well as dependency injection which is easier to test


crypt	md5	5
crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

normally you will choose crypt but if you have a longer password consider md5 or sha1

i should also mention that crypt has this built-in and may be a better solution than md5

mac os x llvm gcc based crypt fuction is borked junk hardwired to only use des a proven breakable hash worse than md5

my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords


qcheckbox	qfilesystemmodel	1
i need show files from qfilesystemmodel in qtreeview and customize that tree to show one more column with qcheckbox so user can pick 0..n files from that qtreeview


clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml	1
this tutorial recommends making crossdomain.xml or clientaccesspolicy.xml files and putting them in the web root of the service


ng-view	ng-controller	1
unlike the ng-view it s possible that there are more than one ng-controller in the same page


implements	extends	51
by the way i don t recommend implements actionlistener in jframe class also you don t need to extends jframe

hashmap does not implements or extends to be more precise hashtable

where application authentication authenticationservice is nothing more than an extends of the zend authentication service and implements the identityproviderinterface

the reasons why you might prefer implements the interface runnable to extends the class thread are the following

if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces

extends makes more sense to me here than implements maybe it s a typo in the book

but that seems a lot uglier than implements a facade pattern and just extends the map code but that is a lot of intermediate code to create a facade for

implements gives larger errors because i tried with extends

as an aside i d also recommend implements runnable instead of extends thread and using an executor service so that threads can be reused

why is implements runnable a better option than extends from thread class

a possible reason is that extends represents a a stronger relationship than implements although both represent is a or is a type of relationships

personally i d recommend implements your own adapter most likely in this case by extends simplecursoradapter and encapsulating the updates to distance text and compass heading rotation within that

before we move on i just wanted to mention that spring oauth2 already provides an implementation for the above interface meaning that we could make our life a lot easier by actually extends the only implementation of the above interface clientdetails which is org.springframework.security.oauth2.provider.client.baseclientdetails rather than implements it from the beginning leverage all that can be done from baseclientdetails and add our own custom fields hence the myclientdetails looks as follow then

i recommend extends one of the list classes that has already implements a dataprovider property it s a lot to tackle

public class mealhistoryactivity extends activity implements connectioncallbacks onconnectionfailedlistener locationlistener ..

if you need to use columns that show images a lot i recommend implements a custom imagecolumn that extends mx advanceddatagridcolumn has some kind of imagefunction as property and uses a custom itemrenderer which would use the column s imagefunction to show the appropriate image

plain chars having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extends a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain chars unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain chars gets implements as signed

although extends by nothing is valid typescript it would seem to me that in this case implements would be more appropriate

note extends mouseadapter is easier since you only need to implements the methods you want to handle

the current example is a bit choppy in rendering which may be okay for you but if not you will need to extends the already obscene number of media queries that are driving it it would likely be much easier to implements using less or sass

however rather than extends actionlistener as in your second example you ll probably find that putting the listener implementation into a different class even an inner class which implements actionlistener provides better logical logical separation of your code

we can either extends thread which will implicitly implements runnable but then we can t extends any other class so implements runnable is better approch

implements runnable is better because you can extends other classes

i also know implements runable is better than extends thread

they say that implements runnable is more preferrable than extends thread

i would also recommend implements runnable instead of extends thread - or quite possibly using a timer instead given that you want periodic execution

i have read that implements runnable is better than extends thread but i have no idea of how

also prefer implements runnable over extends thread

you can make your life easier by extends each of the components you use to a custom component that either implements its own event but then always the same event like contentchanged or takes a java 8 consumer function that is called whenever the content changes

which i think makes sense because extends from a class should take higher priority than implements from an interface

that way when you want to add features you can choose between extends the base class or implements the interface from scratch

and i write extends midlet implements command listener amm it doesn t work am dont get any bug and if i copy all my code and i paste it in a new project midlet and i delete all it has and i paste my code it does work mmm always and when the name was for default hellomidlet i just watch two things.

if not make remotedatasynchtaskprocessor a runnable btw i always prefer extends implements runnable to extends thread and try using it with an executorservice

but if you d like to extends this api to be used by the external services then you ll be in a much better position with implements oauth 2.0 using doorkeeper because you can easily configure for example a authorization code grant for them

are there some solutions available to extends asp.net identity better than implements a custom solution as suggested in the links

more or less the same thing as the accepted answer can be implements more succinctly by extends the gridviewpager like this

and when you need to choose between implements an interface or extends a class for a particular scenario go for implements an interface

here is how gcc does it it sign extends if the integer type is larger than the pointer type this ll happen regardless of the integer being signed or unsigned just because that s how gcc decided to implements it

this is kind-of the functionality you for instance see but you instantly already see that there it s called at an instance and the fact it requires to extends rather then implements pdostatement has more to do with the c-level implementation functionality of that class

when you extends you incorporate the code of the superclass into yours sometimes there is no code to incorporate so implements is better suited

i already know that we prefer implements runnable interface over extends thread because it provides flexibility to our class we can extends some other class in future

second in order to add or update the value of listview in general extends arrayadapter is much easier than implements baseadapter because of arrayadapter support add remove insert method by itself

while implements our own jdbcclientdetailsservice i do not recommend extends the default jdbcclientdetailsservice because there are quite a few private class variables and methods which will not be inherited hence let s use the default implementation to write our own

is implements the rawcomparator that much faster than extends writablecomparator

i have not found a lot of times when implements an interface would be a better system than extends a superclass

the extends keyword is more general in this sense since it s used to mean that the generic type could either extends another class or implements an interface

mvc is the most extensible and if you are familiar with how things work under the covers you ll probably be better off than implements a hard to extends ms thing like odata and wcf

but whether or not your use an anonymous class is orthogonal to the question of whether implements runnable or extends thread is the better mechanism to define your thread task

prefer implements runnable than extends thread

i switched a thread from extends thread to implements runnable implements runnable is better practice right

prefer implements runnable than extends thread and prefer threadpools instead of spawning threads in production at least

python-daemon	daemons	1
i have a basic python daemons created using older version of python-daemon and this code


fileoutputstream	filewriter	4
usually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of its constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imo

then you can use filewriter or fileoutputstream to write to the file i prefer filewriter

note that i wouldn t recommend using filewriter to write to a file - use a fileoutputstream and an outputstreamwriter chained onto it as this lets you set the character encoding instead of using the platform default one

you need to create a fileoutputstream and decorates it with printstream or better filewriter with printwriter


public	protected	67
for your first problem make sure that both the classes are in the same package and the members are declared either public not recommended or protected better or don t specify any access specifier which is a bit more restrictive than protected

the wildcard matches all fields any type any name in this case constrained to only match public or protected fields

on the other hand relaxing from private to protected public is less traumatic because you don t have to worry about previous access to that property from without that class

note that this will work when the variable is public but it is best to limit the scope as much as you can so protected is more sutable here

do prefer protected accessibility over public accessibility for virtual members

of course if you define a class you can declare which properties it has - you can even choose between public private and protected scope

what is the true rationale behind all the private and protected stuff when we can just make our life as a programmer easier by using public for everything

if you don t need it to be public it s often safer not to due to getter setter allowing better control over what values can be assigned then you should declare if protected or private

technically they could be private or protected but for ease of use i recommend public until you are more accustomed to document classes and their tricks

furthermore protected is actually closer to public than to private

be aware that guaranteeing immutability by having no public or protected constructors is easier to break than making the class final

public is higher than protected so there s no problem

this approach seems more complicated and possibly less clear than inheriting protected and then using into public the base class members your child class actually needs to expose

i did not make any changes more than change protected to public but i add another class in a new package to print the rules by these following codes

reason i once heard that protected is better for hibernate performance but all i can find on the web is hibernate can access public private and protected accessor methods as well as public private and protected fields directly

protected is closer to public than private

if you overload it you must also define it as protected or define it as public which is weaker

that prohibits you from doing something like having a protected and public overload where the protected overload is the better match

since object clone is protected and since java favors subclassing inherited over interface inherited the automatically generated subclassing overrides clone as a protected method rather than a public method

and you really limit yourself by using public most novice coders look at protected as being more limited

otherwise there is still the possibility to change a public access to a protected or package private access which will be much more restrictive than public

from a software engineering point of view as soon as you make a function protected you expose it to other users of course much more limited than public exposure but still much more exposed than private and you create expectation about some stability of the api

so i d prefer public or package protected

change it to public to make it more accessible or perhaps better protected to make it less accessible than public but more than private read more about that here

documentation provides more information than private protected public does and a good system will have documentation anyway

i think that as a commenter suggested reflection is the way to go - you can get more than the public ie protected variables but still apparently can t get private ones

it really doesn t matter if you choose public protected or private

in this case public or protected would be more use

since package protected is less accessible than public the code is reducing the accessibility of the foo method

personally i prefer putting public methods first followed by protected methods following by private methods

so you can choose protected or public

from this point of view if a class has members which don t need to be protected for example a boolean which its corresponding get set functions can be freely changed by the user is better to put that attributes as public and remove the get set functions more or less these are the bjarne stroustrup words

if for example you choose protected inheritance all public methods in a will become protected to the outside and the rest remain the same

in scala you can choose between public access public package-private access with inheritance package-private access without inheritance class-private access private object-private access inheritance access protected access whatever you may call it and additionally you have some kind of file-private access modifiers sealed

therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public

with subclassing is trickier because any private members of a class are not inherited by the subclassing but protected and public are

3 has an example of writing public accessors for private member variables although again i d recommend writing public accessors for protected member variables instead

if the access modifier does not match public protected private

choose public or private or protected but var is less explicit i prefer the others but its your choices

so with classes like std stack clearly demonstrating that an absolute rule about this is nonsense the experienced programmer must weight the pros and cons and when deciding on inheritance must choose between public protected and private inheritance

doesn t work either due to the public scope being less restrictive than the overall property scope of protected and moreover not of the same scoping level as defined on the base class s abstract property declaration

in my regex replace modifier with public private protected replace returntype with the return type and replace methodname with the method name.

package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope

so only letting what are used for other classes and objects nothing more than that public for those where other classes would use too protected for those limit only for extending classes

so a protected is more restrictive than public and private is more restrictive than protected

for cglib spring 3.2.18 recommends public method signatures whereas spring 5 can intercept public and protected methods and according to the note in the documentation even package-visible methods if necessary

also using private and protected instead of public is more about good programming design than security and i recommend you read about it as well as polymorphism and inheritance

protected is more restrictive than public

it s not perfect but i guess that a protected method that does not check parameters is better than a public method that does not do it

this access is more restricted than public and protected but less restricted than private

since getter and setter are so cool when should we prefer public protected default object field

my rule of thumb is to have the most restrictive policy possible - prefer protected to public

using default no protected private public is even worse as it allows classes in the same package or subclasses to access the logger

protected functions maintain a weaker invariant than the public one before and after each call

there ll be no functional difference between the constructor being public or being protected but making it protected gives a clearer indication of the intended use

you have declared the compare method as public which generate a warning as the method in the base class is protected

the theory is that someone extending your class with protected access knows more about what they are doing than someone who is merely using it with public access

this will match public static or private static or protected static

so the most important reason to prefer private over protected over public doesn t apply

oh i see you need a constructor that has more access than protected but less than public

that means private is better than protected protected is better than public etc ..

many developers have established a coding convention instead and used public for those cases where protected may have made more sense

for public inheritance it means that all the accessible members of base class that is the public and protected members can not be at a level more permissive than public

the solutions using a public constructor are fine too but as the constructor cannot be called directly on thr interface i think protected is better

secondly if you want the superclass variables to be accessible by your subclassing it s better to use protected than public

as alexandrescu and sutter recommend in their 39 th rule you should prefer using public non-virtual functions and private protected virtual

if the only purpose is improved testability then exposing methods as protected or public is an easier option


libxml2	libxslt	3
also since lxml is based on libxml2 and libxslt you ll need less calls into the c api which can be quite expensive in my experience

libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

gimel and tim recommend lxml which is a nicely pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries


komodo	gedit	1
when i m in a hurry i use gedit purely because it is quicker than komodo edit


skip-lists	tree	10
for example if you want to implement an equivalent of std map it would be a pain to do it with a red-black tree but a skip-lists is much more manageable

skip-lists isn t any more difficult to implement than a self-balancing binary tree and gives much better performance in some situations

the most simple would be an array but a double-ended queue or an indexed skip-lists b tree could be better depending on the data size we are talking about

in a single thread world is different you can use a sorted set a binary tree or your custom data structure that would perform better than concurrent skip-lists

that is not exactly what i was expecting from skip-lists algoriths have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced tree and are simple faster and use less space pug89

so as you can see the random binary search tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists

skip-lists algorithms have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced tree and are simpler faster and use less space

thus write-heavy data structures are probably better implemented mutably and with something like a skip-lists where you only need to lock locally while read-heavy data structures are probably better implemented immutably where a tree is a more natural data structure

balanced binary search tree will perform more poorly than a skip-lists in such a case as skip lists require no rebalancing and skip lists are also inherently sorted like a bst

i doubt that the skip-lists was the better choice than an e.g an avl tree even in 1989


orientdb	arangodb	1
this means that arangodb can offer a greater level of compatibility with the node.js ecosystem compared to orientdb


bottle	turbogears	1
i strongly recommend turbogears or bottle


ppl	tbb	2
since you already learned c++ you should use something more serious such as tbb or ppl

some wrappers like tbb and ppl offer far more functionality than the standard libraries


dotnetzip	sharpziplib	7
gave up and switched to sharpziplib as it doesn t blow up on simple extract but sure would be nice to know what was wrong with dotnetzip it has a nicer api

i would recommend using dotnetzip imo it s much easier to use than sharpziplib here are the examples of usage

also i prefer dotnetzip to sharpziplib as the license is more straight-forward for use in commercial apps

an excellent explanation of why microsoft compression worked so badly for you and why dotnetzip or sharpziplib can do much better even with the same format basic algorithm is in this answer by mark adler

dotnetzip offers native support and has a quite friendly api and is my opinion more flexible than sharpziplib

i used it because it is small 6 kb compiled with just the extraction making it far smaller than dotnetzip which is more than 150 kb and is more permissive than sharpziplib

dotnetzip is much easier to use than sharpziplib example of zipping all files in folder


gsap	velocity.js	1
i ve researched about the use of liquid fire and its fine but i don t quite like to have to use different syntax for the outlets and be tied down to the use of velocity.js i find better the use of gsap for the management of animations in terms of control and performance so i m wondering what kind of mechanism could i use to animate outlet transitions and above all deletion of models some kind of hook that i can make wait before the record deletion


multiplication	exponent	11
multiplication is even easier as you dont have to line up the decimal points you just do the math on the significant digits and simply add the exponent

if the exponent is 0.5 you should use sqrt and if the exponent is a small integer 2 3 4 expressing the formula with multiplication is faster but less readable

so ideally i want to have approximate relative times of elementary operations execution like multiplication typically takes 5 times more time than addition exponent is about 100 multiplication

in addition since all my coefficients are positive and i only want the x qth one is there a way to get mathematica to discard all exponent that are larger than that and not do all the multiplication with those

however naive multiplication will get slower and slower as the exponent increases

this is analogous to the way you can compute exponent using successive squaring much faster than by repeated multiplication

the misunderstanding is that incrementing the exponent is not faster than doing a multiplication

however with really very small parameter 2 in your case exponent is faster than multiplication

as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

note that the exponent operator has a higher precedence than multiplication and division just like in mathematics

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division


uitableview	nsindexpath	1
then in the function tableview tableview uitableview cellforrowatindexpath indexpath nsindexpath i got the lower image in the first row and the upper image in the last row invisible


int	boolean	104
int allow more flexibility while boolean offer limitation and simplicity

the boolean values will be true or false depending on whether the given floor int is higher or equal true to the values in somenumbers i or lower false

the int version seems to execute much faster than the boolean one

keep in mind that depending on the use and on the system using it while a boolean takes less space because it s just a single bit depending on the implementation an int is the native word size of the hardware

second other data types like int require more bits to represent so they are going to take up more room in the stream than boolean

seems like a bug to me i can compare boolean means with int and vice versa fine but only issue comes when using boolean mean with boolean though i do not think it makes sense to take mean for boolean -

all three of the above variables can be used in any different way i choose string int chars float boolean etc.

if i convert these vectors into string with whitespace-separated numbers i would be able to use boolean query with should statements for this search but i think that using arrays of int should be faster

a handy mnemonic is that the small version of the boolean and works on smaller pieces bits instead of bytes chars int etc

10 prefer boolean true vs false over int 0 vs 1 or -1 or heaven help us

it is saying this because using the int to store the value 32 bits is going to use less space than a boolean 256 as each allocated boolean will take up 8 bits 8 256 2048

in high-level programming languages the choice between a boolean and an int is really more of code readability supportability than one of efficiency

it is not wrong with without option explicit though since the framework can compare int to boolean true 1 false 0 but that s not what you want here

for those answers which use a method isprime int boolean there is a faster algorithm than the one previously implemented which is something like

so boolean operation is quite longer than for int or float

they are much more type-safe than int strings or sets of boolean flags

skipping a simple type like boolean or int is easier since you can just call readboolean or readinteger without bothering with the readlist functions

what that code is doing is first checking if then casting the resulting boolean to an int will be 0 or 1 and finally checking if that int is less than maxx which it will always be

i prefer casting boolean value to int but i found using conditional operator

you compare int double float long and boolean with

boolean true is more meaningful than int or chars 1

relatively speaking the string concatenation in your code is probably going to be slower than the int and boolean comparison operations you have here

now the last three do indeed only make sense in boolean contexts and so with c# having a stricter separation between boolean and int values they are no longer applied to int

compares the type too which compares boolean true false with int 1 which will never be true

the last two statements compare boolean against an int

1 you are trying to compare int i with boolean result

we can mix and match boolean and int values in our designs obtaining an if then else that requires evaluating both branches simd style by evaluating cond then + 1 - cond else using 1 as true and 0 as false in cond so you can get away with using the built in arithmetic of your ring to make your circuits more shallow

i sometimes find that using boolean in int expressions make for shorter and simpler code

but counting the number of trues in a boolean array is more difficult since the accumulated type int differs from the source type bool

how do i compare boolean or int though

any data type witch is lower than int except boolean is implicitly converts to int

there is one case when boolean or int works better than boolean and int

you cannot compare boolean with int

a boolean takes less space than an int

for example for your case a string chars comparison takes longer to carry out in general considering the int boolean alternative

as d i is having int value and you are trying to compare it with boolean value which cause error

if the boolean value is true and the length of the string is greater than the int value print the sum of the float and the int

since your patterns are just 0 and 1 values you can think of them as numeric values long is a 64bit int which is more than enough which can be converted later to a boolean matrix

this behaviour is due to the fact that int is more specific than double while there is no such comparison between int and boolean

keep in mind however that following the robustness principle of be conservative in what you send liberal in what you accept the interpretation of int in the boolean context is somewhat more relaxed

if you need more you will have to use a larger int system.int64 create more than one enumeration and chain them together or just create a class with a bunch of boolean values

it s similiar to the boolean idea but opens other possibilities if you perform other actions on the answers this id could also come in handy since it s quicker to compare int s than string s

you passed wrong regexp to variables pk must match int so d+ and boolean must match words w+

in language where int that are not 0 represents the boolean value true and 0 false like c i will tend to use because it represents the same meaning as if int whereas represents more the int value being equal to 1 rather than the boolean true

however the second loop causes the additional task of casting each of the values between a.length and 0 to a boolean which is more time consuming than int comparison

first off if your dataset only consists of 3-digit int then a simple array of 1000 boolean will be much more memory effieicnt than a map

in t-sql a simple select boolean int will achieve the same result i believe

a boolean would most likely not yield better performance than int since the excel formula engine is dynamically typed

since a boolean is stored as a 16-bit int it is easier to toggle between true and false states by simply not ing all of the bits rather than only not ing the least significant of the bits

since the logic is the same i thought evaluating boolean objects takes more time than int equivalence true 1 and false 0 therefore i came up with the following benchmark and it turns out that i was correct

one example where an int could be more efficient than a boolean would be in a relational database

the mask arrays boolean arrays being much more memory efficient than int or float arrays might bring about more performance boost

when you write such statement editor will tell you android studio hope so that you can t compare int with boolean

basically you are trying to compare int and boolean

select boolean field from postgre as int and in php cast to bool

i m writing a program for a class where the basic problem is using a vector of unsigned int and bitwise operation to imitate a vector of boolean but use much less memory

perhaps using int type if values are all numeric would work better than boolean for a and b

the user can configure the modules which are objects of the same or different classes all returning one or more variables as int or boolean

they are much more type-safe than int strings or sets of boolean

the surprising thing is that a single matlab data type may match different java data types logical matches boolean byte short int long float and double in that order of precedence

error the method compare int int boolean arraylist in the type mycomparator is not applicable for the arguments int int boolean arraylist

if you want a 0 or a 1 then an int or boolean might be a better variable type to assign to

obviously a string can hold far more information than an int or boolean

in the getvalue flag you convert the value of the flag route data entry to an int and then to a boolean depending if the int is greater than zero

the header size will stop to change after the fourth iteration because the case statement tries to compare int values instead of boolean

what is the established way to pass some data â more than int boolean string because those can be handled as marker attributes â from the class that creates an imarker to an imarkerresolution so that the quick fix can be smart about what it displays does

accessing a byte boolean can be more work than accessing an int or long so if performance is the only consideration a int or long can be faster

is there any situation where using charfields along the django choices is a better option than using boolean int smallintegerfield

since some of your rules evaluate to a boolean and others to an int or only compare int you d best let your rules return a generic object and cast accordingly

you can also use a 1 and 0 for true and false but then you have to compare with int instead of boolean because 0 true in ruby

also your examples about why int would be better than boolean are kinda flawed

so floats win over int and int win over boolean it would seem

but wait it s not really constant for boolean arrays and why does int array indexing take longer last case than boolean array indexing even if it has to process 5 times less elements

i recommend using an int to keep track of states with more states boolean become harder to manage and it s easier to make mistakes

from the link which is mentioned in question my question is that microsoft says the c# type keywords and their aliases are interchangeable but why we need aliases from my point of view boolean is more meaningful then bool and int32 is more meaningful then int then why aliases

no int are not easier on the processor the processor does fundamental boolean logic operations on bits

to hold up to 16 boolean you could use a byte array with two bytes or a single int depending on whether the overhead of an array or the unused bits in the int take up more space

int and boolean statements are always faster to process than string comparisons

c does not have this restriction as it tends to be a lot more permissive with types with int and boolean being more or less the same thing. details are a little technical perhaps but the int 5 is implicitly coerced to truthiness so you see an infinite loop

would a boolean array of size 32 take more space than an int variable for example

for instance will a variable that has a boolean value take up less space than one that has an int value

what i thought is first of all so it s impossible to compare boolean with int address value of r

notice that for the test is true and could give 1 the conversion of the true boolean to an int which is less than 10

which is invalid as a boolean cannot be less than an int

your trouble is because first comparison returns boolean value and after you compare it with int value

int can be smaller than 8 bytes and boolean take 0 bytes

returning boolean or an int is more of a c mindset than a java in java you would just handle the exception one

types narrower than int are widened to int in expressions anyway - so the boolean operators would still work on int operands

to be able to express what you were trying to do the operator would have to be able to do more than just boolean because right now your has a bool and int around it

the tablemodel column visibility boolean and column width int or double had better be somewhere in your model

so the best approach here is either to use a wider type than int number or pass some flag boolean value to function as well as int to indicate actual value absence

it returns a boolean value true if the elements in the list contains at least one int and no more than six int whose values range between 1 and 6

you can encode up to 32 boolean in an int as follows the method won t error on more than 32 boolean s but won t be able to unpack correctly

i always assumed that boolean were more efficient than int at storing an on off value - considering that s their reason for existence

side note number is my string that is the user s input and int is a boolean declared earlier in the code

if a value in the double array is less than the int value at the same position of the two dimensional array then in that part of the boolean array the value would is true

however if the structure has a member such as bool or int types and i attempt something such as if i uni_memberint where i is an int counter declared in the shader or if uni_memberbool then i get errors along the lines of cannot compare int to float or if condition must be of a boolean type which suggests to me that the data is not making it to the glsl program intact

in that sense boolean are much closer to one-bit int than to enums

boolean compare int board

objects or expressions of an int type whose int conversion rank is less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int roughly speaking any smaller int type such as boolean or chars types

that being said i understand that it might be for your assignment but converting boolean into multiple unsigned int is more like useless c optimization to me

int occupy more memory than boolean so the heap got corrupted

for use with types other than boolean and int this is more complex but still possible - but it would be easier to use an initializer

as for variables each variable is a reference and will take up 8 bytes of memory even if it stores nothing int will generally only take up 4 bytes and boolean are even more optimized but these are special cases

strangely it works in anaconda spyder but i prefer pycharm and would like to figure this out

hash	md5	166
you could for example use it to compare md5 user_input with the hash in the database login system

the faster the better as this function will get called roughly 20 billion times during the execution of the program i m running it is the performance-critical code at the moment. it doesn t need to be written in c it really just needs to outperform md5 somewhere in the realm of the built-in hash for strings

and instead of md5 you are better off using either sha256 or bcrypt hash

i have a powershell test-script that compares md5 hash content of gold files standards on a windows 7 8 or 10 pc to files that have been written to usb drives copies or reproductions of standards

fwiw i ve been using sha1 sha256 in crypto products in binary form for over 5 years and i d recommend choosing hash in this following order from the strongest to the weakest sha256 sha1 md5

having looked at the existing accesses listed i can see that it doesn t appear to be using the salt md5 hash that s stated in the apache docs the hash password that s stored is different to what i m thinking i should expect the salt is significantly more than 2 characters and for security reasons i m reluctant to embed a particular password hashing algorithm in my code

the idea is that equal responses will have equal md5 hash and storing hash is a more lightweight process

verify the cert and key are matching after they have been copied compare md5 hash

to match md5 hash as a substring part of the text use word boundaries b

it doesn t even matter much what algorithm is used - one could even use md5 or md4 and the passwords would be just as safe there is a slight difference because computing a sha-1 hash is slower

using mysqls md5 function select md5 testsalt i found the hash to be 315240c61218a4a861ec949166a85ef0

so i guess it s the md5 in the dump output cause the conflicts and the hash value is longer than md5 outputs

however some of them like md5 have less possible hash and execute faster

specifically if this input from untrusted users and they should not be able to trigger hash collisions use a more secure algorithm than md5

it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5

i would like to apply a hash code solution on my webpage which is more compact than md5 and sha-1 because i want to use them as keys in a json hash table

using source control version numbers or an md5 hash would be better

the wrapper uses these in such a way that even the md5 implementation is significantly more secure than a simple hash

whilst i would not recommend md5 for password storage if you want to verify that a password is correct you do not need to decrypt the hash

double md5 hashing is actually less secure than a single hash with some attack vectors

if you want the fastest encryption algorithm then there s no substitute for testing it yourself - somewhat strangely php s sha1 implementation is significantly faster than its md5 i know these are hash - this is to illustrate that performance depends on implementation as much as algorithm

mysql themselves suggest that you just build a special md5 index that takes the hash of your search tuple and looks for that since sorting 128bit 16 byte md5 hash might be easier than sorting 5 8byte 40 8 bit 320bit long composite rows

ldap signon should select md5 digest as the authentication type supply the username and then supply the md5 hash of the password

one wonderful way you can check is to compare md5 hash

now whether you d be better off truncating the sha-1 hash or using a shorter hash such as md5 i don t know

as you see md2 is also much much shower than the other hash â the same outcome as with the php code but md5 is much faster than sha-1 and overall it took less time in delphi to do the same on the same machine as php

hashlib is new for 2.5 so if you must use an earlier python your hash choices are the older md5 and sha modules.

it s like complaining that a sha256 hash is bigger than an md5 hash - yep it is but only one of them might slow the attacker down for a while

you can use md5 function to compare hash of 2 strings to see if they are always different

md5 hash as done in how to compute and compare hash values by using visual c#

sha1 is better than md5 because it is a longer hash so can accept more values without collisions although collisions are still possible

what i found when trying to tackle this problem was that select md5 users.email does not return the same md5 hash as the actual email address

there you can select md5 and any value stored in that field will become hash

the size of objectid is also smaller than the size of an md5 hash which is better for indexing

my question is how do i grab the md5 hash i have never seen any code that grabs md5 hash from a file so i have no idea how its supposed to be done

the hash idea should work minor note that sha-256 wouldn t present collisions md5 is no longer secure but it depends on the trade-off if the service involves something really really critical a client-side ssl certificate would be the best way to proceed

the advantage however is that by running other hash you are effectivley winding up with a hash signature consisting of more bits - you are getting three md5 hash as a result

i recommend using md5 hash passwords

anyway it s working when the need is to send the hash when the remove button is clicked but i m still looking for a better way to compare md5 before uploading

the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage

now personally i generally use a salt sha-256 hash on my passwords because i thought that md4 and md5 were no longer secure and that hashing a password multiple times would just put too much strain on a server for no practical benefit

you could try adjusting the second parameter to toint32 to see if any specific ranges of the md5 hash produce fewer collisions than others for your data

so if it takes 1 second to generate each hash it becomes a bigger time sink than it would have been had you used a fast hash such as md5 of a version of sha

other hash functions such as sha-1 also have hash collisions although it is much less likely than md5

thirdly use a better hash than md5 for passwords

however if you want to use the sha256 hash alogorithm which is better than the md5 then here s a code sample

compare md5 hash of each decoded file

hash ids are usually shorter than typical hash created by cryptographic hashing algorithms such as md5 or sha-256 and unlike these hash ids are usually reversible meaning we can decode the original value

for example if i choose md5 and addition then i could md5 each digit and add the resulting hash

bigger hash mean a larger set of possible hash for the same input set so a lower chance of overlap but until processing power advances sufficiently to make brute-forcing md5 trivial it s still a decent choice for most purposes

all hash functions have that problem but some are more robust than md5

in that case some hash functions are somewhat faster than other md5 being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle

finally sha1 hash are safer than md5 i tell you that because you used the md5 tag in your post

btw i suggest to do not store password in database in plain text use simple md5 helper to store md5 hash of password and just compare hash instead of password itself

as pointed out md5 is not a very secure hash there are much better ones to use sha256 is pretty good still i think bcrypt is even better for some definition of better .

i want to compare md5 hash from the same file

according to moore s law computers are becoming exponentially faster hence computing hash functions becomes much cheaper in terms of time especially quick hash functions like md5 or sha1

at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5

if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible

if you prefer md5 hashing still then as i see in your code in line where md5 hash theres seems no problem

i think the best way is send an extra value generated from the sent values as a hash like md5 then in server using the same algorithm just compare sent hash to generated with values and if it is equals then posted data is valid

if not md5 would also be suitable for this purpose since you are concatenating the bucket and path and using the hash to provide better key distribution not uniqueness so you have no hash-collision concerns

or will this result in an md5 hash that is more likely to collide than if i would concatenate the content of all dependent files together

for security md5 is not the best method hash is much better

use hash and choose hashing algorithm that suits you well if possible something stronger than md5 but don t go all the way to sha512 either

i think it s a md5 hash but a md5 returns only lower case characters and as you can see the result returns the both lower and upper case

md5 provide more collision than sha which mean someone can actually get same hash from different word but it s rarely

you also need to make sure that your database does indeed have the right data for the username password that the password was indeed hash using md5 more about your use of md5 below and under passwords that they re of the correct type and their lengths long enough

you didn t elaborate on that point but if you were simply looking for a more secure algorithm than md5 take a look at hash coupled with an algorithm like sha512

some common examples are the crc checksums of which crc32 is very common but you can also relatively easily compute 64 or 128 bit or even larger crcs much much faster than an md5 hash

to give more of a guarantee of uniqueness a stronger hash function such as md5 would be more ideal but just has the slight inconvenience that the resulting hash codes are too wide to store in a primitive

do you know of a simple way to have a snapshot of the timestamps and md5 hash of my source files and then for every file of which the timestamp changed compare md5 and rollback timestamp modification if md5 has not changed

better hash functions md5 are slower

5 generate much larger random numbers and hash them using md5 to get a smaller numeric value we should rarely get collisions but i end up with larger than needed numbers again

you should be generating a random string longer than an md5 hash not shorter

note there are better hash algorithms to choose than md5 - it s overkill for this job

with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

there you can select md5 from a drop down list and then click go and any value stored in that field will become hash

so if i want to split the dataset into a train set and a test set with 87.5 of the instances in the train set and 12.5 in the test set then all i need to do is to compute the md5 hash of some unchanging features of the instances and put the instances whose md5 hash is smaller than 2 125 into the test set

if you don t need the cryptographic properties then a non-cryptographic hash or a hash that is less cryptographically secure md5 being broken doesn t prevent it being a good hash nor still strong enough for some uses is likely to be more performant

murmurhash has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than md5 largely owing to md5 being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that

i think i understand the purpose of using sha1 as it s supposed to require more cycles than md5 to hash unhash and the salt is supposed to prevent the use of rainbow tables

sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1

because sha256 hash are much longer than md5 hash you can detect the hash algorithm by looking at the length of the hash

for a programming exercise i designed for myself and for use in a pretty non-secure system later on i m trying to compare md5 hash

for a given instance in the dataset there is 50 chance that its md5 hash will be smaller than 2 127 assuming the hash are unsigned integers and a 25 chance that it will be smaller than 2 126 and a 12.5 chance that it will be smaller than 2 125

another way would be to compare using md5 or sha-1 hash of the certificate data

then when testing the password for correctness you hash it the same way and then compare the results -- sha1 is a common hash for this md5 is better than nothing

the fact that bcrypt produces hash slower than md5 because of security reasons is also clear for me

how can i match md5 hash with the grep command

i am attempting to compute a md5 hash within an ios app in an effort to compare hash between the file saved within the app and the same file stored on a web server using php

if you are in a situation where it is possible that an adversary might decide to sit down and create a load of messages with specified crc32 hash to mimic other messages or just to make a hash table perform very badly because everything hash to the same value then md5 would be a better option

or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are hash together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than md5

i don t see hash given out with software lately -- probably because they were usually an unreliable md5 and it s a pain to compare hash because you have to hash the file yourself

the answer of jakuje will allow you to compare hash but it forces you to keep on using md5 hash for verification

the idea is that an md5 hash of a string is normally shorter than the string itself and the index lookups on the hash are hence more efficient than those on the strings

also the hash algorithm itself is much slower than sha1 md5 sha1 md5 are made for speed - not a useful property when storing passwords

also the pictures are not the same so i can t just compare md5 s or hash or whatever

compare hash md5 to check

using a encypted method with a salt would be even safer but this would be a good next step past just using a md5 hash

compare md5 hash of the lossless video

obviously md5 is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will hash to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits

however there exist large databases of md5 hash which are more likely to contain the password text than the md5 of it

to go along with what everyone here is saying i use hashtab when i need to generate compare md5 and sha1 hash on windows

but if the space of your passwords is 4 digits 10000 combinations how long will it take to find a password that matches given md5 hash

however for security purposes it is highly recommended that you write a wrapped hasher that will hash the md5 hash using a stronger password hashing algorithm

edit i need the output to be equal because i want to compare md5 hash and compare to my version control

using md5 would make it easier to crack a hash though

now the problem comes when i try to pass the regular expression to match md5 hash as a script argument like

of course any hash algorithm is going to have some chance of collision but you have better options than md5 that would still satisfy the 1024-byte limit

to match md5 hash as a whole string use start end of the string anchors

using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

if your php installation is too old even salt hash with md5 are better than two-encrypted password

valid choices for hashing include sha1 or md5 although sha1 is preferable because it produces a larger hash and is considered cryptographically stronger than md5

yes sha1 is a better hash than md5

the 2nd to last line of this query compares md5 d hash of text fields

if the md5 from your select query results in a hash that is larger than the last record in your table you might get no records from the query

murmur3 hash are faster then md5 but may not be suitable for cryptographic uses

then hash your password or pick md5 or something to make it unreadeble

if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys

because the two hash are calculated differently two files with the same md5 hash are no more likely to have the same sha-1 hash than two random files

then it reads each line of the input file creates the md5 checksum and checks if is matches with hash

my script compares 2 source trees creates a map of possible changed files compares md5 hash and creates a diff-package

assuming equidistribution of md5 if you have n urls hash and add one more then there are n possible outcomes how it would collide and 64 6 - n how it would not collide

sha is better hash than md5

my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords

it occurred to me that one way of managing this would be to build an md5 hash of fixed information and then compare hash

this generally uses a hash algorithm that is much faster than md5

when you want to break a md5 password what you really want to do is a first preimage attack find any password m such that hash m matches stored hash h

in the case of cryptographic hash functions like md5 it is even worse

but if you still wish to figure out the phpbb password encryption hash it is no longer md5 in version 3.0 or higher and is a custom hash

also calculating md5 hash is significantly faster than sha-256 and should be favored for performance reasons for any application that doesn t rely on the hash for security purposes

hashing is one way you can prove this to yourself by taking an md5 or shasum of a large file since the file s size is larger than the hash output by pigeonhole principle hash can t be restored.

as far as one-way goes - an md5 hash would be considerably more unique but by no means unique than the simple hashcode - but might be verging on unwieldy depending on your definition

joining in char 32 the character string of an md5 hash is more performant compared to joining on variable character fields

the resulting page identifiers will also be shorter than md5 hash and will only contain digits so they will be easy to include in url query strings etc

then you run that string through a good hash algorithm--something like sha1 is fine even md5 is more than adequate despite reports to the contrary

the difference between crc32 and md5 is that md5 generates a larger hash that s harder to predict

the hash cake generates are more complex than md5

if you re hashing e.g with md5 the value you can compare hash values of id e.g

this hash function can no longer be used for cryptography because the collisions are very easily found but if you need to use it just for your own checksum where collision attacks are not an issue i recommend using md5 even today in 2017 provided that you have found a fast implementation of this famous hash function

i ll recommend using md5 or sha hash

what des_set_key_unchecked was doing in the original code was to fill a platform-specific des_key_schedule structure with some of the bytes from the md5 hash calculated earlier

well the first thing that would help narrow down problem is the md5 hash of key raw is identical in both cases but the base64 encoding doesn t match md5 hash of key base64 so that kind of narrows down the step where the problem diverges to the code for the base64call

crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5

you need to make it more specific to only match md5 hash value -- which is easy

you don t have to worry about collisions and you still get the most efficient indexing mechanism for storage purposes meaning you re not storing md5 hash that are potentially longer than the original word - which makes no sense for real world use

however to answer your original question there is really is no way to compare md5 or any hash against any type of encryption

even if you think an int hash isn t such a good idea using a 32 chars digest sha-1 md5 should be much faster for selects than the raw string right

now i would like to save some bandwidth so what i have done is made a created a php script that md5 hash the images and then my java captures the output and then compares it against hash stored using the preferences api

it uses md5 hash encoded in base62 for the hash making them less than the usual 32 hexadecimal chars long

you can for example store a hash stored with something stronger than md5

you may want to use the rabin hash which is faster and more collision resilient than cryptographic hash such as md5 sha1 et al

mac os x llvm gcc based crypt fuction is borked junk hardwired to only use des a proven breakable hash worse than md5

actually you can insert the passwords as a simple md5 hash it will still work for letting the user login though it is recommended to then change the password through the front end system as the salt passwords are more secure

you need to hash your passwords with an algorithm i recommend sha md5 can be used but is not recommended

if you want to do this - and are in-fact okay with having more larger hash data to store compare - you would be much better advise to simply run a different hash function other than md5 that is either more secure and or uses a larger number of bits

md5 hash would be faster than comparison but slower than a normal crc-check

any hash function like md5 sha1 sha256 etc obviously cannot be 100 unique - because they have a fixed length and due to the there must necessarily be non-unique results for input content that is larger than the hash

this might look a little nicer than md5 hash but you would have to ensure url strings are not used several times

to protect your user s passwords you need to do better than md5 hash the passwords

of course calculating a md5 or sha hash is much slower than calculating a crc32

this command uses key as is if its length smaller than md5 hash block length 64 bytes otherwise its uses md5 key as key and not key derived using cryptderivekey rc4 md5 key like in your implementation

md5 is no longer secure and it can be broken with a good gpu no typo you can use your graphics card to break a hash

if you want to compare you re better off putting your result through getstring and compare the much less secure hash even less secure than md5 already is

once you md5 hash it you have to map that to the token that is less than that hash

onchange	onfocus	3
i know you mentioned onchange and onfocus though personally i tend to prefer onkeyup so that values will change as the user is typing

select onblur onchange onfocus

the purpose of this is to help none-techies who want styled selects and i therefore would like to capture any events they have added to the select such as onchange onfocus and onreset


uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	10
or there should also be a method settoolbaritems animated on the uiviewcontroller not the uinavigationcontroller which is perhaps better

the uinavigationcontroller is more of a behind-the-scenes organizer for holding and displaying other uiviewcontroller s

if you need to build multiple pages and each page has its dependent appearance and user interaction you could choose uinavigationcontroller to manager multiple uiviewcontroller instances and create and configure each page in its correlate uiviewcontroller

add one more uinavigationcontroller between uitabbarcontroller and uiviewcontroller

the app uses a uinavigationcontroller that never has more than 1 uiviewcontroller on it s stack

basically if the user is on a view under the more tab the actual current uinavigationcontroller you want to use to push a uiviewcontroller onto is the uitabbarcontroller s morenavigationcontroller property

the framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in size

the uinavigationcontroller class seems to handle better rotations than uiviewcontroller

the way this is set up you should be able to just select uinavigationcontroller instead of uiviewcontroller when creating your files from the first video

3c why does my uiviewcontroller which is inside my uinavigationcontroller has a longer height than the uinavigationcontroller


jqgrid	datatables	5
i am currently using datatables because it is easy to implement on existing html but would prefer jqgrid s theme support and hooks

if you don t have someone around to help with jqgrid you are better off with datatables

datatables such as datatables.net and jqgrid are more for displaying tabular data than inline editing in the same style as excel

datatables has better customizations as far as clientside bells and whistles where as jqgrid is a little harder to make look as pretty but can do some pretty good serverside interaction from what i understand

it turns out jquery datatables is better suited for customisation and we have adopted this instead of using jqgrid


onkeyup	onblur	2
find out when to check if you have a match onkeyup onblur .

also onchange won t work you ll need to use onkeyup although onblur is probably more sane


ng-init	ng-show	1
drop-down list angularjs adding default value using select ng-init and ng-show


lemmatization	stemming	6
you can also user a stemming which is a simpler version of lemmatization

lemmatization is relatively more complicated as compare to stemming that is why it s harder to find some ready and free solution

lemmatization should lead to better results than stemming source

p the second thing is porter stemming algorithm but then i realized lemmatization is much better for my cause.

2- consider stemming instead of lemmatization stemmers are much simpler smaller and usually faster than lemmatizers and for many applications their results are good enough

if you require that the words are still valid after this operation lemmatization will be a better solution otherwise stemming might be better because it is way faster to execute


eigenvalue	diagonal	2
i don t know what you anticipate your matrix band structure to look like but if it is symmetric and either diagonal dominant off diagonal bands along each row and column are opposite sign of diagonal and their sum is less than the diagonal entry or positive definite no eigenvectors with an eigenvalue of 0. then cg and iccg should be useful

because is singular t can be constructed such that the last element on the diagonal or even more diagonal elements if the multiplicity of the eigenvalue is larger than one is zero


scikit-learn	libsvm	3
the libsvm results seems much more stable but scikit-learn results have some drastic fluctuation

you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn

i recommend libsvm for this and the scikit-learn implementation is easy to use for this in python


aim	instant	1
i like to create a cell like contacts s add instant messages table view with two cells to select aim and home


avaudioplayer	avfoundation	1
i would recommend avaudioplayer in the avfoundation


super	extends	10
no java prevents a class from directly extends more than one super class

where extends is an upper bound super is a lower bound

yes super and extends gives inclusive lower and upper bounds respectively

here the content for the length item is this is a super duper long snippet because we need to see how labels behave when they more than barely extends onto multiple lines. the content for the power cycle item is have you tried turning it off and back on again

as you guys know when we create a new class in eclipse we can choose super class what we should extends at the same time like followed sreenshot

also if all your classes extends class super it s better to write instead of raw class

it s useful to know that extends bound is much more common than super

super is a lower bound and extends is an upper bound

after deciding you will then need to choose between extends and super

and in the case of generics particularly with the use of wildcards like super and extends things get even more complicated


qbs	qmake	1
please keep in mind that qmake and qbs are two very different build systems with fundamentally different designs and capabilities and qbs verbosity is in part due to its fundamental architectural differences which make it far more powerful than qmake will ever be capable of


metaclass	superclass	2
from what i ve learned so far metaclass and inheritance from superclass in python serve a very similar purpose but superclass inheritance is more powerful

why would i prefer metaclass over superclass inheritance


onkeyup	onkeydown	5
i read that onkeyup and onkeydown are better suited for this but since the assignment says use onkeypress i m kind of stuck with using that

for browsers that don t support either event you can fall back to onkeydown with a 0ms timer for the check which is a little better than onkeyup

i personally recommend onkeyup instead of onkeydown because it makes it easier to handle long press that way capture the event and just undo whatever you are doing when an item in the list is clicked

now it is certain that we cant grab key-event with onkeydown onkeyup onkeylistener only if the key-event from hardware key.after my test we can grab up down left right enter backspace back menu volumebuttons by override dispatchkeyevent but only in activity or just that i dont know how to override a function of activity in cordovaplugin

usually onkeydown is more preferable then onkeyup for such combo


mutators	getter	1
these methods which give us access to private members are known as getter setter or better knows as accessor mutators


crypt	salt	4
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords

that accepts either nothing a salt or a hash that crypt made earlier which has the salt to make the hash embedded in it

if you want to compare hash compare the output of your crypt call with the value in shadow both hash need to be created with the same salt

although you could tell dancer2 plugin passphrase to use a 4-byte salt it s much easier to just use crypt saltedhash everywhere


printf	strcpy	3
either the strcpy or the printf function is more appropriate

the above printf should work although strcpy would make more sense for that purpose

at first glance it must be significantly faster because strcpy must be significantly faster than printf


jscrollpane	jinternalframe	3
specifically jscrollpane have height bigger than jinternalframe

my problem is this i don t want the jlabel or the jscrollpane to stretch to the size of the jinternalframe if the jlabel is smaller than the jinternalframe

i ve found that in my jtable which is in a jscrollpane nested in a jinternalframe there can be issues with scrolling and resizing when the jtable was larger than the jscrollpane


afnetworking	sdwebimage	2
sdwebimage claims that afnetworking doesn t cache the image itself but just the http response so sdwebimage is faster in recalling the image from cache and presenting it

so i think afnetworking would a better choice than sdwebimage


gdal	ogr	2
when all you want to do is jam a bunch of shapefiles together or convert a large series of rasters to a common projection gdal ogr is faster to startup and run as it doesn t need to load the whole arcobjects com library to access one or two functions

fdo provides those features too interestingly thanks to integration with gdal ogr in some places like fdo provider for gdal but it feels more like a framework whereas gdal ogr feels more like a library


java.util.calendar	java.util.date	5
additionally using java.util.date is not good practice at all since most of its method are deprecated so i suggest you to use java.util.calendar which is more flexible

alternatively use the java.time classes if you re using java 8 or joda time otherwise - both are much better options than java.util.date and java.util.calendar

there are some rough edges in terms of the api but it s generally much better than java.util.date and java.util.calendar

its better than java.util.date java.util.date and java.util.calendar combined

construct java.util.calendar is comparative slower than java.util.date


inherited	properties	58
in that case my own properties would clobber the newer inherited properties

the difference between the two boils down to the syntax with which objects are instantiated - classical inherited uses the more familiar constructor functions and new operator which hide the inherent prototypal nature of javascript s object creation and inherited properties

you can encapsulate private properties inherited etc. leading to cleaner and more portable code

is more specific than agent stylesheets the default stylesheets that come with the browser and inherited properties are nothing more than something like this

i fully understand that the properties are more easily accessed as public and that normally inherited objects won t have access to them otherwise

less is a css extension that enables reuse and encapsulation of values color values for instance improves inherited allows a better nesting of related properties and operations also

not all properties are inherited read more here

you could also use the tag properties for this pourpose but i think that inherited will be more clear adding semantic meaning to your code

to include a .vsprops file in a visual studio 2008 project one could right-click the project icon in the solution explorer panel choose properties go to the configuration properties | general section and modify the inherited project properties sheets properties to contain a list of .vsprops paths

if you need a globally accessible variable or properties that s more suited to a base class that your classes inherited from

i generally use interfaces are too enforce a common behavior that a group of classes share whereas subclassing is more appropriately used in cases where you can achieve serious code re-use through inherited functions properties

counter1 can be used with instanceof and inherited but is more verbose and doesn t have real private properties eg count properties is exposed

you might want to consider the favor composition over inherited and treat the shared values as a properties instead of a base class and use an interface to treat them polymorphically

but using the prototype instances can inherited properties which means less memory and you gain a lot of flexibility

to access those properties or methods i need to make them public which defeats encapsulation or re-write them into my class which defeats inherited

bootstrap inherited properties for larger grids from the properties set for smaller grids

getter attribute on properties does not match inherited from nsoperation

if using tag properties isn t in principle i m recommend inherited treeitem

using dedicated methods for getting and setting properties is also more clear in inherited

just inherited from the keynotfoundexception class and override the message properties to generate a more meaningful message and then use your own exception class with a proper constructor

use rgba instead on the container div to set the opacity as the opacity properties is inherited by all children elements even text nodes meaning a descendant of any kind can t have a higher opacity than its parent

in essence an object inherited all properties of its prototype but an object s own properties has higher precedence than those of its prototype

the textfield abstract class which singlelinetextfield inherited from defines a tostring method but also value and values properties which are much better suited to what you re trying to do

if you don t select inherited future design changes in the dialog then the inherited design from master template - template name properties of the ntf will not be set it will not be linked to any of the development databases

in fact the best solution here would probably as often in real oop languages to prefer composition over inherited and to simply set the emitter as a properties of the person

this should handle all cases of setting the properties makes them easier to implement in your inherited classes and cleans things up

so i doubt the line-height properties is getting inherited to your .title from its parent so just check from where it is getting inherited and set the higher value for it

even if there are no inherited enumerable properties it is still more work to do than not

transparent means that the match inherited its highlighting properties from the containing block these rules do not change the way text is displayed

it not subclassing because subclassing inherited properties of superclass and add some more

extension or task properties might be easier to isolate since they re not inherited but they re less ad hoc

however i could not find it the documentation so it may inherited more than properties

rather see if you can t favor composition over inherited create a kind of proxy class for the sprite let s call it managedspriteproxy which implements all the methods you would call on managedsprite but forwards all the actual manipulations to its managedsprite properties

santaclausex is just inherited from santaclaus to add a constructor with a renamed parameter to match properties

you cannot do that on that way but you can access a properties s setter method from a derived class so you can use inherited for the purpose

however when i add this select menu inside a dialog box the select inherited properties from the dialog box and loses the properties of chosen-select-no-results

select disable for the debug information format in the properties page for stdafx.cpp then go back and select inherited from parent worked for me

inherited can be more about invoking properties and methods in an execution context similar to how we use .call or .apply and doesn t need to beget a massive codebase full of modules extending other modules only to end up treating them like completely isolated and individual objects anyway

if i m reading your situation right it sounds like you d be better served by avoiding inherited on thing and instead thing about category-specific attributes as properties of the relation between things and categories

yes you will have to create the constructors but that doesn t make inherited pointless although it is actually a good design practice to prefer composition over inherited that is generally not always it is better to have a cat that has-a animal properties than a cat that is-a animal

a half decent argument for properties injection is when you can t control instanciation of the class or when you have inherited where you would need to pass ctor parameters down but remember favor composition over inherited

there is not a solution at this time to inherited select properties from a plan when changing a plan s subscription

if you have experience with object oriented programming then call and apply will make sense if you compare it with inherited and override the properties or method functions of parent class from child class

prefer encapsulation over inherited having each of your current subclassing contain a complex properties with all the common fields

for the vm layer i like the containment pattern more than inherited and at this layer i also implement inotifypropertychanged which is also a properties of the vm and not the data model

this allows me to keep all of my models from having to inherited from a base class that has a messages properties and gives me more flexibility

now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway

since the paddle object has properties that are shared by both player and enemy composition is a better choice than inherited

if you want to use inherited properties it works more like this

potentially you are trying to model something in inherited that is better suited for composition or your base class should be taking in an object instead of individual related properties if the properties aren t related then perhaps your base class is doing too much single responsibility principle

multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state

if a browser s stylesheet does define a style for all types of element and this style has a higher precendence than inherited then inherited properties values should never be observed

favor composition over inherited give each class that needs the data one properties of a common type

inherited is more of an is-a relationship for example a usermodel is-a model thus all properties and methods of a model will be part of a usermodel

i don t see any form properties in the code you posted so either the posted code has been modified or the properties is higher in the inherited tree simpleformcontroller

the inherited and overriding of properties properties calls worked fine earlier

if you were planning on doing this for more than one properties i d recommend making car inherited from dependencyobject or implementing it from inotifypropertychanged instead of creating events for each

local beats inherited inherited beats default etc. you re just comparing the values of two properties sources against each other at the same level


coff	omf	2
windows dmd produces omf while coff is more popular now

watcom c c++ v11.0 seems to prefer coff when compiling and linking windows applications but generates omf object files for use with their dos4gw 32-bit protected-mode dos-extender


suffix-array	suffix-tree	1
i am interested in this because the factor oracle is easy to construct with 30 lines of c++ suffix-array needs about 60 and suffix-tree needs 150 and it runs faster than suffix-array and suffix-tree


pexpect	subprocess	3
you may find this task easier with pexpect which is a third-party module for automating subprocess keyboard interaction

to avoid the many problems that can always arise with buffering for tasks such as getting the subprocess s output to the main process in real time i always recommend using pexpect for all non-windows platform wexpect on windows instead of subprocess when such tasks are desired

if you plan to do something more sophisticated with the subprocess pexpect might be more convenient


valgrind	memcheck	2
when you analyze a program with valgrind memcheck it requires more than twice as much memory than the program would do by itself

by simple i mean setting up some compiler flags -wall doesn t show any errors or using such tools as valgrind used it with memcheck that didn t help much


gam	mgcv	4
i try to fit a gam using the gam package i know mgcv is more flexible but i need to use gam here

if you want loess-based smooths in the gam try package gam but mgcv has a wider range of penalised regression splines and has a more modern approach to smoothness selection in the individual splines

mgcv and gam does not depend on each other but since mgcv is more popular than gam many packages has dependency on mgcv for example car

if that is the case using periodic spline from mgcv gam is much better


capitalization	uppercase	1
i would make the conditions easier by ignoring capitalization by converting to uppercase before comparison and leading trailing whitespace by using the strip method


floyd-warshall	dijkstra	6
indeed floyd-warshall s algorithm is better than dijkstra s in this case the complexity for dijkstra is o m n 2 and in this problem m is much much higher than n so the o n 3 time complexity of floyd-warshall is better

no practically floyd-warshall is faster than dijkstra s for all pair shortest path generally

short answer floyd-warshall is more efficient in this case than naive application of dijkstra s

the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v|3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|

the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v| 3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|

short answer dijkstra s is your best bet if you want just a few shortest paths and the floyd-warshall algorithm is better if you want to find the shortest paths between every pair of nodes


lisp	rebol	1
aside does this mean rebol is more homoiconic than lisp


wstring	wifstream	1
the alternative i thought would be that i d have to do some encoding checks on the text file and then choose wifstream wstring or ifstream string based on the results which seemed more unappealing than i d like to start with


screens	tablet	104
take into account dpi is not related to screens size on the other side larger screens tablet have lower dpi than most modern phones

in my actual code i ve set the display to none if the screens width is larger than tablet size because that s the only time i feel like i need the button

if the app is running on a tablet or in a landscape view where the screens is larger than certain width i d like the listviews to have the data-inset property set to true and be rendered with rounded corners and borders

tablet mean that the default is that the screens is wider than it is tall.

correct me if im wrong but i think the apk for mobile can be used to install the app in tablet.your problem would be in the ui coz mobile has smaller screens than tablet

here in your example col-md-4 class is been used that means if you will shrink your screens more than medium screens size ipad or tablet it will starts responsiveness

it s hard to explain but just imagine that i move this layout to 300px x then on the phone it works because the screens isn t that large but on tablet it will probably not work because the screens is larger

my all menu with the brand should stay in one line in all tablet screens and the screens having higher resolution than it

a lower dpi makes things smaller and allows this tablet to show more stuff on the screens at once

fragment primary support more dynamic large ui screens like tablet.because tablet screens is much larger than normal handset

this only happens when the window is on a computer in full screens mode but when the screens is made smaller to a phone tablet size the divs function how they should

i have some buttons i want to order in a table layout and everything is working fine but of course a tablet screens is much bigger than a normal smartphone screens

which means a big tablet screens gets the lower dimen values and images and everything looks extra small

but the user is thinking of resizing the stage to lets say 1024 to 480 he switched from a phone to a tablet .and now the scale of the objects in the tablet screens are more than 3times before when seen on the phone

basically my layout has 1200px grid width but i figured that there will be a problem with 1024px screens resolution 20 of the population bla bla so i created media queries when the screens size is smaller than 1199px the grid to change its width to 960px and so on for tablet phones etc..

screens resolution i.e higher than tablet i.e col-md and col-lg in bootstrap language should only cover 11 grid with offset of 1

suppose you were to choose a new tablet and you wanted it to have 1 a big screens and 2 a screens that is bigger than 20cm

by contrast a nexus 7 tablet has higher actual screens resolution than an ipad mini but it reports to your web page a smaller screens size

my aim is to use a bootstrap 3 dropdown to display links at mobile screens size and use a list to display the same links when the screens is bigger desktop and tablet size

the tablet s screens must be larger than the phone s screens

i have a problem with textarea inside a modal means text not appearing on 768px vertically on the tablet screens but appear better on horizontally

desktops when in full screens have a more detailed data entry experience whereas mobile tablet have a different experience because of device real estate is smaller

because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a handset there s more room to combine and interchange ui components

this is because that tablet often has a lower density of screens pixels

it simply comes down to the space available a tablet gives more room to developers thus allowing developers to put more on one screens

it is quite possible that those large devices tablet have much larger screens width and height than a typical phone

just be aware that screens size categories like xlarge for example aren t tied to a hard number like 10 inches. instead official documentation uses terms like an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger ...

like most screens being no smaller than 320px width most mobile sizes in the 320â 640px range tablet usually around 960px

i have been working on this page that works fine in desktop devices and tablet but not on phones because the width of the page is more than the screens width i need to make this width responsive to have the page with height-only scroll

it s like the measurements aren t the same and even if i use align client the twebbrowser won t fill the screens of the 7 tablet which is more or less the a4 aspect ratio

on a tablet or phone which may have less than 750px screens width it will go off the viewport

the reason those two really high resolutions exist in mdpi is because they are only used on tablet which have a larger screens size...so the dpi rating works out to still be in the midrange

an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of it though it may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screens

this tablet has a bigger screens yet is still showing only 2 child views in the row

in this tab i load a activity called about.class this class loads a linear layout vertical with a web view and either one or two buttons call || email depending on whether or not the device is a tablet or a phone the buttons are wrapped in a horizontal linear layout of course this is to be determined buy screens size

if my app runs on tablet i put more fragments on the screens as there s room for this and i got just one activity in which i replace fragments when needed

i beleive tablet have greater screens resolutions than smartphones

if i try to distinguish based on resolutions it wouldn t work right since some high end smartphones have smaller screens but higher screens resolutions while some tablet have bigger screens but smaller resolutions

you can emulate a tablet using a standard android emulator included into sdk - just select tablet from device category on device definition screens of wizard

the screens is much smaller so you can not present your app the same way as you can on a tablet

my development environment uses dual-17 monitors which are far bigger than the tablet screens size of 10.4 1024x768

there is more than one screens size in android and what fits on a qvga 2.8 screens and what fits on a 10 tablet will not be the same

but when i tested my game on tablet it fit perfectly in height but in case of width game view width was shorter than the tablet screens width

the first time i run this on a device i realized that i was on a wrong track for some of the local phablets tablet mobile that have large screens has less screens density

a tablet offers more screens space than a phone

in portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes false

i ve come across this website and when you scale the page down to tablet size the logo which is ethan marcotte is in perfect ratio when the screens size gets bigger and smaller

in fact when a tablet has a larger than standard screens size the tablet with detachable keyboards available these days mobile versions of the site can look over-optimised for space which is the reason why browsers allow tablet users to opt to display sites in desktop mode

however the number of people using these giant tablet is much smaller than the number of people with small screens laptops

if the width of the screens is higher than 768px use the landscape layout split the screens into 2 applicable in landscape mode for phones and tablet

based on my understanding i hope that is because the size of the tablet screens which is smaller than the desktop that makes the strokes to get hidden inside the area that was not visible on the tablet however the area is visible in desktop

this will only be added if the screens width is smaller than 480px else the tablet version would show the mobile version

any devices 600dp and larger tablet have a larger copy of the image to take advantage of the larger screens real estate while all other phones use a smaller copy located in the bin with no screens width qualifier

you could make your css mobile-first meaning that all properties are optimized for mobile then as the screens gets wider you apply tablet and desktop optimized css for elements

youll want to choose which screens dimensions you consider as mobile might be hard as some tablet are barely bigger than some smartphone.

because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a

the image i have on my home screens and tablet display resize smaller to see tablet display are both set to background-size contain

they are for example too big in a phone and too small in a tableth because the screens of tablet has more centimeter than the pone screens

you will also notice that the fonts are not scaling as the 7 tablet simply has more screens space available vs the 4 phone

but tablet program screens will be bigger right

the content is longer than the screens of my tablet so i need to scroll vertically on a card

having different ones based upon screens size is reasonable bigger margins on tablet though the mix then would be something like res values dimens.xml and res values-sw720dp values.xml

the tablet had a higher resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels - found by checking the screens resolution through a right click on the desktop than the machine i had initially run the program on 1366 x 768 pixels

as an example my android tablet s stock video player app has a feature that allows it to be less than full screens

a bitmap of a screenshot can get really big on a tablet since the screens resolution is likely higher

using px as a measurement would actually be worse - as new tablet have high dpi screens meaning 100px is going to be visually smaller on a tablet than it would on a mid spec phone

owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone

if you want to force all the views to have the same ration on screens the only way is to give it a size dynamically after you calculated the ratio between the desired pixels and the screens density which is not really a solution what you need to understand is when working with various screens sizes each one suppose to behave differently a tablet screens is expected to be bigger and thus having more room for elements to show up on screens a phone screens is smaller and less elements should be showed on screens you need to adjust your view to support all of these screens and the proper way is to write a different layout for tablet and phones or even different layout by screens dpi

when viewed on a screens wider than a tablet to be responsive according to the smaller screens size like this

twitter desktop accomodates screensizes from around 1048px wide when you are on a screens that is smaller then that you are probably on a tablet or smartphone and if you open twitter from a browser on your phone you are instantly redirected to and prompted to download the twitter app

i would like to make my app available only on phones i.e devices whose screens sizes are less than 5.5 inch.how do i limit my app from being visible on tablet on play store

in practice this would be a tablet sized screens bigger than 320px wide when it is in portrait

i can t use screens size because of devices like galaxy note with huge screens and some phones have higher resolution than some tablet same with dpi i think

on tablet the screens size is much bigger and there is enough space for most of the action items that s why your menu is placed on top

the issue is that the phone screens height in landscape mode is likely much less than a tablet or pc

is there a reason why getting a location from a pc screens could be more accurate than the corresponding operation on a tablet or phone

so how i create my layout bigger than tablet screens using xml and just do something that will hide show the listview 1 or listview 2 to work using any tablet

not all tablet will have a larger screens after all

in mobile platforms except larger screens as on tablet the affix would be disabled entirely and the page would only rely on the responsiveness of the grid

also a tablet might be more suited since it runs apps in tablet layout mode versus a phone layout with everything being too large on a bigger screens

inside the container i have a panel with the text set to left but when the screens gets smaller then a tablet to something like a phone i want the text in the panel to center

i know that obviously a tablet has a higher screens resolution than a phone because it has more pixels dots on the screens from what ive been reading tablet also have a higher dpi dots per inch than phones as well

768px which applies for everything bigger such as large tablet screens and desktops screens

in this buckets put images that match tablet screens for example in drawable-sw600dp-mdpi insert a background with this size 1280x800 and for drawable-sw720dp-mdpi a background with this size 1920x1200

i know that when it does the whole configuration settings are representing a much smaller screens than the tablet s screens but how can i tell if this is a regular phone device with a small screens or a tablet running compatibility zoom mode

tablet have more screens space

to determine device is tablet or mobile i use criteria if device s screens diagonal is greater than 7 iches the device is tablet

another layout for larger devices like tablet where the screens width is larger than your image

since the screens of an ipad or other tablet is bigger than a phone s display and that would leave me with a bunch of open space i was wondering if there is something in codename one to have an image pop-up on a tablet but that it is not visible on a phone s display

you will see that mostly the avds with the bigger screens are way slower tablet are unusable on my machine hvga is almost like a real device

in the long run you ll have less troubles with supporting tablet multiple screens sizes and you can easily re-use them in different contexts

splitactionbar works only on phones because the screens size is much smaller than tablet and it takes space at the bottom for extra space for your action items

what i would like to do is use css media queries to have the title be above the tabs when the screens gets smaller or on a tablet or iphone

this way you get if the screens height or width is greater than 960px and the dpi is low probably you re on a tablet

for example when the screens size becomes smaller to a tablet or mobile you could do this as an example

i m trying use a grid layout but my problem is the layout showing bigger than my screens on the 240dpi tablet 1 5 times bigger

incidentally many smartphones and tablet do have higher dpi screens

if the screens is bigger than 1024px it should be green my tablet screens is but the background stays yellow

however i also need to support tablet which have wider screens

on a tablet i don t have this issue because the screens size is bigger and i make videoview always on screens

the desktop tablet version is working fine its when the screens gets smaller and the smartphone version loads the image doesn t work as it should

to ensure all tablet excluding any larger screens phone will use the new layout how should i name my layout folder

you do not have to provide different layouts for different screens sizes however the possibility of say a tablet displaying more data over a phone is there - so you may want to give the user more options or show the navigation constantly

that hopefully explains why a typical 320dp phone screens is always smaller than a 720dp tablet screens although the smaller screens can have more pixel than the larger


post	get	796
post is more secure than get because you aren t showing information anywhere

other than the fact that get has one character less than post i doubt there is any performance difference

for security http vs https is more important than post vs get

get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

when i try to update a post i get the following error no route matches post post id edit

in effect post is no more secure than get

also if you could post the exception you get could be from more help to find what s happening with your code

when post is better than get

post requests are much more complex that get ones so the parser lies in a separate package body-parser

in typo3 fe plugin choose defined by get post variables

no route matches get topics 104 post 55 like

gets have a size restrictions post do not or at least it s a configurable setting on the server and has a larger higher end than a get request would

so if your get request is longer than 255 bytes it s advised to use post requests instead

for something like a search where you are retrieving information it might be okay but for anything that stores information the post redirect get pattern is a better approach

i am grabbing order line items using js and sending them through as json and decoding from a table that is not a part of the form but the values get added to a hidden form field to grab using post still and the customer details added within a form itself

you re trying to grab get data but you are sending the request via post

anyone knows how to bypass this problem and get more than 100 post

my problem is that i don t want to get post with exactly the value of the price but i want to get post they have values greater than this value

you can send a lot more data with a post than a get

for now if post have more than one attachment i get n entries back.

i m following the tutorial for upload files in rails 3 because i need that my app s user could upload csv files but when i tried to save the file i get uninitialized constant customerscontroller csv message before change my routes to get customers import to post customers import i had other error no route matches post customers import what im doing wrong

the post get may fix the problem - get is much more lax with security than post

i understand that get requests are meant to read data while post requests are meant to alter data if a post request is sent more than once dicey things can happen

if there s match with post it takes priority and action under post is executed else get

speaking of get request types you should also know that get requests tend to perform better than post

that is the resource returned on a get had less fields than the one passed on a post

the scenario that came up in the original post was due more to the nature of the test and the author s not realizing how floating point numbers get rounded displayed than due to a set of conditions that might come up in the real world to cause problems with code when using np.where

edit based on questioner s comments if modifying a number in a url is all that is required to point to records the user is unauthorized to use would post perhaps be a better method to use than get

one more thing some guys would misunderstand that post is safer than get as user can not see the sent data

post is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url

that means - get all the post that have higher id than the current one

you can learn more about the how the default functions work get post delete and more about actions and parameters here

post has worse performance than get

route match get post admin student admin

this blog post is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to get the product key

post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url

i d recommend using post but get also works fine

the main error i get is no route matches post submissions 4

and if i want to get access to logged-in users post to be more specific post that user share from my fanpage is there any other workaround because i have tried using user_status and unable to get it work

if i choose post to the same url example-domain.com api example users the preview is again get request and not post request

post your mapping info and one of response s hit you do not want to get may help more

you can change the http verb near the url parameter to get post put delete or more

edit the above is mostly wrong this blog post might get you started faster

note also that in general it is best to follow the pattern of reloading pages with get after post which makes you less susceptible to form resubmitions in which case using sessions for storage is the better solution

route match get post uploadexcelfile excelcontroller uploadexceldata

firstly post can seem more secure than get

as powelljf3 said post is more secure then get though it can still be gotten to

and i get this error no route matches post post 77

none of the post have more than 10 comments so it wouldn t get out of hand

for example i d like to serve an http error code if the user tries to do more than x get post per minute but i d still like to enable that same user to burst up to y where y x until he hits the burst cap

i don t understand why if i count the number of items in the 2nd response the number of post is smaller than the number of post i get from 1st query

get is a better method in this case than post

o.s.s.w.u.matcher.antpathrequestmatcher request get doesn t match post login auth

i just want to know if i use post method for login api then is it safer than get method

in reality the post are much longer but the strings simply get cut off

there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable

i get the error no route matches post

for example post request are considered more secure than get request as creating a post request is relatively harder than creating a get request

obviously i could script each input into a get request address and replace the img src with that but post is more desirable and it seems there should be a more elegant way to make use of the form s submit mechanism

since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests

in addition if you have few data to send using get will url-encode the data this means that the number of generated sent bytes will be higher than the data size itself while post will consume more byte in general because the request will additionally contain a content-type application x-www-form-urlencoded header likely a content-length header plus the same url-encoded data as get

these steps were taken from this blog post which contains more details about how to investigate and what output you ll get

i am trying to submit a form but if i just put form_for classroom i get a no route matches post error

this blog post provides more info to get started

adding on top of zheyuan s interesting post did some more experiments to see that we can get the same results with intercept as well as follows

i get no route matches post users 8 trips new

here s the solution for post variables as well which is probably trickier for more users than the get solution

can i tell sinatra that i want to use get and not have it implicitly select post

one way that you can consider for hide information not totally but more stronger than get of user is create a json with your infos and send a post request to your page

you d basically need a set of procedures to act as controllers - parsing vars more likely as get post cookie performing any data lookup building + filling the model and then another set of procedures that at as views - taking what s in the model and rendering it for the user

in settings permalinks you can to select post name to get the post name in the url

i m not sure how to get at that intermediary table without deleting all clubs or all post or all post associated with a club as opposed to just select post

use post its safer than get if you use rest

when i first started doing web development ten years ago the conventional wisdom was to always favor post over get for forms and to have the application on the server side require post for form submission for precisely this reason

there are lots of post about using older versions but can someone explain why i wouldn t get the newest version

when the user opens the link in a new tab manually an error occurs no route matches get post 605 view

why everybody here is saying post is more secure than get when used over https

you can send them via get or post--though i highly recommend post since it changes data so using a get would technically be against http specs

post requests can provide a bit more context besides the url but for your question one could argue that they are just a more complicated variation of a get request providing some more arguments besides the ones from the url and in most cases one could turn a post request into a get request with a more elaborated url anyways

i m able to query my database below to get the result that i want but i don t want to have to iterate through all of the author objects just the ones that have more than one post

so it is considerably less then what facebook states in their documentation at least looking by the date however by count it seems you get more than 50 post

be the result of form data probably url_encoded and use the correct request method get is perfectly correct but coming from an html from post is much more common

if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject

the get is usually faster because it has no encapsulation sends data via url usually with a 255 character limit as post exists encapsulation by being sent by the body of the http request

in postman i select post to code i get

i would recommend using post rather than get for this since i assume it will make a change on your server

using get is much easier than using post for most of developers

if you re just handling get then you can just look for n n but handling post will require something more complicated

if one prefers post title before blog title you get two types of conflicting codes after google search

additionally i would advise that the your view explicitly checks that the request is a post and if not make the assumption that it is a get rather than the other way around as you have it this is safer as get and post are not the only request types and you definitely need to know that you are dealing with a post request if you want to deal with variables submitted in the post request

if you need to grab get post parameters

but using post instead of get presumably adds one more level of protection for xsrf types of attack it does not you need some form of explicit xsrf protection token with post or with get

we can send fewer data with get method compared to post method

if user selects post 2 it get highlighted twice

basically it equates the number of topics to the number of post so i always get x topics and x post if post is greater than 0

in other words i think post with x-http-method-override get header is better solution

is this why post method is more preferred than get or does it really matter in any case if it internally uses post or get

but for my personally preference any default state should be done before hand and not the in the script for example initiate your radio dom element to have checked property and then onload script call the post directly anyway post is not designed for this purpose just imagine post as to save something if you just want to get query some data get would be more reasonable

no route matches get post new because now the route instead matches no route matches get post new note the plural post

you should prefer post requests over get requests when you modify resources a news entry

get is slightly faster because the values are sent in the header unlike the post the values are sent in the request body in the format that the content type specifies

yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

using post over https is better than using get and http

but i believe sending data using curl with post method is better than get method

edit2 seems as if i m wrong re post being more secure than get

when i click my button i simply get --- no route matches post expenses 3 -- perhaps this is the wrong way to call a method

get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post so suitable checks for existance and ownership of the record would be important

now i want from all user that have more than 1 post to get all post except the most recent post

btw if you also post the question in apache user email list it might get answered more quickly

how can i get the post which have end_date older than today

is it more safe than get or post

try to sketch out your ideas post somewhere find more people interested assemble a group and get your hands dirty

you re also using method rkrequestmethodpost but making the request with getobjectsatpath so restkit is failing to match get with post

it s much more than post get etc

i think i generally agree with your summary - it makes sense that postandasyncreply is slower than post so if the caller doesn t need to get a notification from the agent when the operation such as putting value into the queue completes it should definitely expose a way to do that using just post

please note this is the best answer you can get without providing more input look at the comments to your post what are your printf results

the reason to use post for sending sensitive data is that it prevents data leakage via the query string although another way would be to use get with custom headers set although post makes much more sense

sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings

but i am lost a bit here because i am not sure how to set up the form get or post is better for this need

but do also remember that in your case get request looks more appropriate and as balusc says its not good practice to use post for bookmarkable page-to-page navigation

...the only difference being i select post it works and when i select get it doesn t

another reason but rather a minor one is that get is easier to exploit that post as there are more ways to trigger get request than to trigger post request

you are also limited at get and for some thing you may prefer post method

you won t get it done faster or better as felix kling said in the other post

so i m trying to send a formula with ajax before using passport for the signup it was working after using passport the post request to ajout-membre gets redirected to with a get explain more my code

i noticed once the length of a get parameter is longer than 400 bytes or 2000 bytes for a post parameter g-wan returns 400 error

when i try to save the file i get the error no route matches post customers new

post oauth token doesn t match get

you can get soap services to work on iphone but it s a lot more work than just get or post ing against an url

additional options are to show this via a timeout so it s only shown when the post takes more than a short time and to use some form of fadein not sure if possible with a dialog then you don t get the annoying flash on the times it s very quick

i know using post would make more sense but i am using get for specific reasons

post method are generally consume more secure than get because when we use get method than it can display the data in url bar.if the data is more sensitive data like password then it can be inggeris

get has the ability to outperform post requests

if you have more than one post with the same com_id in eve.com_id you will get multiple post in your result

why get method is faster than post

if you use post when get is more semantically correct it is less communicative of the intent of your request since post usually means you are sending a payload

the blog post i mentioned earlier says it s more about interaction did the product name get added rather than state

how you are getting the parameters in the controller will depend if you choose post get any

i also recommend using post instead of get since it s for many reasons including easy manipulating in url more secure nothing is secure enough without a high lvl ssl though and validations of some sorts

post variable to get data but the view.ctp file lets me just grab post without looping

added just so this post doesn t get down-voted any more -

the app.all means that the route will match get put and post request

other than that accepting a get request might be - depending on the server side rest framework - slightly more light weight than post requests

i would strongly recommend using post rather than get as get requests are assumed not to change any data

nb using post does not preclude the use of variables in the url - indeed i recommend using get variables to indicate the data you wish to manipulate and post variables to show how they should be manipulated

i need to be able to get the post that have had more comments than their comment_checking_threshold between their comments_last_checked date and the current date

if you edit your post to give some more information as to what is actually in your arrays you might get more useful answers

but if you want to get the username of the user who makes the post is easier than that you only need to access the request.user

you have mentioned that we can t use actions more than get post put delete which is not true

the problem is that some post types have way more post than others so i want to show only 3 post per post type to get a little variation in the loop

if this is an xhr endpoint i d recommend using get post to transfer the values to the server as a better best practice than constructing the url this way

but it didn t select get or post and it also didn t set the header

.ajax gives you a bit flexibility you can choose post or get and you can leave .post in current case

post or get is not really make difference in security if your code is vulnerable to injections post or get method would not make any difference or even you can say get is more secure because get url will be logged entirely in log files and if there was an injection in your code you can find entire injection code part in log files but post data will not be logged

get is better for some cases but it seems to me you should use post instead

but if today post is less than 10 post i will get back the yesterday post to query

a post request would not provide any more safety than a get request any half-decent web debugging tool can forge post requests

i m making a basic form in rails and for some reason when i make the form the action is blank and consequently i get the routing error no route matches post contacts new

is it possible to make dotnetopenauth accept a plaintext signature method for the request token endpoint along with the get verb even if the oauth 1.0 a specification recommends post to be used for this endpoint

so before it you should choose get or post but for example i will use post

get requests are no less insecure than post requests

i don t want to lose get or post values

you can use get or post both but in my opinion post is better way here

the amfphp library is not only faster than regular post get requests it also allows you to pass php objects into flex objects and flex to php

is there anything more i should do more than changing post to get

i am beginner in transactions and entity manager so i will just continue research to understand it better but maybe i get answer here sooner or if i find the solution i will post it

in the method attribute choose between get and post

give the resources a read have a go at implementing the functionality you need and if you get stuck post smaller recreatable problems with the code you have written

use post instead of get it s more secure

for passing complex type pass json string prefer post rather than get and user serializer to deserialize the string to person object

type book why do we need anything more than http get put post

i need to get the name and value from many selects with post like this

post gives you more options and dosn t have a limit on parameter query string length like get the only negative is post is slower by a couple of milliseconds to create the request

which changed the url but when i go to make a post i get a no route matches post londons error

you have to choose get method especially when you want to read and choose post when you want to write update database or file etc

what i am hoping to get from this post is a better way to do this or hopefully someone can tell me why is happening i know that the latter might be hard since it can be a bunch of reasons

currently when i try to post i get the routing error no route matches get topics

param should be params and therefore your data is not being serialized which would explain why the server is rejecting your post since post requires more privileges than get presumably

instead of defining method attribute with either post or get in a form tag is there any method to choose post or get method explicitly for each input tag in a form

because post method storing capacity of response is better than get response

please note however that you may still get some repetition if a post is assigned to more than one category

from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked

network latency is ruled out because get requests take more or less same time as local machine whereas time taken to first byte is more for post and put requests

replace match with post or get if you only want one specific http verb

i think the problem is when the page is loading to get second record from database when the pagination link is selected post values are no more passing to model page so might be the problem

moreover in case of multpart form-data encoding which is required for file uploads but in this case get request is not an option anyway post will be more verbose

they recommend using get primarily for retrieving information and using post for updating information

generally i ve read many time you should do ajax calls as get requests not post because post produces more overhead and traffic

not able to get more than 100 post in single rest api call for the linkedin company updates

route match get post my save-data mycontroller savedata

as suggested in the comments since you are saving data post is more appropriate than get

another post outlines some more details on this how to get master-master replication with subversion

properties names should match post get values in my form

all other get and post responses take less time without throwing a timeout task cancel exception

however i ve searched for a couple days and am not getting a definitive answer and i need a better understand of this so i know no better way to get more info than to post here

using post prevents this particular attack but is this actually any more secure than using get

i was digging through the flask pluggable views documentation and while i find the methodview to be very helpful for making restful crud endpoints usually i end up wanting more than just get post put delete methods under a base route with common decorators and so forth

i want to get all the users that has more than one post but

there are i am sure better ways to do the above and i will post here should i get to know more myself

actually what i want is using of middleman -table as a array to give table_code and get table_name and then use of that table_name to select considered post

at that point either get or post will work post is usually better

if you were to try and do a get to vod_assets bulk_edit it would not match the post vod_assets bulk_edit route but it would match get vod_assets id with the id being bulk_edit

by doing a redirect-after-post the redirected url which renders the results of your search can be made friendly and short while you can use post to pass more parameters in the request to the server and avoid the long query string associated with the get url

i can t help with the coding side of your question but if you re passing in a non-url input then the post method would be more appropriate than get

post is more secure then get and data transfer size limits are also there

may i also recommend using post rather than get if you re sending something from a form

match post event id to post#show method get

post request are safer than get but that does not mean are invulnerable

for security reasons i recommend using post instead get if you have authentication in this

i get an no route matches post products 1 edit routing error

i guess post would be also fine but get is always better for our use

most developers prefer post method over get for form data handling

if i do step 3 fill out the form with the single set of account attributes provided then submit i get a no route matches post transfers new error

this is better than using get comments api for every post to see if there is new comment

hello everyone i am new to django and i have tried a bunch of different approaches i have found online yet i still cannot get the value from my select dropdown after post

given the above how would i get a list of all the tags on a given post assuming that more than one user added tags

post is not better than get

i resorted to split the two in swagger list-without-search as get and list+search as post just to put the page in the swagger documentation also if the latter actually works also as get

however there s one thing we haven t considered yet - what if you never get more than 5 post

the user-submitted values would come in as and or and depending on whether your form method above was post or get i d generally recommend post in case there is a specific reason for using get like wanting to bookmark the page

no route matches get post 1 like

first you make post request although get request is more suitable for search pupposes

get is more vulnerable than post as it can be transmitted and stored

as per the blog post to give eclipse more heap space symptom is â you get unable to execute dex java heap spaceâ edit eclipse.ini with something like

i am setting the policy to constrained-resize to get rid of the extra column based on this so post tableview has more columns than specified

what i am trying to figure out is how to get the post that have less than 5 questions and answers together

however post data are not much safer than get data anyway

i would recommend using post method for this.since this should concern about security aspects get is not the way

my questions are am i right to want to use json and use a php file on the remote server that will accept it as get or is post better and what issues should i be aware of when submitting this for review through itunes

and of course use post method instead of get because get is more limited

update due to matthew s post i used an older version before but even after updating to 1.6.6 the version i use now i still get an error

i m not trying to sort the other two arrays but i want the elements to continue to match post sorting rather than get mixed up

get and head being much more frequent than post

i already build the function to receive by get but i think via post would be better

get and post variables are no more dangerous than any other variables

the ability to choose get or post

if you just want to test that your server responds with a http 200 for certain actions or load test your applications or that the response contains certain values then basic post get would be more suitable

has more than 500 post and get the feed of each category

i used get because is faster than post if you need it just to get a list of element for suggestions

get is more often used on unsecure type of datatransactions like for example a searchform and post is used when you want to make more secure things like a login form

when taking input we can use either get or post.the input is shown in the url when using get but not when post is used.is there a situation where get is more useful than post

i try it and i get all the categories and not just the ones with more than 1 post in them

basically i need to get all post items having more than 5 comment

and no it doesn t need to be post in fact get would be better semantically here because you re not actually making changes to stored data

i had the idea to switch automatically between get and post for example if cookie set because get is more fast and cache able and post is more save

i have links of term on sidebar when i attach more than one post to term it get repeat

this works for personal pages but i don t think it works on other pages to get everything on your wall not just your own status post go to your notifications page and select rss at the top where you have the options of getting either text message alerts or an rss feed of what s on your wall

but i get no route matches post pictures 12 error

i m trying to make calls in background like post get to be more precise in the didreceiveremotenotification method because they start to work as a push notification arrive

prefer post over get

note you are using a post method but a get method seems more appropriate in your case getvotes

get is faster than post

i would recommend using post or get depending on the variable size - cookies come with a lot of limitations and conditions

one big difference links are use http get while forms can use http post thus transferring more data without encoding them to the url as parameters

i m trying to get deeper with post and pre incrementors but am a bit stuck with the following expression

i recommend get method over post since you will just be fetching data

however using get rather than post is typically more appropriate for things like this where you are only selecting different options rather than changing data on your server

a get is a bit quicker and than a post in an ajax scenario

first off get is no less secure than post

or get post that have ids greater than 9 id 9

note that i am assuming a user can get invited to more than one post which seems logical

edit would doing it as a post rather than a get be better

using perl s dancer module if you have an any method which will match get post put delete how can you determine which actual method the browser used

they even told me i need to use get instead of post which not only does their documentation recommend post but get did not work either

you should check this thread why get method is faster than post

it is just an example that shows a scenario in which get is more secure than post but i don t think it would be a good idea to choose get over post from this attack reason

which seems to be saying that all http verbs other than get and post are inherently less secure and should be disabled in the web server configuration

post isn t more secure than get

also note that using post is absolutely not more secure than get because the request parameters aren t immediately visible in url

how can i get all post that have less than 18 comments

2016-05-18 11 14 53.667 debug 22312 --- nio-9999-exec-9 o.s.s.w.u.matcher.antpathrequestmatcher request get login doesn t match post logout

hope you get the more clarification by this post

i don t think there can be more than one get or post per request but per open connection certainly

no route matches get v1 post

using the ajax method really shouldn t take much more than using post get

i want to get similar related post that should be matching atleast 3 tags all post have more then 10 tags

is post more compact than get since get requests have to be url-encoded

i keep getting error messages like no route matches get post 1 comments 3

post will allow the larger data set and with jquery ajax you should send the data using the data object even if you use get

whether you use post or get doesn t make a difference security-wise but using post would be more fitting as you are changing state on the server

09 01 22.146 http-8080-4 debug o.s.s.w.u.m.antpathrequestmatcher - request get login doesn t match post j_spring_security_logout

however post is a bit more safe than get because get could be stored in the history

however you can use it for login even if i personally think a post or get would be the more accurate approach

i think this is better done with a post redirect get so the url can be bookmarked

get requests have more restrictive size limitations than post requests

i would recommend using post get arrays like so

i am aware that a post is better for this kind of thing but my question is is this expected from a get request

at any rate i think web applications that follow the post redirect get pattern are slightly more user-friendly but your mileage may vary

post better because codeigniter was written to favor post requests over get requests

when submitted i get this error routing error no route matches post pages 9

however i m not sure you want pass parameters via get if you have a form and url isn t callable from outside of your application post is far better

eval is more dangerous than get post because the submitted content can run functions like include which can access any file apache has read privileges for or shell_exec which can do anything in the shell the apache user can do etc

is get method is better than post method if you use a form

here are my curl options. i ve omitted steps that choose get or post and create querystring

note that doing this will get the values via post var instead get wich makes more sense since you are sending via post your form

now it is just a matter of defining whether get or post makes more sense for you and implementing the corresponding methods doget or dopost or both at your servlets

in a semi threaded environment you would want to also select post in the same manner to get the latest post for a thread but you would also want to select the replies that each of those post had

in my opinion post requests are not more secure than get requests and the data can be easily intercepted

i also found a post that suggests a less brute force method to get the urlroutingmodule to catch the combres.axd route

in such way you won t need to destroy post and you will get the desired result

...with that url i get a routing error no route matches get new so i m guessing a need a post route

in your case since get requests take far less time to go around than post requests that s why they re completing first

as mentioned in comments use the post method instead of get because post allows much more data characters across in one message

also as ddelnado mentions get might not be optimal for this post might be better suited

usually though post request are intended to be used for changing the state of the resource on the server so if the only thing you have to do is retrieving data a get is more appropriate

you can also chose to get more than 25 post at once

you should use either get or post consistently and for a search engine i d recommend get so that users can pass around links to results you can t bookmark a post ed page

to get more help with that post information about your table structures and content

a get post is easier in that regard

any pointers would be appreciated i d love to get this working as you can imagine doing the post synchronously is considerably slower than asynchronously

hence post is more secure than get

i need to select post filter out by category or and tag then get term_order from category attached to post

when i want to get more than 54 post i receive this error

after that is done you can go into security details where get is slightly less secure than post - see the comments for details.

get is simpler and faster than post and can be used in most cases

the problem i am having is that there isn t a timestamp field that i can use to page with and some post have way more than 5000 likes 5000 being the most records you can get at one time

use post instead of get it s better

rather than try and regurgitate the discussion based on similar queries i will post some links here that should get you thinking more about these issues

get is more appropriate than post for queries because of its safe semantics

so to summarize do not worry too much about the performance difference between get and post and worry more about the internals

you can feel like post is more secure than get all you want but it s a false premise

post request is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs

this blog post explains more on how to get an access token on android

you ll hit problems with larger submissions and file-uploads as the size limit for a get is much smaller than a post

removing this from the url get list post create delete destroy put update i get this error

a get request will be slightly smaller than a post although using websockets would give a more accurate figure

you can choose get or post here just as if you were working with a form

restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit

also i recommend using post instead of get

if comparison match get the category id of post_title and store the category id list into an separate array list and not match category id of post into another array list

post is not more secure than get as itâ s also send unencrypted

if its a rest-api call like post or get to be more specific then its is very simple

i ll get better with formatting and being more specific with the post

in the event that a get must be longer than that limit several people have suggested that it s ok to use a post instead

in some instances accepting a get rather than a post could make you more subject to a csrf attack

in this way is if the parameter arrives by post or via get the withdraw more

you can still mix and match post and get data on this form using the and php super globals respectively

the point isn t to prefer get over post the point is to use get where the request doesn t affect the data on the server and post where data is modified

curl commands seem to work as do some other post commands from older code but when i log out req.body all i get is

i know django forms uses post but in this instance i feel that get is more appropriate which means i don t have to use django forms but does that mean i also don t have to validate the data

no route matches post publicos tematica if routes says get

if you use alamofire this should work it also eases things for you so you choose get or post

when get is better than post

what you need to use is an xhr or ajax request to get the next 10 post it is much better to do it this way rather than hiding them and activating them as needed because even if you hide it the browser still had to download the content

i actually prefer get over post but there is a hash sing # instead of question mark

i did have some issues with the angularjs post get and not being able to update the scope.user value from the success function result of the post get and ng-hide ng-show being more involved for basic use than a simple #verifymebutton .hide

choose between post or get

basically i m trying to see if there is an option to choose get or post while calling sendredirect

as a user when i go to the payment page and fill out all the info and click submit i get the error routing error no route matches post subscriptions

if i get know some more info i will update this post

or in case there are less than 5 post you will get an error

this is my first post on stack overflow i want to get involved into more php that is the reason i got started today i will need more expert help in the future

the purpose of the rest api is to a store basic information about the planets in the solar system b allow get requests and c allow me to use post to add more entries in the database

characters post is more robust and secure than get

jsf favors post requests but you can still use get if you want -- it depends on your need and if the page needs to be bookmarkable

other post are for no route matches get mine sees the file but cannot load it properly

i need to create a menu based on that list but cannot simply list all post and get it because it is a busy blog and has more than 2000 post

apart from this you should also make sure to implement the four verbs correctly so that they match the sql commands get select post insert put update delete delete handle encoding negotiation correctly return proper http response codes and all the other things that are expected of a restful api

maybe i would mostly always choose post over get it s more tidy and refreshing and going back issues with post method are a thing from the past in any major browser they just ask you if you want to resend the data don t they

i normally use something like this tag.object.annotate num_post count post .filter num_post__gt 2 to get tags with more than 2 post

from my understanding it is acceptable to supply less properties in post and upon get you receive more data id auto generated by the server

also you can determine if someone is submitting a form or getting the form by checking if _server request_method post which is cleaner than using a get url parameter though i guess there s nothing wrong with the other approach...

however other application issues might prefer get over post for some state-changing requests and i do not think there is any problem with this

so is it enough only to use limit to get more than 50 post

i agree to get any blame here for such incorrect using of the sending post and waiting for more then 2 hours for response

it differs between people whether they use get or post i prefer post

while using get isn t that pretty in this case post could be more suitable you could do this

i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get

instead i m using post which isn t exactly bullet proof but still a better choice than get in this case

you can also add some get parameters to a post request which are received on the server side as long as the get url is not longer that 1024 bytes

note the post that was earlier marked as a duplicate how to get error event details in firefox using addeventlistener

if you want to get post that are newer than 60 minutes old then you need to include something like this in your query

2. i am not good with web services but would get and post be a better alternative as opposed to deploying my json file with the gae

but google-chrome and firefox take much safer approach by making a http options call to check what all things the web server supports as cors which domains are allowed whether supports get post etc and the next call goes with the actual http get request with authentication

when submitting json you might prefer using post instead if get

get requests are less secure because all the parameters are visible in the url while post requests are more secure as they are not shown anywhere in the url

data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post

so you can implement get or head requests just fine but post requests are trickier

i have followed modified code that dan gentry wrote years back in his blog post titled more relatedfieldwidgetwrapper â my very own popup to get the + sign next to foreign keys and figured out a way to load them to the next page my problem is i do not know how to back out of a chain of these

the post at has more information on how to get that access token

is post safer than get

to get the new post you select post which don t have a matching relation in that table for the current user

so i have a post system and i want the box to get larger as more post come in

when i try to sign up for my site this is the error message that i get no route matches post users sign_up

i do understand that get requests are less secure but in your scenario your post just doesn t seem to want to work

however whenever a post with a field value of _xsrf token is made to the server i get the iconic xsrf cookie does not match post argument

it s not any more secure than get but the general rule is that you want get for getting information and post for changing information

secondly i can t seem to get post to work from fiddler unlike the other http verbs

additionally ajax is nothing more than get or post requests that a script carries out for you asynchronously allowing you to use the server responses in a document without reloading the entire page

i don t recommend sending such parameters via url get it is better and safer if you use post form method

so select post instead of get in postman and put your body to the post body instead of address line

all good points however in answer to the question get requests are more useful in certain scenarios over post requests

use ef to create json object and use web api controller to get select put update post insert delete delete data

with the exception there is more data with the post than the get

post is a little more complex than get though

as far as security goes post is much better than get as the data is sent behind-the-scenes rather than embedded in the url making it the typical protocol for login info

i m able get only 1000 likes of the post.the post contain more than 1000 likes.how can i get all the likes

i actually like that having got the gold flag weight badge i m able to flag the problem post that are less obvious - the ones that 9 times out of 10 get marked as helpful but occasionally get disputed

on the server side you will also have to change _get to _post or _request the last one combines the get and post variables with post having higher preference

you could use a post instead of a get to allow larger files and be semantically correct

it could be get method also but i prefer post

there is a field in the post table named scheduled_date which i will get the post that are less than or equal to the current date

there is a problem here because i already have more than 40 get post request with different url names

how should i choose between get and post methods in html forms

also how could i save the current time for the time column so i could later on get post that are less than say 20 seconds old

where 404 may be suitable for get and put update but less suitable for post inserts

get and post are relatively common put is less common so may not be covered in your server implementation

first i would like to recommend using get instead of post so you can use and therefore have no need to adjust your buffers for this to work

the view looks great and even returns the properties properly the problem is when i click on the neutered not neutered link it does not toggle the field in the database and i get a routing erro no route matches post dogs 3

the problem is that even if i choose post from the drop down menu of postman it hits the get method..

the get request is marginally less secure than the post request

on an unencrypted connection post is no more secure than get

for example on the blog page of my current project i have two widgets in the sidebar one for latest tweets and one for latest music news however as you can see on this page the content of the blog post all test posts... are much longer than the height of the two widgets and would of course get larger as more post are added

i don t want to use the get request since it says in the guidelines of a restful api that it should use post for this purpose plus i might want to send more data than get can handle

this ties to another post i had earlier basically when the user clicks a link a script is loaded into the big div the big div which contains the smaller div later on i need to reload the smaller div but it requires variable available only in the big div and i cannot include them in the small one for other reasons basically the script works when you load everything at once but when you try to dynamically load the small div i get a invalid argument supplied error here is how my code structure

i don t think it get s simpler smaller than http get post and json unless someone can correct me

post requests can be much larger than get requests as get requests are limited by the maximum length of a url

give it a try works perfect for me what it is doing query get the all the post with a left jon with comments table so when a post has comment them n it also has the comment_date if no comments posted on the post then in result set it will be null so i have merged the comment_date with post_date so which post has the greater date for comment_date or post_date it will first and so on

i found sikhttprequest but i cannot find inside demo to choose between get post and put

i could do a post but get is much faster

it seems some operators do better with post s than get s - this is a feeling i get from what some nigerian users mention

i would also recommend using post redirect get

i basically know zilch of java but i m hoping someone can help me put something into that .parse function that would get me post that have dateupdated newer than 5 days

looking at http method definitions there are security implications that recommend post over get

1st select post or get better post

based on the op s example count is unique for each id cant group so after grouping by id and cant specify the logical condition for year in i if the first value of count is less than 12 get the sequence as showed in the op s post or else return the sequence of rows assign the output to pond

the plugin defaults to requiring a post request to logout but using the config setting you reference you can make your application more convenient to use but less secure by allowing get or post requests

from there when i attempt to create an account for myself to simply see the other pages- simple vanilla devise installation attempt i get a no route matches post registrations user error when clicking submit f.submit

i run the ab test several times with same results post is faster but get is lighter

and when i submit the form it s trying to post to the new action instead of the create action so i get no route matches post contacts new

here i don t like that the body of the post request contains more different fields then the body returned from the get request - but maybe this is not a problem

generaly get is shorter than post

no route matches get groups 5 post new

however a post request is less efficient as a get request - bear that in mind and only use post if you really need to

after you fill the dataset save it for later so when the record changes selects post you can then get the data that is already local for your comments

you can of course have only one table aka post and keep adding more columns that are unique for each post_type where they get filled in if relevant

is type get faster than type post cause i am curious how both work

ps i know i should use post but it has the exact same problem and i switched back to get to debug it faster

maybe you can edit your post and provide more details on your helper methods current_user the error message you get with the code above

when i try to get more than 100 post it returns

last to address other answers while you should use post data when modifying something it is in no way more secure than get

i checked my apache s error log on my wordpress site and every time i update a post select post and click update i get this error

to answer part of your second question with .net if the post is larger than maxrequestlength part of the .net configuration but smaller than maxallowedcontentlength part of the iis configuration you can create a custom http module to get at the portion of the post that came through

please edit your distribution and under the behaviors tab please select get head options put post patch delete for allowed http methods

and each post have a like_count integer field i want to get users along their post that has more that n post which is liked more that m times i do

i would like it to be more real time than post get so would like to use socket.io or failing that web sockets or failing that real sockets

do you i have to prefer post or get method for seo

let me know if you get it working if not i ll edit this post to specify more information

however it is better to do this on the php side and work more securely with post instead of get

the conclusion is remember page #2+ calls are get and the request data that you may have used and were working for post are no more valid creating a different set of conditions now reducing your recordset and creating a total count that may be 0 voiding the pagination system hence the 404

i think whoever said post is better than get when using passwords meant that the passwords would be part of the url in the get request which would obviously be bad

get is always faster than post

page is definitely received from the request as a get post var i would recommend get as it s easier in this case

compare get and post method

pick post or get

you would allow post get post is more secure to the php file and would then run an http post get request from c#

post does not match get

i was taught from him that using get requests was better than post but after reading up i would like to switch to post my only problems is i am a little unsure how to modify my code to switch over from get

ajax calls using get are more performant than post according to yahoo

post would be the better option though as get has size limitations maximum length of http get request

first i would suggest making your search form to use get not post of course this will depend on use cases and requirements but search forms should use get to make them more usable accessible

i have simplified the app so the post is shorter but the basic problem is that if i get test in workouthandler - it cannot recognize methods in wardenstrategies or loginhelper unless i also include those files in the handler they are already included in app.rb

1 reading other questions about the rest method for this proposes i think that i should use get better than post

get values don t destroy post ones you have to understand this a little better that s all

what i m trying to get is a page that displays 20 users per page will have pagination with the fallowing info it should show only users that have more than 2 post published

i saw something interesting o.s.s.w.u.m.antpathrequestmatcher - request get login doesn t match post login

now when i try to sort images within the edit_project_steps path i get the error actioncontroller routingerror no route matches post projects 1 steps 2 edit

at first to get post and get parameters is better to use

it just makes post and get requests code shorter and therefore easier to read and maintain

for example when i choose post how do i get a set of post that made traffic from that post or set of post that trafficked to that post etc

i have a blog post explaining more about the subject as well as i have created a django blank project in github so you can get that to have a start point of your project using vagrant

get method is not safer than post data never trust datas coming from the client side

if i select post method it appears that i cannot get on my browser

but when i submit the forms i get no route matches post account edit

for requesting information from the device to your web site s api i d recommend using get or post

if you want to check the password on login - get the password and salt fields from databse get users password from post and compare md5 salt

on that base a get is more appropriate then a post

supply more data upon post and receive less data upon get

i believe post is better than get

oauth 2 authorisation code flow access token request post oauth token doesn t match get

an add action like that would be better done as a post request partly for semantic reasons it s sending data rather than get ting it and partly to avoid annoyances like this

that would mean i d need to do a post rather than a get though get makes more sense when i m just getting some static data right

because your not going to get that using a shader like this by itself because as it stands it will only apply to objects like your plane but not the full camera view that requires a post image effect

so for creating a friendship post method suits better than get

i am asked to apply to all the actions of one mvc project for security reason says post is more secure than get which i disagree with

i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around

while your ajax send a get request read more about how to post using ajax and jquery

first decide whether to use post or get i recommend post to pass ajax data

i know my post became slightly bigger but i tried to state clearly my objective and my approach to get the job done...and to get expert opinion.

this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http get requests to restful urls is much simpler than http post requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about

while the post method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the get

also i recommend using post instead of get because get is cacheable

choose post or get or whatever type of call you want to make

it all depends upon requirement when you want to choose get and post and knowledge of these differences help you to make that decision

generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post

3 now pass that bean data to web-api which is written in php method you prefer get post most of the time in php it is string only

usual way with tagging is to get objects by tag but if tags are used by few applications it may give more than post

i have been trying get data out of new reddit post but theres limitation where you cant get data from more than 100 post

i m searching for the best method to get result with database contain more than 100000 post and more than 100000 cat

if you have nested data in your model this will soon get tricky to handle though and in that case a post is the better option

we provide a number of support resources which may get faster response than post on third party sites including the virtuoso users mailing list public support forums and confidential support cases

if your form is meant to create modify data you ll use post instead of get but get is easier to test

personally i prefer post methods so my code uses _post if using get method replace with _get

i know there can be problems with posts_per_page but nothing is working i ve searched a lot to get the query to display more than one post

also don t think post parameters are any harder to manipulate than get parameters

put and delete are often not used leaving get and post to map to select get and create update and delete post

q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t

however if you must use the same route you could separate them by get and post since post is more common with registration type scenarios anyway

however note that post is not much safer than get

i was reading the yahoo best practices for speeding up your websites some day back and they have very well explained why we should prefer get over post and here is the post snippet for your reference

no route matches get post 48 favorites

you can t get more than 20 post if you are a sandbox user

fyi don t use _request in php but prefer post get server.

post can hold more data and thus you probably won t get exhausted easily with length of data

you could manage more than get or post like put delete...

if you have the ajax use get rather than post this is simpler then you can test the response by just viewing the page with the appropriate query string

an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

you could use post here as well but get will be clearer as a beginner and refreshing won t invoke the browser s submit form again dialogue

although get may seem easier even for testing purposes for json you should use post requests

for this you have some one methods post get i prefer post

also post is generally considered better than get for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too

although putting data with post method little harder than simple get

get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does

post makes it more indirect to intercept and read the payload than get but not safer

request post oauth token doesn t match get logout 2017-10-26

if the post has more than 9 pictures related to it i only get data from the first 9

caching with an activerecord object creates a key that includes updated_at by default so if a post changes the first visitor that loads the post will have a longer wait time and every subsequent visitor will get the benefits of caching

when timber calls order_children duplicate entries post belonging to more than one of the menu categories get overwritten

use json for returning data but prefer get post variables for client- server communication

the usual wait time of the post is not too long not too larger than get so i don t think that should be an issue and post always gets back with a 200

basically ie sometimes caches ajax get requests so setting the ajaxoption s httpmethod to post is a less fragile way to construct an actionlink

i have been able to grab post from the wordpress database and get them do display on the website i made

the problem i have noticed is that sometimes the jquery post result is retrieved earlier than the load of the .js file has been completed so i get an error and of course the jquery plugin doesn t work

although i d recommend post for this you can do get although it gets a bit messy like so

select post or get as required and click the tick

sending a post request via ajax but getting the error above no route matches get

will create standard default restful routes for post and pages get post post get put destroy post 1 get pages 1 edit and etc

like this i may have more than two get post insert or update methods i have to acces this methods from my console application how can i map the methods i want cana any one help me here how will i define the routes for this

for api post 1 destroy get i get

i was trying to implement a simple search function to show any matching post but i get the error sqlite3 sqlexception no such column content select post

there is a default limit of post method which is 2mb which is way higher than get

post some samples of how your events are wired up and i get give a more specific example

usually get is a query string where data is passed through the url with variables appended to the url and post the data is passed through the request body post can pass more data then get

post is more secure than get this is just a quick example

at least in php post and get parameters are more easily accessible in comparison with json request body

sorry that this post is more of the and for further information... type than a direct answer which i think has now been given-- i just thought it was helpful not to get things lost inside comments

neither post or get is securer than the other in that way and so if you need security you should use https

it can be with post or get get is simpler

just copy the content of your code in doget to dopost it should work or else set form method get but in case of password validation post is better and write your code for validation in dopost

there are several ways to get post that are much more secure

what i want is a query that selects post and in all_tags field we get couples of id displayname is this way

post would spring to mind but i think get is a more appropriate method because 99 of the time you only supply a bunch of parameters to these types of actions

it is said that get method is faster than post but i don t know why is it

if you want to grab get or post inputs from a form or ajax use input get

although post is more secure as compared to get when ssl is present

and i think post is better than get

then update works but not new i get no route matches post user 287944764774

both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url

untested either choose post or get

i incorporated devise in my user model but when i try to sign up someone i get this error no route matches post users sign_up.user

what i want is to get all post which contains 20 less in the title

and post to map to select get and create update and delete post

i personally prefer post over get in this situation so here it is

on any platform you may choose between get and post for submitting forms

i recommend using post request instead of get and send the data as parameters not in the url

further i recommend to use post wherever possible avoid using get for form submits - if some users want to simulate a form submit via get make sure your application supports the desired parameters either via post or via get but when you submit the page yourself via a button or js prefer post over get

the pinoyyd post is neater and get straight to the point how do i authorise a background web app without user intervention

you should prefer post instead of get for submits that change the state

note i dont want to pass parameters in url in this case i prefer post over get

post is no more secure than get over the http protocol

i have tried doing the same request as when the page loads when this callback occurs and get the post that are newer than those already on the page

get is basically for just getting retrieving data a get should not have a body so aside from cookies the only place to pass info is in the url and urls are limited in length get is less secure compared to post because data sent is part of the url

while you don t get the whole post you do still have to query the database for the id of post with mood grumpy so unless you have lots of post it s probably easier to just go with the answer dorel gave

2015-12-31 13 16 09.657 debug 8116 --- 0.0-8082-exec-2 o.s.s.w.u.matcher.antpathrequestmatcher request get ws 849 3qaa31j0 websocket doesn t match post upload image

i m working through the rubyonrails.org blog tutorial and get this error when i try to submit a post routing error --no route matches post post new

you may also want to avoid passing your password as a url get parameter prefer post requests since urls along with any params are not encrypted and can be easily read

post get method doesn t have the same lenght limit you can use post to send more data than with get

note you can also use get but post is safer because the user can t change it in the url

but the post method okhttp is more slower than httpclient s post always more slower than okhttp s get method

i would like to know how to only get the post that the user either hasn t read at all no record in views or the post latest_reply.id is bigger than the one saved in views

if you have both post and get params with same name and if you using then it will take post variable only.because post has the higher priority than get

and when i select post after than i need get attached file to this post

this response thus assumes that a request using the post verb would not use the uri to transfer sensitive information or it would be no better than get

if you post for help on questions that can be resolved yourself without any real effort you re doomed when you get exposed to more complicated things

i get and error that said no route matches post message new

yes generally post is a better way of submitting data than get

get select put update post create and delete delete

you can t get a patent any more because with this post i will claim prior art -

however the item being queried is a select so i would prefer using get instead of post

to get the feed of facebook api but it only returns max 12 subattachments while the post include more 12 attached image

using post data is more secure than get because with get the details would be in the query string portion of the url

because in my server logs it s showing a lot of post with million of ping while the other pages have been get is a smaller amount of number

standard post request is not more secure than get one

bowler is pretty much scalatra + scalate with some enforcing nudging of the developer towards good restful practices such as proper use of content-type and accept http headers for responding and emitting html and json and dealing with get post delete and put in appropriate ways and making bad uses of get and delete harder

make the form get not post because the request is not changing anything on the server so get verb is more appropriate and also the get verb will pass all the form values as a query string parameters so you ll get the desired effect

this is what i ended up settling on using i will upvote and welcome all new post in this thread that get this done with less code

post has more capacity it can transfer more data than get

please always try to use post method for submitting data as it is more secure than get method

using post is more secure than get in the sense that data shown into the url in get request but not in post

as a pragmatist i m inclined to use get because implementing it is way simpler than post

if not get requests then they will probably get redirected as a get request and lose post data

this is server-side code node.js php asp.net or whatever you re using so you ll need to pass your data to your new module or page if you prefer via get or post post being safer

see how to choose between get or post here

match requests with get and post verbs to your photos show action

suhosin.request values should be equal or higher than get and post

the error i get right now when hitting the submit answer button is no route matches post quizzs check 1 - so it looks like it is not verifying the answer and redirecting but just searching for another page called check to display

is there is reason to prefer get then post

using the post method isn t necessarily more secure than get

if i search for a mobile it should fetch from category model and match with post and i should get a result

it seems that a lot of people have been confused by this post and started asking more and more to get the mentioned above fix

security wise i prefer using post than get as it gives at least some opaqueness as to what is being passed as a parameter and not anyone can just edit the url and play around

and your post will be better than you d probably get from using the blog api ymmv but i ve yet to find a compatible editor which did everything in ways i was fully happy with if your use case and expectations are simple though you might well be happy with this module but you should probably not expect it to be very useful for a while

if i need to display one 1 friends post i can do this simply but when there are couple of friends with more than 1 post i can t get the name and picurl of the user and it displays null in json response

blejzer answer is an easy and straight forward solution unless you are also working with spring security always recommended in which case you should prefer post instead of get for all modification operations such as delete to protect against csrf attack

get method is used for illustration here you may find that post makes more sense for this operation

following my comment on your original post here s some more information that will help you get through this

i prefer post over get because 1 it can hold more data and 2 it s not so easy for the user to tamper with

a post request can include all the information that a get request does plus more which makes it seem like it should be able to do everything get can do plus more

post is not any more secure than get

but i get a routing error no route matches post products 74 tracks 43 when i try to destroy product track

allowed http methods ensure that you select get head options put post patch delete

post can send more data than get

stick with post on any action that does more than get data avoid xss-issues

actioncontroller routingerror no route matches get post test upvote

but i get xsrf cookie does not match post argument error when post request verified the toke

i m trying to get cloudinary direct uploads working on a rails app using carrierwave and accepts_nested_attributes_for to submit one or more images with a post

in our case this one matches get word - this header could use get post put or delete words

in this case post may be better than get anyways

in order for me to get the behavior i was looking for i had to select post name as my permalink settings

with more information i get for this i will update this post and make it better i just currently do not know what to call this

regarding your question about safety -- the answer is post is absolutely no safer than get

post requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than get requests

i ended finding that post was more work than it s worth and that you could accomplish the same with get

i am using custom delegate methods but when i run this the get request is performed earlier than the post so i cannot get the key before the get is done

a post has broader application and is generally used to send persistent data to a server in fact prescriptively get should not be used for this purpose

when i try to delete that comment i get an error no route matches delete post post_id comments

however in the comparative table i linked get is listed as less secure than post

some may argue to use a get method for this opposed to post but i prefer post overall

based from this thread you can get the xml link to your gcal in the individual calendar s settings hover over the calendar s name in the sidebar click the arrow that shows up and choose calendar settings and use an rss-to-facebook service like rss graffiti ifttt zapier or networked blogs to post new items to your facebook page

get parameters are limited in size and post is better suited for this

eventually i went back to post because we needed the fix quick but it has been bugging me because semantically a get is more correct in this case

you should not be using the post method for requests that contain no actual data get method is better for that

get may yeild marginally better performance some webservers write post contents to a temporary file before invoking the handler

there are simple examples 1 2 for intercepting get requests in the documentation for http-on-modify-request however intercepting post requests is more complicated

have a look at this post it is probably easier to get the selected radio button by changing your itemscontrol to use a listbox with the existing datatemplate

using post would be easier but it will be get request

though all data is usually unsafe basically user data sessions are safer than the post or get or cookie or simply request and some server variables since you set it yourself

knowledge of get post would be better or ajax best requests

there are a lots of reasons to choose between post get put and delete methods or http verbs

if you are curious though rather than just trusting a book or a blog post it is better to make a simple example and take it apart - you get it straight from the horse s mouth and you learn a whole lot more

you can choose get or post as your request verb in your action method you can have a form collection to inspect for a null expirydate

this post suggests how to get and install an older package release but nhib 3.1 doesn t seem to be available stand alone from nuget

twilio will issue an http request you can choose get or post verb on twilio site to an endpoint that you create and your http response if the body is formed properly will issue an sms response back to the user

if you re using an encryption library to encrypt the data then you can use get or post but this will be an added pain and you might not setup the encryption correctly so i d still recommend using post over https rather than rolling your own encryption setup

you need to choose post or get

since you re updating i d recommend using post over get

i get far more than 50 post

from what you say you re trying to do a get post would be far better

also after you are done with your bulk import reduce maxtime and maxdocs so that any incremental post you will do to solr will get committed much sooner

the problem is that the post shipping takes longer than the call get alert then shows me the session variable not updated

from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes

post has a lot more advantages than get

i m currenlty putting each post in a but this just stacks all of the divs and i get a large space between post which are bigger

usually in ajax get method is faster as it doesn t involve proccessing post fields and as you are only getting information i would stick it

neither one of get and post is inherently more secure than the other just like neither one of fax and phone is more secure than the other

but generally post is slower and would be bigger in size than a get request

if the last 100 post have more than one share from the page he get ranked up or some superpoints

actually if you would like to retrieve specific task with all its details get request would be more suitable than post

of course as a general rule it s highly recommended to wrap your ajax calls in a unified method that concatenates the csrf token to the request be it get or post although post is safer and much more correct from architectural perspective so when you make ajax calls you focus on the business input values only and don t need to worry about csrf

first don t select post by post content to get post id

post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking

if that s the case how should i make the queries like get me the blog post which have more than 10 comments perform efficiently

im trying to select post title and two metafield values.but i cant get the correct query.y query is pasted below please help

and this so post getting more than 50 notes with tumblr api says you should use notes_info to get the notes

in my opinion the second way to achieve this is better because using get is not thats ecure in my opinion.it s easier than using post

select get post based on your provider api

i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get

no you should post to list and also regard all the points rakesh made in his answer so that you correctly match post to post from client to server or switch to get if that s more appropriate

post has a higher overhead marginally if we re honest but it all adds up but it doesn t become part of the url so can t be seen by say a casual observer over the user s shoulder - whereas get can

post has one more letter in it than get so it s less compact

however you cannot do anything more than get the content -- you cannot add headers cannot use post

2 as mentioned by mike brent get is wide open to easy and simple abuses but while his recommendation of post is better it s still open to abuse unless appropriate measures are taken see 3 below

now that you accept more than simple get post json or xml your model will have to distinguish between each request type and know how to parse them

i would be really grateful if somebody could post the correct syntax firstly so i can get it working and more importantly so i can work through a working example to understand what the function is actually doing

post data isn t inherently more secure than get data

use get and post for passing larger amounts of data

when you do get the parametres are written to url so you can access them easily on other hand it can be rewritten by user so post is more secure way

get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post

the get method is useful for passing a reasonable amount of non sensitive data between pages while the post method has less limitations and is best for more sensitive data

first of all if your instagram client is in sandbox mode then you can t get more than 20 post more clearly last 20 post

however it isn t clear how much the value can be for the standard tumblr api you can t get more than 50 post at a time

each page would have 2 actions a get that takes simple ids and a post which takes more complex models

if you use just that you get routes for index new create show edit update and delete - some of those overlap with what you have for match post match post id and match add_post

better than get use post method to send and retrieve user data

how come i cannot get the error to show on the code below the select post fine

you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever

some people say get can be less safe than post -- but to the seasoned user this doesn t make any significant difference because they can intercept and modify headers of the request

i want to perform a query on a mysql table to select post posted after a certain date but i don t manage to get it working by setting that date as a php variable

and if you find yourself with more issues after this post i check my github daily so logging an issue against my repository will get more help in a better place for a back and forth

or how is it better than post redirect get if the functions can in fact be used in solving my particular problem

the already-given answers really do answer your question - no prevention of xss is not a valid reason to prefer post over get

using post allows for more data to be transferred since get will append the values to the url itself

also try post ing using ajax as get is much more likely being cached

see how both clients under the prefix matches get for the path clients and directly below that there s an unnamed entry for post to the same clients path

posting your form with get instead of post would be more preferable in case of search form as u wont need to maintain any session and no need of storing values in database also

get requests have smaller limits than post in the specs

select post instead of get and enter the url of your node express app

so if you re trying to retrieve data prefer get and use post where you need to

get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it

i m working on a project where i have a set of post a post has many comments and i want to get all the post that have had more comments than the post comment threshold in the post comment date range

more over it seems that get requests are more lightweight than post under high load

one of your issues is that you are making a post to search but you only have a route that matches get on search

for eps is the same situation the post script is more readable but you should apply all necessery transformations on object before get its size

you can choose between post and get methods depending on your needs

post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks

a header redirect would pass along get variables if using but lose post ones

you can have more than one get post etc per resources by defining different routes

sidenote you are using a post in this case a get would be better since you re retrieving information only

when you use post data is a alot more safer than get and you can send large no

you could stick with using get but i just prefer post

i ve looked through other people s questions on this site but it still isn t getting through to me so i thought i d post my code and get an answered more tailored to what i m doing

this means the amount of data you could pass by using post verb is much more than by using a query string and a get method

however if you want to get more than one post rather use functions mentioned above i think the most important thing is to grab them in one db query and not in ineffective way one-by-one

to get rid of the annoying warning it might help to tell paypal to return to your website using get instead of post and send less of the important data back

i would recommend using post because get has a length limit

you may also try to signal the same page about a valid log-in by sending some information to the same page using the post or get methods post is more secure but i don t recommend it for this purpose at all

while users can manipulate post it s far easier to manipulate get

given http supports various methods like get put post delete and more like patch head options etc

i managed to create simple restful services with get methods but i can t imagine creating post ones being much more complicated

i need some advice on how to get the mysql to respond to a select query from post table within 3 to 4 secs post have more than 1 million records

how can i get rid of the post put data getting exponentially bigger

to choose between get and post is simple

however neither post nor get alone are more or less restful - both are strings of data just in slightly different parts of the request

if you re transfering more than about 512 bytes then using post rather than get should prove more reliable

one reason post is worse for security is that get is logged by default parameters and all data is almost universally logged by your webserver

that would select post id 4 and also get you the title of post id 2 stored in the field parent_title

also a post request would be better than a get if you re sending json

you need to check for the get although i recommend using post information before you run your update database code

edit taking into account what was said in the comments though it looks more secure and is recommended by w3 see touheed khan s answer post isn t more secure than get and as riggsfolly said

i am getting used to the post redirect get pattern i find it a very good procedure and it also seems to get me thinking more about page structure and not relying on asp.net events too often

now next time user open app it will show post and will get any new post or fetch more older post but there is no way it can detect a change in one of the post that it already have in client side

indexing and searching in solr is typically done through get and post making it easier to use as a piece of infrastructure for web apps regardless of what language they re written in

i get a no routes match post error

since i m against get and pro post which is safer method here s an example with post

the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that arenâ t under the attackerâ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual

get can be quicker compared to post as it is a one step request post sends headers first then the body of the request

3 imho using method get would be more restful for a method called getclientjson than method post

as it s widely known that an asynchronous post request is better since the user won t get a perception that the app has crashed while it s loading the long process


cublas	magma	1
magma routine magma_gemm has higher performance than cublas in some cases


srt	subtitle	4
i want to rename the mp4 files to match srt files so that vlc can automatically load the subtitle when i play the videos

ass supports more formatting options but srt is a simpler format and can be modified with the force_style option in the subtitle filter

srt subtitle are much simpler than ass and don t support rotation but you can manually add it with the filter

srt is simpler than ass but lacks features so you may need to use the force_style option in the subtitle filter


system.in	system.out	2
that s better than using system.in system.out

you could try to more accurately mock system.in by returning fewer bytes but not indicating the end of the stream until the next call to system.out is detected or change approach and use runtime.exec to spawn a new jvm and capture all output from that process


leaflet	openlayers	5
i was thinking of generating tiles to serve to openlayers or leaflet for display but my data has a graph structure that i would like to take advantage of and i think using neo4j possibly in combination with a visualization library like d3.js may be an easier way to build my tool

i don t really use openlayers for using geojson prefer leaflet but it would probably open in your local drive if that s where the html file referenced it

you might be able to use mapzen s system as well but i haven t tried their system with large amounts of features whereas i know mapbox does work better than leaflet and openlayers for your scenario

webmap toolkit leaflet became popular and easy to use while openlayers is more powerful

while leaflet aims to be more lightweight than openlayers openlayers is by far the more mature proj


tinyint	varchar	8
the choice of appropriate datatype entirely depends on how you ll be dealing with the table data in your application if any if you re having this table just for storing the records than varchar would be a better option since it ll make your data more verbose but if there s a processing to be done on the table data like filter results on certain criteria long names could be confusing when it comes to comparing them in the application logic and in such situations char or tinyint would be a better option

tinyint or int for that purpose is indexed faster and gives better performance in sort or selects than varchar or chars

as varchar n takes spaces much more than tinyint and your main table is table2 so the second scenario is more optimize

also the regexp only matches tinyint bigint int long and varchar as an example to get you started

i think tinyint is better than varchar in this case

generally i choose int or tinyint for that but if i choose varchar it will be more clear while seeing data directly from the database table or while querying it

same code working if i select varchar but when i select tinyint it s not working

using varchar is less efficient than using tinyint like aju john suggested in his comment but unless i m dealing with a really performance-critical or a huge table - i find it easier to deal with


prop	classname	1
basically i have a shared component that is used across the app and accepts a classname as a prop to get more styles on the parent basic


viewdidappear	viewwillappear	9
to be more precise between viewwillappear and viewdidappear functions of the first viewcontroller

it is much more specific than viewdidappear or viewwillappear

as for the second view controller s animations i don t think there is any other good way than doing it in viewwillappear although i would prefer viewdidappear since the outlets of the destination view controller are not set while performing the segue they will be nil

it sounds like you want to do that every time the view appears so viewwillappear or viewdidappear seem like better candidates for your needs

in this case viewdidappear behaves more like viewwillappear ..

suggestion is to put operation in viewdidappear but it also seems to work in viewwillappear and is slightly less ugly

actually as per view life cycle the methods are called in following manner init loadview viewdidload viewwillappear viewwilllayoutsubviews called more than once viewdidlayoutsubviews called multiple time and lastly viewdidappear

you may find using viewdidload rather than viewwillappear or viewdidappear may work better in this case you can set your view up with a loading holding graphic or animation trigger your asynchronous networking call and then once complete display the required information

often viewwillappear or viewdidappear are a better choice


oncreate	ondestroy	1
otherwise if oncreate is being called more than ondestroy receiver is registered multiple time and the app mis-behaves


wxpython	pyqt	10
but some people prefer wxpython or others such as pyqt

wxpython is probably easier than pyqt or tkinter i don t want to start a framework war

at least they are much easier to intall even pyqt is hard to code for me and wxpython is less attractive when it comes to looks

personally i favor wxpython due to its cross-platform nature but pyqt and pygtk are also equally good as far as i have heard

two words of warning against wxpython it is not possible to install it via the popular fink package manager on mac os x currently which makes it far less portable than pyqt and tkinter

wxpython has a very good demo and it can do pretty much anything which pyqt can do i would anyday prefer pyqt but it may bot be free for commercial purpose but wxpython is free and is decent cross platform library

i personally recommend pyqt a binding to the qt library but many people also like wxpython a binding to wxwindows

now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice feature

also there s pyqt for gui and wxpython mentioned earlier

in case of python wxpython documentation leads over pyqt and pygtk whereas in case of ruby ruby-qt4 leads over ruby-gtk2 and wxruby


jtextfield	jtable	1
that is pointless if you are expecting more than one output from your resultset you need something more than a jtextfield maybe a jtable


django	turbogears	9
in contrast to turbogears django is more out-of-the-box

you ll want some kind of framework i d recommend django or turbogears

compare the very active django tag on stack overflow with that of pylons or turbogears though and i d argue getting started is simply easier with django irrespective of anything to do with code

django turbogears others are are more complex but provide more features

i would recommend django or turbogears

as far as python frameworks go i personally prefer django over turbogears or pylons which i believe also have admin interfaces because it seems much simpler to get installed setup and running

i usually prefer turbogears but django seems to be more smooth at the moment

as well for all i know turbogears 2 or django have stronger support for exposing web services out of the box.

web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears


mouse	keyboard	86
this is one place mouse may actually beat keyboard especially if the current mouse cursor is far from your copy target or if you want to select multiple lines with partial start line or end line

so is there any event in js which would fire everytime user chose something from select using keyboard or mouse

if you plan on working off of the laptop by itself without external mouse kb monitor more than 60 of the time than the macbook pro with it s larger keyboard and monitor would be better suited

all is working i can select by mouse or keyboard

this approach using purely images screenshots and generating mouse and keyboard events is more similar to manual testing activities performed by real people which have just monitor mouse and keyboard

the net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switch and the switch would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days

i need to catch an event when the user selects option with mouse or keyboard

here is a minimal repro example i apologize for the boilerplate cod which will match keyboard and mouse devices and open then

autocomplete allows user to select item by mouse click or by pressing enter on the keyboard

if you are using x window you can grab keyboard mouse using node-x11 client

i favor keyboard shortcuts over mouse actions so i m heavily using keyboard shortcuts with all kinds of applications

doing it with mouse is much more slower than it can be done with keyboard

note i m trying to create a button that acts like a regular button if you use it with a mouse keyboard but have a bigger tap area for touch

do your users prefer keyboard or mouse and how proficient are they

so turning a non-vr game into a vr game that doesn t make you sick will unfortunately take more than mouse keyboard emulation

has no keyboard or mouse there is much less entropy generated

this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences

when i select using keyboard or mouse a value from typeahead s dropdown the ng-model in the input field gets populated just fine

there is an addon that can even remove the menu bar â you ll need to learn keyboard shortcuts this is a good idea anyway moving a hand to from the mouse is much slower

go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts

the first issue i am not sure how to solve is that i wish for the first three tabs keyboard media remote and mouse to be larger than the settings tab which i will change to an icon if possible

the term universal in usb merely reflects the fact that it is not a specific device interface such as the dedicated mouse or keyboard ports found on older hardware

this forces me to select with mouse and then use keyboard shortcuts to complete the operation

i really think you need an external bluetooth keyboard and mouse to be more productive

it s the most common and expected behavior just like windows explorer when you select files with mouse and or keyboard the information panel shows their properties

essentially you want the mouse to be an option but the keyboard to be a better easier more convenient one

i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

this will allow you to move the window with the arrows it is the same as some user posted before but using the keyboard instead of the mouse i prefer keyboard for this kind of things while i am coding

ie ignores the changed tab order when the select box value which triggers the change to the tabindex attribute is changed by some keyboard action arrow keys but does not ignore the tabindex change when the select box value is changed with the mouse see more detailed explanation

the last fallback is to go the snail way - to mouse over to click on the red close window button but any mouse movements are slower than a keyboard shortcut

your idea is good but have to consume events came from keyboard add there keylistener only with e.consume because glasspane to consume only mouse events

together with the nunchuck i have several axis that i can control but the mouse and keyboard are much more limited

since this structure is not exactly related to game logic and technically it can then be reused by implementing an interface for the callback so that you can use this keyboard elsewhere where you want to have your player to type letters using mouse it s better be separated from main logic

i need to connect more than one keyboard mouse with a single computer

this is needed for a game i wanna play where a mouse and keyboard are way more convenient but not possible

sendmessage type functions will be slightly slower since they have more coding inside them allowing them to work with more than just mouse and keyboard functionality

this code work perfectly but i can t able to select a item from the suggest list using keyboard up and down key only can select using mouse what s the problem

this is a radical concept i know but the mouse is slower than keyboard shortcuts

previously to run the .py file i d have to go digging through the buttons on the toolbar with the mouse and i tend to prefer keyboard shortcuts.

the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse

it recommends using ctr cmd + 1 to use the keyboard this is much better than having to use the mouse but i m still looking for a just do the right thing most of the time automatic solution

since clicking the mouse is significantly more difficult for me than typing i was wanting to make a simple program that would just run in the background and click the mouse for me any time i press a specific key on the keyboard

edit note that adding a save button can disrupt the edit flow of users click table cell edit grab mouse aim click save click next cell go back to keyboard edit ...

i try with previewmouseleftbuttondown but if the user select with keyboard or just keep the mouse press and then select it doesn t work

i am trying to make the function that is triggered when that element is clicked with the mouse be more accessible so that you don t need to only use your mouse but also a keyboard shortcut - so to trigger it on keydown - ie

for example i highly prefer keyboard based navigation - but even besides my preferences if my mouse batteries die i may need it to do something while my mouse isn t functioning

i need to change my dropdown menu which works well with a mouse but i would like to make it more accessible with keyboard

when you select a with mouse double click or with the enter key on keyboard the value is a|a

the only thing i can think of that is easier with the mouse than with the keyboard is resizing windows

while it is simpler with mouse keyboard is kind of tricky

i am unable to select a tab using mouse click but the same behavior works fine when i try to navigate and select using keyboard

check the grab keyboard and mouse input on key press option

some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs

is there a way to grab mouse and keyboard input on windows and still being able to read their inputs without administrative rights

unless it s a usb keyboard mouse and 8042 emulation is disabled where you would need a usb stack but you can use the boot protocol for the keyboard mouse which is simpler

but when i press page down button from keyboard it works fine but when i scroll using mouse takes bit more time to load data and scrollbar of gridview displays abnormal

when the grab keyboard is active i can no longer move the windows with my mouse it still works if the application move its window i can t access to context menus and the blinking | isn t displayed in typing areas

i want to do it with the mouse as well but i imagine it will be a very similar process and i think but i might be wildly mistaken that starting with the keyboard will be easier

i want to prevent control+a shortcut from selecting all the files in qtableview i want to make it as such that it can only select with mouse but nothing keyboard shortcut

getting proficient with a mix of sr and keyboard mouse is much easier than full hands-free operation

i prefer keyboard shortcuts rather than the mouse so these 3 shortcuts helps me a lot

for other readers not satisfied i ll tell my story before you read you must know i m that type of developers who love using the cli and thinks that keyboard shurtcuts are faster than using a mouse if you don t agree may be this setup is not for you

having all that said what do you suggest to keep both the hyperlinks and the select with mouse and keyboard ability

those that favor a mouse and those who favor keyboard shortcuts

for example do you use keyboard more than mouse

to solve this i made textboxes readonly but i want a better solution for this issue so that user can enter the date with keyboard as well as pick with mouse

i prefer using keyboard over mouse and on the interface have a general purpose text box which will act like a command line

if the file i select with mouse or keyboard without typing exists then save dialog asks me to overwrite with the message

choose add mouse shortcut not add keyboard shortcut

problem is when select item with mouse and keyboard they have a different style

like reading ev.mouse.x even though mouse did not move at all but that did not matter because your condition if allegro_event_mouse_axes is always true and contents of ev do not match mouse union part because it could have been the keyboard that caused the event so the resulting coordinates are nonsensical because there were none in that part of the memory

problem is that it doesn t take keyboard input it is only posible to choose file with mouse

in general it s more noticeable with mouse than keyboard

i tried removing the class of the div one by one but it seems that it would not remove the modal feature or the page does not respond to any mouse or keyboard click any more

i find most users prefer keyboard data entry as opposed to mouse click data entry - it is a lot faster

also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction

and then all your users are relying on your left right controls no matter whether they re using a mouse or the keyboard which gives you more control over how it looks at each stage

when i select that large items and select by mouse those names and move arrows buttons keyboard keys on texts caption of dropdowncheckboxes it will show all the names without change the dropdowncheckboxes width is it possible to do

instead methods like .live or .on since the former is deprecated are more useful with mouse and keyboard events generally speaking

it s a more stateless way to declare your mouse and keyboard events relying less on the required ordering of your rendering

seems your movie is not in focus so you need some mouse click on movie before it will grab keyboard events

the ctrl key is usually close by my keyboard hand and in combination with the mouse is faster than the page up page down keys

the entire taskpane loses keyboard focus to word s main window but retains mouse capture

from here you could select keyboard and mouse or hold the ctrl key down and select deselect individual messages from the list

for testing user idleness i already figured out that using low level mouse and keyboard hooks are more expensive than calling getlastinputinfo with a timer

for example if i were to select mouse and keyboard how do i write a code that lets me add together the cost for only the mouse and keyboard respectively and the cost for the computer


nemerle	boo	1
i read somewhere that nemerle s macro service is more powerful than boo s


lwjgl	jogl	7
i think lwjgl has a implementation too but the jogl one is better

lwjgl is much more aimed towards gaming with opengl where as jogl is more worried about complete and perfect bindings to opengl opencl

if your company s concern is to avoid big unknown libraries which is prefectly understandable i d advise you to stick with lwjgl which is smaller that jogl

otherwise i would definitely recommend jogl or its competitor lwjgl

if you want to use opengl in java i would recommend jogl instead of lwjgl

you are mixing libraries and levels of libraries jogl and lwjgl are both pretty thin wrappers around opengl iirc lwjgl has more wrappers for openal audio

jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access


aggregate-functions	coalesce	1
calculation in sql returns templatesyntaxerror at caught databaseerror while rendering column votes.time_stamp must appear in the group by clause or be used in an aggregate-functions line 1 ... select coalesce sum vote 0 extract hour from time_stamp.


d3.js	raphael	10
raphael is very much similar to d3.js but is more on thd lines of a graphics library and the added advantage of compatibility with internet explorer 6 through 8 using vml instead of svg.

the only place where raphael defeats d3.js is fallback

the two vector graphic libraries you can focus are raphael and d3.js but d3.js is much more powerful with data binding

this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at raphael which is snaps older brother d3.js is very well established as well

the only place where raphael defeats d3.js is fallback raphael supports older versions of ie where as d3.js is based on current web standards ie 9

d3.js is much harder to learn than raphael but in both cases you will also have to learn svg to be able to create better animations

raphael supports older versions of ie whereas d3.js is based on current web standards

on the other hand normally d3.js visualizations need less mathematics than the similar processing or raphael examples because there are many prepackaged layouts already

as it stands d3.js is not just better than raphael and processing in many cases but is also a viable replacement for jquery underscore.js and other frameworks

i am using d3.js with raphael to support the lower versions of internet explorer


daemon	cron	3
using cron should have less of a memory footprint than a php script - and you don t need to worry about memory leaks and the complications o running the php as a daemon

my first thought was to have a php script called by cron which could work but i m not sure if that s really scalable the best way to go about this would making a server-side daemon be better

but honestly cron is fairly lightweight and unless it needs to be real-time or whatever that means to you writing php into a daemon is more work than it s work


uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer	2
the one thing that argues against this in your case is that if you are not actually using anything that uitapgesturerecognizer offers over uigesturerecognizer then specifying the more specific type would be over-specifying the argument type relative to what the code actually expects

i added the check for uitapgesturerecognizer in case your class handles more than 1 uigesturerecognizer s and you only want to remove that


migrate	upgrade	5
i recently tried to build a method that would migrate an interaction from a lead to a customer when a lead is upgrade to being a customer

however if you are looking to migrate to vsts things are much more complicated and you will need to upgrade to tfs 2017 rtm at a minimum

vss sucks migrate to a real scm microsoft will probably help you seamlessly upgrade to tfs which doesn t have this problem

i did it an upgrade test on a dummy machine and when i get to the real thing i had to uninstall and remove all leftover db s tfs_configuration you can see migrate data from tfs 2008 to an already working tfs 2012

if you overwrite the env versioning the rake db migrate will go downgrade rather than upgrade if versioning is smaller than last known versioning in db schema so please check and avoid similar environment variable


opus	speex	1
it will continue to be available but since opus is better than speex in all aspects users are encouraged to switch


libsvm	liblinear	4
and i ve read that using liblinear is far faster more memory efficient for such tasks as such i ve ported my libsvm classifier to accord net like so

liblinear is considered faster than linear libsvm and often used for large scale data set

you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn

and how do the differences make liblinear faster than libsvm


outputstream	inputstream	9
map your image servlet on an url pattern of and get the image id or filename by request.getpathinfo and finally select it as inputstream from the db and write it to outputstream of the response

you have to open an inputstream and an outputstream optionally get their more efficient filechannel s and use a buffer to transfer bytes

when i want to write the full contents of a file into an outputstream i usually allocate a buffer as a then make a for-loop to read data from the file s inputstream into the buffer and write the buffer contents into the outputstream until the inputstream has no more bytes available

use nio it is much easier than using inputstream outputstream

java streams not to be confused with inputstream and outputstream do more or less the same thing as linq with parallel processing mirroring plinq

are writers and readers faster than outputstream and inputstream

reader writer since jdk1.1 in java are newer than inputstream outputstream since jdk1.0

what i did not expect is that outputstream is much less bytes than inputstream although i have yet to make any modification on doc

then instead of using datainput outputstream you should use an objectoutput inputstream makes it easier in my opinion


daemons	launchd	5
maybe it is but it is much easier than launchd agent in other session from daemons when implemented right with different corner cases support

what i thought is that if i can configure launchagent or daemons then i will provide path to mongod of bin directory of mongodb folder and provide --config and path for .conf file as argument and then i need to just launchd mongod using launchctl with name mongod and it will start

that code is all being launchd from a daemons thread created earlier

it s job is too launchd and relaunch and kill daemons apps including springboard i d guess

if you want more control over launchd background processes from ruby including properly detaching ttys and a host of other things check out the daemons gem


oncreate	onstart	5
but when i use listview.getmeasuredheight or listview.getlayoutparams .height in oncreate or onstart or onresume .the answer is always zero

instead you use other lifecycle methods that are more appropriate such as onstart which will be called both after oncreate when the activity is first created and when the activity is returning to the foreground from having been in the background

onstart is less commonly used than oncreate

in my fragments data handling is taking place starting from oncreate which happens earlier than onstart

and then you call this method at the end of the oncreate onstart could work as well but i d prefer oncreate


backtracking	greedy	15
for your code to work spirit would need to recognize that the greedy print_p matched too much and then backtracking to allow matching less

but this is not a good regex because matches zero or more times with greedy for every search it will go to the end then it will backtracking to match the

the capturing group 1 in the first pattern is greedy it first matches everything and takes as less as it backtracking

regex matches greedy upto the n in the string can t and then it won t backtracking to get the result of can t because you make the next pattern that is n t

since the next is not far the number of backtracking steps is much fewer than with greedy matching

the problem is that the first .+ matches greedy and grabs all up to the last and then backtracking

as quantifiers either greedy or lazy can lead backtracking better option is to work around character classes

traditional nfa engines run so-called greedy match backtracking algorithms testing all possible expansions of a regular expression in a specific order and accepting the first match

because .+ at the first is greedy by default so .+ matches greedy upto the last and then it backtracking to the previous character and uses the pattern d+ inorder to produce a match

matches greedy so the first first matches as much as possible the reminder of the string then backtracking until the forward slash can be matched

in this example we would expect the result xc however the subpattern matches greedy to ba and then never backtracking thus missing the match

if there is no match backtracking on the greedy quantifier

it doesn t show how to do greedy nongreedy matches backtracking matching within a line instead of the whole line and other more esoteric features of state machines that are easily handled by the re syntax

it works since regular expressions are greedy always trying to find the longest string that can match backtracking each time subsequent portions of the regular expression fail to match

but unlike greedy quantifier once they match something they won t give up the match after backtracking


zoo	tidyverse	1
unfortunately the zoo package doesn t fit well since it doesn t deal well with irregular spaced dates i don t want to aggregate rows and my data is too large to deal with this well and i have been trying unsuccessfully to figure out a datatable way to do this though i would prefer tidyverse given my experience


parseint	ceil	1
the math.floor ceil method being marginally faster than parseint and mod


allocator	stl	5
i d like to compare stl strings that are allocated with different allocator an ordinary std string with a string using a custom stl allocator

the boost pool library provides stl allocator that are more efficient when allocator objects of the same type as opposed to std allocator which simply uses new and delete

so my question is has anybody used this kind of allocator scheme in combination with stl would it just completely blow stl apart as i suspect

since the author of the specialized memory allocator has more knowledge on the size of the objects allocated from the pool and how those allocator occur the allocator can use the memory more efficiently than a general purpose allocator such as the one provided by the stl

i ve tried it with std map and found the seems to be faster indeed but my question is how can be the stl implementation be so slower than a specific allocator and what are the drawbacks of another allocator than the standard in terms of both portability and robustness


strlen	strstr	1
the problem turned out to be a loop in strstr which used strlen more or less as shown above


getter	setter	305
here is the combobox code i removed getter and setter to make less lengthy

indeed you ll handle php object with getter setter which is better in my point of view

properties specially automatic properties in .net 3.5 are more concise than setter getter and less lines of code less code to maintain less bugs

a public field is not worse than a getter setter pair that does nothing except returning the field and assigning to it

a public getter or setter gives you more flexibility - when we try and read the variable might not be ready

first option with var as local vaariable and two getter and setter defines better as property because it give option to control input validation and do custom code when setting value like raiseing event

had re-sharper detected that your getter and setter were going more than just assigning to and reading from the backing variable my assumption is that it would not be an issue

you should implement getter setter or make cserviceanalizer unique a friend of cservice

code with getter setter are considered better than direct private member access because those functions can then control all of the input output from those variables and make sure it is of the type range or whatever that the class expects

properties are every bit as powerful as getter and setter but are easier to write and use

people may answer later that self.__grade is treated differently but it doesn t make it private and as a beginner you are best avoiding the construct until you understand why getter and setter are far less common in python than in java and c++

we don t need the getter or setter it s more for convenience

in general you need a lot more than atomic getter setter for most kinds of thread synchronization

if your function is quite short like getter setter it is more common to see the function directly defined in the class definition

my hands-on experience is that i usually am better of with getter setter and constructors

netbeans for php v8.0.2 said to generate getter and setter methods just press crtl + i mac os and select getter setter option but it does not show up as an option in there

depending on your language you should prefer getter setter up front because you can t introduce them later i m looking at you java if it turns out you do need them

having getter and setter methods gives you more power as a developer over the class

the first file also has some potential issues such as declaring a method that appears to be a getter without declaring a property for the ivar same with the setter would be better to just declare a property

in chrome the object.create - getter setter is faster

now again placing cursor at next line of constructor closing brace click alt + insert and select getter and setter and again press ctrl + a to select all variables and hit enter

getter and setter make apis more stable

press alt + enter and select create getter and setter member functions

getter setter should be quicker too - no hashing of the key object is needed - a method is associated with only one stored value

for the sake of completeness i d like to add that using getter setter consistently makes it easier to override a class

getter and setter gives you more flexibility in general than properties

however synthesized getter and setter do more than just retaining and releasing

most pages for this exception i found with google talk about overloaded methods setter which is not the case with my dtos - they re simple objects with nothing more than properties setter and getter

if you have a team which feels more comfortable with setter getter why not

getter and setter would be more appropriate

edit 21.7.17 i understand that getter and setter methods are much more flexible but in this case it won t be needed

getter and setter are more explained here

if more protected setter getter might be a better option - you don t want to set breakpoints in every class that can possibly modify a member of the base class

i am trying to create one getter for all my fields using a switch case because otherwise i would have to create a lot of setter there are more cases than displayed here

anemic domain is when a product or other class doesn t really implement anything more than data setter and getter - no domain behavior

using getter and setter you have a better control over the data to be noted that in your example the setter won t be needed

then again in many cases like most javabeans usage the getter setter do nothing more than what you d do with direct access

if mac os press alt+cmd+s then select getter setter

although i much prefer specified getter setter for each property whether that s a proxy to a generalized or not

properties just offer a nicer syntax for getter and setter aka accessor and indeed a properties just wraps set and get methods under the hood

the more general issue of overshadowing a model field with a property setter getter is more difficult and prone to caveats ref

a getter and setter all look more or less the same as these two

and naturally a pragmatic design where you wrap the various records in a class the userprofile class with getter setter methods makes transitions simpler as you can easily hack in versioning at one place

in this case only although i prefer using getter setter always

other reason why getter and setter are better than public fields in java

i would prefer using setter and getter that way if way your change some implementation details for example introduce validation on value assign you jest have to change that in one place in setter.

for this to work the getter setter approach is a better fit

i think it isn t good idea put your list directly to actioncontext you can use session for that or better list with getter setter in you action class

please someone tell me that there is an better way than creating setter and getter for every bit field in my project

so either change the property name to deleted and keep your getter setter as is or change your getter setter to reflect more precisely the name of the property

getter and setter are better than public fields - but do you really need them in the first place

when you put logic in your setter and getter you make it harder to understand whats going on since many people will never look at its implementation

defining getter setter makes more sense when you prefix the variable to get set

however properties become very useful when the setter getter actually does something more than just assign return an attribute s value

it is often useful to have different accesses for the two most often a more restrictive setter than getter and so the likes of

so i think he has a point and it is this every time you press choose generate getter setter in eclipse or your ide of choice you should take a step back and wonder what you are doing

go to generate getter and setter and click on select setter

in general getter setter are better

generally i would recommend using getter and setter as it is cleaner more organized and more readable

the second quote suggests that without jit using a trivial getter setter is slower than direct field access eg

by using jrebel the magic that it does confused eclipse making simple getter and simple setter look more complicated than they originally are

if appropriate the exposed type of the getter setter can be a more generic or limited version of the actual field being used for instance a getter can be a read-only list allowing you to change the implementation perhaps an arraylist becomes a linkedlist without again breaking your api

one of the nice side effects of this structural change does happen to be performance but not because of anything inherent to java by focusing on classes and getter setter it makes it easier to really pay attention to expensive operations and caching

notice in the screenshot above that you might match getter and setter in resources generated classes to prevent this you can add a clause like

but sometimes getter and setter are a better fit

in that case you would want to make the getter setter method synchronized or better yet make the variable volatile which will ensure that the variable s value is the same for every thread

you can override the setter s level to be lower than the getter s level with either private set or internal set

other than the four options provided by the cookbook - return new user username password salt roles - i need about 20 more fields with getter and setter

note that the test bean has a very special design as the getter returns a more general type number than the setter requests integer

on the generate setter and getter screen you have select getter button on the right - use it

even more oop-like with setter getter

using getter and setter gives you more control over the validity of your objects giving you the option of testing values that are set to ensure that they are reasonable etc

i guess i was expecting those getter setter to be more passive simply recording state changes and then deferring to subsequent centrally-coordinated action

using getter or setter function is better

in other words the getter should contain nothing more than a call to getvalue and the setter should contain nothing more than a call to setvalue

depending on the rest of your code you might be better off with getter and setter

the performance of technique 2 is significantly better than technique 1 in situations where the getter is called much more often than the setter

dot notation can be viewed as a substitution for the bracket form of accessing a setter and getter actually use is more general but use is best restricted to getter setter

though making use of javac api in a nb modules hard to do something better than a getter setter

an other thing i prefer using getter and setter syntax instead of didset

i was wondering if someone could explain to me why field access seems to be slower than getter setter method access and also why the last 8 iterations execute incredibly fast

or if your getter takes parameters or your setter takes more than a value parameter

you use a getter and setter to achieve better encapsulation and to make it possible to change the underlying implementation in easier way

using getter and setter is more expensive because first the vm will lookup the method from a virtual method table and then make the call

it s really easy with flash builder 4.5 to do this just select your variable name and press ctrl-1 select create getter and setter select getter and setter and check bindable and create custom event.

i suppose having getter and setter would be more important for classes which are part of an api that is going to be used by others as it allows keeping the api intact and unchanged while allowing changes in the underlying implementation

if you don t need it to be public it s often safer not to due to getter setter allowing better control over what values can be assigned then you should declare if protected or private

in my opinion calling getter and setter is slower than direct access to a field

from there you can select getter setter or getter and setter

the annotations over getter and setter give you better control over the hibernate columns

if you have doubts over deciding whether to use getter setter over the class variables there are numerous explanations on the internet why getter setter are better

example for instance variable of string atype given below are the setter and getter used earlier which had no issues with struts 2.3.16

i recommend creating getter setter for fields where it can occur and filter it there

sometimes a class attribute could have more than one getter or setter let s illustrate with a silly short example

getter and setter make api more stable

adding setter and getter is better

my colleague told me that using getter and setter are safer and may prevent any accidental access

why the access modifiers for the getter setter is more restrictive has in my opinion something to do with easier implements interfaces which always have implicitly public properties

the more getter and setter you have the more knowledge about an object is required by collaborators of that object

of course if appropriate you can use just static access syntax public variables or static setter and getter which is even more simple and clear than first method

if you have a lot of fields i would prefer setter and getter instead of the parameterized constructor

for this reason i would prefer setter and getter for visibility and a listenable property for isvisible

so after you delete them place caret below all class members and press alt + insert on your keyboard then choose getter and setter and then select member you want to create in the first batch

in the meantime i recommend using getter setter instead of direct field access

your class that models the data and contains the getter and setter methods are nothing more than your typical pojo

if you need getter and setter to expose some instance variables or you want some automatic retain release memory management or thread safe accessor then properties are a less verbose way to automatically create these smart getter and setter

you can create all the variables then right-click in the editor go to source and then pick generate setter getter

this is slower than getter setter

one way to fix this would be to have the position getter return a smarter object that has a reference to the foo instance and proper getter setter

for example when the setter or getter function is more complicated than just the trivial

ok now fix version is 14.1 from this version of idea you can create and choose getter setter template directly in alt-insert menu

i think that the accessors getter and setter is far better at least in your example

select source and then select generate getter and setter

when using getter setter you have more control of variables being set get you can add validation truncation etc

invoke the menu alt+insert and choose getter and setter or one of getter and setter

as we say use the source luke and we re all adults here. we re all able to see the source we don t need to be fussy about piling on getter and setter to provide yet more hints as to how the api works

is there any nice scala way to format the getter setter to look more like regular java pojos

i generally don t write unit tests for bean classes with little more than getter and setter

edit well the simple answer is that the mere fact that a property getter or setter could include far more than just a field read write makes it undesirable not to mention possibly unexpected to allow the sort of sugar you are proposing

to my knowledge it s almost common practice aside from the .designer.cs files it seems to place all global variables at the beginning of a class definition followed by the rest of the code in any order i prefer getter and setter then constructors then events then misc functions

the code in the setter is far more interesting than the getter should it not take precedence and be defined first

in short private members with direct getter and setter are little more than dressed-up public members

it is nothing more than a getter setter for an object

if you want to specify extra accessibility level keyword you can only do it on one of the accessor getter setter and that level of the accessor must be more restrictive than the accessibility of the entire properties

locking unlocking in the getter setter is much safer you cannot forget to do it and more convenient the lock does not have to be directly accessable everywhere you use the property than an external lock on every property access

i think most people will recommend using setter getter

i would have used getter and setter but from the books that i ve read and the forums that i frequent i know that the general consensus is that having getter and setter is even worse than public fields

then in domain cardno.java remove getter and setter to make post shorter

however from time to time i want to set more than just setter and getter

you can always develop an application without using getter and setter methods.as you have explained.but using getter and setter is better practice because access modifiers private public gives you encapsulation which is oops feature

for a unity3d game i m working on i have a situation where i want a read writeable property with a trivial getter but a setter which does some more work

making the members private and providing getter and setter is no better than making them public in the first place okay it s a bitter better for debugging purposes but conceptually it s the same

do the synthesized getter and setter do anything more sophisticated than my straightforward implementation here

if you are not notifying or doing anything else then the automatic getter setter method is the quicker to develop that is not claiming it is the fastest or slowest to execute though

sometimes a property getter setter does more work then just hold a value

but on the comparatively rare occasions where it happens it ll be a lot easier with the getter setter in place

if you wish to make a more complicated property with getter and setter that do more than merely set the property without polluting the namespace you may hold the underlying value in a closure

public static field access would cost you less resources than setter getter methods

item class removed getter and setter to make it more readable

a boilerplate setter getter is no better than a public member

i don t think that you can have private properties and public getter and setter with swift code as the getter and setter cannot have a higher access control than the property

getter and setter create a looser coupling

but if some of the 14 parameters are optional it becomes a bit hard to read then i think either the use of separate getter setter is more readable or a paramater object mimicking named parameters

having getter and setter is a better thing in oop

in general encapsulation of fields by getter and setter leaves more flexibility for changes

i was trying to use bundles but it was suggested using setter and getter would be simpler

copying the description in both getter and setter is even worse

any suggestions as to how i properly set up the setter getter is more than appreciated

if we put our filter in between these calls either in getter or setter setter is more efficient as it is called only when filters change we modify original filtered list with our filter and return it back through the getter

getter and setter are vastly easier to debug especially if you institute safeguards that throw a runtime exception if the object isn t properly populated

no getter setter data-transfer objects are just data bags but yes getter can work better

writing first the fields and later the getter and setter seems a more common usage

but then your setter is less restricted than your getter which is odd.

for class-dump-z the -p option will generate property instead of getter setter which is more clear so you d probably type in

i think explicit getter setter are better in this case

this task can be easy done with getter setter method or with signal and slot but setter is more suitable here

your getter or setter is more than just a trivial assignment

you can do it using rhino 1.6r6 or higher with javascript getter and setter

your object literal cannot have more than one getter or setter with the same name

in the example the getter is still public like the entire property while the setter has a more restricted access here private

setter getter are more preferable because you can encapsulate some processing in those accessor methods too

i prefer using setter and getter because it allows you to manually wire up the object when you re not running it in a spring context setting mocks in a unit test

just use the generate... option or use alt + insert shortcut and select getter and setter

the first one setter anad getter can be more expressive than the second one tell don ask

hi i m trying to work with setter and getter in python for one class and i want to use the setter with other instruction so when setting the property value the setter do more than only assign the value to the property

getter and setter are better for extensibility they can make your life a lot easier if you decide to inherit from a class setter can also prevent certain errors by checking the values

do you recommend using getter and setter or accessing the member variables directly

the setter complexity can be higher than the getter and thus validate a unit-test

fields with setter and getter are more favored from style standpoint

benefits are multiple when given a choice choose setter getter for the benefits of data encapsulation and more control

to use it you have to expose create destroy getter and setter functions

a much better solution is to be sure that the code that needs a reference to the active and displayed itemsform instance has one either directly through constructor or setter getter method calls or better indirectly through a m-v-c program structure

then from your ide go to code generation options - choose generate getter and setter for both fields

just making boilerplate getter and setter is better but is almost as bad as public properties

what i think can help you a lot is something like the revealing pattern which would be a way of doing the getter and setter you mentioned plus more if you needed it

but it doesn t seem possible to roundtrip the geometry as there are less setter than getter the geometry cannot be re-constructed from an empty object just by calling setter

what you ll need to do than is to complete the javadoc comments for the classes and methods that are more sophisticated than getter setter or default constructors

in most cases access maybe via a method getter setter would be better or opening the visibility

python takes the position that getter and setter that do nothing more than access or assign to the underlying attribute are unnecessary

is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like

in generate popup choose getter setter

a property is nothing more than a getter and setter function

getter and setter property is just getter + setter allow for better encapsulation checking validity only getter not setter

sometimes getter and setter require more than just 0 and 1 arguments respectively so i put together something a little more comprehensive

on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter

pojo for person not pasting the getter setter to have less code here

getter and setter generations are more an ide features eclipse phpstorm and many others do it fine

if the getter setter is any more complex than that i would use get_x and set_x

this way is better than having getter and setter in base of performance not to have reduntant code of two methods getter and setter

in intellij idea when you tip alt + inser select generate getter and setter select your property and it s done

for domain objects take advantage of the ability to override setter and getter to make properties easier to work with

hiding state behind getter and setter gives you more flexibility to change the internal representation of the class state without breaking other classes that uses the state

setter are a better example but there s a need arising from the use of object-returning getter as well

i think using getter setter is simpler but here s an example of what i did to make it work

but getter and setter are better as a design point of view since hiding information is better

although plain and simple getter and setter might work better

a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.

c select getter and setter

edit added some getter and setter that makes it clearer how you access object info

and named accessor properties naps as getter and setter are there more to naps than getter and setter

i would say that sometimes getter or setter do more than just returning setting a value

getter and setter are no longer needed for most decent toolsets they will use annotations instead--just be ready for a few people to take a few extra seconds typing get followed by ctrl-space and not finding what they are after

yes you can however it is subject to the rule that your getter setter cannot have a less restricted access modifier than the property itself

therefore unless your getter setter get more complicated you can get rid of the locks and just write

is there any cpan module that would make this easier preferably with automatic getter setter generation

i would also recommend using getter setter instead of direct member access but this was just for simplicity of code.

this is tied to the framework although i don t know any language where a property has more than one getter or setter

of course if getter and setter do something more in method then it must be considered if it fullfils your needs

i prefer using getter setter

accessor properties with getter and setter are much slower than real get set methods

getter setter are better because it encapsulates or hides what the actual class is doing to set that data

and unless you want to have additional logic to the getter or setter you are better off not using backing fields altogether and use auto implemented properties

i d recommend defining setter and getter methods on the type and store the values in a slice in the struct

furthermore since at least in java you can only have the access modifier for an overwritten method to allow more but not less access than the superclass method you are still gonna drag either protected member variables or protected getter and setter all the way up in your subclassing

i prefer user getter and setter because is less code and more legible

when your curser is inside your newly created class then you can press alt+insert -- a dialog should appear and you can then select getter and setter

as someone has already pointed out in the comments your object is technically a pojo already however you have specifically asked about getter and setter which are more akin to javabeans

personally getter setter are the lesser of two evils

getter and setter also seem more extensible

i have the following model all obvious hibernate s annotations fields and getter setter are dropped for better readability

you can restrict getter or setter of the property for your needs but modifier of getter or setter should be more strict than modifier before property name

the getter setter cannot have a less restricted access modifier than the property itself

if you want to keep the normal assignment of a inside dosomething instead of using the setter seta 5 try creating the getter and setter using the refactoring key binding alt + shift + s and then select generate getter and setter

i prefer this solution to just making the vector data member public with accessors getter setter you have better control

if we create our own getter and setter that perform faster or synthesize getter and setter preform faster and why

from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getter is a better idea than member variables because the getter setter are called using reflection if placed on the field than a method

instead i was hoping to just put the logic in a getter setter that seems more appropriate to me

since i agree using getter setter is better way

typically you will use getter and setter to have tighter control over your data

the getter and setter make it more difficult to fix the problems since the client code dostuffwithaccount is now bound to the data-type we used to implement the account balance

property declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods

inside of your customer class i recommend using getter and setter methods for vip such as

properties with both getter and setter are more likely to be backed by a simple field - but there the setter may well perform validation checks and the getter may be lazy too

if setter and getter are better could you explain to me what practical problems would arise

access modifier on getter or setter must be more restrictive than the property s access modifier

using an ide eclipse netbeans intellij to generate the setter and getter would make things easier

what i find strange is that the getter for distance depends on status and the setter acts more like a setter for status

setter and getter are somewhat slower than accessing fields directly so if you are doing heavy maths and read write these fields a lot in your subclasses you should go for accessing the fields directly

these methods which give us access to private members are known as getter setter or better knows as accessor mutators

i also set the function as static getter and setter not used for more straightforward explanation

if you are using android studio just click alt + insert choose getter and setter and than select all your fields

you usually want to use getter setter to get more control over what can be assigned to a property and what can t

if the calculation is expensive or the getter is executed more often than the setter for the changeable properties playername by far it can be an optimization to change the property inside the class into a read-write property and set the value every time the changeable properties are changed

of course if getter and setter do something more in method then it must be considered if it fullfils the needs

choose getter setter

e.g. if the entity-first approach is full of getter and setter which are nothing more than in-memory representations of the database tables you can be sure that the problem has not been thought out

the reflective approach using an existing class like beanutils is less coding but probably an order of magnitude slower than calling getter and setter in a simple way

in practice i know that using getter setter are slower than using function calls and that function calls are slower than directly accessing public variables

private getter setter also make things clearer and establish which things should be seen by other classes and which are only meant to be used inside a single class they are apart of

plus being able to synthesise both getter and setter is a more complete solution

like i describe in the first paragraph use of accessor methods getter and setter is a more idiomatic approach and easier to understand for someone else using your code

is the code more readable with getter and setter that emphasize the fact we are reading writing a property or with properties that at first sight can be confused with parameterless methods

having said that i still prefer getter and setter since if at some point in the future you need to incorporate logic into the member changing a public member to a getter setter for that member will break the api for that class involving changes to all clients using it

and choose create getter and setter for ...

i would also recommend having setter getter methods in your array class struct as well

is there any advantage in those examples or does it only make sense when the getter setter involve anything more complicated than the simplified examples below

i am talking specifically in a scenario where the getter setter does noting more that get set

also note that they are much slower than proper getter and setter

the reason is encapsulation is far more than getter and setter

overall getter and setter are easier to program understand and change and they can make visible the costs associated with an operation

getter and setter also give you more control over what values the variable can be set to

the identifier property in myclass declares and generates getter setter and backing _identifier variable

then choose getter and setter

when you move your mouse above the name of the variable you can select create getter and setter for varname in the popup menu

the setter and getter for value assignment have been created with consistency and future growth in mind and foreseeing that some time down the road the setter getter may evolve into more complex operations

so i think before following the convention of getter and setter it is more important to follow the convention of variable naming

and in java prefer setter and getter

maybe changing the property definition to atomic and using the synthesized getter setter would be safer but the question about direct access to the bool var still stands

also i think getter and setter are less frequent change than other functions

the book states the following if you want parameters to be optional use property getter setter which is a better way of defining optional parameters than adding different constructors to the class for each dependency.

getting and setting is probably 2 orders of magnitude slower than normal getter or setter methods

i would recommend using getter setter

of course there are many things that make life easier with getter and setter pattern like hibernate that creates proxies on entities

example only the getter and setter could be more defensive

position the cursor inside the class then press alt + ins and select getter and setter from the contextual menu

avoid public attributes in class use getter and setter it s just shorter there

yes adding more code than getter and setter is fine in your domain objects

regarding your second example after the edit with the vector - using your getter setter makes even more sense than your original example as you want to give access to the values allow the user to change the values but not to the vector you don t want the user to be able to change the size of the vector

it s better than having getter and setter to do the job

i m wondering if there s a way to effectively force a type on instance variables rather their setter and getter that s easier than manually defining them

first in android best practices it recommends avoid getter and setter and also avoid creating short lived objects like private static final string name my name

getter are usually fine as the caller can t change the object but unnecessary setter can make it more difficult to reason about an object especially when writing concurrent code

if you have setter and getter it s no better than public field

you can compare it with getter setter methods in java

i find getter and setter are better way to program and its not about only a matter of coding convention

discussions about the utility of getter and setter should help you more in your first oop steps

since getter and setter are so cool when should we prefer public protected default object field

3 select getter and setter

hide complexity a getter setter could peform something more complex than just setting a value

i feel like the getter setter example is more clear and hides the implementation details of what name and description are

it means a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods getter setter

getter and setter are really more or less not that necessary as such

i recommend using getter and setter within your class

developer s guide doesn t recommend using getter when you can use direct field access avoid internal getter setter

auto-properties can have different accessibilities for setter and getter by specifying a more restrictive accessibility for the accessor for which the accessibility differs from the properties s accessibility

i added my own implementation not because yours didn t work but to show how you could delegate responsibilities to classes which reflect the problem domain making the code a bit more readable though considerably longer with boilerplate getter and setter

use attr_accessor to set getter and setter and utilize initialize better

if your getter takes more than one argument it s not called a setter anymore

if you judge that the code is more readable with getter setter after fields rather than after constructor you re free to do it

if on the other hand your getter and setter do more than just get and set they re properly complex methods then yes they should be tested

if that is the case i d prefer using getter setter methods instead in classname for an instance of someclass

when everything seems easier with getter and setter

if i just try to use the if compare logic directly within the min getter or setter when min is changed to a value greater than max i just end up with min equal to max

the property s setter getter could do more than just set the variable in your example it could also update the ui to reflect the change of the selected index or the getter could infer the index from some other variable in this case there might be a selection index path etc

in the most cases setter and getter do more as only setting and getting an internal field


httpclient	okhttp	2
but the post method okhttp is more slower than httpclient s post always more slower than okhttp s get method

httpclient is depreciated while okhttp is comparatively faster than httpurlconnection which is generally used by retrofit2


ember.js	qunit	1
this is why ember.js generally recommends using qunit


requestfactory	gwt	5
i recently got it to the point where i can retrieve data with a cursor see this link gwt pass objectify cursor from server to client with requestfactory and show more pages in datagrid

from gwt 2.1 requestfactory is better counterpart than gwt rpc when you use db4o together

so although many gwt afficionados recommend using requestfactory over gwt-rpc i don t think requestfactory can be used for this scenario

gwt requestfactory by design is slower than gwt rpc and gwt json etc

with requestfactory you pay an up-front startup cost to accommodate more complicated systems than gwt rpc easily supports


ctypes	f2py	1
even without having to deal with linked lists it s quite a hassle but ctypes are vastly more powerful and robust that f2py


for-loop	arrays	217
because of this your for-loop should check if the index is less than the length of the arrays by using the less than operator instead of

that means it should be first merge and then create distinct values arrays without using more foreach for-loop

my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2

change that to a normal for-loop using a max of 5 or the size of the places arrays whichever is smaller

i am just starting to learn about the streams and parallel in java and i was wondering why a normal for-loop takes less time than intstream paralleled at adding items to an arrays

i am using a for-loop which iterates i time and every time it is checked whether the ith number of the arrays is greater than 1 or not

but the for-loop is not reading writing the last part of the parent file which is less than the arrays size

also a regular for-loop would be more appropriate since you re returning the same arrays element that came in

also with the for-loop it s considered better to limit the scope of the iterating variable i and to use println you need system.out not just system and you need a string java arrays do not override tostring so something to output the numbers the user entered after loops like

a simple for-loop would be cleaner assuming employeehourslist is a arrays or similar

now i want to read each line from my table one by one and store the result into a arrays and i am trying to use a for-loop to be more professional rather then using repetition

notice that besides using the filter method or not even with a plain for-loop is much better for performance create a new arrays from scratch instead of mutate the current one multiple times

so which for-loop would be quicker at using the arrays

to my knowledge and research so far - javascript s native for-loop is quicker than arrays map for iterating through the arrays

while loops aren t normally used to iterate over arrays as for-loop syntax is less verbose and allows the sentinel variable i to fall out of scope while the for-loop syntax does not

i removed the for-loop and the matches arrays indexing and it worked

you should use a for-loop which is more convenient to loops in an arrays

however the for-loop ends when i equals the length of the arrays which gets shorter as values are removed

when rendering and binding to lists or arrays i normally prefer for-loop over foreach loops because it will generate required indices for the modelbinder to bind data to the model

so then i think to go with that approach i would end up with a for-loop and loads of add calls but surely that is even worse than the arrays copy isn t it

i read in the data in a for-loop and create a bigger data set by inserting an arrays for the area points for each datapoint

isn t there an easier way than the for-loop to build this arrays

my arrays can contain more than 1000 object so the for-loop can run for a long time and generate a lot of strings

the hits arrays is longer than numtotalhits so your for-loop limit should be numtotalhits instead of hits.length

use a for-each loops to go through a range it s not as fast as using a variant arrays but keeps things simple and offers better speed than a for-loop

or if data is an arrays a for-loop will give you more flexibility

the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be accessed once per iteration

the for-loop just initializes the arrays which that each slot in the arrays is .211 higher than the one before it

if you have only a handful of items in the original arrays say less than 16 then you can also count from 0 to 2 n -1 in a for-loop

if you can get away with using an arrays using a for-loop might be slightly faster than foreach

but for the arrays it is better to use for-loop as shown by alnitak than for-in

search for the string in the infowindows arrays store the indexes of the items that contain the string in the matches arrays and then use a for-loop with the matches arrays to add the markers from the markers arrays based on the index values of the matches arrays

but i don t want to use a for-loop as my json arrays has more than 3 entries and if i request a lot of data in short time it takes long time till the for-loop goes through every entry

rather than using a for-loop and continuously expanding y which is going to be extremely slow for large x arrays you can use the second input of sum to compute the sum for each row and then you can determine which rows sum to an integer by comparing the rounded and original versions using a very small epsilon the proper way to compare floating-point numbers

what you probably want to do shorten the for-loop to be more concise especially when you already have an arrays or iterator

the for-loop should give you better perf when used on arrays

but the outer for-loop still runs 9 more times pushing temp which is already a set number onto the numbers arrays

after that we make sure that the arrays contains at least two value to compare by starting the for-loop from 1 and make sure the size of the arrays is greater than 1 .if not we return the arrays as it is

answering your question based on additional input provided in comments in order to compare arrays elements use the index like or if within the for-loop

looping with a for-loop is nothing more than a basic iteration of an arrays using a for-loop

to use this in a loops you can write a simple for-loop which always checks if the index stil is smaller than the arrays length

or use the length of the data in the arrays which may be smaller than the arrays size and use a simple for-loop

also for printing arrays i recomend to use the enhanced for-loop it is easier

i am trying to create a method that will step through an arrays with a for-loop and if they arrays subscript is greater than or equal to the minimum requirement a string arrays subscript will be added to a listbox

i m working in matlab in which nested for-loop is used to collect data and store in cell arrays however i want to collect data and the inner loops is collect further in the same cell arrays according to its position

iterating pair-wise you d normally do something like but iterating over an arrays is faster than using a c-style for-loop

now you can walk your collection with a for-loop without fearing that one arrays is shorter than another one or even use a foreach loops to go through elements without using an index

and also i don t want use for-loop because it would cause trouble if the arrays size becomes bigger

you can do the whole job in a single for-loop reading from stdin look if it is larger than the max smaller than the min and so you do not need the arrays

shouldn t a for-loop be slower because of bound checking on the arrays

i ve tried using more than 1 for-loop and to zip the files using an arrays but to no avail

in this case instead of generating two large matrices with the row and column indices you can use a for-loop on the rows of your arrays it s slower but not as slow as a double for-loop

the longer the arrays gets the more iterations your for-loop will need

a straightforward solution is to iteratively create each of the arrays using a for-loop or list comprehension or use a higher dimensional arrays where each of these 1d arrays is a row in your 2d arrays which is generally faster

first build a new arrays simple for-loop which cycles through all elements and stores in a new temp arrays check for all elements higher than my arrays so for input 50 the elements 100 80 66 are higher so discard them and then my new arrays is 25 4 2 1

i used a 3-layer for-loop and a counter to check wins arrays against board_array but to no avail

it is clear without any performance tests that native javascript for-loop is faster but there is no big difference for small arrays like 10-20 small items

the few instructions you can run concurrently the for-loop and a couple of operations on the morton code arrays are much cheaper than un locking a mutex even using an atomic increment if available would be more expensive than the un-synchronized part

a for-loop is more adequate than a do while for simply iterating an arrays string

i suppose the first option is good for small arrays but a for-loop is probably better practice as the amount of code would remain the same regardless of arrays size

you need to leave the computation of the average in your current for-loop and then create a second for-loop and an int count variable which you will increment each time you find a number in the ba arrays that is smaller than the average

you can even shorten the for-loop by directly pushing the objects into the arrays which is a better way -

if your logic is calling for calculating totals of 4 consecutive elements of the arrays then your for-loop should stop earlier

then for-loop the rest arrays start from the second arrays to the last and if the size of the current arrays is smaller than the value of minsize then set both minsize to the size of the current arrays in the for-loop and shortestpath to the reference of the current arrays in the for-loop

edit #2 but this was faster than a for-loop for a test i ran on an arrays of a million points

and i want to do this for-loop faster fill up the output arrays which has a higher 2nd dimension in a cumulative fashion from its previous value .

but you will have loops the outer arrays in order to get it to work which would be better done with a for-loop so you reference both at once

then the for-loop only counts the words in the matches arrays transforming it into the object you requested

because if the first word in arrays is shorter than second one you need second for-loop

yeah i could do this the standard for-loop way but these arrays get bigger and the standard brute force way isn t good enough for me

edit using an enhanced for-loop is a lot better than using arrays

however the aim of this answer is to give you a modern approach for writing the same code using the std vector and the range-based for-loop since you are in the beginning of your learning process try as much as you can to avoid c-style arrays and learn more about the stl containers

i use a for-loop and a boolean with an if clause to detect whether the arrays element is larger or smaller than the input and then add it all together and display it

i created an arrays of skspritenodes and used a for-loop to make life easier

but modifying the arrays is more work than a simple for-loop again

write a for-loop that loops through your arrays taking the integer value of each item and if it s less than min save it to min and if it s greater than max save it to max

a for-loop is more suitable to iterate through the arrays

if you wanted to split the contents of the input arrays into multiple output arrays you could do that with .reduce by encapsulating all of them as properties of a single object but .foreach or the for-loop would look more natural to me

but there have been a few cases where i need to iterate and the arrays helpers are less intuitive and more cumbersome than the for-loop

then we can simply use foreach for javascript arrays .its a simplest than for loop..but as per the research for-loop is faster than foreach ..this is one of the good explanation for that

this is still slower than for-loop mostly due to intermediate arrays creation but much faster than stream version

i believe you want to move it into for-loop to get more random numbers in your arrays

in my opinion a for-loop is usually better for doing something a specific number of times and if you re just iterating over every item in an arrays foreach is usually more straightforward

yes you can use the values of the arrays to specify the lower bound and upper bound values for the for-loop

you can use array.prototype.find method to check if the element exists in arrays which is much better than perform a traditional for-loop

on every cycle of your for-loop when you need to delete an item inside your arrays just create a new char arrays which is smaller and copy the contents of the old one to the new except for the value you deleted

i would know how many segments to expect if using something other than an arrays for-loop would be easier

now the problem i am having is that one this model is called in side a for-loop thus i can get back many of these arrays each of these arrays is tied to a different user and two each arrays can have more then two arrays inside of it in fact some of the arrays that come back can have up to 40

also change your logic in the for-loop to be not since i will not ever be greater than the arrays length

or if the arrays is a straight numerically indexed one you can use a for-loop which is more efficient

defining every next jagged arrays arrays of each column in the for-loop would be trickier but i think i can do it using string to hold my numbers and then using .split to assign value to the arrays

the for-loop here is more efficient for 2 reasons a you don t have to construct a temporary arrays of tuples like with zip and b it returns false as soon as a non-match is found

you remove the element s which its value is i from the compare arrays instead of the element at position i which is not find in the second for-loop

secondly just some advice if there are several relevant keys in your application i recommend using arrays of pressed booleans truepressed booleans waiting booleans and twaitstart longs for handling multiple keys in one for-loop

but because of the overhead in the for-loop and the second arrays it is slower as the before mentioned arr.filter as shown by this jsperf

if you use the values as keys in the arrays of things you want to skip checking for them in your for-loop should be more efficient than using in_array

would an arrays be faster than a for-loop in this case

i completely failed to check that assertion and just jumped into the analysis of how the enhanced for-loop is faster on arrays than lists

for sure this won t work this way since your arrays will have more than 100 entries but with a second for-loop outside the first one you should achieve what you re trying quite fast

thus the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must

the below code works but i would like to automate the process with a for-loop or another method so i can repeat the same process on arrays that are much longer

comparing this against bluevoxel s code using a time-series of 50 000 data points and computing the auto-correlation for a single fixed value of lag the python for-loop code averaged about 30 milli-seconds and using numpy arrays averaged faster than 0.3 milli-seconds running on my laptop

also a for-loop is used to compare arrays contents--instead of grep --since it can be quickly terminated if a mismatch is found

specifically i m trying to store some information acquired in the for-loop in a different arrays i think there s a more efficient way to do this but we haven t covered more than single-dimensional arrays in class yet so no matter at a parallel index as the current interation

i also changed the for-loop that you had there to foreach loops which makes more sense when working with arrays

i ve found that for bigger arrays 100k elements it actually pays to simply iterate the arrays with a humble for-loop performing 30 better than math.max.apply

if the above is true doesn t this mean that the foreach loops is much slower then the common for-loop since it involves making copies of each element of the arrays

so you can access the arrays at any index between the range of 0 and array.length - 1 alas if you wanted to use a for in loops to iterate over an arrays you certainly can however a regular for-loop is more appropriate

seems like a for-loop would be the better way to go here but if you think you must use foreach you could shift the first element off the arrays and unshift it back on

or if the pages arrays contain more than one element you want a regular for-loop

in my opinion a for-loop would be easier than a foreach loops since you re using 2 arrays and a for-loop can give you an integer for an index to use for both

for more than three possible locations an arrays and a for-loop would be the nicer solution

i have to unset from master arrays which id match with arrays without for-loop please help me best solution

i think that use max reduction clause to find the max element of an arrays is not such a bad idea but in fact the parallel for-loop ran much slower than serial one

i tried this code with my the big arrays it is around 10 to 20 times faster than a for-loop solution and around 200 times fast than the old code

when summing an arrays over a specific axis the dedicated arrays method array.sum ax may actually be slower than a for-loop

according to the answer of the foreach vs for-loop question assuming it s correct for loops on list are a bit more than 2 times cheaper than foreach loops on list and looping on arrays is around 2 times cheaper than looping on list

in your code on line in the for-loop does no more point to an arrays --the compiler has no information about the length of the variable that it s pointing at whether it is an arrays a single chars or an int or something else-- but it is just a plain pointer presumably a pointer pointing to a default int

to avoid this problem a for-loop would be better since you already know the size of the arrays

im going to have a second for-loop that makes more arrays and names these arrays as the strings from my previous arrays

so i am using the music graph api to access and display artists similar to the current one in this case the who. however when i use a for-loop to go through the results .text artistnames only prints the last name in the arrays in this case it only prints pink floyd even though the arrays contains more artists. however console.log prints every name in the arrays

i have an arrays of integer and i am trying to iterate back the for-loop to the last index it visited based on some condition lets say i have 2 9 15 19 23 28 37 elements in that loops i am giving a condition that if each element of that loops is greater than a number lets say 8 it will process that element again

in such a simple arrays you shouldn t be concerned about memory usage but the for-loop consumes less memory than foreach because foreach uses an internal copy of the arrays

using arrays subscriptions and a for-loop are much easier to read

having seen a question here on so about joining strings i have done some testing and came to knowledge that joining a string in a foreach is slower than with a for-loop and using the indexes in the arrays

i ve used it for convenience a for-loop is much more reliable for converting an htmlcollection to an arrays

instead of getting the length method to treat a single element statement as an arrays i think a better solution would be to use a foreach loops instead of a for-loop to iterate

and if it is o n 2 then how is it better than nested for-loop where i just compare each char with rest of the arrays

this is a scenario where a traditional for-loop is more handy than just iterating over the arrays

so i thought maybe deleting the entries in the interpolated time arrays would be faster instead of copying to a new matrix but when an entry gets deleted the interpolated time arrays changes size so this for-loop would cause it to access outside the matrix

you can use a for-loop in this case extending one of the arrays elements is better than creating another arrays

but when looping through an arrays it s better to use a regular for-loop

i was trying to have each of these arrays sort_array added to a single multidimensional arrays by using a for-loop to have everything added to one arrays to make it easier to plot and export as a text file

readability is a big reason for functions using recursion rather than loops makes them easier to follow and for using the iteration methods where possible map to transform an arrays values-by-value rather than a for-loop

i would predict that iterating over a traditional fixed-size arrays would be more efficient with a for-loop and dynamically allocated storage would be faster with the range-based loops

it s slower than simple for-loop from 1 to arrays length and ipairs is deprecated in lua 5.2 anyway

note that you should check if index is within arrays bounds in such cases and that system.arraycopy is more efficient and arguably simpler than a for-loop for copying arrays

but to loops through an arrays you re really better off with a regular for-loop

note that this is one of those cases where matrix division of large arrays takes longer than a for-loop

second in your for-loop you are checking the a arrays s length which would make the code break if the other arrays have more or less objects inside of them

in addition for the second for-loop for printing int arrays you d better using x aone i .length instaed of x aone.length since it will cause issue when the number of rows and the numbers of columns in int arrays are different

the normal for-loop is useful when you don t want to visit every element in the arrays or if you have more than one loops variable

this changes the variable curve so that it now points to the middle of the arrays that was previously initialized so that the follow-on for-loop indexing is likely easier for the programmer to think about and a bit cleaner to write debug etc

as mentioned above as you remove items the arrays gets smaller so a for-loop is probably not the best solution

if you insist on having the data in 2 arrays it is easier to iterate the arrays using a for-loop with an index instead of a foreach loops

you get the recursive formula from the inner for-loop that iterates over the arrays of primes lower than sqrt n approximated by sqrt n 1 2 â ln n and the work you have to do to come this far represented by t n-2

then continue on to your for-loop so the flowesttemp will be at least the value of the first element if not lower if any subsequent arrays elements are lower

when i try to access it with a for-loop where its index is less than the arrays length i get the following error message typeerror function object is unsubscriptable

with one arrays one can do which is easier than a for-loop

the only way to copy arrays that is more efficient than for-loop coding is system.arraycopy

yesterday i was testing whether using a for-loop for adding up elements in and arrays was worse than using the built-in matlab function sum as far i understand this should be the case since built-in functions are pre-compiled however i got some weird results

running a quick benchmark it seems that the for-loop is 4x faster even in the worst case where you have to replace every single time and you construct a new arrays to hold the replacements

the problem is if i jump over that value which is negative with my while loops to get the higher k i will have to pass the same k in my for-loop which i don t want to because i already got it in my arrays

in its implementation foreach executes a closure over every element in the arrays this is typically more straightforward and transparent alternative to old-fashioned for-loop

the for-loop will take too long if my arrays has more than 100 items

the idea is that when all the values inside the arrays are greater than zero the for-loop breaks

your for-loop iterates over compares loops variable to menunames.length while your using the indexer of the items arrays

note that a for-loop with a pre-allocated result arrays will be more performant

for example sometimes a for-loop is faster than the built-in arrays methods in some browsers

is there a simpler way than a for-loop to create this arrays or no

now i am using a for-loop to iterate over these frames and add 10 frames in prior and after the erroneous frames in order to get a sequence so that in the end the arrays is more populated

this can be done in much better fashion by avoiding for-loop provided if you choose to change your arrays structure with predefined index some thing like var

the questions should i use for-loop or is it better to do it recursively next insert will be called after previous is done should i check if saved.length datalength and then return the arrays or is there some better way how to do it

but at this situation i have to compare with arrays of users user id as i mentioned above i wrote for-loop in above code as

wondering if there is an easier way with a for-loop - looping through an arrays or similar

but then normal for-loop is far better for arrays than using for-in which is actually for object

next i can use 3rd 4th and 5th level of arrays means more than for-loop statement will be assign

as seen in this comparison using for-loop with counter set to the size of the arrays is significantly faster than for each loops

i fixed this by adding after the for-loop and before the return statement which fixes the problem but if the for-loop is written to continue while i is less than the arrays length and when the arrays only contains a the length is one and i is 0 shouldn t it also pop a

the for-loop iterates from 0 to the length of arrays which equals longstring.length less 1

.each is an internal iterator and i m pretty sure the for-loop will run slower than the enumerable each method that arrays inherit

try catch inside for-loop is probably closer as long as you don t mind the unassigned values left in the arrays

you can give an arrays which have higher count as data source to tableview then you can use for-loop in cellforrowatindexpath to check the values are matching or not

notice that i have added a check in the for-loop that will make sure you don t create an infinite loops by requesting more unique items than the arrimgs arrays can provide

what is even better is oleksiy s solution because surprisingly .foreach method uses less memory than classic for-loop so if you re optimisation freak use .foreach but after all it doesn t matter because your arrays size is small so you won t notice any speed difference

so when you go up an arrays 0-9 you want the top of a for-loop to be less than the arrays length when you are going down the arrays 9-0 you want the lower bound to be less than or equal to the bottom of the arrays otherwise you will start out trying to access at 10 the arrays length and get an outofrangeexception

if you just need to pass numbers and run a list of jobs with the same command except the input file number it s better to use a job arrays instead of a for-loop as job arrays would have less burden on the job scheduler

it turns out i had a hard coded maximum index in my for-loop which was bigger than the arrays i was trying to assign to

you are treating this like a normal arrays so i would prefer using for-loop

this is the reason why working with the higher-dimensional arrays ends up being so much faster than the for-loop -based code

the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be

so first i tried with nsattributedstring when i received an arrays from service i used for-loop and added one more key with attributedstring and then i displayed it

after you finish reading from the user run a for-loop to check if the value of the arrays element is greater than 1 then you print it

above is a simplified version of my actual code where the c arrays is much larger so i have to use a for-loop to get every index

first if you use python list convert it to numpy arrays it make faster your computation in comparing from the for-loop you just use

however instead of using two nested for-loop you can use count arrays which is more efficient

the key is to track how many rounds of division the for-loop goes through until the quotient of the current time minus the input time divided by th value of the arrays item is less than the th value of this arrays

when you know both objects are arrays method is a faster way to check equality than for-loop

when i read the question verilog for-loop for arrays multiplication became clearer how to operate but i can not see how to manage it to be entered into memory

use hashmap that it has o 1 speed also iterate the arrays of integers in enhanced for-loop because it is slightly faster than ordinary for-loop

it returns a byte arrays of all the pixels which can be iterated much faster than a for-loop with a call to getpixel inside nested inside another for-loop

if it s a very deep inner loops however and you need to squeak out every last nanosecond my experience has been that with release build code a for-loop indexing over an arrays is measurably faster than a foreach loops with a slightly smaller performance loss for using delegates with linq vs

although an enhanced for-loop on a string arrays is much faster than it is on an more on that below the .tostring .split overhead would appear to still dominate and make that version slower than the arraylist version

since it s an arrays it s better to use a for-loop with a counter variable i which starts from 1

an arrays usually offers more information for alias analysis and after some optimizations the same code will be generated anyway search for-loop strength reduction if curious

if the messages arrays contain more than one element you want a regular for-loop

for-loop should run less than the length of the arrays not equal to and string should be replaced at the end of the for-loop

okay so after telling the user to enter the size of the arrays the arrays was assigned to lets say 5 therefore in the first for-loop the program is checking if i is less than the arrays size so it can only be entered 5 times as that is the size of the arrays

an index-based for-loop might perform much better than an iterator since you can index the original arrays directly and avoid copying to a new arrays

in this case if any element in arrays is shorter than 11 symbols will become big and for-loop will stop executing

1.0 faster than a for-loop iterating over an indexed arrays of 1kk elements for 9.0 plusmn

i have a json arrays wherer i would like to pasre the json till the last element by using for-loop for that i would like to get the number of arrays elements in the json arrays i have more than 3 objects in anarray so i am confused how to parse the json till the last element

the for-loop runs for 10 iterations and the last character is not inserted in the input arrays because of which the standart character count in input arrays is coming one less than expected 2

after jgauffin suggestion i used johnskeet code and found that the for-loop with arrays is faster than following

some kind of followup to my last question for-loop - move deeper on numeric key in multidimensional arrays

if you don t want to remember or google up all those methods every time you need to iterate an arrays just stick to the good old for-loop which is way faster anyway

i was considering whether some approach using arrays of function pointers so that initialisation is done in a for-loop might be better

due to your loops accessing the arrays element several times during each iteration in this example a foreach loops would be faster than a for-loop

in your for-loop you have given condition such that loops will execute only if the args arrays size is greater that 1

on the last iteration of the outer for-loop ndx is one less than array.length so when you call arrays ndx+1 that is equivalent to arrays array.length which out of bounds since arrays start indexing at 0

if the length of the arrays is less than 8 a regular for-loop summation is performed

this arrays can be longer so i have to read it s data with a for-loop like this

first if you generically want to apply the same function to each element of an arrays and there isn t already a built in vectorized way to do it you could use arrayfun although often a simple for-loop is faster and more readable

one thing that is wrong is that you have maxstudents set to 200 you allocate the studentnames arrays with size 200 but that means that the valid subscripts are 0 through 199 but your for-loop uses a less than or equal test against 200

i then use a for-loop to compare arrays i with arrays i+1

the comparision in the for-loop to be less than the length not less than or equal to as this will trigger an off by oe error due to length being the count but the arrays being zero indexed

my brain just woke up i have realized i just need to make an arrays in order of the way i want the data to be saved in the text file and changed the for-loop to be less complex


directx	gdi	11
i need to capture screen as fast as it is possible i used to use gdi but it s too slow then i read that using directx will be faster but the time of capturing screen and converting surface to bitmap is approximately same

using getfrontbufferdata in directx method is slower than gdi itself

directx is in general much faster than gdi due to the fact that it has full acceleration on most video cards

if you are talking about someone else s there is no promise that they will render larger than the screen since would be wise to clip their painting to what is visible and they may be further constrained by other factors such as the size of a directx surface which is smaller than the gdi limit

speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

...but i am not sure which method is better such as gdi or directx nor how i would implement said methods

directx is way faster than gdi

to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics

i m new to graphics programming and i m wondering why i would ever prefer gdi over the hardware accelerated graphics of directx opengl

directx should be faster than gdi except when you are reading from the frontbuffer which is very slow

after that you may have to look at using gdi or directx to get closer to the hardware


fileoutputstream	printwriter	1
you need to create a fileoutputstream and decorates it with printstream or better filewriter with printwriter


treeview	expander	1
i wish expanding any expander make my treeview control resize to smaller size


drools	jess	2
drools and jess have a higher power than swrl but protã gã supports swrl in that it supports owl so the use case is to support multiple swrl implementations

depending on what exactly you mean by business logic a rules engine such as drools or jess might be a more efficient way to implement them


margin	font-size	6
in safari property font-size 0 doesn t kill margin between child inline-block elements

if you don t want to give padding or margin at all then set the line-height property of headings more than their font-size

margin .67em 0 applies a top and bottom margin based on the font-size which is fairly large so that explains why the margin becomes larger when you disable the other one

my website in developing process looking in mozilla firefox with same font-size declaration margin padding and different font-families always a few smaller than in google-chrome or internet explorer

i don t understand why the height of span element more than its font-size margin and padding 0 jsfiddle example

the problem is that all inline child elements get a huge margin above them even if their font-size is much smaller


jasmine	sinon	2
the thing that makes sinon a better choice than jasmine spies is that it is capable of programming spies expectations withargs ... .called.

it should be mentioned that sinon provides many more features for smart stubs spies than jasmine so both can be used together


memcmp	strcmp	5
rest assured though that strcmp is better equipped in the general case for string comparisons than memcmp is

if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp

strcmp also works but memcmp is cleaner if you are comparing parts of two arrays together as my ip value had an octet stored in different indexes so i could easily just use the size 4 to cover 0 to 3 indexes

note also the functions strncmp and memcmp which are similar to strcmp but are safer

memcmp is simpler than strcmp and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned


opennlp	stanford-nlp	4
i find training in opennlp much easier than in stanford-nlp

but if you will look at the accuracy level stanford-nlp have more accurate detection than opennlp

i looking to use a suite of nlp tools for a personal project and i was wondering whether stanford s stanford-nlp is easier to use or opennlp

going forward for ner there as well stanford-nlp have the more accurate results compare to opennlp


jrockit	jprofiler	1
with java 7 update 40 oracle included java mission control originally part of the jrockit jdk - a very powerful performance tuning tool which is able to compete with yourkit jprofiler


membase	couchbase	1
i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level it s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together


xsl-fo	xslt	4
i found the xsl-fo designer from ecrion to be good for both programmers familiar with xslt and xsl-fo and old ladies that need to make changes to the templates we are deploying a desktop solution based on xsl-fo that replaces an older proprietary solution and the ladies can make small changes to the document templates

you can also use apache fop if you prefer xslt and xsl-fo

xslt + xsl-fo are then easier to handle imo

all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo


buttonclick	clicklistener	1
if you need more than a simple method call you could just as well create a more elaborate clicklistener implementation that has more than the buttonclick method


ostringstream	std	15
all you ve determined is that std string is probably smaller in size than std ostringstream and so it doesn t fill up the stack as quickly

if word is not a a std string or a char you should use a std ostringstream which handles more types see

but in c++ std ostringstream is better and typesafe as joachim explained in his answer

std string using appropriate std string reserve has no reason to act slower than std ostringstream in this situation

prefer std ostringstream since the stream is used only for the output

snprintf but in c++ std ostringstream is far better

i prefer std ostringstream for complex concatenation

however std ostringstream is probably faster for appending if you absolutely have no idea about the size you have to reserve

on ideone the ostringstream is about 3 times slower than std copy + back_inserter + std vector and about 15 times slower than memcpy into a raw buffer

if you care about memory a std ostringstream can be more useful that the + operator

edited since you chose the second approach i would recommend using std ostringstream than sprintf and using cclog instead of outputdebugstring because you just print it out and independent os no need extra arguments

when an std ostringstream would be more appropriate you can also do

as jogojapan said using std ostringstream is a better choice

std ostringstream is much better for that kind of thing

this was finally slightly faster than std ostringstream but it has few downsides


openssl	gnutls	4
nss is more strict than either openssl or gnutls

i ve generally gone with openssl though gnutls is newer perhaps better

openssl is more similar to peter gutmann s cryptlib and gnu s gnutls

speaking about usability personally i would prefer gnutls api but at the time openssl looks more preferable to use


fullscreen	minimized	1
the trouble is the game runs fullscreen in 800x600 resolution and really doesn t like being minimized which makes it more or less impossible to actually use ida while the game is running


macvim	emacs	1
textmate or macvim as the ide gvim or vim for the linux folk usually though some prefer emacs


partialfunction	implicit	1
a way with a partialfunction and implicit which looks more like your mapfirst


mergesort	shellsort	1
will using shellsort instead of insertionsort inside mergesort yields a faster performance


wmv	asf	1
if compatibility supercedes compression i would recommend asf which is basically just a container for wma and wmv


sortedlist	sorteddictionary	23
â sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

for your purpose you would probably be better off with a sorteddictionary class or perhaps sortedlist

the question of whether to choose sortedlist or sorteddictionary is answered here

if retrieval by index doesn t happen too often a sortedlist or sorteddictionary will have much better performance characteristics access by index can be achieved through the elementat extension method

sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey

seems the sorteddictionary might be your best bet as searching goes but since you want to search by multiple attributes this drops so if you want a good balance between searching and inserting for that large amount of data maybe a sortedlist will yield better results at the cost of memory usage

ignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionary

can someone tell me why sortedlist and sorteddictionary are slower than dictionary

i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue

sortedlist appears to use less memory and is technically a binary tree where sorteddictionary is faster with unsorted data

sortedlist is faster when you want to enumerate the elements and you can access the elements by index and sorteddictionary is faster if there are a lot of elements and you want to insert a new element in the middle of the collection

if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary

sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

note if you are constantly adding removing items from existingholdings then you could use sorteddictionary which should be faster sortedlist is faster for accessing elements but takes longer adding removing

sorteddictionary offers same advantages than sortedlist but performs better if values to insert are not already sorted

if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary

you should also keep in mind that sortedlist performs worse than sorteddictionary during construction if the items are not inserted in already-sorted order although in this particular case it is highly likely that dates are inserted in chronological sorted order which would be perfect

sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o logn as opposed to o n for sortedlist

note after doing some benchmarks i found that sorteddictionary is faster for removal but sortedlist is faster for adding and indexing by key

as zmbq mentioned in his comment to marc s question the sortedlist is implemented as an array so if faster insertion removal times are needed then the sorteddictionary would be a better choice

sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist

sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary

i had one further issue that related to the oncollectionchanged - the notifycollectionchangedeventargs required an index as opposed to the item of the sorteddictionary which is doesn t come out of the box it s easier with a sortedlist but anyhow


colorbox	thickbox	1
colorbox is implemented as a jquery plugin which is a bit different and better than thickbox s sort-of-self-contained widget model


scikit-learn	nltk	5
if your in to python there is nltk as already mentioned by it s author but there is also scikit-learn which provides much more than just clustering

what you re looking for is linear regression and scikit-learn is much better than nltk for this see

or scikit-learn directly .for more details nltk 3.0 documentation

the nltk library includes a confusion matrix that is simple to use and produces a nicer output than scikit-learn

if you are worried about memory then do look into scikit-learn since equivalent models can use significantly less memory than nltk


qgraphicsscene	qframe	1
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent


monocross	mvvmcross	1
from my own observations it seems that stuart lodge s mvvmcross has experienced much more community momentum than monocross


lapack	openblas	2
if you are on linux and have chosen blas and lapack from a repo it is very likely that they are much slower than openblas

it seems that openblas routines are slower than native blas and lapack


titlebar	window	2
the reason i ask is i am running proficy ifix 5.0 and when i run aero it adds annoying scrollbars to everything as the titlebar of the window is bigger than it normally is

apparently windows won t allow the width of the window to be smaller than the space required for the buttons and icon on the titlebar


powermock	jacoco	1
on other cases earlier versions of powermock already worked with earlier versions of jacoco using offline instrumentation


amr	aac	2
unfortunately for you neither mp3 or wma is supported with this method but you can choose between aac and amr codecs

mp3 or aac compression format is suited for music content and amr is better suited for speech content


info.plist	ipa	1
we are having an issue with uploading ipa files to our mdm solution when there is more than one info.plist present in the ipa file


pjax	history.js	1
history.js does everything pjax does and better so no need to mix the two


apache-poi	docx4j	5
but for the task you describe you d probably be better off with docx4j with which i m involved or apache-poi - especially if you are trying to do this server-side or in an environment where the client pc environment is unknown

if you are dealing with docx document docx4j is more convenient than apache-poi

a better answer than apache-poi is to use docx4j

i have used both apache-poi and docx4j extensively and having said that docx4j is more robust as it offers more support out of the box for not only the document itself but for tables and images

i used apache-poi for excel sheet and i know that it has a good api support for word doc too but i heard that docx4j is better in handling word documents


havok	physx	1
however if havok physx are significantly more accurate i would consider those too


freebsd	opensolaris	1
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64 bits out of the box and part of default installation


jruby	rubinius	7
so get rubinius or jruby which allow more than 1 threads to be running at a time

nb that jruby macruby and rubinius have more advanced gc s

you can try using anemone with rubinius or jruby which are much faster with but i m not sure the extent of compatibility

for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri

in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices

again we see the pattern of it getting faster during the first two runs after which it settles somewhere in between slightly faster than yarv and the other jruby and slightly slower than rubinius

works on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock


multiplying	multiplication	37
note that for large values you ll need to be careful that the multiplication doesn t overflow - perhaps by converting to a wider type or to floating point or by carefully multiplying and dividing by smaller factors

if 50 is replaced by x a value known only at runtime there will be a multiplication before the add the multiplication canbe optimised into a faster operation if the multiplicand is simple enough as one instruction because there is support to multiplying by 1 2 4 8 and 16 - at least in some processors and even risc processors multiplication is often more complex than a few add and shift operations - small numbers are often very easy to deal with this way but 575 or 13412 may not be so easy to convert to a small number of simple operations so a proper multiplication will be needed

feel free to use non-mathematical symbols for this but since you re basically multiplying probabilities the multiplication symbol seemed more likely to give an intuitive idea for what is going on than incorporateprobability or somesuch.

after analysing your code there is a final unsigned 32 bit integer overflow in the last multiplication by 10 you multiplying by 10 not by 2 so you can get up to four new bits in each multiplication making it easier for an overflow even if you do unsigned arithmetic which is recommended so you don t need to play with the signs

while it is true that a simple shift or add is often faster than a multiplication but not always â multiplication are faster than you might think the only way you could use it here inside the loop is if you first checked to see that you were supposed to be multiplying by 2 and the cost of doing that check more specifically the cost of making the decision as a result of that check is far more costly than a simple integer multiplication

multiplication is slightly harder just multiplying two scaled numbers and then divide by your scale factor

and don t use divide where multiplying will do multiplication is typically faster though not always

math.random returns double values between 0.0 and 1.0 so even when you are multiplying it with kids.size if size is 1000 there is a great possibility that the multiplication result is still less than 1 and so converting to int would return 0

another possibility would be to multiplying the values and check if the result is equal to 0 but this approach is probably a lot slower since multiplication takes usually more processor cycles than comparing values and or ing them

since bit-shifting operation is typically less costly than multiplication to speed things up you will see in some program people use left bit-shift operation as a replacement of multiplication when they mean to multiplying it by an integer number of power of 2 that is 2 4 8 16 etc

the autojit compiler realizes you re multiplying by all 0s and removes the matrix multiplication completely and simply returns a matrix of all 0s in the 1s it skips the actual multiplication part and just does the summation part of a matrix multiplication which is slightly slower than just returning all 0s finally the final one actually forces the compiler to have to do a matrix multiplication since it can t assume the answer

perhaps it s also relevant that the first three lines of the posted code multiplying matrix elements repeatedly since repeated multiplication can generate numbers less than 1 as well

the code is written like this in the belief that a shifts and adds are significantly faster than multiplication and b the compiler doesn t know the best way to multiplying by ten

if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple

the reason for this intuitively is that the last multiplication does dramatically more work than any of the previous multiplication so much so in fact that summing up the work of all the preceding multiplies gives something asymptotically dominated by the last multiplying

mathematically left shifting is the same as multiplying a number by a power of 2 but as the operation is done only by shifting it is much faster than doing multiplication

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

if you start with zero and multiplying it by whatever number s it stays zero -- it s not a neutral starting point for a series of multiplication it s more of a fixed point a black hole in a sense

you have to multiplying both the width and the height by a constant and the scaled result of the multiplication should be less than 16777215

implementing multiplication is easier if you remember an shl operation performs the same operation as multiplying the specified operand by two

since you want to do same thing couple times writing your multiplication num1 num2 function yourself with only addition and using that when multiplying would be much better choice

still while it might be better than multiplying by say 17 16+1 or 12 8+4 as they only add in a couple bit-shifted copies of the original value instead of five it s a very weak hash compared to hash functions that do more than a single running multiplication and i ll illustrate that using some statistical analysis.

since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

i believe that division would be faster than multiplying by the inverse since the inverse has to be calculated first then multiplication performed

multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiplying followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

this is not true for matrix chain the cost of multiplying 100 100 100 100 is much greater than 100 100 100 100 100 1 because two matrix-vector multiplication is much cheaper than a matrix-matrix

multiplying first is probably simpler than using floating point if you only want an integer result and if you know that the multiplication will never overflow

if i make a mistake and multiplying a number by 1.0 instead of 1 and i do not use any compiler optimization then my multiplication will last much longer than multiplying a number by 1

there just isn t a lot you can do about this other than not using operator at all to do your multiplication and find a more suitable api to multiplying your matrices

matrix multiplication is the easier one there are several matrix implementations with a multiplying method in packages org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg and org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed

multiplication and division are much more complicated and the compiler usually produces some small helper functions to deal with these whenever you multiplying 64-bit numbers together

in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 ï because multiplication is so much faster than division

so the bottom line is after every divide do the multiplying the 5 with 5 and if the result of multiplication is less than the equals to n then divide the n with result and add the zeros counter variable

multiplication is the easier of the tasks just remember to multiplying each block of one number with the other and carry the zeros

note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that multiplying is faster than division however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs

in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here

in a 64 bit application this code will be a lot faster than in a 32 bit application in a 32 bit application multiplying two 64 bit numbers take 3 multiplication and 3 additions on 32 bit values - however it might be still faster than a division on a 32 bit machine


geany	gedit	2
if you re fine with moving to another text editor then i would strongly recommend geany which does the same thing as gedit but is more fully-featured and can allow for execution of code in the same application

in addition to the vote for eclipse above if you are looking for an alternative for gedit i d recommend geany


do-while	goto	1
but goto is rarely used in modern coding it is not likely to perform any better than a do-while loop after compiler optimizations are applied and it has limitations on how it can be used


json.net	jsonfx	1
i have used json.net extensively in the past and came to prefer jsonfx over it a few months ago


sse	avx2	3
is it possible to build an binary in vs that includes different vectorization for example the same binary chooses between sse or avx2 at runtime so that i get optimal performance

and simd math libraries for sse and avx however they seem to be more sse than avx2

currently compiling using the 128 bit sse instructions this is faster than all s but using the 256 bit avx2 setting was slower even with all s


apache	nginx	209
in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option and i bet it will still be more efficient than apache

the syntax for nginx configuration is different but more clean than apache

using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

it seems your apache is more busy than your nginx

apache is more friendly configuration wise htaccess htpasswd rewrite rules etc nginx is fast in regard to static assets

4 i d like to understand why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

nginx is actually quite a lot easier than apache in my opinion

i would really like not to run both apache and nginx i did switch everything to apache yet found it loaded my proxies slower than nginx

also have a look at nginx for example it is fast and uses less memory than apache to handle client connections

i also know there is nginx and haproxy although i have never used either of them and have a lot more experience with apache

i will say that nginx tends to handle heavier loads better than apache though so take a look at that

if this is what you re really trying to do rather than a simplified example you may be able to accomplish the same thing with apache mod_rewrite or the equivalent in nginx and have better performance since you re not executing any php code at that point

id love to know how to solve this since using nginx sometimes is a better option than apache and having this issue with fuelphp framework and not being able to use this two great tools together is awful

you can choose nginx or apache or iis if your windows version supports it if you want a full utilized server or just use simplehttpserver in python if you re just making a personal toy

good at serving static files it s slower than apache and nginx

i know this might be out of context but i would recommend replacing apache with nginx much much simpler configuraiton

i am more familiar with apache php combo rather than say nginx and fastcgi with php setup so focusing on this area

serving static files with nginx is much more efficient than with apache

apache is like a 4 by 4 contains everything you need nginx is more like a ferrari not much there but it does what you need it to

nginx + gunicorn is likely to work better than apache + modwsgi at this point in time

nginx â without any optimizations done â is much faster than apache

then make nginx reverse proxy to apache cache all static files which offloads that from apache because nginx serves them instead meaning apache can do more php requests and also get nginx to perform output compression

if you have a proxy in front i prefer nginx but even a vanilla apache will do the proxy will worry about the clients and apache can focus on a new dynamic content request

uwsgi is better if you are using nginx i find nginx far better than apache personally

next you ll find that the threading model of nginx is much more efficient than apache s for what you re doing

also when your setting up the server i would say start with nginx it s uses less resources than apache

for example nginx is considered faster than apache and a nodejs application is considered faster than a php application

apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests

but doing that kind of things with apache is rather painfull and is easier with nginx

in other words serving static files from django will have worse performance than using apache or nginx

letâ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

generally i would recommend using apache or nginx for long-term running production environment though

to start nginx usr local nginx sbin nginx note i had to kill apache first sudo etc init.d apache2 stop

we have found that using servlets and those 3 different kinds of handlers instead one single type of modules the generic term for other servers like apache or nginx makes user-developments easier safer and faster

nginx makes apache better

if you have long-running requests i think the performance will be pretty bad because apache use one thread per connection nginx performs much better

as such i m assuming that about 96 of our users will being using apache and not lighttpd or nginx which are supposedly more suited for long polling

a more recent benchmark on 1 2 4 8 cpu cores - also made by an independent third-party - compares apache 2.2 apache 2.4 nginx lighttpd varnish litespeed cherokee and g-wan

it s just a little slower than using apache bench directly against nginx

the remote server is set up to allow very few maximum concurrent clients generally nginx handles many concurrent clients better than apache since it doesn t need to fork a new process for every request so if it becomes an issue you might want to look into switching web servers

nginx is faster than apache and the configuration is easier

i have used this pattern with apache before and nginx seems more capable in most respects so i m sure this must be possible

when i was googling info on nginx it appears to be faster than apache and works well in serving static pages

but i prefer apache and nginx

but for production i prefer modrails.com where you can choose between apache nginx

however i m on a memory limited vps and i d rather not run one set of php-cgi processes for nginx with their own apc cache and another for apache using more memory for their apc cache

further than that i wouldn t use apache at all if i needed to optimize things nginx is much better as a server it s even faster than node.js for serving static files for example

apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features

apache mod_wsgi will actually benefit from this as well if everything is setup properly as nginx will isolate apache from slow http clients allowing apache to perform better with fewer resources

for static file serving i found nginx performance lot faster than apache

note that in any case for increased security and fast static file css js delivery you might want to add a reverse proxy layer nginx usually provides better performance but apache works as well before the nodejs python server

alternatively would phusion passenger with nginx or apache handle this better

nginx is better at handling requests since it does not spawn a new process for every request unlike apache

nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that

that being said it s not like i think event-based programming is all just a ruse seeing as how it seems to have been the primary driver allowing such http servers as lighttpd nginx whatever to overtake apache in highly concurrent performance

the passenger whether via apache or nginx or unicorn are much more established production ready application environments

as other already suggested nginx + gunicorn or better nginx + uwsgi are better options than apache + mod_python to serve your django app

nginx is faster than apache handles slow clients better and is generally easier to use

i ve read that nginx is faster for static pages but there are questions about its performance with php compared to apache s performance with php

it s worth mentioning that in both nginx and apache there are many more options that must be set for this to work correctly

otherwise we recommend using apache nginx to do the redirect

there is no need to use apache or ffmpeg nginx would be alot easier

i recommend nginx or apache

i recommend using nginx instead of apache

very fast static assets nginx is faster than apache at serving static assets css js images ... and uses very little memory to do so

just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation

nginx is more performant than apache in most cases with high-levels of requests

for example nginx is much faster than apache

so you can do a django redirect_to urlconf entry but you d be better off with an apache or nginx or insert-your-webserver-here redirect so the initial request never has to hit django at all

if you haven t done it i also recommend dropping apache for your php application servers and look into nginx with php fpm

common examples of this software include apache most famous popular - runs like 40 of all websites you browse including facebook.com and nginx becoming more popular

not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content

you can serve it from for example nginx varnish which are usually faster than apache

resources that compare apache vs nginx

or don t apache nginx are better etc

you might try running say apache or nginx which is even simpler to set up

therefore serving and caching images from nginx or apache still seems the better choice

if you otherwise prefer to stay with the amazon linux server apache is fine but i recommend nginx

apache made a claim that apache 2.4 will offer performance as good or better than nginx

having nginx in front of apache is a better set up in my opinion

i switched from apache to nginx to save memory especially to serve static file i seem to be using about 75 less memory with nginx

nginx apache are much more efficient at handling static files like images css javascript files and will only pass dynamic requests those where the content is often read from a database or the content changes to be handled by the python code

so i don t understand the meaning to compare nginx and apache with php code

nginx will definitely work faster than apache

the famous line is nginx is not apache in other words nginx has better ways to handle urls than rewriting

the advantages here are that you can block off certain methods or certain parts of couchdb using nginx apache which is typically more flexible than the http options available in couchdb

nginx or other server is not much more efficient than apache

there seems to be a consensus that nginx serves static content faster than apache

yes i know apache has these features as well but nginx seems to outperform apache in almost every way

many recommend nginx or apache along with uwsgi or gunicorn

also what makes nginx better than apache in this case

i know apache reverse proxy and nginx are better for this but i need to make db request from validatetoken method and to my knowledge it is not possible with apache or nginx

apache and nginx are faster than django because they do much less and much simpler things

nginx is more picky about case of file names than apache

apache is more flexable then nginx but it comes with a high price in performance

is nginx + php-fpm is suppose to do server operations much faster than apache + mod-php due to efficient usage of memory and other resources

i don t know from your question if it s a requirement to keep using apache but if possible i think nginx would work much better for you here

hi everyone i need help with this i ve already set up nginx + php and it works great faster than apache my problem is how to setup a multiple projects in one ip

the context of this question is that lots of people recommend using nginx to serve static media files and apache to serve the python which beckons the following questions

as an alternative i d recommend using nginx to proxy between one or more apache instances which are better suited to executing heavy php scripts

for sites with high traffic i d recommend using nginx instead of apache

apache can be just as good but requires building from source and knowing exactly what configuration to use to match nginx

i want to move to nginx since it s better than apache

apache and nginx can do it faster

and finally from my experience nginx is faster than apache

if you want to use something in front of it though i suggest you use something like nginx better than apache since nginx is also asynchronous like node and it s performs really well at serving static files

16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests

i ve been attempting to upgrade to php 7.1 using phpbrew and elected to install it with nginx as i read everywhere that it was simpler than apache not that simple in my humble opinion

i would like to ask which server to choose apache or nginx to host the application in ror

personally i prefer nginx to apache but you can do this with both

i would prefer nginx apache level

nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections

if this plugin crashes it seems it could entirely kill nginx or apache respectively

nginx is very fast much lighter than apache

i ll tell you one simple thing which is obviously only my personal opinion nginx is basically a proxy server so it s built to do this kind of stuff and it s lighter so i would recommend nginx as a load balancer instead of apache

i know that reviewboard recommends apache but also that is possible to install it on nginx

instead i suggest taking a look at mod_xsendfile if you re using apache or it s equivalent for your web server of choice i prefer nginx and would use xsendfile for this

also you should consider using nginx as server that s more flexible than apache

2 nginx outperforms apache and reduces a lot of the bloat that simply isn t needed

according to these system requirements then typo3 recommends apache over nginx

choose nginx or apache as the reverse proxy to your node.js

i have configured tomcat with apache web server in past and never slowness problem before and practically speaking nginx is said to much lighter and faster than apache web server

even using nginx under the hoods you can still choose apache or nginx to maintain your webservers domains using sockets

it seems to be common wisdom that if you are deploying django on an apache server then you should still put an nginx server in front of the application to serve static files at which nginx is more performant

as an added benefit nginx can also serve static files much faster than apache and nginx also uses much less ram and can handle much more connections

for several reasons i would pick nginx as a reversed proxy instead of apache and configure it accordingly

we have a few clients who have very high traffic sites running apache slower than nginx with varnish in front of it and they get way more traffic than you are saying with little to no performance problems

for second your apache nginx are faster to deliver your js and html from angular instead tomcat for example

nginx can be configured to only respond to requests matching a predefined pattern far easier than with apache

although this thread is more than a year old it still merits from the fact that no one mentioned about the not so recent innovations of nginx lighty and other web servers which scale much better than apache at higher concurrency and consume lesser resources

smaller leaner companies prefer nginx to reduce costs while big enterprises tend to prefer apache becuase of more support and people who know to configure it

i read that nginx is faster than apache and i want to try it with some of the projects and leave the others with apache

would be for running many php scripts all the same in the background - nginx be the better solution or apache

a apache this is popular but some people prefer nginx those are the main web servers out there i think.

i dont recomend apache to do these nginx fits better with nodejs

the easiest and fastest way is using http front-end server as a reverse-proxy for your application i d choose nginx for that task but if you have running apache on the machine it can be used as well

nginx uses an event based non blocking single thread and the memory usage is relatively much lower than apache

any one of the reverse proxy systems can likely do this nginx is popular too and generally has easier configuration than apache but i ve never used it with https

i d rather recommend nginx than apache as proxy

if you re working with php and you wish to have a single process per container then i do recommend using nginx and using php-fpm as it s significantly easier to configure than apache for this type of setup at least that s what i ve found

this is more efficient as the apache nginx daemons are far quicker than node at serving files

nginx apache fits better with nodejs

in nginx which i much prefer over apache i map my server root to

how can nginx performs better than apache

nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that

i ve heard it suggested that i use nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache and node.js is that a better solution than just nginx

and question what i should be use server nginx or apache but i am choose nginx

i m about to try apache but most write ups suggest that this is worse than nginx at this job

paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .

nginx works great by itself and will likely be much faster than apache

i can choose between nginx and apache

i tend to prefer leaving the cors handling to the http server nginx apache it gives more flexibility to the people deploying your app

tornadoweb and nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than apache under certain circumstances

there is no single reason why nginx strictly outperforms apache

nginx s static file performance is better than apache

nginx is quicker though honestly you ll struggle to see the difference except for very high volume sites and has quickly become the web server of choice for a lot of people if you don t have any specific need for apache for your code

nginx is an asynchronous event-driven web-server which outperforms apache by a huge margin

in fact according to a few stackoverflow posts here here nginx and apache perform better for serving static assets

you can configure apache to act as a reverse proxy to your django application although a number of people seem to prefer using nginx or lighttpd for this scenario

i will add that i ve often heard that nginx is faster than apache for serving static files to the point that it s sometimes worth using nginx for static files and reverse proxying to apache for dynamic content

is microsoft beginning to recommend apache or nginx instead of iis now

i think you would like lemp e stands for the nginx and for a lot small projects it would be better than apache

i would give you more info except a ip aliasing on centos 7 is more involved than i like much easier on solaris and b i m not familiar at all with configuring nginx very easy on apache

on that note you might prefer installing apache over nginx unless you have specific reason otherwise i m not sure how well developed nginx is on the raspi but i know many people use apache to run web servers on it

it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup

however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx

you will find much more documentation about whatever webserver you choose apache nginx etc than ours and we are slowly getting out the webserver business entirely anyways

also nginx uses a lot less memory than apache

how to do something like this in nginx or apache will prefer nginx

it is slower than nginx because apache with the event mpm is very roughly equivalent to an event-driven http proxy nginx varnish haproxy in front of apache with the worker mpm

i have recently read that nginx is faster than apache

i m currently using apache as web server but i have heard that nginx can handle more requests with more concurrency than that of apache because of the non-blocking nature of the system

one thing to consider is the magento environment tuning the php the web server favor nginx over apache and mysql

i would recommend apache or nginx

node.js is fine but i would choose nginx instead of apache

i switched from ms-centric solutions about a year and a half ago and now i m hosting all of my websites and web projects on linux mono apache mysql based virtual servers i was originally using nginx instead of apache but mono-fastcgi-server was randomly causing thrashing so i choose apache as a web server

i m significantly more comfortable with apache but learning to use nginx has been pretty exciting or as exciting as learning to configure a new webserver can be

i recommend you to use nginx as an reverse proxy since the configuration is easier and the performance is much better than apache

nginx is typically faster than apache but with a low request server it hardly matters

i tested both for apache and nginx webservers got comparatively better results in nginx

also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having it on the front end it gives you a lot of flexibility

also you can run php behind nginx using php-fpm but that s quite a challenge to get working and for that reason apache may be a better choice

however since i m used to apache it was faster for me to configure the site to run on apache and switch to nginx when performance problems occured

if you aren t using any of the other features of apache consider using something lighter and faster like lighttpd or nginx

for me apache is easier to use but i prefer nginx as it is much faster

as for apache vs nginx in regards to your django app it seems that mod_python is indeed faster than nginx lighty + fastcgi but that s no surprise because cgi regardless of any speed ups is still slow

nginx is still faster and i might choose it but apache isn t asleep

servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t

my app is a python wsgi with cherrypy and works perfectly in appfog but i don t wan t cherrypy to serve static content i think that apache or nginx is a better option for that

nginx is better suited than apache as it is light and single threaded vs apache thread per request in most normal setups

having deployed django behind both apache and nginx in windows i have to say that i found nginx to be infinitely easier

i am not an expert in deployment but in my experience nginx is much faster and more friendly to django compared to apache

nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly

the switchover to nginx really had little to do with the rewrite rule and more to do with getting away from apache 2.2 default upstream version for centos however with nginx rewrite rules are more straight forward than apache s imo

one of the main advantages people discuss when choosing nginx over apache is higher performance in serving large numbers of static file so when using laravel are those static files loaded as dynamic php files

i m new to nginx and want to try it out since it apparently is much faster and less resource-hungry than apache but i can t see why this would be such a hard thing to achieve

i know nginx has lower memory footprint and little faster than apache in serving static files

nginx is faster and lighter but many people find it easier to work with apache because of .htaccess support nginx does not have an analog due to performance concern

in my experience passing css js through controllers slower than pure apache nginx request

apache mod_php is much more stable and cleaner while nginx will often deliver http bad gateway error coded in 502

using nginx rather than apache to server the images nginx generally works better to server static content such as this

why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

the django developers recommend using apache and mod_wsgi but you can also use other servers like nginx

now back to the question my guess based on reading tests published here would be that the proper multi-thread apache architecture should scale better than nginx on multi-core cpus

i am not going into how to do rewrites on nginx because it is much more complicated than apache

you can create custom controller to serve that files and use send_file mentod in it with disposition inline also you may be interested to x_sendfile_header setting to serwe that files with apache nginx which is faster

i have no idea what i m doing so i dove nose-first into nginx -- which i had never used before -- because someone told me it s better than apache at dealing with lots of small tasks and requests -- not that i would know how to turn apache into a proxy mind you

i aways heart that nginx performs better than apache server

you don t want to use apache because nginx is better suited since nginx is built for async i o


vb.net	vb6	35
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008

the style was common in vb6 with optional parameters but imho and according to microsoft in vb.net overloading is usually more elegant than optional parameters

avoiding them by modifying vb6 is lot easier than fixing the issues in vb.net

i assume the same control in vb.net would be datagridview and i m fairly sure that you can probably make it look better than in vb6 but if you want really good looking ones you might want to look at thirdparty grid controls

none of the .net libraries are there and there are some syntax differences as vb.net is more strict than vb6 is

however if your moving from vb6 then i d recommend learning vb.net or preferably c#

vbscript is much more convenient than creating an activex on vb6 or c# vb.net

vb.net seems to think lots of things are objects one way or another but vb6 has stronger typing in this case

vb.net is a better language than vb6 use its com capabilities to save you from writing endless sketchy vb6 code

if it is useful to you you are more than welcome to it note i m more familiar with vb6 vba than vb.net so this udf is more in the vba style but still works in vb.net

if you have to maintain or transfer an older project then the differences between vb6 and vb.net are much more serious

also developing enterprise application is such new languages java c# vb.net rubby is easier that vb6 because they rely on frameworks every body can write c# java code that function but it requires tricks good practices and some of imagination to write vb6 strong and rehusable code

if your already familiar with vb5 and vb6 and your just building small desktop utilities then i would recommend vb.net

bear in mind when converting types from vb6 to vb.net that the numeric types in vb.net are larger

fortunately vb.net finally ended all that and is completely pixel based you can still alter you viewport scaling but .net seems to handle that much better than vb6

especially as vb6 is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the vb.net language takes on a life of its own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing

the differences between vb and vb.net are even bigger by some metrics because no complete vb6 code is valid vb.net

can i safely assume that vb.net result is more precise than vb6 and discard the vb6 result completely

vb.net appears much more complex then vb6 and the learning curve is tough

coming from familiarity with vb6 c# and vb.net are the same on the back end and vb.net would be a better choice for you i prefer c# if you care

in vb.net the default behaviour is the same as vb6 to make it easier to upgrade legacy code

so i have a rather complicated application written in legacy vb6 that i have been tasked to update to current vb.net to work on more machines

vb.net might be easier to learn if you come from a pure vb6 background but i ve found most web developers with a bit of js experience can pick up the c# syntax easily enough

if you want to learn more about tdd and unit testing you should apply it to functions or procedures in vb6 -- although i d recommend vb.net or c# and doing object-oriented development

biggest of all is that adding new features to your vb6 application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or vb.net

i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript

one comment though - while it would be possible to do this in vb.net using the illustrated techniques doing it in vb6 would be much harder or even impossible

if you don t already know vb6 there s little point in learning it now - your time could be put to much better use by learning vb.net c#

getting your project migrated to vb.net is certainly easier when you keep the old vb6 controls

in conclusion you can build your browser in either vb6 or vb.net however i would recommend vb.net as microsoft has retired vb6 as a product and a technology

yes they are different but you can hardly say that the vb.net version is less capable than the vb6 version

the time and energy you spend refreshing your knowledge of vb6 would be far better spent on learning vb.net

can somebody explain how it can be that the same api call returns so much quicker with vb6 than with vb.net

quite apart from the fact that the language vb.net is far more feature rich than vb6 the fact that you have developed in vb.net means that you have made extensive use of the .net class libraries including system.security.cryptography that you give as an example

you can access apis with c# vb.net although it is a bit tedious something like vb6 would be surprisingly quicker to develop around the api functions although its clunky for general coding


median	rank	2
this step works because all elements less than the median in a would intersect only with those elements before the insertion rank of a s median in b

we use ave to see which rank are greater than the median for each group and we select where those are true


pubnub	sinch	1
anyway i would also recommend sinch i m using it right now alongside parse pubnub pusher


xstream	xom	2
but if convenience is more important than efficiency yes you probably should consider a tree model not dom necessarily xom is better for example or data binding jaxb or xstream

if you decide to roll your own xml configuration i d recommend using xstream with customized serialization options or if you just need to parse some xml take a look at xom


integer	fractions	25
therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the integer is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly

those approach that you are using trys to make a number integer if a fractions part is less than 1e-6 0.000001

fractions exponents are considerably more difficult since it means essentially calculating an nth-root of the base where and multiplying the result by the result of the integer portion power calculation

if your numbers have no more than n fractions digits and can be scaled to integer you can multiply by 10 n and operate with integer instead

so my problem is how could i extract the fractions part from 254.73 so that i can get exact 73 as integer to do more calculations

you can match integer values as well as fractions values with

than use bcpow on the integer part and bc_exp on the fractions part which now converges from the get-go since the fractions part is smaller than 1

a floating-point format with a n-bit fractions can t represent the integer which is larger than 2 n+1 -1 because it will lose the precision

the label s text size of an integer part is bigger than text size of a fractions part

another example is geometry classes one parametrized to work with 64bit floats another parametrized to work with 64bit integers passing data between them may result both in rounding errors integer can t represent fractions and overflow integer has bigger value range than same-sized float

as python integer is less limited than the float you may get bigger results with the fractions if it makes sense at all

but for someone who doesn t even know what an integer is numbers without fractions values is probably clearer

if fractions part was greater than 0.5 adding 0.5 to it will increase the integer part and after conversion we get 1 higher of the original integer part rounding up

the reason i used it is because integer math and multiplication are faster than fractions math and division

the result of the multiplication is slightly less than an integer because the numbers are internally stored in binary and you can t represent most fractions numbers exactly in binary for the same reason 1 3 can t be written exactly in decimal with a finite number of digits after the decimal point

generally the fpga in the x3x0 already does a lot physically the adc and dac of the x3x0 are running at 200mhz by default and you can select integer fractions of that as user sampling rate

if you divide a 15 digit number by 3 you lose one digit because the division may not make the integer part have fewer digits and it demands an extra digit for the fractions part

so if the fractions part was less than 0.5 adding 0.5 will not increase the integer part and so after conversion the integer part will be the same rounding down

you need to write a comparer function that will take two values split them by the point . and compare integer before comparing fractions part converted to an int

when you then calculate the integer part is 1 less that you might expect while the fractions part is slightly less than one

if a decimal fractions is included lower order time elements if any shall be omitted and the decimal fractions shall be divided from the integer part by the decimal sign specified in iso 31-0 the comma or full stop .

if the number of bits in the mantissa or fractions is larger than the number of bits in your integer type then you ll possibly lose precision when someone types in a number such as

i would like to create a loop that keeps adding a set fractions here in my example 1 3 and which later i can check against for matches with integer values

i know there are not that many mantissa bits for fractions part for bigger numbers but you did not specify which floating data-type you are using if 32 64 80 128 256 bits or more so hard to say and if the integer part is bigger then your integral data-type used to cut off the non fractions part then you would be in trouble with f-long f

that means that the 16 upper bits of a glfixed represents the integer part and the fractions is the lower 16 bits divided by 65536


tree-shaking	es2015	1
es2015 module is more efficient than the other formats and can facilitate the creation of smaller bundle size through tree-shaking technique importing just the bits you need instead of importing the whole thing


haskell	sml	7
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell

haskell and sml are more clear about this

i would probably recommend sml over haskell if you feel like trying on a functional language for the first time

it is semantically influenced more by java sml haskell and a very obscure oo language called gbeta

much as i love haskell here are the reasons i would prefer sml for a class in discrete math and data structures and most other beginners classes

also sml has stricter precedence rules than haskell

i haven t read the paper on edison but if it s nothing more than the haskell implementation of purely functional data structures doesn t it make more sense to port the sml code that s in the book thesis


glfw	sdl	2
you can use glfw sdl or glut for getting those personally i recommend glfw if you need only one single window

however due to it lack of android portability i have to replace all of my glfw code with sdl since sdl is more portable


uibinder	smartgwt	1
while smartgwt has much more sophisticated widgets than gwt you still can t use uibinder in conjunction with it which is why i rejected using smartgwt


error-handling	exception-handling	3
i would recommend #2 with exception-handling because if you use the return value for error-handling you can t really use it for its real usage returning something

some users prefer exception-handling others prefer error-returning and if all of them work on the same project they make project s error-handling practice a total mess

exception-handling are more natural error-handling mechanism for c++ language


concave	angle	3
you check that the polygon is not concave by simply checking for all angle being less than 180 degrees - any corners which has a angle of over 180 is concave and you need to break it at that corner

if the total of the angle is less than 180â the triangle must be â œhyperbolicâ on a concave surface which might be the shape of our universe

edit2 okay i just see that if the angle is bigger than 180â it s concave so i have to change the shape for be simple than a triangulation

rodbc	rjdbc	4
rjdbc may also be a more stable option in the linux environment especially now that the fetch code has been re-written in java as of development release 0.2-0 on r-forge its performance is on par with if not better than rodbc

there another option that seems to outperform rodbc and rjdbc

now the speed of sql server interaction with r has affected because rjdbc is slower than rodbc but its not too bad

rodbc takes longer than rjdbc

i have tried to use various combinations of sum if sumifs sumifs sumproduct utilizing indirect match vlookup offset among others

bear in mind that index is the same as vlookup in that it will only return the first value if two tenders finished on the same day it will only return the first it comes across if you have more than one maybe sumifs would work better maybe along side countif to show how many there were

have a look into vlookup match sumifs sumifs countif countif

functions like match vlookup and hlookup need to match data type number or text whereas countif sumifs make no distinction

as tim has suggested in his comment above...you can use vlookup match along with sumifs to get your results


division	subtract	12
compute the larger units by integer division subtract the minutes used by the larger units from your input value

division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract

a modulo is effectively an integer division instruction which typically has a latency which is an order of magnitude greater than that of compare subtract

in normal integer division you do it using a series of compare subtract steps

however if the result a is added to or subtract from another expression and not reused then starting with the division may be more interesting since you can group the multiplication with the following addition by using a fma thus with a single rounding

you might also be able to run a straight division algorithm shift through carry compare subtract ... on binary 11 into dividend

division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

if division result is larger than 1 push the current transformer to the results array and subtract the current wattage from the total wattage

radix2 division shift and subtract would be much faster and easier to implement

i d think the the multiplication division would give you more trouble but nevertheless in the long version you are still subtract two floating point numbers

one way to check whether or not a double is a whole number without knowing the calculation type this works for more than just division would be to subtract the int part to get the fractions part and compare to zero

version 2 is safer as it subtract remainders before division


or-operator	and-operator	2
which will never be true have in mind that the and-operator binds stronger than the or-operator

as far as i know the and-operator has the higher precedence than || or-operator in most of the languages


qgraphicsview	qframe	1
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent


gruntjs	browserify	2
while gulp gruntjs is very popular for build automation which includes bundling all dependent javascript in file and minifying them in to one file webpack browserify is a better option as it supports module import

i recommend using gruntjs browserify or clientside to rebuild the files using watch rebuilds when files are saved and using that built and optionally minified file in your file


qdockwidget	qvboxlayout	1
the center widget is a qdockwidget containing a qwidget with a qvboxlayout containing more stuff


xpo	openaccess	1
i think we re going to buy xpo or openaccess


pylons	pyramid	5
i d recommend pylons pyramid because it s in python and because i agree with the design decisions and thirdly because you can run it on google app engine as well as on other servers

instead of a single monolithic framework pyramid pylons act more like glue tying together best-of-breed components jinja2 for templating sqlalchemy for the orm mochikit as the js library etc

but pyramid would be a better choice to learn right now as pylons is not actively developed

also given that pylons itself was a very successful platform judging from its high-profile deployments do you recommend pyramid as a good replacement

the difference between pylons and pyramid are the merge of repoze.bfg and turbogears which brings more api resources


toupper	uppercase	4
since you using toupper compare with uppercase string value like below

we uppercase this with toupper then we add on the next 3 characters of the string starting at the 4th character which we force in to lower case with tolower

when performing string or char comparison is it more common to use toupper to compare uppercase characters or tolower for lowercase

you code is right you may not be getting check boxes to be checked because some values may be saved with a space at beginning or at end so you need to use trim method also just to make sure that your condition satisfies call toupper to convert database value to uppercase so it matches with uppercase y


subtraction	addition	87
i am trying to make a simple calculator using radio buttons to select addition subtraction multiplication or division

division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition

this is a hold over from older compilers and interpreters on old chip architecture that would do addition slightly slower than subtraction

to be a randomaccessiterator it must support these operations plus a few more such as addition and subtraction

this is happening because the concatenation operator has a higher precedence than the addition or subtraction operators but multiplication and division have a higher precedence then concatenation

since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations

in fact has precedence even lower than addition and subtraction so x y+z comes out wrong--it means x y+z instead of the x y +z that you d want

it does have and or compare subtraction and addition instructions

addition subtraction assignment has lower procedure than simply add operation

additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive types since they must be read operated on and rewritten

the addition and subtraction is okay because the types of a and b force them to be performed using floating point arithmetic - but because division binds more tightly than addition and subtraction it s like using the brackets above only the immediate operands are considered

but there are other things you can do with little more than the addition and subtraction required to deal with indexing into lists etc

my issue is it only displays addition if i select add but if i selects minus it doesn t display subtraction

division has a higher precedence than addition or subtraction so it s really this

put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority

it will be much slower i don t have benchmarks but i would guess at least an order of magnitude maybe more decimal will not benefit from any hardware acceleration and arithmetic on it will require relatively expensive multiplication division by powers of 10 which is far more expensive than multiplication and dividion by powers of 2 to match the exponent before addition subtraction and to bring the exponent back into range after multiplication division

so for a class assignment we are using html and php to make a form that asks a user to input two 2 numbers and to choose between addition subtraction multiplication or division form using radio buttons then to input a guess as to what the answer is

you can do the addition or subtraction using a larger type such as int cast it to a short and test if the cast changes the value

by the way the result of this addition taking its lower 8 bits discarding the carry bit is the result of the original subtraction

division multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction and parentheses is required to do addition subtraction before multiplication division

multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still

of course the relative overhead will be smaller for functions that do more work than one addition and one subtraction per iteration

bit shifts have lower precedence than addition subtraction see in docs

that will make it easier to do operations with this value equality greater than less than addition subtraction etc...

multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction

for the sake of completeness i would like to mention another less powerful algorithm with addition subtraction

addition subtraction for the rectangular bound calculation is cheaper than multiplication

multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction

i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky

my problem is this when they choose the mixed radio button to randomize between addition and subtraction i can get it to randomly choose addition or subtraction but can t get it to keep randomizing between the two

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

i know that addition and subtraction perform better when using sse

the addition and subtraction are much more than multiplication and division

if you want to support better than just addition and subtraction you could do it as an eval if you are careful about how data gets into #number

not that these are bad granted they tend to be an order of magnitude slower than addition subtraction negation etc. but they aren t needed and if they re present it probably means the implementation isn t really that efficient

nothing follows the rule of multiplication and division having more precedence over addition and subtraction

according to python.org unary + and unary - operators have greater precedence over addition and subtraction

then you ll notice that the dereference operator has higher priority than addition subtraction + - operators they are in group no

i m curious about why bitwise operations were slightly faster than addition subtraction operations on older microprocessors

and have lower precedence than addition and subtraction so it messes up your expressions

you will have a more difficult tostring method but your addition and subtraction will be simpler

the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers

it s possible though that software could mess things up by making subtraction slower than addition - but that s unlikely

notice that by making the rule for contain the rule for this grammar makes sure all multiplication division operations occur lower in the parse tree than any addition subtraction

i managed to write increment and decrement functions but the addition and subtraction seem even less documented and harder to write

and my question is this if the book says that the addition and subtraction have lower priority compared to other operators what if i add the value of a typical expression multiplied

it is also possible to manipulate the inputs so that various parts of the calculation return 0 for addition or subtraction or 1 for multiplication or division to make testing easier but this only gets me so far

and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation

a111 addition is equal or better than subtraction

they are slower less efficient than addition subtraction but they are much faster than looping and doing repeated additions

i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition

the problem is i dont know how to select addition or subtraction using add_sub

if the exponent are more different than the size of the mantissa then addition or subtraction you get the number with the larger exponent as the result all the bits of the smaller number have shifted off into the bit bucket n + 0 n - 0

in general you ll have more variation with multiplication and division than with addition and subtraction

the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does

here it is conceivable that subtraction is slower than addition

although i should warn you for anything more complicated than addition and subtraction and shifts you ll need to use non-trivial algorithms

typically operations like addition and subtraction are much faster in integer -- multiplication and division less so

the intuition would say addition subtraction are faster than multiplication division but is that really correct

the subtraction case is going to require a little more work than addition in this code

i don t know how it works but it s much more complex than addition subtraction or even multiplication

finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into

the next problem is a compare is a subtract subtract and add go through the same alu and take the same time as addition so for most platforms old and new trading compares subtraction for addition wont save you anything you end up looking at the branch cost pipeline flush etc

addition and subtraction is worse as these have to be done in sequence of two operations and the second operation requires the first to have completed - this is not the case if the compiler is just producing two add operations on independent data

i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric

re-order your script so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again

if one of the numbers is a constant your compiler might optimize by doing some combination of bit shifts and subtractions mostly for powers of two since hardware div mod is slower than addition or subtraction but on modern processors the latency already only a few nanoseconds is hidden by tons of other performance tricks so you needn t worry about it

for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu

either way your example with the numeric expression would multiplying by 3 first because multiplication has higher precedence than addition or subtraction

converting between time zones runs in constant time as there is nothing more involved than simple addition subtraction

the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction

but i d think bignum subtraction is a little slower than bignum addition

knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction

addition and subtraction are slightly lower latency multiplication is the same

source unary + - bind tighter than addition subtraction + - and associate right

i can t use anything more than basic addition and subtraction and string parsing functions

i was thinking that there could be an issue if the result from the addition is bigger than what 15 bits can represent 32767 or if i get a negative number in the subtraction

strict addition is rare but subtraction is more common like when you subtract one image from its filtered one

to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction

apart from that multiplication is addition done more than once and division is subtraction done more than once

spoiler its namesake may betray why addition subtraction is more costly

however the thing is that both addition and subtraction produce 1 more carry borrow bit

if i select add from the combo box my jtext field should display the word addition and if i select minus from the combo box the jtext field should display the word subtraction


qfile	qdatastream	1
a qfile may be used by itself or more conveniently with a qtextstream or qdatastream


np-hard	np-complete	5
it is not easier than the np-complete problem since it can be reduced to it in polynomial time which makes the problem np-hard

as i understand it an np-hard problem is not harder than an np-complete problem

the subset-sum problem is hard more precisely it s np-complete which means that your variant is hard too it s not np-complete because it s not a decision problem but it is np-hard

is that mean np-hard problems that are not np-complete are harder

if there exists a np-hard problem that is not in np to the best of my knowledge no such problem has been proved to fall in this category at this moment of time such problem is harder than np-complete problems


gtk	cairo	2
with gtk it s more common to use cairo already mentioned by jeff foster

the problem is that the canvas drawn by cairo is larger than the area of gtk s scrolled_window


pyquery	lxml.html	1
there is a project pyquery that is much faster as it uses lxml.html library speed comparasion can be found here


feof	fread	1
if fread returns 0 check feof and ferror to find out if you got to the end-of-file or got an error both cause fread to return less than the number requested


isnull	datepart	1
declare totalwaitingminutesoverall int select sum datepart mi isnull departuretime getdate - arrivaltime


border-color	background-color	1
still if you don t want the elements background-color to span more 10px because of the transparency border and you do not want to set the border-color to match the background color you can use css content property like this


try-catch	exception-handling	25
when you call input.nextline as part of your exception-handling catching is it better to place it into every catch block or just inside a finally block at the end of the try-catch

if you really want to catch exception-handling and die slightly nicer you can put a try-catch block around the application.run call and work from there

or depending on the use case and generally less clear especially if you have more than one exception-handling expected - you don t want to have try-catch imbrications...

so here the unchecked exception-handling is better to use in order not to copy and paste all that ugly try-catch block rethrowing an exception-handling and add the throws clause to the method

additionally you may have to write nested try-catch blocks more frequently if you are using traditional try-catch . closing a resource also throws an exception-handling

in general try-catch is more robust does not require you to define an exact position of where to test could be a block and provides info about the exception-handling

if it s not the case then i believe it is much better to isolate the different code blocks throwing different exception-handling into different try-catch blocks sandwitching do more stuff here that does not throw exception-handling

if raiseweberror re-throws the exception-handling this will then be handled by the next try-catch block found futher up the call stack the parent method you refer to

there s no way anyone else can know anything more specific about your exception-handling than you already do and the best way to investigate is use try-catch and create more robust error handling

when there are more than one exception-handling in try-catch block rec_catch_exception triggers

your colleague may be right in the general sense using try-catch to test your exception-handling handling is less desirable than using the provided expectedexception utilities

going beyond that you can use a try-catch block to gracefully handle those exception-handling and provide better output logging options

the control flow works backwards up the call stack until it reaches the start of a try block at which point the parameters of all associated catch blocks are compared in order of appearance with the type of the exception-handling object to find a match see try-catch for details on this process

also whether this is really the problem or not you can wrap your facebook requests with a try-catch block to catch facebookapiexception type exception-handling to get more information when you have errors

try-catch is actually slower if there really is an exception-handling thrown

i use try-catch blocks when the potential exception-handling are more complex or more numerous

i prefer using exception-handling with try-catch but you can use warnings or silent error codes as described at the relevant section of the pdo setattribute documentation here

try-catch rsources is fine for some cases but this is the old way and works better when you have more than 1 exception-handling in a block

in java you can call option s isempty isdefined and get without any special hassle the really useful option methods such as getorelse are another matter. checking the result of the isdefined method in an if-clause should be faster than checking exception-handling in a try-catch block

in a project i am creating now i use several try-catch clauses and i would like to display a popup message in case of an exception-handling to make it more user friendly

if you are writing a constructor which could throw an exception-handling you had better make sure you clean up anything you need to by using using or try-catch block

the try-catch is needed because sometimes it will throw a exception-handling if the securitymanager dont allow the thread to sleep but dont worry thats will never happen..

will hide the exception-handling and since dealing with exception-handling is heavier compared to a simple if t why isn t the normal new t not considered less good practice considering we will have to use try-catch to check if a simple allocation succeeded and if we don t just watch the program die

if the application can run even if that exception-handling occurs make the try-catch block wrap a smaller more relevant part of the code and let the buttons initialize

wrap your code in try-catch to get more info on the exception-handling


coalesce	isnull	61
coalesce function works a bit different coalesce will take any number of parameters and return the first non- null value i prefer coalesce over isnull cause

isnull is faster than coalesce

however i prefer isnull over coalesce since the latter has an issue if it contains a sub-query

you will find that coalesce works better than isnull here

in almost all cases i prefer coalesce over isnull

coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.

this is pretty much the ifloop answer but isnull is slightly faster than coalesce

in most cases it has reviled indexes that needed to be add and in most cases the indexes improved the queries the most but after thet have been added the isnull and dynamic still perform better than the coalesce

isnull is marginally faster than coalesce

isnull or as i prefer coalesce returns unexpected results if cityname or abbr is ever null in the data

edit based on the tests done by multiple people and by theory isnull seems to be a better option over coalesce

2.coalesce function works a bit different coalesce will take any number of parameters and return the first non-null value i prefer coalesce over isnull cause meets ansi standarts while isnull does not

also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contain nulls

other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull

on the subject of performance on sql server isnull often performs better than coalesce but the latter is ansi compliant if that is important to you

for anyone curious about the coalesce vs isnull discussion and why i changed my answer to use isnull kanav rightly pointed out that coalesce is more expensive

note that i much much much prefer the ansi standard coalesce but sql server has done us the favor of documenting why isnull is better effort that imho could have been spent fixing the problem

note that in this case the isnull would do the same as coalesce but looks better for this application in case you add some new language

normally i would recommend coalesce over isnull

next value for function cannot be used within case choose coalesce iif isnull and nullif

the exact clause for your statements may be different - you may be able to replace the case statement with an isnull or coalesce to make it easier to manage

but depending on the answers to those questions i m guessing that coalesce might do the trick for you better than isnull

i tend to use coalesce only when i need to get the first non-null value from a set of 3 or more values as isnull only supports two parameters

to prefer isnull over coalesce when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce

the only place i d recommend using isnull rather than coalesce is when you re creating a computed column in a table or within a view the second parameter you re passing is non-null and you want the column s definition in metadata to be not null

sql server is probably smart enough to translate isnull into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then coalesce is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with isnull and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in isnull

coalesce is more correct of course you could just embed isnull over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and coalesce may just win

i d also usually recommend coalesce over isnull

i was playing around a little with some union selects with coalesce and isnull .

you could also use isnull but coalesce is more standard

using coalesce is better option than isnull or case..when for this problem since the input values for the coalesce expression can be evaluated multiple times

normally i prefer coalesce to isnull because the former is standard

in some circumstances isnull is faster than case or coalesce

i prefer coalesce to isnull because the former is ansi standard

i choose coalesce instead of isnull as you may add other technicians in there

coalesce is the more standard alternative of isnull

if you wanted to display a username or their email address if they don t have a username you could use coalesce or isnull for example select isnull username email_address - which gives the value of username unless it is null in which case it gives the value of email_address

isnull performs better than the generic coalesce and better than having another and

the function isnull is kind of equivalent but coalesce allows more arguments and is standard sql.

if you move your where conditions to your join conditions you can deal with null s in your select with isnull and or coalesce

isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce

the difference between isnull and coalesce is that coalesce can receive more parameters

isnull is better then coalesce because of how datatypes are handled

you can also use isnull but coalesce allow more that two values you can use it for three or more columns like coalesce column1 column2 column3

you can also use coalesce which is the more general form of isnull and is actually part of the sql standard

i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce

is the performance of coalesce field constant better than isnull

i saw a coalesce statement version but isnull is more efficient

an example of why coalesce is better than isnull

i would see if i got better results with isnull instead of coalesce

i ve been told that coalesce is less costly than isnull but research doesn t indicate that

i prefer coalesce to isnull because coalesce is ansi standard

in this case i would use coalesce which provides more levels than isnull rather than the case stement

you can use isnull also in place of coalesce as isnull is comparatively faster than coalesce

coalesce will go through the listed values and choose the first one that isn t null it s more portable code than isnull or ivnl etc

coalesce is the standard ansi way isnull gives slightly better performance although the difference is probably insignificant in most cases

i would recommend using coalesce function instead of the awfully named sql server-specific function isnull

you also could read an article which compares coalesce and isnull

isnull can only have one input however it s been shown to be slightly faster than coalesce

coalesce case can add implicit data type conversions whereas isnull has simpler rules

- coalesce should be more portable than isnull


gsap	scrollmagic	1
i d recommend using scrollmagic and potentially gsap if you need


scipy	skimage	1
here is the skimage scipy version appears sharper


icarousel	uicollectionview	1
my only problem is that is seems that using uicollectionview is a better approach and i have read some seemingly off-hand comments about icarousel being a poor approach


asp.net-mvc	openrasta	1
i d suggest having a look at openrasta which is much closer to http semantics than asp.net asp.net-mvc is


fancybox	thickbox	2
i m using facebox and fancybox both smaller than thickbox

fancybox or thickbox are better option if you want to use iframe


jquery	jqmodal	1
i would recommend using jquery with the jqmodal plugin instead of using a â popupâ


imagemagick	pillow	1
there exists a simd fork of pillow which claims to have much better performance than imagemagick or plain pillow but there are no comparisons to opencv


gitorious	gitosis	1
if you have some product-specific stuff git could be installed with gitosis gitolite gitorious provide more details as to how you ve done it


uilabel	uibutton	7
secondviewcontroller which is a subclass of firstviewcontroller also has a uilabel but has one more uibutton

suppose i am developing or say prototyping an e-commerce app where i have to show product list with their price-tag it will be uilabel product description in uilabel and buy uibutton button

the uilabel text is shown correctly but the uibutton title update is slower

the problem i am having is when the test of the uilabel gets longer after pressing a uibutton - read more in the cell itself

if the uilabel is larger it will then wrap around the uibutton to the next line

an uilabel could be used kind of showing a link but an uibutton might be more appropriate

my solution is i create a uibutton name read more at bottom-right and below the uilabel


background-color	transparency	5
you just set the div with border-radius so that it is a circle and background-color is the more transparency color in the circle

still if you don t want the elements background-color to span more 10px because of the transparency border and you do not want to set the border-color to match the background color you can use css content property like this

i d recommend setting background-color transparency

for example setting the background-color on a transparency element turns it black...rather than the intended color.

why is the html select background-color black in chrome when set to transparency


cobertura	emma	4
however cobertura looks more modern active last update from 2010 instead of 2005 and generates nicer reports so i would prefer it over emma

i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking just that cobertura has a better maven plugin and emma has a better eclipse plugin in my opinion

i prefer cobertura over emma

if you re going to stick with maven and want a plugin for maven that will do the code-coverage job i think cobertura is a better choice as emma stable last build is from 2005


optgroup	fieldset	2
if i m not mistaken only button input select textarea optgroup option and fieldset elements can actually have the disabled attribute

according to w3c recommendations the following html elements can be disable button input select textarea optgroup option and fieldset so if you want to disable a table then it is not possible because it do not has any disable attribute


theano	cntk	2
finally i don t expect to learn many meaningful lessons from this benchmark both cntk and theano are calling the same cudnn implementation the advantages of cntk are more around higher level things such as a comes with a high-level library b the user doesn t have to worry about the batch and sequence axes except for a few specialized operations c efficient recurrent networks d efficient i o e easy distributed training

it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features


strncpy	malloc	1
in addition to the previous answers the strncpy char pointer which seems unsafe for my opinion and the malloc which is safer but you need to remember to free it outside of the function and its inconsistent with the hierarchy of the program you can do the following


hbase	impala	2
hbase will be faster if you have a good key design and a proper schema because just like with hive impala will translate your where into scan filters it ll depend a lot on the type of queries you run

hbase is schema less and from hbase you can create impala or hive external tables


width	height	2158
the thing is the window showing the files is pretty big wide or tall because you resized it and emacs sees that the width or height is greater than the respective threshold and splits it likewise

i want to show two column with equal width and height max height which have more content

you could also just change the height and width to make something bigger smaller

getting the width and height takes more work than it s worth especially trying to do it across all devices and a responsive framework gives you so many more options

i used the page view webpart and the width is set to 700 px and the height is greater than the height on the flash html

check that panel width is bigger than oval width and the same with height

if so then your job will be easier as the width and height of the image view can be defined by the width and height of the image ie the image view s intrinsic content size

if height is less than what the aspectratio allows to still utilize full width i m clipping

if the image is 500x800 it should be presented as is as it takes up the entire available width and height is no bigger then the container s visible height

the other page isn t rotated but it has a height that is smaller than the width

for example if the height and width are both less than 1001 and the pixel count is less than 500 000 then you don t bother scaling at all

for example when rotating from portrait to landscape the collection view bounds value still has its height greater than the width

but if the width and height are smaller then userinput i get an error

but for other images of the same resolution ie width + height but looks a poorer image the returned byte size is a lot less - like 9000 bytes for example

i have my website in this situation the thumbs of my gallery are ok when i change orientation to landscape if the width is longer than the height

by the way i don t recommend using width and height like you re doing in your css code example width 631.10px

there is two case if your actual image size is equal or grater than your imageview width and height then you can use adjustviewbounds property and if your actual image size is less than imageview width and height than use scaletype property to shown image in imageview based on your requirement

it is regarded as portrait if the height is greater than the width

right now you say if movetox y is 0 and less than the width height then add acceleration x y

meaning that width and height are greater than 768px when they are not

i m wondering if it s possible to automatically arrange the icons so that when the width gets smaller than x the last icon of each row gets pushed to next row so that it grows in height

you are using dp to position fixedly the elements relative to each other in larger and higher resolution screens elements with a fixed height and width will be smaller and will have more space around to position other elements

i ve found some comments and references that seem to indicate that setting the height greater than the width will cause the browser to change the orientation automatically but in my testing that only works in opera used to work in opera but not anymore

you select the image in storyboard then use the pin tool as seen here then ctrl-drag to the side and selct width and then control drag to the top of the wheel picture and select height

if either current screen s width or height is less then 15cm image should be scaled preserving aspect ratio in such a way it fit to screen

i disagree i have been able to set select width and height using css with something like this

i see that they are squeezed such that the height is more than the width

if you want a pure css option i believe an absolute positioned div inside the body with width and height of 100 overflow auto and right padding larger than the width of a scroll bar will replace the normal scrollbar without shifting the content to the left on long pages

anyways the problem is that barcode has a very low resolution and i m trying to figure out if it s possible to return the preview picture barcode with a higher resolution or have the width and height be greater then the preview frame

you need to set the display to block for the which is an inline element so that width and height apply and better do it the automatic centering way instead of hardcoding any padding sizes

so if the total slider s width got smaller then the image will be the same if you don t want the slider to get smaller height set .bx-wrapper img to height 100

if the thumb text width is less that the height of the track the thumb shape will be scaled down

determine if the width or height is longer and use the .scaledwidth or .scaledheight methods of the image class to resize it and preserve the aspect ratio

so what i need to do is to check if the exif wants to rotate 90 or 270 degrees and if so only perform the rotation if the height is less than the width which would mean the portrait picture isn t already rotated

when drawing a rectangle i made sure that its height and width were greater than 0

that will let you know if the picture is landscape because width would be greater than height

when height is more than all the above mentioned height and width

although if you use values greater than the width and height you re going to have issues

i have a div who s height and width can be larger than the page

if i have wider image it crop 500px width and the height is not proportion to the width the same as the height tall image crop to 500px and width is lesser px.

when x is equal to width and y is less than height you will be writing to the array 0 y+1 cell

you ll need to change the width and height settings so that the width is larger than the height

also per the api docs size is more efficient than height and width

but since i want a portrait preview i need to rotate the image and as a consequence i get images with an height much larger than the width the transpose of the original image i guess

if width is bigger than height this code won t work

automatically show scroll bars when content is greater than height and width like this

i bet start has negative x or y when error happens or the size.hight + y or size.width + x is bigger than height or width of the image

however this does not take into account the space taken by the notification bar or window decorations so in reality you have less space than width times height

so the problem is the javascript is not adding class from the image if image height greater than the width

in order to do so you need to find out if the svg is portrait or landscape - meaning if the width is smaller than height former or not latter

so it goes as container the width height to keep spacing of the rest of the page correct container width height fixed then header container with logo drop-down within that

css scale height to match width - possibly with a formfactor

in other words does a stage with greater width and height consume more memory itself even if i render objects only on a small viewport-sized part of it

i have various different image sizes running through the site - some where the width is greater than height and vice versa

use javascript to match width height and bind event listeners to collect mouse movements

as soon as i m in portrait mode frame.rotation_90 the bounding rect gets drawn rotated so an object with more height gets drawn with more width and also a bit off

currently i am using the universal storyboard and want the image to be 3 4 so the height needs to be 33 greater than the width

issue has fixed size but works so long as larger than site width image height

i ve discovered that using the height width constraint instead of frame width height is more reliable

it should have exactly 3 inputs channels and width and height should be no smaller than 197

the rotation point is by default in the center and because your box has a bigger width than height it overlaps

when i try to change the height and width using and the height changes perfectly while the width only changes if it is less than the width of the viewport so it wont go wider than 323 pixels

gl_invalid_value is generated if width or height is less than 0 or greater than gl_max_texture_size

when i add a testview whose width height is bigger than its superview- containerview the frame of the testview including children should be adjusted so that it fits perfectly inside its superview

i need to resize the image when the height or width is bigger than 700px

for example with scrollview.bounces no a horizontal image whose height is smaller than the height of the scrollview but whose width is larger so it can be scrolled from left to right will scroll further to the left than it should when scrolling to the right it stops correctly at the edge of the image although if scrollview.bounces yes it then bounces in from the edge so the image is always cropped on the left when the image is larger in both dimensions than its containing scrollview this issue accentuates and the whole result feels broken which is unsurprising given apple s documented advice

if the vertical scroll doesn t have the right height make sure that your content width is not bigger than width of the container

so when playback i first check the orientation of the video by measuring width and height and if width is longer than height rotate textureview by 90 degrees by below code

the issue is that the first image is wider than body width thus creating a horizontal scroll-bar making window height smaller

if height is bigger than the width it s height won t be 100 only it s width in all cases will be 100

create a nxn matrix such that n n is a power of 2 and n is larger than the width and height of the original image

after reducing the height the west pane width has reduced even more than the width of the vertical scrollbar while the vertical div remained in the same place

means a longer change in width straddling a shorter change in height

from my experience every time the kindle fires up my landscape app with a width smaller than the height thus by definition not really giving me a landscape view i just ignore the surface and wait it quickly gives me a a real landscape flipping the height and width so that its a true landscape view

scrollview s contentsize s height and width should be greater then scrollview s frame s height and width

this would become more apparent if you had a shape with much longer width than its height

i have a centred fixed width content div and if there isnt enough content ie an small error page the height of it is smaller than the height of my web-browser

assuming width is bigger in size then height scale the image width to the holder width

i suspect that this has to do with the width height ratio of the webview s frame being changed since if the initial height of the webview is greater than content height this will also happen

with this method you only need to change the width and height values in .circle_holder css the rest will fall into place a width value less than the width of the text would look weird

it looks like you want to resize each jpeg image in a folder to a width of 1840 pixels with keeping aspect ratio for images in landscape format width is higher or equal than height

i am trying to make all a row of 4 images all have the same height size i already tried to play around with the width and height using css but nothing seems to work the portrait images always end up taller than the landscape ones here s the code

if your screen resolution is 1024 728 then the image width should be larger than 1024 and the height 728

when you fit one side of image to background you will face with two problems first one is screen width is bigger than image s width or screen height is bigger than image height.so you will have empty space

assuming the width is greater than the height

var jscommand string window.open win height 200 width 300 toolbar no scrollbars yes

so you need to double triple your width and height to receive a better resolution

in landscape the height is smaller than the width

if you have a portrait device the width is smaller than the height

width and height gets more and more different

the height and width are more than the window size

the width exceeds but height is less

if width goes bigger height will goes bigger

start with the full string and the known two-line height of the label and its known width and keep cutting words off the end of the string until at that width the string s height is less than the label s height

if the width is smaller scale the image so it has the minimum width and crop it so it has the proper height

â width and height should be no smaller than 48

error build buildd opencv-2.3.1 modules calib3d src stereobm.cpp 802 error -211 sadwindowsize must be odd be within 5..255 and be not larger than image width or height in function findstereocorrespondencebm

the image is 120x100 but no matter what i do and how i resize it the excel spreadsheet always shows it spanning multiple rows and distorts it to a much bigger height than width

the result is the bitmap is the full height of the imageview and the width is much larger

i m trying to upload an image from my api to show it as profile picture the problem is from the first time that the user opens the navdrawer the image doesn t load and it makes the entire layout disappear but from the second time it all works and i notice that it happens when the width of the image is less than the height

try setting just either height or width whichever is more important to you

if the width is greater than the height

all i have to do is check whether the width or height is proportionally larger then scale the text down by that same ratio

as long as landscape means wider than taller and portrait viceversa it means to read the image into memory and check width and height

when the get clicked the double theri width and height to show more information

he only animates the margin-left margin-top width and height and sets a higher z-index for the block

i assume the screen width and height to be less than 2000

if the distance between the center of the circle and all of the vertices is greater than the radius of the circle and all of those distances are shorter than the width and height of the rectangle then the circle should be inside of the rectangle

if the height is longer than the width the screen is in portrait mode otherwise it is landscape

if a glsurfaceview s width is or height is larger than the device screen it will behave like below

but when i try to extract this textview width and height and try to create an image of same width and same height its generating a smaller width image by cutting the correctly word y partially

in case your form contentpane s width height is smaller than the images width height than a better option would be use

for the portrait mode and when image height is less than image width

the mapview s frame is set as the screen s width and height and i found the map view s height is less than the screen height

i ve tried 2 ways of rotating the image when the width is less than the height both are in this code

ps if i use width 100 instead it will work but will cause some troubles on pages where the height is more than the height of screen

if width is way more than height for the 16 9 aspect ratio it s still scaled appropriately just missing the top bottom part of the video in see-able view

unfortunately using nsstring -stringwithfont forwidth linebreakmode doesn t work - which ever wrap mode you choose the text wraps with a width that is less than the current width and the height becomes 0 on any overflow lines

scale does not work for images where the height is larger than the width

just draw the square maybe slightly smaller than the height and width of your character you re detecting the hit test on and you should be good to go

i mean i want to move all the .tif files which result of width height is less more than a certain value

i have problem with column height in rows where at least one cell has content width is larger than header width

then since width of your image is greater than height multiply the original width and height by 250 498

by default the width and height of a box or container cannot be greater than the width and height of its parent container because the box won t fit

i have a header with 60px height when document width is greater than 760px

i d like it so that the image fills the width or height whichever is smaller first

my document s width is greater than the browser s height so i can t center it vertically in relation to the document

example if there is an object bigger than width and height that i ve set before that object can t be detected

in case your image s width height is smaller than form contentpane s width height you might as well do not scale it since the image will fit the screen

but what i obtained surprised me the width of the files in pixels changes depending on latitude but also the height is smaller than the original and

it will currently resize to the width of its container while maintaining its aspect ratio however even with a wrapper that defines an explicit height it will overspill the container if the width of the wrapper compared to its height is greater than its aspect ratio

this image will not throw an error since both width and height are less than 8 191 and it s pixel count or width multiplied by height is less than 16 777 215

meaning if width is greater than screen width image will cover the imageview frame width and takes a corresponding height for that width

my camera by default is in landscape mode therefore it takes pictures with a width much larger than the height

the grid should have the images across the screen at 300px max width 200 max height but if the user shrinks the window they would scale down to 200px width 133 height then have one less column at 300px

most devices seem to recognize the highest dimension as the max-width but some amazon kindle 2 appear to treat lower dimension as the width and higher as the height

but with the videos i m using the width is always greater than the height and players know whether to rotate the video or not based on the rotation exif value

overall width height is much smaller

it s because you re using and orientation portrait so once the width of the window has a higher value than the height none of your css will be taken into account because it s considered landscape orientation at that point

set the width of the browserâ s window to make sure the height of the green box is greater than the height of the red box

it is however still possible that either the width or height is greater than the maximum set

when the width is greater than the height the orientation is landscape

the div in which the file was to be embedded did not have height and width specified earlier when the height and width were added it s works on firefox as well

if i set the page format with height is smaller than width it is treating it as a4 paper and feed the bottom of the paper

it test if window.orientation property is supported if it isn t it checks if window height is greater than window width

even though you ve given your header a fixed height of 10vh if one resizes the browser whereby the header s width gets smaller eventually a height 10vh might not be tall enough to contain all of header s content thus it overflows

above images are portrait but if you calculate height and width you will find that width is more than height

when i resize a borderless form to a small width and height it won t get smaller than width 132 height 38

but with iframe it is a problem - window height is always bigger than width

few are portrait images where the height of the image is like 3 times more than width

how do i determine the picture size if it is a horizontal picture width is more than height width 300px and height 200 then insert into the database

if the width of the label in interface builder the literal size in interface builder is less than the width of the view at runtime then the height of the container is too large

only elements and which determine the scaling in the x and y dimensions are calculated differently if width is greater than height

vh for portrait orientation since in portrait the viewport height is higher than its width

to do so you will also need to check if the new width height is bigger than the original and change all the elements accordingly

so the majority of desktop and laptop screens nowadays have a width greater than the height

how can i use jquery to change the height of the element when the page width is less than 960px

that means fit width when the height is less than the ratio and fit height when the width is less than the ratio

when a rectangle is drawn with some line width we have 3 sizes the outer size is equal to the clientrectangle size and the inner size is less wider than clientrectangle width and less higher than the clientrectangle height

i know i may lose width and height of the fragment s root layout in such a case dependent on how i inflate but that relationship is between two child views

the big.jpg has more width than height so when it s resized the wrapping containers get the correct new height but they still have the old width

fyi width and height are more like x- and y-coords

when height is greater than width set width and auto stretch height

2 compare height and width of wrapper with wrapped element

if the length of field s meetingpurpose value is less than the width of the textfield it prints beautifully however if the length causes the text to wrap and stretch the textfield the text is baseline shifted down 1 2 x height

this second snippet is the same as the previous one but now the height is 20 smaller than the width it was equal on the previous example plus have a max-height limit of 100px

since the height width is calculated on the visible viewport the soft keyboard apparently causes the orientation to flip now that the viewport width is less than the height

you may think that percent value for width and height means that more percents from original image size but actual meaning of this value defined into specification is percent of size of containing block

if your video s height width is more than height width of the device set width to be 100 else set height to be 100

see code below and fiddle - i ve added the case where the height is greater than the width too for completeness

i m not sure it is the same problem than yours but after some test research i ve found that the problem was triggered by having a div element filled with a ng-repeat with a height greater than screen height inside a main div with height and width set as 100 google maps

i found some info in the internet that core-image process images on cpu if any of it s size bigger than 2048 width or height or both

i m calculating the width based on the div height if the height is greater than the screen width

the caption for the vertical slider demo in the ie documentation erroneously indicates that setting height greater than width will display a range slider vertically but this does not work

i want the inventory to scale with screen size so i changed the canvas scaler and set it to scale with screen size set a reference resolution to 1280x720 because that fit quite nicely at the size i already had and set match width or height

from here i d create a pojo plain old java object which would maintain a reference to the original png file and stored the width and height to make it easier to look up

my sprite s width and height can be changed more images can be added later in the sprite

you said you specified the height to 800px and wanted the div not to stretch when the width was greater than that.

how do i match type with height h width w to come out with the desire transformation

alternatively you can use jquery filter method to filter all the images which have width greater than height and then add the required class at once

how can i display a cover image at the top of a web page that stretches when the width of the screen is bigger than the width of the image but that retains a fixed height

the basic idea behind the approach is that you map the coordinates of the images to the interval by dividing by the width assuming the width is the larger dimension but it does not matter if it is smaller than the height

here is the problem im having in the oncreate i would like to initially set the imageview to the first image in the list of files but with the imageviews width and height when it flips back and forth it sets the image to the imageviews dimentions no problem but in the oncreate i get illegalargumentexception width and height must be greater than 0

landscape width is bigger than height

we next tried to just look at the actual screen size assuming that when width was greater than height we were in landscape mode

obviously the buffer height and width will be larger but does the 1080p camera capture more pixels because possibly of a wider camera field of vision and so there is no enhancement to the quality or is the 1080p camera working within the same field of vision of the 720p camera and it is simply capturing more pixels per inch and so even if i don t output the buffer to an image i should expect more grain detail from my frame buffer

hold the control button and click and drag the button you want to resize to the same button and select width and height so select add constrains

then i check if the width of the video is greater than the height and rotate the screen

but the problem is because the screen height is bigger than the width is makes image looks expanded in height like this

if the window height is greater than the divs height the the size should be based on 100 width

if you want the button to be the same size for all screens and resolutions you have to add the canvas scaler component to the canvas and the set the screen match mode to match width or height here is the link to the docs this helps a lot if you want to aim to different sizes or resolutions

so in code where you perform scaling add condition which checks if the content width or height is less or equal container width or height

the program s label changes dynamically so when the width is greater landscape mode it s label has a different text then when the height is greater portrait mode

gives a way to make the margin transparent but they are still there and the plot is smaller than height and width i set in the saved file

the first label is taking extra width and height is less

my idea here is that you always resize to whatever dimension height width is bigger then to crop the excess amount in the smaller dimension you have you pull the positioning to the appropriate negative value

you can compare height of element with its scrollheight property and width with its scrollwidth property

but i d like the box to always fill the parent s width or height whichever is smaller

if im2 exists before this code is run and its width or height is larger than the image you are generating the new image will only overwrite the top left corner of your existing im2

if height has a higher value than width the browser will be in orientation portrait

this should work as long as the height is never greater than the width

and if the image s height is greater than maxheight or the width is greater than maxwidth i d like to proportionally resize the image so that it fits in maxwidth x maxheight

i ve been using interp2 but since it fills in values in between existing ones after each step the matrix grows in both dimension 2 n-1 which results in the height growing faster than the width

i am currently using the pagex and pagey event attributes but this is returning a value greater than the width and height of the image itself

so i am trying to figure out a situation where i would populate an array with the index numbers from another array whose elements meet a certain criteria array b would be index numbers based on array a which is an array of images and would populate b when width is greater than height

choose an image which is smaller than the width and height of the div

i.e if the browser height goes smaller the image will scale down while not overlapping or going under the text and staying centre same goes for width

in this screenshot the image must be expanded to up and down because its width height ratio is larger than the original

one where height is bigger than width and one where width is bigger than height

if you resize your browser window to still have a viewport with a with equal or less than 1024px but have an height greater than your width the viewport is no longer considered to be in landscape mode but switch to portrait mode

in this case if i want to have a fixed width while keeping ratio i just set height to a very large number so that the resizer will actually ignore it since the ratio of real height to desired height is far smaller than the ratio of real width and desired width

what i want to do is to answer a 400 bad request to the user if the value of width or height is less than 10

as long as the square height width are bigger than the text and the container height is bigger than the square height you should be good

i wrote some code that takes a look at the original image checks to see if either the width the height or the height and width are greater than the max width max height settings

if width is bigger than the height it s width won t be 100 only it s height in all cases will be 100

as it fit for device but as font-size increase in both width and height so fonts and elements were messing up because font-size was bigger with respect to width

as you can already see from these dimensions the captured image s width is smaller than its height whereas the uiimageview s width is larger than its height - the proportions are different

it is happening when width is greater than height

in english when a page is initialized look through every image on the page that has a width and if it s larger than the width of the device erase the height and set the width to 100

but when the height img is more than 500px or when the img width is more than the width of the carousel the img overflows the carousel

to avoid cropping either top if width is more or left if height is

if the image s width and height is less than 400px then don t resize and save the original in resized

this will have a diameter that is equal to either the rectangle s height or the rectangle s width whichever is smaller

this would mean that the image should never be more than 100 width but it allows the image to be proportional to the 100px height

the problem is that your li has a bigger height than your width

if i enlarge the width of the form the height should get automatically bigger

instead think of the image residing in the left upper portion of a large square the length of the square s side will be the image s width or height whichever is larger

i wouldn t scale the image every single time in the paintcomponent method but do it once if the width and height have been changed since the last call and in that case recreate a bufferedimage containing the image which you blit every single time before calling the superclass paintcomponent scaled up to the right size use something like image scaling does not work when original image height width is smaller the scaling height width

the method under test - this method will shrink the input image so its height and width are less than maxheight and maxwidth retaining the existing aspect ratio

this makes it more flexible across devices regardless of orientation not to mention width height is more widely supported than orientation

my goal scale an image width if the height is greater than the device height

note that i am using jquery to set these boxes max-height so they will never have the height bigger than the width

this guarantees that the largest dimension of the image be it height or width will be no greater than 115

if the width is greater than the height of an individual page add a dictionary entry to that page and explicitly set it s rotation

as this height will need to be adjusted as the browser width gets smaller i have tried to call the function which does this calculation on window.onresize

145 and 154 and it has non sense because the max and last scale factor applyed is 4 so as i can see in the screen the width and the height is munch higher than 150 or similar values

i ve found that if you load an image from the camera roll that is a png pngs have no orientation data flag and the height is greater than the width upon applying certain distortion filters to said image it will rotate and present it self as if it were a landscape image

sometimes width greater than height and sometimes width lesser than height

the image height is probably going to be less than the width and really just depends on what type of image you are using and how tall you want the carousel image to be

so it s even more odd that the width is greater than the height when it should be the other way around

my problem is that an image larger than the width or height of the screen gets squeezed out of proportion in order to fit

as-is it maximizes the width and assumes that the height is not greater than the height of the screen

the length of getdata is more than width height

so i expected at first time when i set only set background to have this scenario - the view will be with the same ration and will fit the smallest - width or height of course if height is larger than 55dp it will be scaled

i had to listen for the width and height to be greater than zero before proceeding

if the height is larger than the width the ratio will be y x instad of x y and minimum will be multiplied by ratio for x instead of y

test for yourself with the provided link the higher the scale or map width height is increased the more it lags while walking

portait in a mobile device is that orientation where the width is smaller than the height

in the bottom of the storyboard i activate â ž vary for traits â œ and select width and height so that only ipad devices remain

so its width is the width of the user s browser minus as much as possible without making them larger than 90 height of the viewport

what i have shown is children should have smaller width height than parent because when using floats they spill out

i have 2 dimensions width height and i need to take another image and resize it until both width and height are greater than the 2 dimensions

thumbnail width height is smaller 400

this means that to keep scale and full width i set a height constraint to match width height proportions in the .png file

2- if total rows height is bigger than current datagridview height it means there will be a scrollbar..also the same for the other scrollbar columns width is bigger than dgv width

so here when you enter multiwindow mode your app s window no longer fits screen - width is greater than height and it is considered as landscape

the only font-size is on the body tag but what happens is that the div is square but the button has a smaller height than its width

the problem is that the image has static width and height and then if i access the blog on a mobile device the image is cut because it s bigger than the width of the device

i would expect that the output width would be 200 and the height would be something greater than the height of a single line however it produces

hover toggles the height width when device width is wider than 768px while a click toggles the height width when device width is less than 768px

that is because the filloval drawoval methods should actually use a width height that is 1 less than the size of the component

my array larger than max height width but not max height max width

if you set the width and height of the element and set the offset to any size the same size for both left and right or top and bottom it will be centered because the element cannot get any larger than its width and height attributes

is there anyway using the resize_to_fit method to tell it prefer height over width

to generalize this approach you could try and check whether the offsettop of an element is greater than the height of the container or the offsetleft is bigger than the width

if width is greater then height then it is landscape orientation and it converts all the values under landscape column into json

let s consider i only want to allow 4 lines in the following example you can t go higher than a height of 84 pixels with the given font in a given uitextview with a width of 200

you can define more layouts with different width and height.then check the height and width and density of device and use that specific layout for that device

solved just compare width and height of the activesheet.usedrange range

notice how the buttons width and height are bigger than it appears

in retrospect what you re trying to do will not get you to make the imageview circular because the default imageview is rectangular the height is always more than the width and so.

i want to make the webpage scaling depend on screen height or width which is smaller

how would i use imagemagick to resize the image if it is larger than 1500 width x700 height whichever is larger comes first then reside the image

as proposed in other answers set the containing grid width or max width that will show the scroll bars only if the listboxitems height are greater then the grid height

putting this together plus caching width and height and using the simpler overload of random you can change this to

if a user s screen had a resolution of 1000x800px 100vmin would be equal to 800px and 100vmax would be equal to 1000px as the height here is the smaller unit and the width is the larger unit

we now have a clock that can scale properly but only if the viewport width is greater than the height not the other way around

if any of the width or height is less than l user is prompted to upload another one

after clicking on add to cart the customer can choose width and height

the only way i found to be sure that the view is in landscape mode is to test that the view height is less than the view width

although layout_width and layout_height are set to wrap_content the imagebutton is shown as a rectangle with the height greater than the width

it turned out that the image width and height was much more than was expected

this ensures that the image will cover the full page no matter the size matches height or width depending which is greater

my current code will rotate but will crop the edges if the height is larger then the width

make sure the parent width and height are larger or the same as the msg control s width and height

now this works on my desktop machine in firefox if i make the width smaller than the height

you have to multiplying both the width and the height by a constant and the scaled result of the multiplication should be less than 16777215

for the looping make sure to go one less than the width and height

there is no automatic clipping performed so you have to ensure that parameters top and left are not smaller than 0 zero and left + as well as top + are not greater than the width or height of the destination image respectively

when the picture is portrait height is greater than width the output is automatically rotated how can i prevent this behavior

you may need to crop if the image height is greater than the width so i decided to crop with dimensions equal to the width from the to left corner most likely you wont miss the face of the person this way

you could also do some magic with jquery on orientationchange and toggle some classes when viewport width is greater as viewport height

i have images that have height much greater than width

in the case the height is greater than width simply not all the rows will be used but all of the columns must always be used

for example my image width is 10mm but in height it is 300mm so i want it to appear reflecting this so in this case i would expect it to appear very narrow but tall because the height is so much greater than the width

if this value is greater than the width height of the above calculation then you need to use this value

using this parameter selects the mode that most closely matches width and height values even if doing so adversely affects performance by reducing the frame rate

it s has the same height but has more width

right now i scale by height which works to some degree however as the width gets smaller the image gallery will be cut off as the container has overflow hidden on some smaller widths as it is adjusting by the height of the container to stay in proportion but doesn t consider the width of the container too essentially the width is longer than the container width

imageview - have height match width

so if an image is in landscape size the width is shorter than the height which throws things off

i m required to write a function to overload the operator to compare width height and colour

32px height by width would be much larger obviously

using media screen and orientation portrait means that when is the width of the screen bigger then its height and when the soft keyboard popup the width of the screen become bigger than the height so that happen

if the width height percentage is higher than the fixed min-width height then the element wont resize until the zoom the fixed min-width height pixel count is greater

the layout s height is less than the height of everything else and the width of the layout is the same as everything else but when i use layout.getheight and layout.getwidth in my onresume they always return 0 so i can t really use that

the div 4 has the height of all other divs together and if the screen width is less than 600px i want to display them one below each other like this

when value assign for width and height it turn greater one to the target value and adjust another one by original ratio

when width of the image is greater than height set height to a fixed value and auto stretch width

when original image have less width and height or scaling ratio more ie 0.5 - 0.9 then all fine

while on portrait you should set trail and lead constraints as your height is bigger than the width so if you set 0 for trail and lead and 1 1 ratio you are safe that it will fit beautifully

5- delete all the contours that width is more than its height delete the very small contours the very large ones and the not rectangle contours

according to the exif-information the orientation is 0 so supposedly the picture is not rotated - but since the width is greater than the height the picture is in fact rotated

is there any way i could use regex or something to detect if the width is greater than 320 and if so have it replace the width and height by something that would fit

however when i build the apk and run it on my android phone the image is distorted width greater than height

here you are asking your browser to change the height of your element if the width is bigger than 1000 and 1300

therefore scaling the captured image to fit the uiimageview s width scale by 0.5 means the captured image will be of size 320x568 - its height is larger than the uiimageview s height

the width and height are little less because my printer doesn t support zero margin

the problem is when a users browser s height is smaller than the popup the overflow css property adds the ability to scroll which is what i want but it also adds its own width inside the popup causing one product to move down to next line

or you could to the same technique as above but for each property show products or the first product where the difference per length height and width are lower than 10 of the original property

it is quite possible that those large devices tablet have much larger screens width and height than a typical phone

generate initial square cells that fully cover the polygon with cell size equal to either width or height whichever is lower

i m not fully sure how this should work on desktops but i m pretty sure that when you resize the browser the orientation should change provided the height was bigger than the width and after resizing it s the other way round

the best i could come up with would be to scale the line to fit inside paper based on the width of the path assuming that the width is more than the height

- that s the real problem the height is autmatically calculated from the width by the proportions of the image but when the calculated height is more than 710px it will be forced to be only 710px and the image proportion will be distorted

okay here is the problem i have images of different sizes but that doesn t really matter because their width is always greater then their height and all images are resized to a 100px width height still is different in each image

so at first this looks ok but is actually is not all pixels in the image are not square but elongated with their height being bigger than their width

something traveling faster than the width height of your collidable area won t be reliably detected

if the height is greater than the width turn the display to none

in case height is more than width then you have to resize with height

inside you can either manually set width and height or use the more lenient getlayoutdimension int int

if image width is larger than height landscape then scale the height to 1024 pixels and scale the width to appropriate value to maintain aspect ratio

assume that my custom framelayout has only one child imageview which match width and height of his parent

width of the image is responsive but height is getting too smaller than the original image

in some browsers the iframe actual height width will be more than the css width height shown in the parent page

most of my images have a bigger width than height so when i scaled them i just put

first do one thing get the width of the document using java script and your sub div set min width of generating div on hover of sub menu if it is greater than minimum height than animate your sub menu sub div to wherever you want or you can also give style using java script css property

then how to know when width is greater and when height is greater

if you re using a sprite and specifying the height and width unless the width is larger than the sprite

you may want to check if the width is greater than the height

switch the values of the width and height so that the width is longer than the height

now i can see the image and just fit the screen nicely but the image is just at the top of uiscrollview . notes in this circumstance the width of my image after being zoomed to minimum zoomscale equals to the width of uiscrollview the height of my image after being zoom to minimum zoomscale less than the width of uiscrollview

update 1 upon further testing this problem occurs only when the desktop resolution height is less than 942 pixels width is irrelevant

so that means the width is longer than the height or that it is still in landscape

for scale use add new constraint and select height width

for once particular thumbnail i d like the width to be greater than the height because i want to go for this new layout

now width is always 64px but height is larger

my current solution to add an extra inside the container one and then set it s width and height to be be bigger by the margins i want to remove and the offset it by setting top and left to negative values of the respective margins

i have a bingmap its width and height is more than parent div

which means if viewport width is more than 970 and viewport height is more than 0 serve banner with size 300x250

how to calculate element s width and height with their padding margin values using less code

you can simply compare width and height of the image

i interpred this to mean that for example the width will be 5 8th of the width of the working area unless this results in the dialog which is taller than the height of the working area in which case it will use a wider width

it will scale your bitmap but not greater than the width and height that is because it can cause blurriness to your bitmap

would calculating text width and then making sure it s less than textbox width height how

in my site in a table of particular i have to insert a image as background.i did that but the image looks like double image as the image is smaller than cell width and height it is getting overlap

if width is more than 150 i will reduce the width to 150 and i will calculate the height

i have set the layout of j panel to null then i have set the bounds of j label greater than the width and height of the panel

i figured that if the image was actually in landscape then it was appearing stretched and truncated because it s width was larger than its height

realising that event.pagex would always be at least 1 and never more than 1 less than the width and that event.pagey would never be more than 1 less of the parent s height i added a rudimentary function to expand the coordinate range from 0 to the full width and or height

when the image is resized while maintaining its aspect ratio chances are that either the image s height or width becomes smaller than imageview s dimensions

then i d compare width height of each image to know if it s a landscape or portrait format and add a corresponding class

if the width of the browser window is larger than the height body width will be equal to the window height

when using an image.preserveaspectfit or an image.preserveaspectcrop paintedwidth or paintedheight can be smaller or larger than width and height of the image item

i think what you re asking for is how to return the information for all the images where the height is greater than the width

i have also messed with various cell sizes width 1 less than height height 1 less than width etc and messed around with some section inset combinations but have not managed to find the source of this issue that is causing the animated view to not to show up

choose whether to divide it horizontally or vertically if its aspect ratio width height is greater than a divide it vertically

but when i load datagrid with 9 rows its height is showing 452 instead of 450 9 50 and in the same way width also showing more than that

since the svg s width is much larger than its height every 1px change in the height of the svg is causing the width to change by about 10px

i heard setting the width and height may be slower so i always tried

the purpose of using a percentage here for me was in using one gradient to support large and small containers with size appropriate stripes while also auto sizing to either height or width whichever is more appropriate for the specific element

not to complain about the current behavior but as a design question instead of null can returning some illegal rect values such as negative width and height be a more useful alternative

width and height must be greater than 0

i am more concerned with width and height

you have to double check that the source width and source height are always smaller or equal to the image s width and height

now my requirement is if my table s height or width is bigger than that of image i do not want the image to repeat current situation

is set to portrait if the page width is less than the page height

the variables density width and height are lower than the original image s values

however nowhere in the code have you checked that the width of the view added to the top of the view is not greater than the height of bitmaptosave

i think your problem is because your view canvas label etc width height is smaller than your image

i ve used resize_to_fit to reduce images to a specific pixel size depending on the longer side but i m wondering if it s possible to do it with this logic instead for any image whose width x height product is greater than a set value resize the image so that the new width and height values are as large as possible while still being under that value

but as you can see top side is not fixed it is also moving slightly i want to make top side fixed it should not move like hermes website and want to make this wave continuous instead of just once when webpage loads also i noticed once wired thing that when i keep open my modified version in browser for 5-10 minutes it shrinks in size height width and gets too smaller after sometime

this works good for lots of stuff other center margined elements may appear #mid_con and will stack only problem is if left and right panel height are shorter than first middle panel the second middle panel will take up the whole #tub_con in width cuz is 100 appearing stacked directly under first middle div

on resize check if screens aspect ratio is greater than 1.0 width height if so display your page if not hide you page and show a message asking the user to rotate their device

of the viewport size for viewport width vw height vh the smaller

first set height greater than width

and how i can resize this user portraits to some specific needs in the custom view compare width and height in python according to some rules to calculate the right resize

it will also blow up any images smaller than max which you can stop with a bit of checking on whether or not both width and height are less than their max

does not match width and height

here are some other methods that work as well by either using the same layout mechanism for both width and height or giving more room for transforms

if width or height is greater than 1000px image should be valid

render the application without scaling when the application s width and height are larger than certain values

if that array size is bigger than 10 i would like to remove those objects which area width height are smaller

assuming the height or width whichever is smaller of your element is less than this total the radii will be scaled down proportionally

if either width or height has more than 0 then it doesn t return anything

i m not interested in the height only the width they won t be the same - the size will be dynamic but i can presume the height will be larger than the width

if the button contents width is higher than it s height then the binding will force it s width lower

firefox desktop and mobile showing the images with full screen width but cutting out the image parts which is higher than screen height javascript doing his job without problem

but this technique doesn t work when height is resized extended by word wrapping that is if a sentence is wider than the width of the text box and the textbox creates a new line automatically

first if the height is greater than 1000 simply scale both height and width by 1000 height

now inside the ongesture protected function handler of crosszoom it actually checks the innerregion of your chart and if your current x or y is greater than the width or height you get this from the innerregion of the chart of the chart respectively it s reset to the width height of the chart width and height is

the container should hide all what is longer as it width or height

resize scale image only if the width height is bigger than 1000px so that the resulting image s max width height is 1000px or less

to determine whether the image has landscape or portrait format simply check to see if width height is larger or equal to 1

a repeating image doesn t have a maximum height or width that using a larger non-repeating image would impose

in your case this means you are drawing a line from 0 0 to 1 width 1 height which is less than a pixel

ok so i m trying to see if an image s width is greater than it s height then apply a class if not apply another class

since the image is always 100 of the viewport it gets smaller and smaller by height and width because of its aspect ratio

i m trying to use universal image loader uil in my test project and i think i m having trouble loading images when their height is greater than their width

if the orginal file s width is greater than 480 or lessthan 450 then i want to set the width of output image as 450px.and the height has to be proportional of the width

the specified width and height cannot be less than the width and

if height is larger than width

as i understood the imagemagick documentation and various other questions and answers on stack overflow the caret should mean that if the image width or height is smaller than those minimum dimensions it s resized to meet them and also maintain aspect ratio

therefore width and height are more meaningful

i needed to compare the width and the height of the uiimage when width is larger than height i will add border

the images seem to store correctly however when i have a portrait image smaller width than height it is not displaying correctly but rather rotating the image on its side

you can make your radio buttons bigger by changing width and height in the below class

the img must cover all div both height and width must be greater than 100

i want this image to be cropped horizontally if the device width is smaller than image width and to have 100 of height

but if i look at in the firefox responsive design developer mode the circle takes always more space than it should when the wrapper containers height is larger than its width -

on xcode6 in storyboard we have a new button to choose height width of the device

width and height make much more sense as getters

so you will need to set a height to your .container and set a max-height 100 to your image since your image has lager height than width

this isn t causing your problems since width is greater than height and you stay within the object s memory when doing normal accesses to it

buuuut we run into a problem because i have to guess the image height for a full width drawing on bigger resolutions where the image won t be shorter than 400px if displayed at full width because if a 2500x1200 image is displayed at full width on a phone it s gonna end before the div does looking ugly

the first example is an image whose width is greater than its height

this method works great except for one thing if the new height is smaller than the new width the new height and new width successfully get modified but after the imagetoadd.draw rectanglef the size of the imagetoadd still has the new width value instead of the cropped width that is if i can assume that if i draw an image with -20 as its x-value the width gets modified with -20 as well

if you can get that to work you might want to try progressively removing the height width position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you want

however if you want to redesign your layout or make adjustments based on wether the screen is in landscape width is larger than height or portrait height is larger than width mode you can definitely use css media queries

please take a look at uicollectionview you should be able to configure the scroll mode to horizontal and adjust the cell size to what you have pictured height should equal your screen height and width be slightly smaller than the screen width

once both are selected go to editor menu and select height equally and width equally one by one under pin option

media screen and width greater than height

if the height of window ls less than width 2 scrollbar of window is enabled

and setting the option to prefer viewbox over height and width

width return a larger dimension than height which is not correct

and a width and height that is less than the size of the element s contents doesn t work very well when tags all need explicit height and widths or where layouts due to lack of float support and erratic treatment of s by necessity need to be based on tables most of the time

if the height of the image is greater than the width i just want to crop the height

once your image have a width higher than height you need to set only the new width and let the browser do the trick with the new height

1 check if width is greater than height

since table layout have the ability to break the assigned css width height it is better not using it unless it is table-like structure or you want to contents expand the container - so your

checking if screen width is larger than height is useless in my case because the app always runs in landscape

after the picture is taken the image is clear but is either shorter than the device height or the width is smaller depending on what device is being used

if you want the full image set the cavas scaler to match height instead of width

others because the width is larger than the height doesn t fit properly.that s why i crop them they must be centered in order to make sence

in safari the large image appears at the correct height and scales proportionally when the height is changed but doesn t scale correctly when the width is changed less then the width of the image

this is because s width and height are smaller than window size

as of today no browser implements a vertical slider based solely on height being greater than width

if the image that s inside has a width that s smaller than its height add class portrait

to answer your question monopsace characters have often a height two times bigger than their width

device width greater than device height

simple because the viewport has changed due to the keyboard showing and the final viewport has a height lower than width

also ordering by width and height separatelly is much more eficient and produces the desired result

now if width and height are smaller then required don t resize and just save your image

it happens normally when child divs width or height is greater than the parent div

stroke width must be smaller than the size height

i also want to make it where when the width of the box gets wider and the height gets taller it will re-center

with oversized i mean that the real image s width and height are higher then the place which is available for image by html and or css rules

in this example the absolute difference in width is larger but the percentage difference in height is higher

since the flex container box original width height is very less

you have to compare width and height in this method

essentially i detect if the view s width is larger than the height and if so rotate the view that contains the boxes

the image itself may be bigger or smaller than that height and width and i want to adjust the image to fit the size rather than repeating or showing only part of the image

nb the run time screen shot is me changing the height and width of the rectangle to an arbitrary size greater than the width and height of the textbox

because the width was bigger than the height of the pictures the img element was too small and the rotated picture overlaid some of the text above and below

works for matching the widest dimension there doesn t seem to be any way to specifically match width or height

edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

the second div contains an image random width height could be bigger than the available height width

this results in all your elements to be larger than the height and width specified

i want to maintain the aspect ratio so in doing the width resize the height of the image becomes greater than the height of the screen

if the width of the bitmap is greater than the height the returned image is in landscape so i rotate it 90 degrees

it only compares height to height width to width and so forth

however in this case when i have 150px height image the 150 width seems start lower

the second example is an image whose height is greater than its width

in your xml the tag specifies height bigger than width hence the oval

but a workaround could be to detect the size of the viewport if the width is greater than the height display normally

the smaller squares are also adding 2px to the height and width which means anything more than a 1x1 grid won t fit in the container

but for mobile phones with less than 320px width like iphone 5 the list of items is so long that there s not enough height

how can i adjust this behavior to say cap the height at a specific height and show more width or cap the width and make the height get taller

i noticed that the horizontaladvance of the chars f w y a is smaller than their normal width and the verticaladvance of the char is smaller than its height

here is another solution but make sure your image width and height is greater than the imageview

the code that i have so far seems to work as expected when the x-axis of the wrapper is bigger than the y-axis width height but for some reason when the height of the wrapper is bigger than width it gets all distorted

if the height is less than the width then rotate through 90 degrees

this problem arise when image-height is greater than image-width so if your image s height is greater than width then you should resize the image by swapping image height and width with each other before applying cifilter..

if image width and height are greater than 200 than then i re size them to 200px

so never height is more than 150px and width is auto to this height to keep it s ascpet ratio and also fit in this div

so the ring shape will be cropped if the width of the imageview becomes bigger than the height

portrait orientation is that one where the width smaller than the height

here x width and y height return 0 always since it s integer division and width and height are values greater than x or y

the image is exaggerated in that it s width is normally bigger than its height

also its actual width and height are much more than the max-width and max-height i have set in the css

width - set it a width make sure it has a priority more than others but less than height

in second scenario i will display image in fix width and height div which will be smaller than image width and height

then when an image is loaded the rectangle s style checks its triggers to see if the image has a height or width that is less than 100px

pass a value for width that is much larger than that for height and you will get a very wide figure

the first imageview will be working like before but loaded image will be scaled down so that it s width will be smaller than the width of the imageview and it s height will be smaller than the height of the imageview

the draggable div is greater in height and width than droppable div

given a scenario where you don t know the height and width of image elements in advance let s say that in cases where image height is greater than image width you d like to vertically center the image by cropping the same amount of pixels form its top and bottom such that the new image height matches the image width

personally i would extract it to a separate class just so that i could in isolation verify that given a width larger than a height i was returned a scalr.mode.fit_to_width and vice-versa

but if the width is less than the height then the body width is 100

in combination i had to do a manual check for the screen dimensions to see if the width was greater or less than the supposed height of the screen

i fixed the width and height this makes things easier and then rotated and translated the box to center it within the parent

i ve tried setting this up in the report properties but as per my observation the moment the height becomes lower than the width ssrs will automatically convert it to landscape

you can check the width of the image and if the width is bigger than height you reduce the image for the width instead reduce from the height to fill the container something like that

if top position relative to parent + height is higher than the parents height or left position + width is higher than the parents width assume the element is not visible

also i am not posting an image but i tried to set the height and width of the window to 96 in a previous experiment and the height was less than width

i am trying to resize the image based on if the height is larger than the width or width height

i believe the aspect ratio is defined as width height so does that mean that the vision framework cannot detect rectangles that have a width bigger than height

unlike other styling that is suggested to be done via a css the images width and height properties are better of by using those attributes

as you can see if image width is greater than height the script first makes image 128 px height

to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less

the above scaling assumes that the height of the grid location is always smaller than the width of the grid location

but on narrower devices like iphone 6 the background images just scale to fit the width of view port which make their height become smaller

because it is solid scroll bar calculated needed cell s height is not correct now cell s width is little smaller - scroll bar is part of a view

does this mean that if or when i resize the width of the web browser on my desktop pc so the width is less than the height of the web browser the portrait.css file will override the current style

because the game window can be resized the image needs to be rescaled to a specific size this is easy with the width of the image which is just windowwidth - 128 however the height is harder to pull off because the bottom of the image is supposed to disappear off of the end of the window

also i don t want to specifically select height width and length but any rows that may be inside properties

adjusting the height and width essentially adds more space around your text within the select

when you are using the orientation landscape you have to consider whether the keyboard popup will change the display once the width size is larger than the height size the css will consider it as landscape

height is slightly more tricky for it to work you need to have the parent of the overlay div to have a known width

same for width being greater than height

change the size of the brush so the viewport has more height than width and change the geometry accordingly so the lines still appear 1px thick

since you want height to be screen height and width can be more or less i d say try

basically you would start with a font height smaller than the height of your textview and then iterate or do a binary search through fonts of varying sizes until you find one that measures to smaller than the width of your textview

from what i remember there is something to do with the height-for-width drawing model that means when wrapping is enabled gtklabel etc request enough height to reflow the text for wrap-width even if there is more horizontal space available which leaves loads of empty space when the width is wider

how can fix this problem so any image that is lower than 500 width and height does not need to be resize

but when i try to upload an image with a width higher than the height i see that the lines that output vh vw return zero

the border-radius value doesn t matter so long as it s bigger than the height and width values to get a cirlce

if the background image s width is bigger than it s height it s width must be 100

if this is the case you ll need to set a width height or put more content in the div to fill it out

the whole problem is because of the div 2 height and width is larger than div 1

when i add a margin to the divs the width becomes smaller and the height stays the same so the aspect ratio changes

button height is higher than it s width

i had it as but the width and height came out smaller in the browser

div1 has fixed width but variable height so what i would like is that if div1 height is bigger that the div2 height the div3 stays under div2 and on the right of the div1 like here

since you want to track cars a simpler approach is based on the consideration that a person is smaller than a car or that with reference to their bounding boxes for a person usually the height is greater than the width usually a person is standing or walking for a car is the other way around

first you should compare width and height instead of measuredwidth and measuredheight

suppose if the ckeditor height is 200px and width is 300px then end user should not be able to add more content with height and width

i figure it has something to do with an image which has a width smaller than its height

if the circle s width height is larger than 1 2 of the textview height circle width height 200dp textview height 100dp then the circle gets correctly scaled but somehow there are some weird empty margins on the left right side of the circle

i can manage the height by giving specific size but the width is displayed less than screen size

another problem is if use multiple monitors together for viewing desktop the width will be very bigger than the height so the boxes will have smaller height and bigger width

both methods work excellent for views which dimensions width and height are less than the dimensions of the device screen 480x900

ability to select height width selection of desktop or entire desktop and stream live to that channel as if i was using flash media live encoder

if i have an image whose width is greater than its height rotating that image using this method and then painting it will result in the image being painted vertically above the point 0 0 and horizontally to the right of the point 0 0

while it works excellent i m trying to enter php code which resizes images to 120px by width or height whichever is larger

for orientation detecting you can use css pixels just compare width to height

and the height and width to be greater than 0

these are the cases if the image width is greater than 2048 then we need to scale down to 2048 same as if the image height is greater than 1229 then we need to scale down to 1229

for width i can use margin 0 auto but height is trickier because it would need to make a div absolute

likewise if we change img and #clock to have a defined width instead of a defined height then we have a clock that can scale properly but only if the viewport height is greater than the width

the returned url has a profile photo scaled according to your specified width and height and is cropped more or less to the profile owner s intent

the original image height is higher than its width woo no surprise so far

for some of them the width is much more bigger than the height for some of them the height is much more bigger than the width and for some of them height and width are almost the same

i suppose that it is happening becouse when the keyboard is opened it resizes the browser window to other size that on some devices is recognized as landscape becouse window width is greater than window height

i want to grab width and height from the url and

unless the screen height is less than 580px or width less than 930px

obs the font-size must be dynamic having text height limited by container height when container width is larger than text width and limited by container width when container width is smaller then text width

scaling the captured image to fit the uiimageview s height scale by 0.25 means the captured image will be of size 160x284 - its width is smaller the the uiimageview s width

if width is bigger than height print image-horizontal else print image-vertical

i resolved this issue by comparing scrollview s height with screen width can compare with height - based on your requirement

if i don t multiply image original width and height they are smaller

but the model is not fitting properly when the canvas width is less than height aspect ration less than 1

the reason why you would still see distortion is because the original image is wider than the width that you are specifying or height if the distortion is vertical

it respects both width and height while widht 100 or height 100 works unless the window width height is not smaller then image itself

note this holds as long as the condition that the height is always greater than the width is maintained

in the case the matrix s width is greater than height it will be padded with 1 s to make the matrix square

device height greater than device width

first you determine if existing image has width or height which is greater dimension

also make it so it ll always be centered horizontally and vertically and the width will always be 1.5x bigger than the height

visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero. i suppose it doesn t check if an element is into the view or not

to draw a crossed rectangle of height 2 times larger than its width using the low-level graphics package facilities i call

in your xml you gave and 10dp both vertical and horizontal spacing and then in your custom view implementation you gave 150 as width and height and 8 as padding basically they conflict try to make both values convenient since the columnwidth you gave is way more less than width you gave in your custom view

therefor all the images used should be at least 2x width 2x display height which means 4x larger

if image height is larger than width portrait then scale the width to 1024 pixels and scale the height to appropriate value to maintain aspect ratio

i have four layouts inside of my viewpager that are supposed to match width height of its parent the viewpager

hi i m working on an application that will be loading images and i m looking to scale each image to it s largest possible size for instance if the image is a landscape image if width is larger than height i would like to stretch the width to fill the width of the phone and scale height to keep it s aspect ratio

the width should be larger than the height

but if 2261 is the image display width then relative height will be less

if uiscreen mainscreen knows that i really want the height to be greater than the width whether or not i actually do how can i either query the actual dimensions or query whether the device is in portrait mode or landscape

in case the image s width height is larger than the device s screen width height i want to crop the image so it matches the device dimensions see picture below

similarly if width is greater than height the top position of the rotated image is incorrect

i have a div tag with height set to 800px i want that when the browser width is greater than 600px it shouldn t stretch the div but it should bring it to the middle of the page

so if the width was greater than the height doing

the view that you will add programatically will be aligned on the bottom of the relative layout and the map should have match parent as width and height so you can put the view on top of it just like the above

the image renders but then when i try to pinch zoom in and out only the height of the picture changes bigger or smaller with the width stuck at the iphone screen width

what should i modify to make the background image s width 100 when it s width is larger than the height and vice versa

right now what this code is producing is the right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the height

in this case if textview is higher then imageview imageview aspect ratio should be intact with max width possible and if imageview i higher then textview again width should be maximal and parent should have height as imageview

that is if we change the width the height is no longer actual because the content spreads over the new width making itself shorter in height

if the background image s height is bigger than it s width it s height must be 100

edit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize that

the svg should never be smaller than his width or height

the video may be 1920px in width but height can be smaller than 1080px and i want to get that height by ajax or api

otherwise if the height of the image id greater than its width

photoshop opens it and shows it vertical mac preview does too but getimagesize keeps telling me width is bigger than height

see css scale height to match width - possibly with a formfactor

upon further review it appears to only occur when the image height is greater than the width

where the width is wider and the height is shorter than 44

in xcode 6 storyboard if i select width height as all iphone portrait mode i.e 400 x 800 how it will adopt to other screens

on devices like the droid the bottom row is squinched in because the table width is smaller than the height

to fix it you should set the image background bigger than screen width and height for example if you are using 900x600 in your anchor pane you should set your image to 920x620

i check to see if the window s width is greater than its height in order to determine if the user is holding the device in landscape or portrait mode and i translate the data that the accelerometer provides based on that fact

using your sscce i see that with java 8u20 if i resize the window s height to be smaller and then click on grow width the upper and lower tabs remain the same height they were before

when text records in autocompletetext are more than its height automatically vertical scrollbar appears but why when length of text is bigger than autocompletetext width scrollbar doesn t appear

i can rotate it to any angle i want but i want to make the rotated square squashed making the height 2 3 smaller than the width

problem with this is sometime it adds black portion to the image if the image re sized height or width was smaller than 400w or 264h pixels

you can select width height and font so that you ll have comfortable window size

also if the image width or height is smaller than displaywidth scale you might want to cap it to be image width instead

i have a div with fixed position and height width is more than the window height width then full page is not appearing

if the video height was larger than its width the math is the same

the images are at of a maximum of 800px width so height might be more if its a portrait image

i m trying to ensure that if the text happens to be longer than the height of the image the image expands to fill the whole space left column but doesn t break its width constraint

if you resize the browser so that the height is greater than the width you will notice that the scrollbar goes away which is because the padding is relative to the width

so the scroll get the scroll width and height of the div 2 and as the div 2 height and width is greater than div 1 padding to right and bottom is not visible

now you can select width and height as per your choice

chrome however stops displaying the canvas when the height becomes larger than 8130 pixels the width is constant - 834 px

in this one the width height ratio is smaller

i ve tried using vmin but that does not help as the height of the window is almost always smaller than the width

size and more than that height and width window should be resize

however i realize you probably want it to be more than the width and height so you don t see the edges of the shapes but i figure you can fix that up

what i am after is to have the image the same width as the canvas and if the height is larger than the height of the canvas then it overflows and is hidden...i just want to fill the width and keep the aspect ratio

as you can see before its parent is sized the map_canvas height is zero and its width is larger that you might have expected

i upload expansion code to show photo by android camera on html as normal on some img tag with right rotaion especially for img tag whose width is wider than height

and kicks in when the canvas tags width 600 height 600 are larger than the style width 600

if its width or height is larger than your max values then it will be resized by keeping the aspect ratio

now i did the width 100 and height auto so as i minimize the screen the image will also lose width and height so that it wont distort the image but when i do that all the content i have underneath the carousel stays in place creating a a huge gap in between the carousel and the content below it

either define the height to be taller since the content is taller or don t define the width height and let it auto size

this way you get if the screens height or width is greater than 960px and the dpi is low probably you re on a tablet

i read somewhere a good point that android virtual keyboard only changes height of the screen not a width so i assume it would be a good idea to compare width before and after resize

therefore when i get my browser bigger width gets bigger as well as height

have you tried setting width to some as per your div and image ratio..just call a javascript to check width of image and of your div then accordingly set css attribute width of image to require percentage using script and height as auto.....and vice versa if height is more

following that if the width is greater than 1000 simply scale both height and width which may already have been scaled due to the height by 1000 width

in between 768 1024 and only when width is longer than height

regarding why you are seeing my guess is that your image s height or width are less than 1920 which is and since you are using in the while loop the greater check for that side fails and thus you never enter the while body

that is because some images have a larger width than the height ex 480 x 670

but what i d to do is to prevent user from making the frame size larger than specific width and height

detects width and matches height

#8 causes the width to be larger than the resolution i see the window s right edge show up on my secondary monitor and the height is slightly too large so the window partially overlaps the taskbar area

width is always bigger than height

i was wondering how to get the height and width of an image if i m rendering it react style so i can process it to flip it to portrait mode if the width is larger than the height

i want when draggable div dragged into droppable div the droppable div color get another color then draggable div width height get bigger and exactly fit to droppable div

what i mean is i want the full height of the image to be displayed but if the width is wider than the container allows using bootstraps grid system then just overflow hidden

check if object 1 s y + height is greater than object 2 s y + height and that object 1 s x + width is greater that object 2 s x

after the dialog is created set the new width for the dialog wrapper and start an animate if the current height is lower then the calculated

so the height cw + px sets the height to the size of the width and sets the top attribute to minus cr circle ratio times cw circle weight which results in positioning it either -10 of width when screen width is less than 400px or -30 of width when above 400px

you need to place .about_me outside .about_me_pic and maybe set a smaller width height if the total width is larger then the line the second element will go in the next line

landscape mode is when the window width is larger than window height

here s an example of the width being less than the height and then rotated 90deg.

as the simplest solution swap width and height if width is lesser than height so you always get the resolution of landscape mode

the width will be very less and height of image is scaled throughout height of tablet

the circle will stay perfect as long as the width is less than the height

the phone layout just contains one framelayout that matches height and width

with this implementation your layout will be square assuming the lower size between width and height

i use a directive to set the width and height which are passed into an isolate scope then set the background-image property when i detect the directive top offset is less than the height of the window

then you can safely pass in negative values or values greater than width or height

the issue now was that the if the rotated image s new width and or height got larger then the origin dimensions of the image then the proportions wouldn t be accurate and would cut off the imagesometimes depending the rotation angle

first vc i choose width and height in vary for traits

if you dont want to crop the image at all or use javascript i think your only choice is to force the text element to have the same proportions as the image with width approximately being 50 larger than height and then adjust the font-size text elements to fit the container

tried some option as width is less when we resize then list item move below and increase height of ul so using this method i am able to hide last visible

i use a rule of thumb that manmade artificial values such as money are best represented in decimal formats bigdecimal whereas natural values such as height and width are more appropriate as float double

so in my program the width and height are no more like 100pt but a number of cols and a number of rows

the button height is higher than it s width go to step 2

but because most monitors have a smaller height than width i used the height

empirically i ran code matching thousands of ellipses and i never got one return value where the returned width was greater than the returned height

for a very simple example there are three slides the slides are just fixed positioned at 100 width and height the last one has an overflow auto on it so one can scroll its content that doesn t need any animation and might not need more than 100 height eg

width should be smaller than height at about 100px - the all works fine

you should have the width and height set to less than or equal to whatever value you want

and i need the height to always be a little bit smaller than the width

i tried making them smaller with the width height

in java we have a restriction that width should not greater than height

make it very narrow and while its height is bigger than the desired one keep increasing width

now interesting part is here that in square class height width properties are no more required as it is replaced by side property to expose to outer wold so i am using new keyword to hide them

shapes width are a couple of pixels larger than their height and using that value in computations works

when working with a landscape photo the photo width is greater than the photo height

it applies to window objects but also to scrollable frames and elements with the overflow css property set to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less than the height or width of its contents

its working fine for square images the problem is when width is greater than height

however in my experience while this routine will return accurate origin and height information the width is typically longer than it should be

the images ratio does not fit with imageview s width and height or the image width or height is less then the imageview s width or height

define background-size to value smaller than width and height of the div

now i want to get all elements which position is in a specific interval or which width or height is not greater than a given value or which type equals some string

in the xml layout set the width and height to be a larger amount of dip

meaning if the height divided by width gives more than 1

or does it only load the portrait.css file on page load and if the viewport width is already less than its height

height is greater than 200 we need to calculate the new width and

orange has fixed width and height its bottom must be aligned with the bottom of white and it should be pulled to the right maybe with some offset from the right the height of white must adapt to be not less than height of orange

the idea is that the width is 3 times larger than the height and i was thinking to achieve this with overflow-x auto and overflow-y hidden as shown in the example from the second row 6-th column on these website

landscape orientation is that one where the width is bigger than the height

the point i m trying to make is that i want my horizontal width to be more than that of the page yet i want to size things fluidly which means relative to a single page height width

set the screen match mode to match width or height so as to scale it dynamically

now i want to order this array by the pictures with the biggest width worth and where the width is bigger than the height

with this gives you a figure of which the height is 300x smaller than the width

i tried to make the circle smaller with width and height but it didn t work

check if the element has height and width that are bigger than 0px

i tried changing the screen resolution in a virtual machine orientation change is really just a screen resolution change that results in width being larger than height or vice versa and could not trigger any layout events

the answer given above favors width change over height change so if you adjust the height a lot but because of mouse positioning the width also changes a bit the user will still see pretty much the same window

now in paintcomponents of mypanel i want to paint the rectangle with the width and height that are more than container frame width and height

i have acheived these things that image height should never get more than the div and its width should never be less than the width of div

the drawn circle which as the same radius as the bitmap s width and height is slightly larger than the bitmap

instead of making your images the background of a div put them as an actual element within those divs and give them a height of 100 choose height because your height will break before width since you have wide images

my fixed document xps has its page orientation set to landscape the page media size has a width that is longer that its height and it displays correctly in the viewer as landscape

i am trying to write an javascript to extract the pictures in the html whose width and height are higher than a specified value

this can be done using pure css using the vw viewport width vh viewport height vmin relative to width or height whichever is smaller vmax relative to width or height whichever is larger length units

use scaling when the width or height are smaller than certain values

now if a user uploads a picture with less height than width

i tried to add class and added the background image for that input.but the height and width is aligned bigger than the text box.on trying to change the height the input size reduced as the background img is inside the input

somethinghere s solution isn t bad but when the screen s width is greater than its height the image will leave 20 of white space on top and bottom

likewise if the height is greater than the width and

using canvas.getclipbounds should give the appropriate sizes even if the canvas width and height are actually larger

in my cellforrowatindexpath i detect the width of the device and if the width is less than 480 i set the image to the screens width and then set the height to the images height images width screen width to keep the image scaled

calling autosize in ie works great when i display the errors on login screen but on ff it returns height to be less than 20px and the modal popup seems to have a width but its height is less than 20

if the height is greater than the width just reverse the width and height variables

i imagine the error is that your i and j variables are becoming larger than the height and width

the 990 isn t hard-coded anywhere because the exact width that it slows down at is dependent on the height it s more of a total pixels thing

your ratio is a little more than one since your width is longer than your height so your left and right boundaries are essentially something like -1.5 and 1.5 whatever your ratio happens to be

this is to make grid consist of squares instead of having them look like rectangles with height few times greater than width closer to the north and south poles

if an image s height is greater than 250px resize it so the width is 250px and the height auto

thus you can write a script that would look at the width property and act accordingly that being if the width is 32.8 then check the height and apply the logic for if the height is greater than desired see article here

anyway i checked your code ..your mistake that you always calculate knopafmeting based on width that is correct if height is equal or greater than width

please select width and height any any in storyboard.it may be helpful to you

but 3x assets should have a width and height that is 1.5x larger than their 2x counterparts not 2x larger

i d like the height pixels back too while i m at it though the width is more important

in fact the gap doesn t appear at all when width is greater than height only when height is greater than width

is there a way to change the height so that its smaller than the width to make horizontal rectangles

so my intuition says that it is better to have an image where the height is much greater than the width

if you make it transparent or less than full width height then it will appear on top of the content behind it

auto shrink only seems to apply when the width is smaller than needed and not when the height is insufficient

the top image is 100 width of the browser but shorter than 100 height of the browser so the content peeks up a little bit the tops of the two images below are showing

try this function.it will reduce the size of the bitmap to 512 if its width or height is greater than 512

i have a div with auto height and 100 width .now inside this div i have to display one more div with remaining width available in the parent div and 100 height div should be displayed in full page after the button of the parent div got ended .also i want to show the second div with border so that any one can know the expansion of the div by seeing it

but is it dangerous to assume that while working in landscape mode the window height will always be less than window width and therefore making it the main constraining factor

update as pointed out by der golem take the smaller between width and height so that all sides should be equal

if i put image height is more than width i can fill the box easily

i want to use an image which is smaller than width of the screen but has height bigger than the screen

i assume this is because either e.x or e.y is no longer either greater than 0 or less than the height or width which is what i was trying to check with the iswithin function

i m trying to figure out why the java print api can t handle paper sizes where the width is greater than the height

this could happen if your fft size is much larger than the height of the drawing area or the number of spectral lines is a lot more than its width

i have the height and width constraints set to greater or equal to 200

that controls the #comment width well enough but height was harder to nail down

so i am trying to build a website using bootstrap and i am trying to arrange vertical and horizontal videos in a feed with a design where the first 3 and last 3 columns are occupied by a vertical video thus the height being longer than the width and the middle 6 columns being occupied by the horizontal video where the width is the longer side

image vies constraints are horizontal position constraints aspect ratio all three selected have equal width and equal height they scale on bigger screens

which means if viewport width is more than 970 and viewport height is more than 0 serve nothing

on the other hand if you need the user to insert it him herself using two fields one for width another for height would be much easier than validating the user input

i want to make an 100x100 pixels thumbnail of it and in this case because the height is less than the width the height should be 100 visible on the new image and the width should keep the aspect ratio of the image

i get a rectangle and then divide it until width and height is greater than 1

inversely if the width is greater the generated height will be slightly smaller

similarly max-height will be in effect when height is greater than width

if width and height are greater than zero your bitmap is not corrupted

fyi whenever you change the google maps height or width it is better to trigger this resize event

and if possible specify minimum width and height to ellipse and path also and make sure the path width should be smaller than that of ellipse

i think your iframe width and height are more than webview width and height

set the content view s width and height to be greater than or equal to the clip view s

so this will make width proportional with the height that is set but the problem is when the width is bigger than height

next means that the ratio of width to height in devices greater than 960px width should be 1 1

this is because the height of the second image is greater than the width

the goal is to make the max-width wider as the original image width height gets smaller

the following code is working without any error but my problem is when i create a thumbnail some times thumbnail are non understandable one some conditions such as width is very larger than height i also tried a code for calculate height automatically.but it won t perfectly works

rather than setting height and width try setting the position and letting the image scale to best fit the available space match height match width match both

my code so far which works like expected in the broswer with width of 560 and height of 500

1vmin 1 of viewport height or width whichever is smaller

there may be a better way to do this but a quick and dirty method would be to inspect the display s width and height with display.getsize point point - if the width is greater than the height then normal mode is landscape otherwise portrait

3-1 if height is more over than width then

issue is that user may link to an image that is of extremely large height and width which is more than the height and width of the div it is in causing some overflow layout issues

if the image is larger than the height it will only put the height to 350px and ignore the width that i ve set to 350 too

i use the ctframesettersuggestframesizewithconstraints function to define the size my attributed string will need but the height i get is smaller than it should be and also the width is bigger than the constrainsize.width parameter

i need display photo to fill full width and when image is higher than imageview height it can be scroll up and down

or continuously check the stage width height in onenterframe update and if height is bigger than width portrait else landscape

how can i call this method manually and pass the current size in which width is greater than the height

instead the svg s height is the same as its width when the height should be larger than it s width

same for the images height values although it is not set in css but when we put width 100 without setting height the image will be respective while still maintaining the aspect ratio yo ucan see that img-0 height is less that img-1 height because the first image has original image of 200px while the second image img-1 has 350px height again the output height is representing the actual and exact height on the screen no matter what the original height is

i don t want to manually set the height with 150px for example because based upon the screen size the height needs to fluidly grow shrink in size to match width

in crystal report if i set a user defined size as 4ã 6 it sets the page landscape as height is less than width due to this printer prints page on landscape mode i want it in portrait

with this the result is simply that width and height are no more set neither as attributes nor in the style the image cannot be resized and the image properties dialog no longer include the input boxes related to image size

you would then need your height to be 2 times bigger than your width

but the capture image s width or height can be less than that

vmin - relative to viewport s width or height whichever is the smaller

either the width 1348 or height 35667 is larger than max_gantting_size

it is to make it smaller by height and width

but the image data required for this height and width is greater than what is given by the file

this is the same as before if height is greater than width and swaps the calculation logic for the two directions otherwise


opera	safari	42
it works fine in ie10 11 opera 15 mozila 23 safari 5.1.7 win safari

according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

i already tested it and it doesn t match with opera google-chrome firefox or safari mobile

you may prefer firefox opera safari because it s safer technologically superior or whatever but you may lose several users that way remember firefox has only recently reached 20 of usage share

on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time

the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

fireofx google-chrome safari and opera has better css selectors support compare to ie

according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

all major desktop browsers win ie mac win safari mac win google-chrome win opera mac win firefox

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

ie9 win google-chrome win opera win safari win safari mac

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

i did one design which works for opera win firefox win + mac ie9 safari win mac ipad google-chrome win

i have this working fine in google-chrome osx win firefox osx win safari opera osx

safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

i ve checked the site on two machines vista with firefox ie6 ie7 ie8 safari win opera win

for one thing i would choose safari over opera

all my other browsers safari google-chrome and opera have newer javascript versions

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

i m using dinnextltpro-medium font on this site and noticed quite a difference on the rendering between safari 6 google-chrome mac and the rest of the world safari 5 mac win google-chrome win firefox win opera win...

browsers firefox win osx google-chrome win osx ie win safari osx ios opera osx

i have the problem in firefox 3.6.13 and have tested against current versions of safari win google-chrome opera and ie where the code all works perfectly

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

i test on win google-chrome and don t know how it works on safari firefox ie opera

i have used some css hacks to get the position pixel perfect on firefox ie 7 8 9 and 10 win google-chrome opera and safari however on mac google-chrome and mac safari it is a few pixels out

i am currently testing using various versions of firefox ie opera safari for win google-chrome on winxp and winvista

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

the downside is that you cannot use it for browsers older than ie11 firefox 31 esr safari 7.1 ios 7 konqueror all versions and opera all versions

i d support both ie still has a big chunk of the user space with firefox and others opera safari etc.. occupying a smaller percentage of the browser market

incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox

everything works fine for google-chrome 26 ie9 win safari 5.1 and opera 12 all of which detect the 5px setting

for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

i ve used this in ff2 ff3 ff3.5 safari 4 win opera 9+ google-chrome 2 google-chrome 3 and they all work

everything works correctly for me in safari 6.0.2 firefox 18.0.2 mac firefox 10.0.1 win opera 12.12 mac and ie 9

firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

i think it doesn t work entirely correctly in ie6 but it is fine in ie7-8 firefox safari win opera google-chrome


freebsd	linux	13
the fact that mac users tend to be less unix-savvy than linux or freebsd users probably doesn t help but even without that this is a perfect way to end up with thousands of people who have a pip and a python that doesn t match and no idea why

just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that freebsd works much better on low-end hardware than a modern linux distro does

for best ready-made os go with latest freebsd as-is which still outperforms linux 3.10 networking using basic hardware. otherwise intel and linux will works just fine for basic drop-free 10gbps capture provided you are eager to roll up your sleeves

i d prefer freebsd or openbsd or linux

this is basically using the unix select call although both freebsd and linux provide more optimized alternatives such as kqueue

be aware that the bourne shell in freebsd is more capable than on linux

i have done some cross-platform development before on freebsd linux which was considerably easier - and i had people in the group with experience that i could talk to

i d expect that freebsd would be more stable least changing from release to release than either linux or s11e

migrate to enterprise linux or freebsd postgres works much better on unix type systems mdash

tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally

linux containers and freebsd jails are a better alternative to chroot

no guarantee but it s rather likely. in your case it s even more likely as linux freebsd and os x are all posix-compatible

for students in computer science major learning programming on linux freebsd is much better than doing these on windows


nvl	sysdate	1
select nvl date_field to_char sysdate yyyymmdd hh24 mi ss from table_name


mdx	dax	2
the calculation language is dax which is an improvement on the horrible mdx - dax reads more like excel functions

using the powerpivot excel 2010 addin i believe its possible to effectively create this kind of function using dax and mdx has more built-in functions such as median


luis	api.ai	2
my team is more experienced with api.ai and only starting to learn luis

api.ai is free the performance on big enough training set matches ibm watson and microsoft luis


activiti	drools	1
i have implemented it using process library and my own java code however i m wondering can it be done in simpler way with activiti jbpm and drools


squash	merge	12
in the options dialog you have to pick merge to working tree otherwise the commit happens without you being able to pick any options squash

if you click the dropdown and choose squash and merge all intervening commits will be squashed into one

if you really need to be the only one to whom your work-in-progress history is visible you could create a local branch pointed at the head of your local work-in-progress to preserve a named reference to the commit and then perform a squash merge git merge --squash which will still create a merge commit but will collapse your work-in-progress commits down to a single commit the local branch you created earlier will still point to the true detailed history however

moreover i read that a branch is just a commit but why do we have to merge branch but pick squash

i pull switch back to master pull select merge choose my local dev branch under merge options i select squash under fast forward options i leave the default if a fast-forward only update the branch pointer the other options are if a fast-forward create a merge commit and if not a fast-forward fail

prefer squash small commits into a fat one before git svn dcommit or branch merging using either git rebase -i or git merge --squash

when merging instead of just clicking the merge pull request button click the drop down menu and select squash and merge option second option down

this command will open up an editor where you can just replace pick with squash in order to remove merge them into one

after enabling it when merging a pr you can choose squash as the merge strategy

i see ones i merge master to feature branch i can not squash he commits any more using interactive rebase

and then replace pick with squash for the commits you want to squash merge

usually i use git rebase pick squash to merge them but my partner said that way too long and he tell me should try cherry-pick


systemtap	perf	1
perf standard tool dtrace supported only in some linuxes have license problems - cddl incompatible with gpl stap systemtap works better with red linuxes like centos


emacs	sublimetext	4
though it is more or less similar to sublimetext 2 s monokai there are some differences which i want to correct so as get my emacs monokai more close to sublimetext s monokai

get aquinted with some good text editor like sublimetext text2 or notepad++ hardcore programmers will recommend vim or emacs - don t listen to them yet

for those who prefer sublimetext instead of emacs as the editor of choice to program sml the following guide describes how to configure sublimetext to work with sml

this is the one thing i think sublimetext does better than emacs


coffeescript	haml	1
i prefer haml sass coffeescript so i created a guardfile to automatically generate html css js and copy from src to www


qstyleditemdelegate	qitemdelegate	2
qstyleditemdelegate is newer and the qt documentation about qitemdelegate states that

having implemented a similar approach for a qlistwidget i recommend using qstyleditemdelegate in lieu of qitemdelegate as it allows you to more easily integrate this widget with your application s style layout


fossil	git	6
so just pick git mercurial fossil or whatever else dvcs which suits your needs

as the comments already mention if you are starting out with version control you would be well advised to choose a newer system than rcs git mercurial fossil subversion ...

4 fewer merge options than in git though the fossil workflow makes merging less likely to occur in the first place.

i d recommend git msysgit on windows mercurial tortoisehg makes a great explorer addin and fossil as an awesome lightweight alternative

from the article it sounds like fossil isn t a database any more than git is a database

fossil is another one that s easy to use i would say easier than git to learn but it uses an sqlite file to store your code and i m not sure if it scales to really big projects


r-tree	quadtree	15
if your objects are sparse then a quadtree or related data structure r-tree etc. is probably better

you can also try a quadtree it has some better perfomance over a r-tree

r-tree are much faster than quadtree for nearest neighbours queries

on the other hand the wikipedia article on r-tree seems more specifically targeted towards mapping than the k-d tree or quadtree

maybe a r-tree or a quadtree can be faster

i believe instead of r-tree a point quadtree would be more effective for your need

quadtree indexes are created faster than r-tree

i would recommend r-tree or quadtree

quadtree and r-tree have different performance tradeoffs for different tasks quadtree can be faster when objects are more uniformly distributed in space or when their positions change frequently and r-tree can be faster when searching for all objects in a given region

a quadtree is a simpler data structure than the r-tree

quadtree are easier to implement r-tree can be twice as fast than quadtree

there are other multidimensional trees that are usually better than kd-trees quadtree r trees like r-tree but much faster for updates or ph-tree

i use quadtree more than r-tree and find them super flexible

your r-tree approach is the best approach i know of that s the approach i would choose over quadtree b+ trees or bsp trees as r-tree seem convenient to build in your case

r-tree are substantially faster than quadtree for window queries like inside contains covers etc


gif	bmp	6
there are a couple of options where you can set one color as transparent then load a simple bmp jpeg and do some bitmap tricks however using ico gif will be far easier for this

gif jpeg png bmp are more standard than any vector format where usually adobe has the market

you could also use bmp in place of gif and get a larger file size

but when i try to save the image as bitmap with the new color map it says bmp gif files cannot have more than 256 entries in the color palette

i haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmp

jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss


momentjs	bootstrap-datetimepicker	1
since bootstrap-datetimepicker use momentjs it is better to use localized formats from the official documentation


slim	phalcon	1
i recommend using slim or phalcon micro app


opengl-es	glkbaseeffect	1
among other things the apple template code will include creation of a glkbaseeffect which provides some shader functionality that seems to be required in order to be able to draw with opengl-es 2.0


imagemagick	minimagick	1
based on my own experience i would look into a gem like minimagick which provides a nice interface to imagemagick which is a more common library for the tasks you re trying to do


postorder	inorder	1
postorder is trickier because the stack has to store nodes to visit and nodes to process and they aren t always simply related like they are in the inorder case


fasta	biopython	2
also if you are working with fasta files i recommend using biopython it makes working with collections of sequences much easier

for fasta formats in general i would recommend using biopython package


slimv	slime	1
i prefer slime over slimv for its simplicity


haskell	elm	1
my bone to pick with elm is that its type system isn t as expressive as haskell s


ibatis	mybatis	1
a data mapper tool like ibatis now mybatis will give you more flexibility


background-repeat	background-image	1
the following question recommends setting background-repeat no-repeat but that seems only to work for background-image not b ackground-color


uigesturerecognizer	subviews	1
i much prefer using uicontrol over uigesturerecognizer to solve such problems because it handles events elegantly and obeys hierarchy so for instance if a uitableview is its subviews the uicontrol will not interfere with scroll and touch events on the uitableview


memcpy	memset	14
your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy

as you have already seen when you eliminate memset datasrc 0 n the first memcpy is even slower because the pages for the source must be allocated as well

when touching the destination buffer of memcpy memset b2 0 buffersize... then the first run of memcpy is also faster

it is understandable that memset is faster than memcpy

what more it seems to beat memset too when memset seems like it could benefit from optimizations that memcpy or memmove can t

the problem is that memcpy is only slighly slower than memset when i expect it to be about two times slower since it operations on twice the memory

if the list of memset and memcpy calls get longer then i d suggest to do it like this

at the very least i would have expected that before memset b 0 len that memcpy would be slower because the of lazy allocation first touch on the first of the 100 iterations

i suggest you starting with memset instead though since memcpy is much more complicated than you might think

for data-sets several hundred kilobytes memcpy memset perform faster than anything you could mock up

the objective seems to be to initialize the pzbuffer and i agree that memcpy or memset would be a better choice

you could use memcpy memset for strings too but strcpy is simpler

both memcpy and memset taking less that 2 10ths of a second for 10 million iterations

memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute


altera	xilinx	2
xilinx tools suck but their raw silicon is better than altera

how can i compare xilinx tools flow and altera tools flow


sqldatareader	sqlconnection	3
it s much more difficult in 2.0 until you get your rythym down as previous poster i d recommend sqlconnection and sqldatareader etc

once you have this you should be able to have more than one sqldatareader shared on the same sqlconnection in your code and use them independently of one another

the exception may be thrown from the code you are displaying but i would suspect that the cause is because of an sqldatareader associated with the same sqlconnection used earlier in the program execution that has not been disposed


affinity	processors	7
i have created a window application in c#.now i want to set the cpu affinity for this application.i may have 2 processors 4 processors 8 processors or may be more than 8 processors

so the difference between the two is that if you assign affinity at the thread level you can assign them to more than one processors and spread the load more than with all threads assigned to one processors

right click on it select processors affinity and assign as much processors as you like to the emulator

on a system with more than one processors or processors cores you can normally assuming you do have a smp-enabled system cpu affinity doesn t prevent it expect those two processes to use both processors but you do not strictly have a guarantee

right click the process memoryanalyzer.exe whose processors affinity you want to change and choose set affinity

you ll have to experiment setting processors affinity or having more ums scheduler threads to see if you can get past this limit

when the android emulator is starting open up the task manager look under the process tab look for emulator-arm.exe or emulator-arm.exe 32 ...right click on it select processors affinity and assign as much processors as you like to the emulator


pthreads	epoll	4
the best solution is to use select pthreads epoll linux kqueue bsd or i o completion ports windows depending on your platform

for the cygwin family of pthreads runtimes on windows they had to implement select epoll etc

most particular platforms restrict the list of calls that can be interrupted to a smaller set than pthreads allows so you d have to look at the linux docs to be sure exactly what is and isn t eintr-safe but the epoll family of methods along with read recv write send and friends are almost certain to be unsafe

how i d very much like to know has microsoft implemented the system call that underlies select epoll given that it has to function on sockets serial ports pipes and everything else in the land of pthreads that is a file descriptor when everything else on windows can t


maven-antrun-plugin	maven-wagon-plugin	1
instead of maven-antrun-plugin it is better to use upload goal of maven-wagon-plugin


flask	web2py	1
frameworks like flask cherrypy pyramid or even web2py might be the easier ones to start with


overwrite	preserve	1
on each repetition of the outer non-capturing group the contents of the inner capturing group are overwrite which is the reason why only the last match is preserve


tiff	ico	1
i recommend using either my own twelvemonkeys imageio plugins supports tiff ico and adds better jpeg support but i guess you could also use apache commons imaging or other library


parent-child	one-to-many	1
first choose between one-to-many and many-to-many parent-child relationship


icalendar	rrule	1
it s possible for icalendar software to make this a lot shorter with rrule but these calculations are hard and not everybody implements it


jgrowl	qtip	1
craig wrote the removedata is just a hack to allow more than one qtip to be bound to a single element at any one time hence allowing multiple jgrowl s


teamcity	ncover	1
it turns out there is an issue with the fullreport with ncover 3 and teamcity 7 read more about it below


addslashes	multibyte	1
as mysql_real_escape_string escapes characters according to default charset so it is better than addslashes function and it properly sanitizes sql injections arising out of abuse of multibyte character sets but in another article here a workaround-scenario is shown that explains that injection can still be done


mouseout	mouseenter	24
mouseenter and mouseout afterwards is cheaper for what you are doing and fires it s event only once

i prefer using mouseleave and mouseenter then mouseover and mouseout

i highly recommend using mouseenter mouseout function since they trigger only when you enter and leave an element

if you to bind events and use the benefits of a normalized event system you ll use the first version for regular blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error or your custom events

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

i would also recommend using mouseenter and mouseleave rather than mouseover and mouseout since you will have child elements with your menu

the available events are blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

bind works with almost every event you need possible event values blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup and error

i don t think that this kind of javascript library exist you could easily build one with jquery just listen to all the event blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout

you could try playing with different events i think mouseenter and mouseout might work more consistently

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

i recommend mouseenter because mouseover is noisy it fires more than once as you move from one child element to another within the form and can cause flickering when used with mouseout

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

i tried changing the event but sagepay overrides all these events blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu

val css html text data width height offset blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout


isotope	masonry	6
notice that this is not the same as masonry or isotope which allow lower images to cross over the edges of higher images

they do this using a jquery plugin called isotope which is a more complete version of masonry you pay for

does anyone know of a jquery plugin that would stack elements like masonry or isotope and displays bigger smaller elements based on importance

according to this answer the isotope plugin might work better than masonry for media-queried resizes

in its stead you can use isotope - which does filtering a lot easier than masonry

masonry was the first one and works very well and isotope is the newer version that expanded on the original thinking along with additional features like sorting


tinyint	boolean	9
does tinyint in mysql take up more space than boolean

2 from an indexing point of view you could argue that an index on a boolean well tinyint field is smaller than indexing a datetime field

in mysql database after select boolean it is showing tinyint 1 but the issue is when in database the value is 1

according to the internet mysql doesn t support a native datatype which makes sense why whenever i choose boolean i see the column end up as a tinyint 1

experienced mysql experts recommend using tinyint as a de facto boolean type

bit will map to boolean as well but when exporting bit with mysqldump will look like 0 so i recommend tinyint 1 which will look like 0 or 1

for all thing with boolean is better tinyint 1 or enum y n

the mysql documentation recommends using tinyint 1 for boolean values so tinyint 1 is probably the best

i can choose boolean or tinyint and use the values 1 and 0 but was just wondering about the values true and false


touchesbegan	touchesended	3
if the value of touchesended is more than 3 seconds beyond the current time and the time of touchesbegan is still before touchesended then it s time to show your hint

if the value of touchesbegan is greater than touchesended then an active touch is going on

btw for extra credit if you are using ios 3.2 or 4.0 or later use the uipangesturerecognizer class to handle the drag and drop logic - the drag and drop motion is a lot smoother than overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended .


cakephp	yii	6
instead i would recommend laravel as it s such an amazing framework but you should also try out cakephp symfony yii or something else which is still being developed

if you employ php frameworks like codeigniter yii maybe even cakephp which have comparatively smaller learning curves you will find your path wellpaved for you in php

yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp

i am currently looking at yii and while its more complex than codeigniter the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s

cakephp is sweet too but yii have more things and is more advanced

tried cakephp but yii seems much clearer


vmware	bootcamp	2
that said i d recommend bootcamp and parallels vmware

i ve found that bootcamp was slightly faster than vmware non bootcamp image but i still use vmware the majority of the time because i like using the host os for things like mail chat browsing


nssearchfield	nstableview	1
now i am observing for changes and if selected object do change and if nssearchfield is the one changing it programatically select nstableview first row


free	strcpy	1
additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


lisp	sml	1
if you look at a language like sml for example and compare it with lisp the functional core of each is almost identical


ceylon	kotlin	1
if scala 2.10 s reification turns out to be more limited than kotlin and ceylon


decimal	ieee	5
the maximum representable value with ieee 754-2008 binary32 is so the base 2 log of a number stored in binary 32 is less than decimal 128

decimal types libraries are fantastic for financial applications because we re used to dealing with the style of rounding required in financial stuff but there is the cost that they tend to be slower than ieee floating point

i understand the ieee rounding in r for values that are to one decimal place ie 0.5 becomes 0 1.5 becomes 2 but what about numbers that are to more than one decimal place

the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an ieee 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 decimal digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision

double has its ieee floating point definition which is also much more complex than decimal


behat	mink	3
i would say behat + mink is more useful for that purpose

if you are just beginning i suggest you stick with the latest versions of behat and mink they are much better and have been more than stable for the past 6 months

often especially when using mink to test web applications you will find that behat goes faster than your web application can keep up - it will try and click links or perform actions before the page has had chance to load and therefore result in a failing test that would have otherwise passed


richfaces	icefaces	11
richfaces looks more good option to work than icefaces bcoz it has inbuilt support its easy to learn its long time support guarantee for seam+richfaces combination

icefaces provides more good looking components than richfaces

seam is more powerful with jsf but not necessarily richfaces or icefaces for they mostly just extend the component set which is anyway fall down to standard html components when rendered by jsf

i did my part of the research and found out that either richfaces or primefaces would be better but most of my applications were developed using icefaces

my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs

richfaces has better ajax support than icefaces

you should be able to mix and match icefaces and richfaces just fine

that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation

with jpa ejb and jsf for presentation layer you can choose between icefaces and richfaces as jsf component library both support trees as well as drag and drop

there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces

for the view layer we have to choose between primefaces icefaces 2 since we definitely want jsf2 and richfaces


changelistener	listeners	2
now this basically boils down to an observer pattern swing implements this kind of functionality in it s listeners changelistener springs to mind as a possible candidest but propertychangelistener is a more powerful option as it generates events based on the property that has changed

if you have more than 1 changelistener and at the same time no mapchangelistener setchangelistener registered on your property the listeners wont be executed


keydown	onkeyup	1
onkeyup is probably the way to go but you raise a good point about it not firing if the element loses focus between keydown and keyup


bots	api.ai	1
also - maybe you ll prefer api.ai or maybe - watson nlc-based bots


setlocale	strftime	1
you can probs achieve this better by using strftime and setlocale


reportlab	pdfrw	2
you can use a similar but perhaps slightly better path with pdfrw -- you can run pdfrw in conjunction with reportlab and import the pdf you exported from pydot and use it as a form xobject similar to an image on the reportlab canvas

if you want to place existing pdf pages in your reportlab documents i recommend pdfrw


pyquery	beautifulsoup	5
if you re at all familair with jquery and possibly even if you aren t might i recommend pyquery as one alternative to beautifulsoup

pyquery is based on lxml so it s also much faster than beautifulsoup

pyquery uses the css selector syntax familiar from jquery which i find more intuitive than beautifulsoup s

although pyquery is the jquery equivalent judging by your use case i think maybe something like beautifulsoup could be better suited for what you re looking to do

also pyquery is significantly faster than beautifulsoup in many cases for processing results


sproutcore	javascriptmvc	2
i know sproutcore is backed by apple and looks like it is getting more popular by the day and it has a nice green website whereas javascriptmvc looks less professional with less of a following and less momentum behind it

it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction


nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	11
joshua bloch s effective java recommends throwing nullpointerexception over illegalargumentexception in this situation item 60 favor the use of standard exceptions

there are some instances of implementations that i have seen for some methods that throw nullpointerexception if argument is null but that is wrong implementation in those cases illegalargumentexception makes much more sense

so throwing nullpointerexception would be legal however it s not the common practice so i would recommend illegalargumentexception

arguably throwing a nullpointerexception would be more idiomatic than throwing an illegalargumentexception though

notice my use of illegalargumentexception instead of nullpointerexception - the illegalargumentexception is more in line with what you re hoping to achieve

since it s an exported method clients should get an exception on their abstraction level so illegalargumentexception is better than nullpointerexception

as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative

disclaimer all this would be needed just to throw an illegalargumentexception which is less idiomatic than a nullpointerexception

also throwing illegalargumentexception makes more sense instead of nullpointerexception when string has blank empty or null values

in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method

decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever

dropbox	icloud	5
unfortunately the default behaviour is that the picker always starts with icloud drive so each time a user wants to import something from dropbox they have to tap on locations and pick dropbox from there - two unnecessary taps

and in this menu user can choose icloud google drive dropbox ...etc

instead of dropbox i could use key value store as rest web service which i want to do later but have no time for this for now in my opinion my solution is more reliable than icloud and which is very important i have full control on how itâ s working mainly because itâ s my own code

initialy i have used icloud but finaly i prefer dropbox

i ve tried to put a documentpicker to get a file from icloud but actually my app opens the documentmenu to import a file icloud dropbox and when i choose icloud i present the document picker with my files


mtu	ppp	1
when udp data size is smaller 1452 than ppp mtu no error


lift	scalatra	1
it fills the gap between scalatra and lift more powerful than scalatra and easier to use than lift


nsdatadetector	uitextview	1
you can read about nsdatadetector to get more info about it it can detect phone numbers mail adresses etc. the uitextview often detect some by defaults


innodb	tokudb	8
myisam beats innodb and tokudb on full table scans since it is basically just sequentially scanning a file

tokudb alone beat innodb in our benchmarks by about 25 but when i turn master-slave on innodb now beats tokudb by about 20

tokudb blows innodb and myisam out of the waters in specific situations but is not a general replacement db engine for everything under the sky

at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

there s also tokudb engine that surpasses innodb in terms of scaling both better than memory engine

from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb

i use tokudb on tables of up to 18 billion rows and nothing else comes close it s at least 100 times faster than innodb for random inserts on big tables

one reason that we choose innodb tokudb is we need partition support and maintenance friendly


bfg-repo-cleaner	git-filter-branch	1
but bfg-repo-cleaner is a much faster solution than git-filter-branch


jikes	javac	1
on the other hand my primary ide intellij idea allows do that choose between javac jikes or eclipse compilers


tidyverse	lubridate	1
lubridate is another package from the tidyverse it makes easier work with dates and times


silex	slim	3
you can do a good job with php too but i suggest to use frameworks like silex slim or laravel that are better suited to put up a rest api which you will need if you want to use backbone

i think silex produces a bit uglier code than slim but i m afraid to choose slim because it s changing constantly and i will be stuck with the current version if it breaks backward compatibility

silex seems to have a bigger community than slim maybe it s just my point of view


settings.bundle	plist	2
3 instead of selecting settings.bundle - select plist

on this screen you can see on the left site the root.plist with the childnode item for the additional plist file called more.plist which is located within the settings.bundle in xcode


reentrant	readerwriterlockslim	1
the readerwriterlockslim class is an example for a lock mechanism where one can choose between reentrant and non-reentrant


puts	gets	3
you can choose fputs if you re worried about the ending newline that automatically gets added in puts

gets and puts were supposed to be used for simple input output from the terminal whereas fgets and fputs are more general and provide finer control you can specify the stream and they do not perform any implicit linefeed handling

immutable tree maps have o log n puts and gets which is asymptotically slower


bmp	png	18
also note that without compression also image size is just 30kb for rgb image and if you reduce size to 60x60 pixels image size would be only 10kb without any compression i.e you can use bmp images and if you want lesses sizer but lossless compression you can choose png

i feel like if the bitmap class makes data modifications to the stream then it would have to decompress the stream which should make the bitmap class take the same amount of memory working with bmp streams as when it works with png streams despite the fact that the png streams is smaller

gif jpeg png bmp are more standard than any vector format where usually adobe has the market

i recommend not to use jpg as mask because of its lossy format i recommend bmp or png bmp is better

for my senior project i am trying to find the best way to create a grid of up to 1000+ x 1000+ images and save as a png tiff psd bmp etc i prefer png with the ability for the alpha transparency

working with a png as opposed to say a bitmap bmp is made somewhat more difficult by the fact that gdi does not natively support pngs

i have a sample wpf app here and wondering why bmp is loading faster than png

textures use apple s own texture2d class from the samples bmp will work but i recommend png because of the platform optimizations

note that the png format is much more complex than bmp since it allows compression etc

jpg png is slower to draw than a bmp

jpg jpeg bmp png webp gif svg js map ico css less scss

not only do png files have natural support for transparency they are also smaller than bmp files

if you check the description of imwrite you will see that if you want to save your image as binary you are supposed to choose bmp png or tiff

you can use png jpg bmp as well as ico file but everyone recommend png

is not simple scale or crop but to be able to rotate scale and crop every single sprite and draw it in the exactly order to compose the final hight resolution image in a backbuffer then save it in bmp and make some copies in lower resolution as png

i haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmp

rebuild a new png format in-memory data which is much more smaller than current bmp data and send the new png format data by socket to remote server

using imagemagick or graphicsmagick would be better idea but if you really want to use sips you could try to remove transparency by converting image to bmp and then back to png again


bionic	newlib	1
note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports


inline-functions	inlining	4
if a definition should be in a header to allow inlining i personally prefer inline-functions with external linkage as addresses compare equal and the compiler still can inline if it thinks it s worth it

i m well aware that inline is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to inlining non-specified inline-functions so the user control is almost negligible

using options such as -os for the compiler to tell it to make the code small in other words don t inline-functions unless the code is shorter by inlining than by calling the function and don t unroll loops etc etc - but do inline-functions called only once as that does make the code shorter

compilers are getting better with inlining the use of function pointers where the function is actually known but contemporary compilers certainly don t always inline-functions calls through function pointers even if all the context would be there


flot	graphael	1
i found jqplot easier to use with more options and better documentation than flot or graphael


single-quotes	double-quotes	9
obviously json is not javascript but still that s a reason why a some might prefer double-quotes in their javascript so that object literals look like json and b some might prefer single-quotes so that they can manually encode json without having to escape the double-quotes

escaping the quotes with back-slashes works hi there you but embedding apostrophes single-quotes within double-quotes is often easier

that said this is html so double-quotes are actually more common for attributes than single-quotes

first you can use double-quotes or q it just takes more work than single-quotes or q

basically what i need is a regex expression that only selects double-quotes that are not surrounded by single-quotes

also i recommend using single-quotes for string literals not double-quotes

another side note single-quotes inside xpath string looks a bit tidier than escaped double-quotes imo

i prefer using single-quotes instead of double-quotes unless quoting something with a single-quote inside it s a bit more javascript-y

i tend to use double-quotes just out of habit from other languages but i don t have a strong preference i m willing to change if i hear of a compelling reason why single-quotes are better but to date i ve not even heard a good reason let alone a compelling reason


tvos	ios	4
running this set up always picks the ios simulator even when i select tvos as the target

something that is open-source and well supported future proof we re using google facebook github and twitter optionally email-authentication for web mac win ios android and tvos

states that you can share in app purchases between ios and tvos

tvos is more similar to ios than it is to watchos although they all have some similarities


vim	notepad++	4
my personal picks are vim eclipse or notepad++ if you re using windows

get aquinted with some good text editor like sublimetext text2 or notepad++ hardcore programmers will recommend vim or emacs - don t listen to them yet

in vim they re more of a placeholders for splits so my guess is you ll have a hard time working with them if you mean to just copy your notepad++ s way of work to vim

lately i have used notepad++ a bit more than vim


mongoid	mongomapper	4
i highly recommend checking out mongoid or mongomapper or just using the mongo gem itself rather than taking this approach

likewise you can compare mongoid with mongomapper actually you could but there is no comparison because the last one is almost dead

over the last year it looks like mongoid has been more regularly maintained and updated than mongomapper

i prefer mongomapper for 2.3.x projects but mongoid has seemed much more stable for me in rails 3 projects


arraylist	linkedhashmap	2
after a few test hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap are way slower than arraylist and i wanted to use them just for the ability to create submaps

it gives me arraylist but arraylist has a linkedhashmap which contains some more linked hashmaps containing final values


vim	sublimetext	5
personally i m using sublimetext right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste

second if you only want vim s colors to match sublimetext s you ll probably need to tweak the colorscheme itself or send their author a formal feature request

get aquinted with some good text editor like sublimetext text2 or notepad++ hardcore programmers will recommend vim or emacs - don t listen to them yet

textmate isn t known to perform well on large files but sublimetext supposedly performs better than vim on large files and yet supports legacy textmate syntax parsers

sublimetext or webstorm are far more accessible than vim so it usually happens with their editor rather than mine


cygwin	cmder	2
virtualbox vagrant git for windows cmder even try cygwin but i prefer cmder for its simplicity and some minor stuff

imho cmder is better in windows than cygwin to work with unix commands


urllib	httplib	7
though i personally would choose httplib over urllib

i don t know why this works i can only assume that httplib is slightly better behaved than urllib

the requests library can handle post put delete and all other http methods and is significantly less scary than urllib httplib and their variants

urllib and urllib2 are build upon httplib they are more abstract and powerful but sometimes won t fulfill your specified need about some http related operations

is there a way to do this in an easier fashion with httplib or urllib

requests is one of the cleanest api s i ve ever seen way better than httplib + urllib + urllib2

basically - httplib is lower level while urllib is high-level


apache	lighttpd	25
you can configure apache to act as a reverse proxy to your django application although a number of people seem to prefer using nginx or lighttpd for this scenario

using a different server such as one apache and one nginx or one apache and one lighttpd will be much easier because their configuration files don t conflict with each other

- if you move towards more static content or go the fastcgi way lighttpd is faster than apache

it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup

i have read in a site that another benefit of having lighttpd in front of apache is lower number of child processes

if we use apache or lighttpd we talk php-cgi more

i have recently started using lighttpd instead of apache and found it more usable and fast

just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation

if you aren t using any of the other features of apache consider using something lighter and faster like lighttpd or nginx

they both are able to handle much more current users than apache lighttpd or nginx.

letâ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes

i prefer apache 2.2 however lighttpd can also be deployed if it offers a feature for the implementation

unlike a proper server like lighttpd whose cpu usage is undetectable the crummy via c7 was serving 100 http hits s and lighttpd used less than 1 cpu apache will kill your box

i don t have thorough benchmarks but i m personally convinced that just like lighttpd can outperform apache on simpler tasks mod_wsgi gives apache the laurel when it comes to serving python web apps

theoretically because of a smaller footprint lighttpd should allow more users to visit site at the same time using exactly the same resources as apache would

this is my first experience setting up lighttpd as i thought it would be more suitable than apache in this case

as such i m assuming that about 96 of our users will being using apache and not lighttpd or nginx which are supposedly more suited for long polling

a more recent benchmark on 1 2 4 8 cpu cores - also made by an independent third-party - compares apache 2.2 apache 2.4 nginx lighttpd varnish litespeed cherokee and g-wan

for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache

i know how to use apache but since i was hosting the webserver on a small raspbery pi i felt lighttpd would be just more lighter

long polling that s the way i ll choose using lighttpd under apache to load static files images css js etc.. and just for this type of long-polling

since you ve switched to lighttpd the webserver itself is going to use fewer resources than apache would but apache is rarely the bottleneck unless you ve run out of ram or seriously misconfigured it

that being said it s not like i think event-based programming is all just a ruse seeing as how it seems to have been the primary driver allowing such http servers as lighttpd nginx whatever to overtake apache in highly concurrent performance

the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content

nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections


phpmyadmin	adminer	1
i recommend using adminer as an alternative to phpmyadmin


ethernet	wireless	4
i m using cefsharp how can i choose wireless ethernet 0 ethernet 1 etc network adaptor per a chromiumwebbrowser

depending on your system you can manipulate the interfaces network metrics likely need to deactivate dhcp for that and if you d like to prefer wireless just reduce its metric below that of the ethernet interface

if you are working on physical machine that has cable and wireless connectivity then you will have more than one ethernet adaptor choise

if you have more than one ethernet wireless cards name might change a bit.


exif	jfif	1
this allows older readers to correctly handle the older format jfif segment while newer readers also decode the following exif segment being less strict about requiring it to appear first


xna	slimdx	4
considering the lack of windows 8 love that xna is getting support being dropped apps won t be sellable on the app store -- i d go with slimdx -- it s better than xna anyway -- the only down side is that you can t make xbox apps with it

so bearing that in mind would you choose xna or slimdx

i m working on deciding between managed directx through ms api codepack slimdx library managed wrapper for directx xna managed wrapper++ for directx9 only or unmanaged directx 20 + extra development time

personally i d recommend using slimdx as xna is lacking a number of features that the newer directx versions provide


bazaar	git	32
mercurial is not designed for this purpose and i don t think bazaar or git would be more fun on this

this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster

but distributed version control systems like git mercurial and bazaar are much better suited for your type of environment than subversion

the development phase and development discussion messages of both git and bazaar suggest that in the future git and bazaar will advance quicker than hg

you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce

that being said the message conveyed on python-dev was that all of them git mercurial bazaar are better than subversion for the most part they are fast enough and the choice of mercurial over git bazaar was mostly based on the gut feelings of the bfdl and the attendees of pycon2009

an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested

bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git

i personally prefer git but some people find svn simpler to use and some people like mercuiral bazaar or darcs

note most recently i have been using bazaar and hg with fully powerful regexps so may be looking for stuff more powerful than git provides

bazaar is imho easier to learn than git

i recommend git but there are plenty of vcs ses available svn bazaar cvs...

it works fine and fits all my needs but recently i found that git works better than bazaar so i decided to use it but i face a problem with git usability because most git s gui not user friendly as bazaar explorer so i want your advice based on a practical experience which best git s gui user friendly or which one is most similar to bazaar explorer

mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference

i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git

in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it

subversion git mercurial or bazaar would be better choices

people recommend bazaar hg and git - which are the three i believe have critical mass these days - and which one fits you best is up to you to find out

bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes

distributed version control systems such as mercurial bazaar or git are better suited for such tasks

for many of the cases where subversion trumps perforce many people seem to prefer the distributed systems like git bazaar mercurial these days

bazaar is a distributed version tool just like git but is imo simpler to setup and use

i would not mind changing to for example bazaar or git if needed i am a bit afraid of git to be honest everything i read about git seems 10x more technical than anything i read about mercurial or bazaar and installing it on windows seems to imply installing all sorts of secondary software it seems but that is another matter

i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git

as an alternative to git which has already been mentioned i would highly recommend bazaar

with git and bazaar i have less experience.

as for the first tool to choose problem with git bazaar and mercurial is they are distributed vcs s

a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial

i would recommend using git bazaar or another vcs which doesn t require you to tell it when you move sources around

i choose bazaar over git mercurial coz bazaar is notifications are very well integrated in ubuntu

the main problem with bazaar you will have is almost everybody who uses git or hg will ask you every time why did you choose bazaar when all guys in their company use git or hg

some version control systems bazaar hg git make this easier than others but it s possible on most


gridview	checkboxlist	1
since you re presenting multiple columns a gridview control is a better alternative to checkboxlist


adafruit	ftdi	1
i recommend adafruit s ftdi friend


vbscript	autoit	2
to do so you ll have to use more advanced tools like autoit which would i prefer vbscript or sikuli there are many different script languages for gui automation

as you mentioned in your comments that the main reason for choosing vbscript was that you need a solution without prerequisites i would recommend autoit or autohotkey instead


alarmmanager	wakelock	2
it also uses a wakelock while in my case i think an alarmmanager could be a better idea

this is better than alarmmanager pending intent - no wakelock draining of battery etc.


perforce	svn	16
and if you just want something faster or more scalable than svn then just buy a commercial product - i ve used both perforce and rational clearcase and they scale up to huge projects without any problems

if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce

make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with perforce and svn and while perforce is better svn is free

i would certainly recommend perforce for a number of reasons already covered in other answers but i m not in a position to offer a comparison with svn having never really used it

perforce is soooo much faster than svn because all the check-outs are stored on the server so it doesn t have to check every file on an update

since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues

well i just suggest before you make your choice and pick svn or cvs or perforce or god forbid tfs carefully consider mercurial as well

svn works much better when disconnected from the network - with perforce you have to tell the server when you ve done a checkout

if you have the money ericgorr is right perforce is much nicer to work with then svn

perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too

i agree with the previous yuval - having worked with perforce and svn both in gui and command-line mode i prefer svn

perforce offers more advanced branching and merging capabilities than svn

no personal experience but i havenâ t yet spoken to a dev that has used both perforce and svn who didnâ t prefer perforce

the tortoise- svn git merge tools or that of perforce are way better here

while perforce is great svn git are more than ok free and widely supported

if you want to a little bit further you can imagine use more powerfull scm clearcase perforce ... but maven integration is fewer not well documented and community provide less examples than svn or git


flip	slide	1
it doens t matter which transition i choose slide pop fade flip ...


turbogears	pyramid	1
the difference between pylons and pyramid are the merge of repoze.bfg and turbogears which brings more api resources


qhash	qmap	6
also i have changed the qmap to qhash to make it faster and wirelessapdata is just a struct

qhash is faster but qmap values are sorted by key if you iterate through them

also with this method you could use different container for different dimensions like if you need one dimension to be sorted use qmap which is sorted by key for that and qhash which is more efficient for the dimension which doesn t need sorting

also it looks like you re trying to implement a look up in your class which means perhaps qmap or qhash would be a more appropriate container

using qmap instead of qhash seems more reasonable as neox recommended on his comment

qhash provides faster lookups than qmap


g-wan	lighttpd	2
even lighttpd or nginx with natively pre-compiled c++ is slower than g-wan s c scripts

a more recent benchmark on 1 2 4 8 cpu cores - also made by an independent third-party - compares apache 2.2 apache 2.4 nginx lighttpd varnish litespeed cherokee and g-wan


stdout	fflush	3
what you could do is use a pipe the output to someone else and grab it after stdout already fflush it

occasionally the stdout needs more than a write method fflush is another common one which stringio will handle

i guess that these lines have shorter output so the fflush frequency is lower i used the stdout line to print a deliberate help message


qtableview	qgraphicsscene	1
technically this could also be done by customizing a qtableview widget but qgraphicsscene is more robust for custom graphics and performance


visualvm	yourkit	5
i would recommend getting yourkit visualvm has limited information and use this to profile your application in production if possible

but by all means if you have the budget i d recommend getting yourkit as it provides more sophisticated features and better metrics that visualvm don t have

i prefer yourkit which costs but there s visualvm which is free

i prefer yourkit as i find it easier than visualvm

one option is to use visualvm however a commercial profiler like yourkit may handle larger memory sizes better


keydown	keyup	35
onkeyup is probably the way to go but you raise a good point about it not firing if the element loses focus between keydown and keyup

i picked keystopped because it matches keydown keyup etc

edit keydown is a little better than keyup for the element bind now enter key fails silently-ish

also even without using the shift key when typing quickly i often find i haven t quite released a key before typing the next letter so i get more than one keydown event in a row before the corresponding keyup events - this has no noticeable bad effect in normal circumstances but is noticeable when there s code responding to both the down and up events

they have their differences better stick to one i prefer for this example to use keydown just plays better with me you can use keyup

in my test keyup gives a smoother transition as compared to keydown

keydown and keyup they give you more control by capturing each keystroke but it s lower level than the change event

i finally figured out that keypress has a better compatibility than keydown or keyup on linux platform

then the right events to do it is keyup more than keydown since the value isn t yet in the field at this moment or on change

keyup is more preferable than keydown because keydown may occur multiple times if user keeps it pressed

if you to bind events and use the benefits of a normalized event system you ll use the first version for regular blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error or your custom events

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

keyup is usually a good time to respond to any action that is going to have an effect on a document but keydown would be better if it s a game where the user wants immediate effect

i wrote a plug-in a short while ago that will handle text input much better than keypress keyup and keydown events

the available events are blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

logic to handle enter + mouse click is placed on keydown and mousedown it could be moved to keyup and mouseup if makes more sense

open devtools choose sources tab on the right side expand event listener breakpoints here you choose keyboard and select keyup or keydown

as you can see the keyup events of numpad5 and numpad6 occured earlier than their keydown event

bind works with almost every event you need possible event values blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

also if you notice i ve changed the keyup event to keydown which is better in my opinion cause when the user holds their finger down on a button the code wouldn t be fired if it is on the keyup event

change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu

the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup and error

i don t think that this kind of javascript library exist you could easily build one with jquery just listen to all the event blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

kendo editor provides some events like select keyup keydown but i want more events like click etc

better use keyup event name as in my example because keydown requires one more click for the last symbol to be updated

to do the lookup on every character add you d have to look up the keyup or keydown events i prefer keyup to avoid breaking the browsers back when somebody holds a key down

also note that using keyup or input makes far more sense than keydown otherwise the previous value will only be evaluated on the next event occurrence

the events seem to not follow strict sequential rules second keydown comes earlier than first keyup so the timer gets initialized multiple times

use .val and .keyup using keydown doesn t register the newest value it registers the value before so keyup is better to use for this

also note that keydown is better for this methodology as keyup will fire multiple times though i guess this will too.

its what s used for keyboard input in wpf way more than the keydown and keyup events

i tried changing the event but sagepay overrides all these events blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu

i changed to use the keydown event on the listbox insted of keyup and do no longer have the problem as keydown is in dialogbox and not on listview but keyup occurs on listview

flask	cherrypy	4
i d recommend checking out flask or cherrypy as easy places to start

i would recommend flask or cherrypy for that task

flask is very good but cherrypy may be better suited for beginners

frameworks like flask cherrypy pyramid or even web2py might be the easier ones to start with


webclient	httpwebrequest	23
i d rather use webclient because it requires less code than httpwebrequest httpwebresponse

as far as i understood webclient inherits httpwebrequest providing more simply way to code

does webclient or httpwebrequest take less memory

httpwebrequest and webclient are much more light weight

while webclient may appear to be easier to use than httpwebrequest it is less flexible and will automatically perform it s callback on the ui thread and if you re downloading files in the background you almost certainly don t want this

you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but in order to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and override the protected getwebrequest method

use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s just more robust

also using a separate httpwebrequest or webclient gives you more control over proxies handling redirection authentication etc

so i recommend using webclient or httpwebrequest

if you are using an earlier version of the .net framework you can choose between webclient or httpwebrequest depending on what specifically you want to do

webclient is easier but httpwebrequest is more powerful and allows for more control

httpwebresponse and httpwebrequest are a little bit lower level than webclient

httplistener + webclient or httpwebrequest can provide you more tools for authentication security

also i think the webclient class is more idiomatic these days than hand rolling httpwebrequest

if httpwebrequest response are lower level then webclient what can i accomplish with httpwebrequest response that i cannot accomplish with webclient

so simply httpwebrequest is better option then webclient

would using webclient be more reliable or is it the same as using httpwebrequest -something like below

use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false

if that is the issue you ll probably need to refactor to use the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse classes instead on webclient and configure a more reasonable timeout

using webclient is potentially slightly on the order of a few milliseconds slower than using httpwebrequest directly

because webclient is higher class of httpwebrequest and its slower

webclient has a much simpler interface than httpwebrequest and takes care of reading and writing from the streams for you

i recently just finished a web app using asp.net mvc 4.0 and i ran into some limitations while using webclient instead i opted for httpwebrequest which gave me more options to fine tune my requests


bindparam	bindvalue	1
i prefer work with bindvalue and not mix it with bindparam


fink	homebrew	5
i recommend installing homebrew to manage installing nix tools on os x i d stay away from macports fink

macports or fink may have something similar but i prefer homebrew

i would recommend using macports fink or homebrew to install python 2.7

others prefer fink or the newer homebrew

if you have never installed fink or homebrew or macports i recommend choosing macports because it interferes less with other tools


sctp	tcp	5
if both of sctp and tcp can do why prefer sctp or tcp

so if you want a entire file of 93mb to be reassembled by transferring fragmented packets over the network such that no packets are dropped then tcp sctp is a better choice

as i understand websockets are on top of tcp and have higher latency than sctp that underlies webrtc when for example sending binary data between server and browser that also could be 2 peers in webrtc

how sctp is better then tcp

sctp is not better than tcp in any way but it does something different


printf	strtod	2
if you re really concerned with portability i m not sure that there s any better option than using printf and strtod and assuming that you may not necessarily have any more accuracy than the absolute minimum required by he relevant specification section 5.2.4.2.2 of the c99 spec.

a fairer comparison would be comparing stringstream to the printf sscanf line of functions which would be slower than strtod but still faster than stringstream


istream	ostringstream	1
if further stream will not be used to read values from it it s istream part won t be used ostringstream is more suitable


idictionary	ilist	1
idictionary and ilist are more specialized interfaces that extend icollection


bionic	libc	2
unless you particularly need to build against a more standard libc than bionic you can just use the ndk s toolchain either by copying the hello-jni example and changing build_shared_library to build_executable in the jni android.mk or using the script to generate a stand alone toolchain

bionic the android version of libc is more slightly more limited not by much


msisdn	sms	1
if you want to be more secure you can send the sms s more often however there is a way to understand sim-card change this is for t-mobile and europe use i guess from within the app so that the user cant fool you by enetering sms for a different msisdn and then change to his her real msisdn sim card


tcpreplay	wireshark	1
i use tcpreplay to replay it on an interface but the problem is that the number of attempted packets in tcpreplay is different less with number of packets showing in wireshark


getattr	setattr	1
yes getattr and setattr are much slower at least at the cpu level


appkit	nsapplication	1
the documentation for deactivate method for nsapplication says that i shouldn t call this method directly since appkit knows better how to deactivate stuff

profiling	benchmarking	6
the issue is that the execution time of a benchmarking is much higher about 3 times in case i do not invoke the profiling along with it than the case when the benchmarking is executing with the profiling

minitest has much more than most people know for example minitest spec has bdd matchers akin to rspec minitest mock is a mocking system and minitest benchmarking is for performance profiling

as svick said it s no better way than profiling your program identifying hot spots and optimizing them using concrete benchmarking

using a profiling is often more appropriate than benchmarking but it seems to be even more tricky

to get a more reliable timing of the query you d need to use profiling or some other way of benchmarking that works more directly with the query

ultimately if performance is really important in this part of your program you ll want to try a few different techniques and use a profiling or benchmarking to get a better idea of what works best


groovy	gpath	1
you can read up on groovy collections and gpath to learn more


wma	asf	1
if compatibility supercedes compression i would recommend asf which is basically just a container for wma and wmv


onmousemove	mouseup	1
the active selector handles the mouse click much better than mouseup down you just need a way of reading that state in the onmousemove event


ring	enlive	1
select the right overall web framework - clojure has quite a few already but i d strongly recommend ring - see this excellent video one ring to bind them plus either fleet or enlive or hiccup depending on your templating philosophy


oncreate	setcontentview	6
do the following in your oncreate make suer you have setcontentview on the top which sets your xml containing the splash details

for that reason we choose oncreate for setcontentview and it is the first life cycle method to be called

so for one time initialization code like setcontentview or initializing variables the oncreate event is a better place

my personal preference is to call setcontentview immediately after super.oncreate so that i know the rest of the oncreate method is less likely to break

an activity that uses fragments is often little more than oncreate calling setcontentview

i can make this happen with the minimal project where oncreate does nothing more than call super and setcontentview


sqldf	plyr	1
in the first example sqldf is 3x slower than data.table and in the second its 200x faster than plyr and 100 times faster than data.table


nsurlconnection	nsurlsession	12
while we once would have recommended sendasynchronousrequest effective ios 9 nsurlconnection is formally deprecated and one should favor nsurlsession

specifically nsurl nsurlrequest and either nsurlconnection or nsurlsession nsurlsession is a newer api and is suggested for use by apple

with that said unless there s a really good reason to handle sftp using nsurlconnection or nsurlsession you re probably better off just handling that by using one of those sftp libraries directly rather than trying to plumb them into the url loading system

nsurlsession is newer than nsurlconnection if you are using swift language then you can use your own custom methods by using nsurlsession or you can use alamofire

besides you should prefer nsurlsession over nsurlconnection because with every release more and more methods are deprecated

since nsurlconnection api is deprecated i would recommend nsurlsession

nsurlsession is much more powerful tool than nsurlconnection

i would recommend using nsurlsession instead of nsurlconnection

it s not my experience that nsurlsession is any slower than nsurlconnection is

the block-based methods of nsurlsession are richer than what was provided by nsurlconnection

nsurlsession also provides nicer interfaces for requesting data using blocks in that it allows you to combine them with delegate methods for doing custom authentication handling redirect handling etc. whereas with nsurlconnection if you suddenly realized you needed to do those things you had to refactor your code to not use block-based callbacks

nsurlconnection should work but since it is deprecated i would recommend using nsurlsession instead


box-sizing	margin	2
note that in addition to changing the images widths i also changed the margin to padding and made use of the box-sizing attribute read more about it here

in general to get spacing between containers i prefer margin because later you may need inner padding for something else or run into cross-browser box-sizing issues with padding


haskell	agda	3
another popular language that offers more power than haskell is agda - i don t know agda beyond knowing it is dependently typed on hackage and well respected by people i respect but those are good enough reasons to me

coq is probably the most prominent language of the style but agda has a more haskell-y feel as well as being written in haskell itself

i ve heard people complaining about haskell s type system having holes and that agda and ocaml coq are better


woocommerce	shortcode	1
woocommerce recommends creating a custom variable but i would imagine building a shortcode would be easier to deal with


filesystems	btrfs	1
i now run my lxc containers on a btrfs filesystems to make it simpler to take a snapshot of the running containers


metaphone	soundex	7
looking at my code i also used a hash that was a soundex conversion of each word after stripping stop words etc though my comments note that metaphone would have been better i was using sql server so soundex was built in...

then i tried the metaphone function and it worked far better than soundex

double metaphone - this algo will give you a better match than soundex at the cost of speed it is really good for spelling correction though

in php you should use metaphone it is more accurate than soundex

edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english

general consensus including the php docs is that metaphone is much more accurate than soundex when dealing with the english language

if you implement it yourself you should look into the metaphone or double metaphone algorithms i d recommend them over soundex which is not nearly as good at this type of task to store phoenetic representations of all your words


subplot	imshow	1
any ideas what might be causing this how i could fix it or how i could get around it to use matshow or imshow on a specified subplot the end use case is to have more than 1 subplot in the figure


jquery	bootstrap-switch	1
since bootstrap-switch prevents the checkedchanged event from firing i would recommend using jquery and the switchchange event provided by bootstrap-switch instead like so


nsfilemanager	nsdocument	1
if you do not wish to use it you ll have to drop support for nsdocument and use a lower level abstraction like nsfilemanager + nsfileversion


opentype	woff	2
truetype opentype font that provides better compression than woff 1.0

woff is compressed - smaller download sizes compared with raw truetype or opentype fonts


collabnet	svn	3
personally i prefer collabnet svn

however svn protocol is much faster so i suggest using collabnet svn for performance reasons

i highly recommend collabnet svn use the apache option in the install and tortoisesvn as a nice gui client


openkm	alfresco	1
i think the preview function in openkm is more well than alfresco


propertychangelistener	listeners	1
now this basically boils down to an observer pattern swing implements this kind of functionality in it s listeners changelistener springs to mind as a possible candidest but propertychangelistener is a more powerful option as it generates events based on the property that has changed


vertica	greenplum	2
for high consistency and availability- choose mysql postgresql greenplum vertica neo4j

the storage costs in hadoop are much cheaper than vertica netezza greenplum and the like


moq	moles	3
i recommend moles because it s free efficient and use lambda expressions like moq

moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot

personally i think moles is much better suited for mocking the unmockable and i prefer a combination of moq for my own interfaces and classes and moq for framework and externalities like file i o gui db connections etc


qabstractitemmodel	qabstracttablemodel	1
well obviously you created an implementation qabstracttablemodel which has a little bit more specialized interface than qabstractitemmodel


gtk	xlib	1
you might use a low level x11 library like xcb -or the older xlib - it is used by graphical toolkits like qt or gtk or fox etc.. which are both free software toolkits so you could study their source code and xlib xcb are also free software


mktime	strftime	1
the first match mktime strftime and the sprintf function call are another way the format the date and time


opengl-es	glsurfaceview	1
textureview will display opengl-es rendering but is much more flexible than glsurfaceview and will follow the normal layout hierarchy in android which allows views to be moved on the display


range	min	80
to create equal bins you can simply first define a min and max value which is slightly smaller than both range

and during sometime i have a range where min and max is less than 1 and greater than 0

my solution to the range part feels clunky over complicated and doesn t check if the max range value is bigger than the min range value doesn t check if 10 2

in general you want to have a range slightly larger than x max - x min and then divide the range into the desired number of bins

the code below works perfectly but it takes more than 10 min to loop through all named range

the max value of a range must be greater than or equal to the min

i want to make sure that the user does not enter a zero for the max value and also that the min value is less than the max value not equal to but less than - i need the range of values max - min

maybe you can decompose your ui in datepicker and timepicker and then choose max and min for conforming your time range

workaround is to use a value lower than the min value in range -2065 here or you can also use -1e9 to have a shorter string

if you look how floating point numbers are implemented they can t represent all numbers between their max and min as the number of real numbers in a range is bigger than infinite

the dis min max part sets a range of min and max values this distribution can come up with which means it will never generate a value bigger than max or smaller than min

if min is bigger than max i just return a random character from the entire range

hi all i m trying to find a way to select min or max from a range of data based on these conditions

i want to select min min_serving_time max max_serving_time from a date range group by weekday like this

add on if you have no match try range for min max and avg

firstly i select min date from table 1 that match with table 2 by date range and they should overlap as well

so just calculate how many bits you need range.bitlength may be useful check if randomized value is in specified range so if value is greater than range random again if everything is ok return randomized value increased by min

the whenever clause is required in this case to prevent min values being higher than the max values and to ensure that the range size does not exceed the capacity of an int

then i select min date from table 2 that match with table 1 by date range and they should overlap as well

check the the min value of this range is lower than the ip

it looks like the default calulation of the range slider is min + max - min 2 or min if max is less than min

to do this i suggest to bind to keyup event for range input and store value to internal field i used lastvalue within input itself then bind to change event to compare lastvalue with min max value

the question i have is i would like the calendar to only display the min and max date range for the from date and to date any thing greater than the max and anything less than the min should be greyed out

here is a dynamic solution that works for any range of numbers where min is less than max

to return a random integer equal or greater than min smaller or equal to max with chance probability of the result to equal x and 100-chance probability spread uniformly among all other results in the given range

now it s a simple select with min and max to turn it back into range

i tried to select min and max serial number after that group by datetime but still cant get correct range because each users will have multiple range

however i m getting a attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter. error when i m trying to plot the normalized data

my query is given below so based on the date range first i have to sort down the records after that i have no idea how to find the difference between created_at and updated_at having status success and the time difference is less than 5 min 5 to 15 and so on

i would like to know if there is a way to access the range of said shader properties so that i can set a max and min value to my sliders

2 that the min range is not greater or equal to the max range.

ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

but i also need two highlight line sliders to allow the user to select range of values min and max values on the chart

while using md-slider from angular-material if the range of max and min is less then the slider is looking fine

but continuing i always got attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

a larger range means a greater max value and a smaller min value than decimal

whenever the lower range is set higher than the upper range the upper range automatically changes value and min attribute to match the lower range value

issue here is i need to submit myform but because of min max attribute i get this tip value must be less than or equal to 20 or value must be greater than or equal to 10 for the inputs submitted lesser or greater than the range provided in min and max attributes respectively because of this my form does not get submitted

i m working on slider that updates 2 text boxes with values the slider is in a limited range so it doesn t give values lower higher than min max

here i am inserting values min and max id s in a temporary table from another table so that i can then use those values to retrieve my data in the final query.but in the final query where i am specifying the range i.e the line containing select max from rangee and select min from rangee is giving this error.how can i solve it.the values of min and max are returning fine

with range autofilter and worksheetfunction min methods code gest shorter with neither loops nor variables to be declared

the new randomint takes min and max which defines the range the parameters are exclusive so the range is covered better

i know that in general for a set of range if the max of the mins is less than the min of the maxes than they intersect but the circular nature of degrees makes this a bit more complicated

main problem why i cant adopt those solution is that every of my random values has different range and i need the values to be uniformly distributed withing the range no frequency occurances at min max for example which happens if i cut off the values which are less greater than min max

age can be in the range of 0..100 but i want also to validate crossing values i mean that max is greather than or equal to min

a variation on pentadecagon you are free to set n arbitrary values on the diagonal in some range min..max containing x and fill the rest of the array with lower than min on one side and higher than max on the other

take a look at your picture - all the range you want have ending time greater than min and starting time less than max

also consider that you are looking for the min date and if the partition function has range that include more than 1 date value then even if the optimizer narrowed down the specific partition rather quickly it would still need to scan the entire partition because you don t have an index defined on that date field

in your query if the data range params are same then you can write a single select statement with min and max fields on value

the problem is when i select max range and slide it to min all items somewhere has gone

if max and min are independent variables the extra subtraction for max-min will waste time but if that expression can be precomputed at compile time or if it can be computed once at run-time to test many numbers against the same range the above expression may be computed efficiently even in the case where the value is within range if a large fraction of values will be below the valid range it may be faster to use because it will exit early if value is less than min

if you want a range use select min user_id as min max user_id as max ..

each table has nearly 20 tests it may vary and i need to pick min range value of each row and enter it in result column for the same row

currently i m joining a range of dates that covers the full range of possible dates select min start date max end date

first we need to create two parameter min_date max_date .first parameter1 and give any name and select datatype date and current date give what ever you want.and select range range value min and suppose

figure the max values yourself and use integer range min to max to ensure no bigger than necessary usage

i can select min and max values and cut the range but if the pks are not distributed quite evenly it may give me some range of seriously different sizes

so you can either pick a date range run a select max and select min against your db or execute your query and then add the missing dates

produces the same error attributeerror max must be larger than min in range parameter

figuring out the necessary exponent range is much more straightforward if you can describe the max and min possible absolute values of your input you can easily find suitable corresponding binary minimum and maximum exponent

keysin returns all keys in the range of and min get the lower bound

for ease of debugging i pass the value of to reactive values and print the first date range s value to the console rendered to check whether the it is smaller or bigger than the min and max of the corresponding date column as i did in the lapply function

this only happens when the min range is zero any other time when the min is greater than zero the query works exactly as expected

if range is greater then or less then the min and max then it should throw error

it may look odd but it is common for number-to-string functions in many programming languages to make an exception for the min value in this way because with two s complement representation of integers the max value is 1 less than the absolute of the min value range of -2 147 483 648 to +2 147 483 647 which means the min value is the only negative value you can t flip to positive and then process using the same shared loop code as for the positive values.

to randomize output at resulting array select a number greater than min and less than n to create a random number within a specific range

but if i take it out of range for more than 1 min it gives an exception

if your range were sorted in some manner then you could look at the extreme ends if the end s min is greater than the targetmax then say look at the range 1 4 backwards from the end etc.

now you can see in the product.rb i want to fetch the product based on the price so that in the with_min_range the result will be the products whose variants minimum price range will be greater than the value of min

which works in a similiar way as select min a from range group by b

if you want to check that a number is between the min and max of the range you would likely want to check that it is both higher than the min and lower than the max

i see that you used the revised query with range predicates instead of in predicates and that this query now runs in a mere 39 s compared to 15 min --- either because the range predicates are evaluated more efficiently than the in predicates or because as martin indicated a later run of the query benefits from indexes that where automatically built by monetdb when evaluating the first query or because of both

any value in the disjointed range that is less than the value in d1 has 1e+99 added to it and that won t be the min of anything

but the random number is always lower than the min number isn t inside the range i don t know why.

then you can compare min and max to see if the given numeric type covers the range of another numeric type

select min abs variable - current.variable over order by criterion range unbounded preceding

so if the range is sufficiently large other methods can definitely beat min by requiring less function calls

override min range to allow more zooming jsfiddle

grid min value should be either 0 or a nice value lower than the min value of the data in range

range is 5000 to 50000 what i want to achive is in maxpoint select box i want to display the values which are greater than min points selected value


rtp	rtsp	7
the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast rtcp generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via rtp multicast only sender reports are generated

http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as their network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads

the chance of receiving video streams over http is higher than rtsp rtp rtmp and so on

rtsp is more of a handshake done with the server while rtp is the actual stream coming in once the handshake is done and you start streaming

when i tried to open this url rtsp 10.3.207.52 mediainput h264 stream_2 on my windows vlc player i had to go to tools preferences input codecs and select rtp over rtsp tcp in order to be able to play the video stream

i think you re confusing rtp over http with rtsp over http and therefore rtp too see for more info

my question is is there such parameter in vlc object for the web to select rtp over rtsp

create the text field and register the documentlistener to it...although i d be wary about using a documentlistener personally maybe a actionlistener and or focuslistener might be more suitable but hay


.when	each	4
i have gridview with template field of dropdownlist in each row..all dropdownlists are set to default value select .when i select any value from dropdownlist it will change color of 3rd row below than it but when i re-select select option the color is still there of 3rd row.i don t need it.it should be changed to default color of gridview that is white

so i then came up with using .when but what i am struggling with is on the above function i can grab each urls data as json with this with there is no easy way to do this when i do console.log data

i am using an user defaults which contains array of dates .in this array i am storing all the dates selected from the date picker.i now want to compare each of these dates with the current date .when the date matches with the current date the notification should be shown .i have done the code for traversing array but it is not working it does not match the date with the current date.and does not display the notification at the proper time

this results in a lot of states â one skip me state for each match of w by the plus except the first since plus requires one match .when then checked


qtreewidget	qtreeview	3
and one more suggestion instead of using qtreewidget i think qtreeview is a better choice if you can explain the issue a bit more maybe i can provide some sample code

if your exchange data between 2 widget i suggest to use qtreewidget more than qtreeview because data in qtreewidget can edit dynamic data row and value

or isn t qtreewidget purposed for this use and a qtreeview would serve better


strtol	strcmp	2
once you ve done that you can use strcmp to see if the string is equal to stop and if not then call atoi or better yet strtol which has better error checking to get the numerical value

onâ running the application in single step mode also into the standard library functions strcmp and strtol it is even clearer that the processor has to do many more instructions to run an integer comparison in batch file than a string comparison

floor	sqrt	7
this can be naively implemented by checking if it is divisible by all integers less than floor sqrt n in a loop

reason n + floor sqrt n is greater than n

the other suggestion keep repeating until x stops changing does not work either because for non-perfect squares x will alternate between the floor and the ceiling of the root â because of integer mathematics the term n x will alternate when x is slightly smaller or slightly larger than sqrt n

that ends up double counting the points with both x and y less than sqrt n so we subtract the square of floor sqrt n to compensate

you re missing some dividers if a b c and b is a divider of a then c will also be a divider of a but c might be greater than floor sqrt a for example 3 floor sqrt 6 but divides 6

edit as suggested by gregor the r code can be better written as sum floor sqrt x 10

assuming as you propose that out may reference either lhs or rhs and that a and b have cells of uniform bit-length in order to technically be able to perform the multiplication in place elements of a and b as signed integers generally cannot be greater or smaller than â floor sqrt 2 cellbitlength - 1 4


charts	pie-chart	2
if h is larger than your pie-chart radius you are placing the label outside the charts you should consider a constant r for that with a nice looking line

if you want to do a split slice operation on a pie charts first you need to create a pie charts with slices.here from what i understand you tried to give the option split charts first which actually is to make differrent pie charts in the same row or column which needs more than one pie-chart

but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take

for unit tests single bean tests not run within container i d recommend junit and easymock mockito

uiview	subviews	25
though earlier uiview and uiscrollview have the same area after keyboard shown the blue uiview becomes smaller but its subviews button text fields is outside its area

the issue is that once the alpha of the uiview is less than 1.0 i can see all the subviews sides and the one that gets me the most is the outline of an uiimageview can be seen that would otherwise not as it is the same colour as the uiview

of course uiscrollview can have more than one content view just as any uiview can have more than one subviews and this case it will be more difficult to render its layer

when using embed in - uiview the new view will be a bit bigger than the subviews

they re much bigger than the uiview of which they are subviews

you could put a smaller uiview as subviews of your selectionview and change tha background color of that view

if you take a look at the associated guides you ll see core animation and layers does require hit testing though that s relatively easy but it s far cleaner than the uiview doing all the drawing and more efficient than many subviews

the uiview is taller than the screen so in ib i pulled it out of the scroll view so i could see it all but i never moved it back to being a subviews of the scroll view

your scrollview height is less than the uiview which is the subviews in your case of scrollview and for scrolling it fully you will have to set your scrollview contentsize height more than the height of the view you are scrolling in it please give a check on this point

add smaller webview as a subviews to the uiview

i have a label with a single character that i wish to be bigger than the uiview that it s a subviews of

do i just create a new uiview that is 4px larger than the selected object and and make the selected view a subviews of it

i m sure you could do something with auto-layout but when you have a view that has subviews that need to be positioned within it subclassing uiview is a better way to go in my opinion

because the uiview is smaller it is going to crop out the larger subviews

i have 2 more uiview as subviews in scrollcontainer view

i have an issue i m creating a uiview that is returned from a method and that part is fine but what i ve noticed is that when i add sublayers to one of the subviews those layers overlap subviews that are higher up in the hierarchy textview and imageview the sublayers added to testviewcopy are appearing over top of these subviews and they aren t supposed to

for my circular viewgroup i just want to put each basic view uibutton uiimageview ... around center of my circular viewgroup i read the apple doc about uiview and uicollectionview and both can contains zero or more subviews and i don t know what i should use uiview seems less difficult than uicollectionview but uicollectionview seems more appropriate for what i want to do maybe i am wrong but how implement customcollectionlayout and how set this layout in customuicollectionview because i planed to add in future custom drawing and animation

i want to add a uiview of smaller frame as subviews to parental view but i am not getting the needed

change the contentsize of your scrollview.your uiview size and uiscrollview size is same if the uiscrollview contentsize is more than its subviews size then scroll will happen change the line overviewscroll setcontentsize cgsizemake screenframe.size.width screenframe.size.height-25

the subviews version is definitely faster since having the controls loose on the uiview took more like 2 seconds to update

i have a uiview class hierarchy that has self.layer.shouldrasterize turned on in order to improve scrolling performance all of them have static subviews that are larger than the screen of the device

i have a smaller uiview as a subviews to the main uiview on my uiviewcontroller

now select uiview subviews of uiscrollview say contentview control click contentview to main view default controller s view and select leading trailing top bottom constraint

you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because subviews do in fact consume quite a bit of memory uiview are very expensive compared to their underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the subviews is usually released afterwards

if you want to achieve locked screen effect i would recommend adding uiview as subviews of your uiviewcontroller that will take whole screen

typedef	struct	21
i usually typedef my struct to make it more readable

looking at what they have the struct holds and int and it holds an array that should be populated with the f_string typedef they defined earlier

having typedef s internal to the struct gives me better encapsulation since i only need to pass a single template parameter the dataset class rather than individually specifying the dataset plus t r .

personally i prefer automated typedef ing to the possibility of having a global scope coexist with a struct tag of the same name and so i do

you already typedef the pcb_q no need to use struct keyword any more

following the linux kernel coding gudelines i don t fancy typedef because they tend to make the data definitions opaque if something is declared elsewhere as the typedefined type understanding that is a struct is somewhat more complicated

also typedef struct is more c than c++

the above regex matches typedef struct that is not followed by another typedef struct ..this is done so that multiple struct are not captured

this is a good example of a time to know the basics - i think understanding the ins and outs of struct is more helpful than typedef since you can do so much more with it

i changed the bitmap header file a little to typedef the struct and make life easier at least for me

c++ allows you to define struct without the struct keyword so the typedef is used less often

the list is composed of link struct to be more precise it appears the link type is typedef d to be a pointer to the actual node struct

for instance here is a regex which will match typedef of struct which point to a single name and may or may not have a pointer

many people who use the symbol defined by the typedef feel it more natural because often they come from other languages c++ c# ... where there s no need for the struct thing

one camp most notably the linux kernel people thinks that struct a is clearer than the typedef

if you re using typedef you no longer need to write struct all over the place by useing typedef code is more cleaner since it provides a smidgen more abstraction

also i think typedef is a better choice when you want to define a struct

you can verify with a simple objdump symbols objfile.obj that the length of decorated symbols by using typedef s is incredibly longer than their similar counterparts split into struct s microsoft compilers have historically used a proprietary name mangling scheme

struct foo is easier to parse then typedef d foo as the name-lookup is simpler

when programming for ios should i prefer using struct and typedef where the object has no behavior methods basically

i d recommend using typedef with your struct to simplify calling them


fiddler	charles	7
charles has a much better ui than fiddler

this low level network capturing is not something i am normally akin to i m normally higher up with fiddler or charles but considering this isn t via http i need to go lower down the stack

i prefer charles but others like fiddler work fine too

if you use a transparent echoing proxy this can show you all http traffic charles and fiddler are two good example i recommend charles

i prefer charles but any web debugging proxy fiddler included should help out

i would recommend using a web debug proxy to work out exactly what is going across the pipes i personally prefer charles but something like fiddler should work too

i recommend downloading fiddler or charles and using that to determine what the server response was

128bit	64bit	18
perhaps 128bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit

so it looks like the simd implementations give a 2x or more improvement over 64bit scalar code although 256 bit simd doesn t seem to give any improvement over 128bit simd and that typical throughput should be a lot faster than 5 gb s

gcc supports built-in __int128_t and __uint128_t types on 64bit platforms but it looks like formatting support for 128bit integers is less common in libc

so a 128bit adder will be slower than a 64bit add

pkcs#5 padding technically is not defined for block sizes larger than 64bit aes uses 128bit blocks

if you re using gcc and the version you have supports 128bit numbers try using __uint128_t than performing the 128 multiply and extracting the upper 64bit is likely to be the most efficient way of getting the result

to be able to calculate very big numbers bigger than 64bit 128bit

actually on intel sandybridge-family at least mul imul 64bit 64bit 128bit is faster than imul mul 32bit 32bit 64bit

in a benchmark test the 128bit intrinsic function performs faster than the 64bit intrinsic

the emulated 128bit integers are slower than the hardware 64bit integers. specific changes

some wider instructions like sse2 128bit wide or double float 64bit wide are faster or sometimes will not work for alignment of native width if you need to load 128bit data you should align it in 128bit

i wrote this brute-force converter but your values don t seem to exactly match up with .net type precision - double 64bit is too low precision and decimal 128bit is more

128bit transactions tend to be faster than 64bit which tend to be faster than 32 bit

excel cannot process data more than 64bit big it will store it in powers of 10 but in our application i want 128bit data for that i have formatted particular cell to be text format in excel sheet so that i can enter very big number

so make sure you code has a working set of less than 16 128bit vectors or 32 64bit vectory at any time

i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem

and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit

in a few more years there might be an architecture where 128bit math is faster than 64bit but i don t think any exists today

i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10

note atof and similar functions don t detect overflows and return zero on error so there s no way to know if it failed not sure if it sets errno see also keith s comments about undefined behaviour for certain values so the point is you should use strtol for converting from strings to int and strtod for converting to double those have much better error handling


pypdf	pdfminer	1
much better than pdfminer and pypdf in terms of text extraction


pyquery	lxml	2
i am using and would recommend lxml and pyquery for parsing html

pyquery is based on lxml so it s also much faster than beautifulsoup


mockito	jmock	4
i suggest that you to move jmock which has a better api or even to mockito whose protocol is even simpler

for the record jmock as of today supports more complex scenarios than mockito that s why the initial learning curve is steeper

much as i used to love jmock i have to agree with the comments that mockito is far friendlier to use

for mock i would prefer mockito to jmock or easymock


piston	tastypie	7
tastypie is more tightly coupled to the orm than piston but there are methods that you can define in a tastypie resource to specify how to handle create read update delete

- similar to piston but i ve had better luck with tastypie

also tastypie is amazing and i highly recommend it over piston after using both

though piston wasn t updated for a long time now so i d recommend tastypie which is actively maintained.

additionally as you might guess creating an api from models is a common task i m assuming that your api maps to models as that s the common case and you haven t specified you may want to not reinvent the wheel and instead use piston or tastypie to make this easier on you

i recommend to take a look on tastypie which turned out to work even nicer than piston it helps you also with things like versioning your api and mamange multiple endpoints nicly

edit i found out that piston was proposing query throttling but everywhere people say that tastypie is better than piston


gridview	sqldatasource	1
particularly with the dev stack i am using its seems the less controls formview gridview sqldatasource i use he less problems i run into


domparser	saxparser	1
i have no doubts in domparser and people prefer saxparser than domparser because of the memory it takes


kmz	gpx	1
kmz loads much quicker than gpx and can be integrated with the google maps api as a kml layer


clistctrl	ccombobox	1
possibly faster than ccombobox with drawitem would be an owner data clistctrl


cvsnt	tortoisecvs	2
since you re on windows i recommend installing tortoisecvs and then configuring the included cvsnt server as follows

firstly i d recommend using tortoisecvs as it has better cvsnt support


ocaml	agda	1
i ve heard people complaining about haskell s type system having holes and that agda and ocaml coq are better


melt	reshape	2
in response to your comment i believe cast and melt from the reshape package are much simpler for your purpose

here it is with reshape in base though joran is right melt is likely easier


qtablewidget	qframe	1
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent


crypto++	libtomcrypt	1
i can recommend crypto++ or libtomcrypt for that


openrowset	openquery	2
i prefer openquery over openrowset given that openquery does not require the connection-string definition within the proc

has anyone ever had the chance to check execution time to compare openrowset openquery opendatasource for a very large file import in sql server 2008


free	alloca	1
dr deallocate memory with the correct corresponding function c s malloc with c s free and prefer alloca -style functions or foreignptr if that s not possible


chart.js	morris.js	1
after some investigation to try and get morris.js to do the animation this was found to be extremely difficult so i opted to go for making chart.js appear more like morris.js


jruby	mri	29
sometimes mri is faster but with the right parameters and warmup jruby was 3 to 3.5 times as fast on my system for this particular

mri has a gil so why is it faster than jruby in handling requests

this really surprised me because i expected mri to be slower than jruby

i know that rails jruby handles concurrency better than mri but i don t know how to do it

mri was faster than jruby

i ve noticed however that jruby is more sensitive to memory leaks than mri

there are other good reasons to choose jruby over mri in any case -- much better threading for one

lastly if you are frequently finding yourself running long running process i advice you to try jruby which is works much better with long running processes due to jvm lot faster than mri

if you are set on using ruby you might want to compare mri to jruby from my experience with the latter and profilers like jvisualvm i wouldn t be surprised if jruby fared better

with these options jruby on rails gives about the same or better performance than mri

once the jvm has warmed up rails requests under jruby are usually significantly more performant than under mri both in terms of raw execution speed and garbage collection

works on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock

i m fuzzy on a lot of the finer details between jruby and mri ruby but here s what i know based off of what i ve learned using jruby

works on some rubies better than others jruby is recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock

mri is faster than jruby

jruby is faster than 1.9 mri matz ruby interpreter the standard in certain areas

so it seems like the opposite - mri 2.3 gets 2-5x slower than jruby 9.1

and it sounds strange but jruby scales very well and it s faster than mri with java 7

with mri i d use forking with jruby there s more of a case to be made for threading

does this mean that the old adagio about jruby being faster than mri ruby is gone

the jruby runtime alone is already pretty heavy much heavier than mri

jvm hosted languages are generally going to be faster than traditional mri ruby and both java and scala are generally faster than jruby when it comes to raw cpu capabilities

for example jruby is faster than mri jruby 1.7 is faster than jruby 1.6 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot is faster than jruby 1.7 running on j9 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 is faster than jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.6 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 with the c2 compiler is faster than jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 with the c1 compiler and so on

for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri

in fact on windows jruby passes more rubyspec tests than ruby meaning mri or yarv itself

in practice this means that deploying a rails app to jruby is a good idea as is running your integration tests but for developer unit tests and scripts mri yarv or rubinius are better choices

the last together with the loading of the jvm makes mri better for short ad hoc scripts jruby better for process hungry longer running processes with methods repeated often so jruby would be better for running servers and services

alter your command path so that jruby s version of the ruby command has a higher priority than the mri one

same passenger + mri 2.3.0 is 3 times faster than puma + jruby on same rack app


gridview	datalist	6
if you want to bind data to gridview datalist datalist controls then better option you should use datatable dataset or you can use list ex list

however there is a grid here that compares listview gridview datalist and the repeater you may find helpful

i am trying to bind it with a gridview or a datalist whatever is more appropriate without success

gridview has much more bells and whistles than datalist

gridview and datalist are better then the older versions

from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option


changeset	cherry-pick	2
while others have rightfully pointed you to git cherry-pick you should understand that the changeset might have broader meaning that you might originally maintain

this will work for hotfixes and it is simpler than cherry-pick your development changeset from your default branch


wildfly	jboss	13
if you don t have any specific container to run your application you can choose between jboss 7 and wildfly and wants to run spring java config try it out on wildfly

everything is set as default for sure the server is up and listening to port 9990 trying to compare both wildfly and jboss eap standalone.xml but they aren t exactly the same wildfly is more evoluated compared to jboss eap which is more stable

jboss 6.4 had no problems with that but yes wildfly is more strict looks like

also note that for example glassfish and jboss wildfly are more than just a servletcontainer they also supports jsf ejb jpa and all other java ee fanciness

jboss eap which is based on wildfly deliberately has a slower release schedule

2 integration would be easier with jboss eap support from eap 5 or wildfly however if you don t need any java ee technologies i would go with more lightweight server like tomcat or jetty

is it because request response handling on wildfly is kind of more lightweight than the jboss 4.2.3

i m going to start a very important project and i have to choose between jboss 7 and wildfly 8 for this project i m going to use gwt jpa hibernate and jbpm 6

i am trying to deploy a war file on centos 7 from jenkins to wildfly 8.2.0 final using version 1.11-snapshot i built it from the fork of the deploy plugin version 1.10 does not have support for wildfly and has issues if you select jboss 7.x

normally wildfly and jboss use 8080 by default and looks like you have an application listen in this port also wildfly use few more ports for other protocols and management that the app server needs

that no longer works with jboss wildfly

under folder jboss community select wildfly finish

these days you d better grab wildfly oracle jboss minded and already java ee 7 ready or tomee apache minded but not java ee 7 ready yet as alternative to open source edition of glassfish


lz77	lzw	1
if so what is the nature of the output of lz77 that makes it more suitable for huffman compression than lzw or some other method entirely


free	strncpy	1
in addition to the previous answers the strncpy char pointer which seems unsafe for my opinion and the malloc which is safer but you need to remember to free it outside of the function and its inconsistent with the hierarchy of the program you can do the following


boost	cereal	1
if you don t need to serialize raw pointers to things and instead either use c++11 style smart pointers or no pointers at all i d recommend using cereal as it supports pretty much everything in the standard library whereas boost has a more limited subset


matlab	s-function	1
my c s-function is faster than my embedded matlab function block in matlab environment but when i use it in rt-lab the embedded is faster


ant	pom.xml	5
but even when your project s pom.xml files become more substantial they hold an entirely different kind of information from the build file of a similarly sized project using ant

it will depend on the complexity of your builds if you have basic java builds then maven might be more suited as the pom.xml files maven build filds are pretty simple but if you need to do a lot of custom specific stuff you may well end up having ant scripts to perform also if you already have one system in place there isnt necessarily a huge advantage of swapping

if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files

it has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but it does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven

you already know the answer to the very oriented body of your question there is no ant equivalent to this minimal pom.xml because unlike maven ant does not define a set of standards patterns conventions in other words a lingua franca or shared language for project management that would make it possible so ant can t beat maven on this sample


rolify	cancancan	1
i d recommend using devise + cancancan + rolify to authenticate your users and assign permissions based on their individual roles i.e admins can create delete edit or users can only view


gprof	shark	2
regardless i d strongly recommend using shark instead of gprof - it s very easy to use and superior in pretty much every way to gprof - and doesn t require you to recompile your program

personally i prefer shark for mac os x and gprof for linux


h.264	hevc	3
at the qualities i m recording 720p or 1080p the file size of an hevc-encoded video should be 40-60 of an identical h.264-encoded video and i am seeing this when i use the default camera app on ios but when i use avassetwriter as above or in the project linked above i m seeing file sizes be about three times larger with hevc than with h.264

edit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for now

4- for comparison purposes between h.265 hevc and h.264 avc intra-prediction the total sae of a reconstructed picture by hevc should be less than avc


ftp	telnet	7
telnet and sftp in favor of ftp or consider wrapping less secure

telnet is more general than ftp and is generally used for command and control

it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each

ftp protocol is more complex than http or telnet form example

http is not the internet any more than ftp telnet or world of warcraft are the internet

yes i know ftp is better than telnet but right now i m stuck with telnet

mpmath	sympy	1
i know sympy has its own plotting module but the one in mpmath seems easier to use so far with the exception of this one issue of course


androidviewclient	hierarchyviewer	1
androidviewclient while not faster because it relies on the same protocol as hierarchyviewer may provide a simpler alternative to write tests


namenode	hdfs	4
it s almost always suggested that each file in hdfs be much larger than the block size to increase the likelihood of a process reading a full block and to reduce namenode memory contention

it s a more involved process with namenode assuring that at least dfs.replication.min copies are written to hdfs

hdfs high availabilty is only available when you have more than one namenode configured

since the namenode is a single-point-of-failure in hdfs it requires a more reliable hardware setup


gtk	drawingarea	1
so if the gtk scrolledwindow is smaller than the gtk drawingarea inside it the scrolled window should change to scrollable - but the problem is that it does not work


mybb	ipb	2
the ipb which has less queries runs slower than mybb with more queries

the ipb one has less queries used only 14 on average but it runs slower than mybb with more queries used average on 20


keystore	jks	8
i believe the storage formats were either jks the standard java keystore jceks a java keystore that provides much stronger protection of private keys or pkcs12

bonus question can a single keystore jks file have more than 1 cert inside of it

in this default implementation the jks format is better suited for a single keystore that is to handle both trusted entries and key entries in the same container

that s why it might be better to create a separate truststore keystore jks might be easier for the ca certificates

java has build-in support for work with pkcs#12 keystore work with this containers doesn t much differ than standart jks keystore

command summary - to compare jks keystore to pem file

instead you can support more than the jks and try the default keystore type and if it fails try the #pkcs12

start kse and select create a new keystore choose jks


g-wan	cherokee	1
a more recent benchmark on 1 2 4 8 cpu cores - also made by an independent third-party - compares apache 2.2 apache 2.4 nginx lighttpd varnish litespeed cherokee and g-wan


notepad++	gedit	1
i vastly prefer gedit + gnometerminal + nautilus filezilla to the sluggish cygwin + console2 + notepad++ setup i have in windows7


textmate	gedit	1
i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - gedit is lightweight and i actually enjoy using it more than textmate on os x


fink	macports	14
i personally prefer macports although i think most folks prefer fink

on top of that fink gives you access to more packages than macports

i recommend installing homebrew to manage installing nix tools on os x i d stay away from macports fink

because fink is reputedly more stable than macports and has many more packages

installing from source is somewhat more time-consuming than using macports and fink but enables you to have a working environment that is optimized for your system

macports or fink may have something similar but i prefer homebrew

i would recommend using macports fink or homebrew to install python 2.7

if you have never installed fink or homebrew or macports i recommend choosing macports because it interferes less with other tools

he also recommends to install a newer version of bash through macports or fink and register the newer version as the default shell

i would recommend using macports or fink as a package system

fink has more packages than macports

since i have seen many reports of the macports package manager being less reliable than the fink package manager i would suggest installing fink and then simply doing

i second macports it is more up to date than fink and closer to the freebsd ports system where i come from

i myself did not use brew before but this page says it is less intrusive than fink and macports so you may give it a try


cobertura	checkstyle	1
if you are interested in improving your coding standards and build systems then i highly recommend using ant junit cobertura checkstyle and findbugs together with a continuous integration server hudson or cruisecontrol and a version control system git


xstream	jdom	1
i already create the xml for some beans inside the larger bean with xstream and append them as elements to the jdom


vtk	paraview	2
i would recommend using vtk files see www.vtk.org vtk img file-formats.pdf which are read by both paraview and visit paraview is built on the vtk graphics library

to see some of what vtk can do i recommend checking out paraview


coalesce	nullif	3
select coalesce convert decimal 12 2 nullif replace lineas.param1 0.00 coalesce convert decimal 12 2 nullif replace lineas.param2 0.00 as multiparam

next value for function cannot be used within case choose coalesce iif isnull and nullif

since my solution with nullif had performance problems and your use of coalesce was much faster i wonder if you could try tweaking that solution to deal with the issue of -1


nsdateformatter	nscalendar	1
don t use nsdateformatter use nscalendar which is much more accurate

cpu	hyperthreading	8
vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s

i tried using schedule static num_threads 4 and noticed that my programme always completes in 11.5s to 11.7s always below 12s at about 320 cpu runs more consistently and uses less resources even if the best run is half a second slower than the rare outlier with hyperthreading

non-hyper-threading cores each correspond to 1 cpu whereas hyperthreading cores contain more than 1 typically 2 - logical - cpu

now - your i7 cpu have 4 cores + hyperthreading which results in more threads spawned for processing thus you can get more exceptions because for example 4 things can be processed at the same time when exception occurs

the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

hyperthreading and multi threading in general allows a cpu to execute more than one statement per cycle

almost any new cpu has more than one core or if it has just one it might support hyperthreading and thus pretending it has more than one


cas	shibboleth	2
i couldn t really find any reason why i should choose saml over shibboleth or cas since these two sso solutions not only support saml but also many more functions that i otherwise have to implement

conceptually it seems like a type of central authentication system cas but is more similar to shibboleth also a federated identity management system


hindi	turkish	1
i recommend hindi japanese and turkish â for the largest chance of revealing bugs


jquery	icheck	1
i ve been trying to apply icheck plugins to my radio and checkbox and i just cannot figure out why my radio button keep selecting more than a single option with no experience in jquery i think i might need help with this


button	right-align	2
a right-align fixed width button looks better imho

instead of figuring out the individual positions for each image button it is easier to simply right-align them by modifying the anchorpoint to 1.0f 0.5f and then position the images button at exactly the screen width and variable screen height position screen width 100


launch4j	jsmooth	3
launch4j - no new development in over a year supports 64 bit but you can t sign the exe created by launch4j so i prefer jsmooth but it does not support 64 bit

if you want a no fuss way for the end user to kick off a program with multiple jar dependencies you may want to look at launch4j or jsmooth i prefer launch4j

someone already mentioned launch4j however i found jsmooth to be alittle better


ng-show	ng-hide	10
so use ng-if more than ng-show and ng-hide or else the user can just change the visibility option using developer tools

using ng-hide and ng-show is better then doing it manually maybe something like this for the directive template

what is the reason that we should favor ng-show over ng-hide or vice versa

as for as performance is concerned i think it does not make any huge difference but since ng-if removes all event handlers attached to this element and its children and also the dom element so i think ng-show or ng-hide will be faster

they have a good edit in-line model and it seems to have better ux than the ng-hide ng-show options

i m not sure i understand your problem entirely but if you want to work with directives on those elements i would recommend using ng-show and ng-hide instead of ng-if as the latter can really screw with any event handlers you apply via directives

i did have some issues with the angularjs post get and not being able to update the scope.user value from the success function result of the post get and ng-hide ng-show being more involved for basic use than a simple #verifymebutton .hide

please don t change code like using ng-hide instead of ng-show and add more extra div

little bit cleaner than ng-hide ng-show which sets display none to the extra header every time

i recommend using ng-show ng-hide because the ng-if directive creates a child scope which will fight with the ng-model directive which expects no scope on that element


realloc	calloc	5
if you want to instrument libc s malloc calloc realloc things are even simpler - just wrap them in your allocator functions

you probably only need one call to calloc when you pass it that big numbers whereas realloc can accept smaller increments

in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

the various alternatives calloc realloc work roughly the same way calloc is easier to use when dealing with arrays and zero-fills the data while realloc is useful when you need to resize a block of memory

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc


django-haystack	sphinx	1
the only reason i see to choose sphinx search in detriment of django-haystack using django-sphinxql is if you specifically have a use case where sphinx is clearly superior to any django-haystack backend


activemq	rabbitmq	8
it seems activemq is better than rabbitmq in the sense that it is easy to set up and maintenance for cluster

i use activemq in prod and fine with it but for very highroad rabbitmq will be better

what does rabbitmq do better or worse than activemq

lot s of free stuff available look for anything implementing amqp for example and not limited to apache s attempt - activemq zeromq as listed above rabbitmq which is more complete than zero and even red hat are in the game with red hat messaging

if standalone what messaging framework should i choose activemq rabbitmq or something else

comparing jms amqp concepts to compare activemq and rabbitmq is not the most important activemq speaks amqp and there is jms client for rabbitmq in the commercial edition was called vfabric rabbitmq

apache activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine

our team is in a spike sprint to choose between activemq or rabbitmq


istream	getline	2
note the use of std getline is safer and more convenient than std istream getline

one thing to note is that std istream getline is more secure than std getline so should be preferred in some situations


grass	proj	1
you might benefit from combining each proj into a single war but i do think this is really one of those the grass is always greener problems


ienumerator	idisposable	2
due to ienumerator not implementing idisposable more manual ways of doing it end up being a bit fiddly.

most likely for the same reason that implements idisposable but ienumerator does not--the earlier version was written before the authors thought of circumstances where one an a implementation might need cleanup but a factory returning such an implementation might not know about such need


fftw	gsl	4
you can have a look at this speed performance benchmark from fftw which suggests that gsl is about 3-4 times slower than fftw 3

on the accuracy front this accuracy benchmark from fftw suggests that they have similar accuracy for most case with fftw being slightly more accurate but that gsl tend to exhibit accuracy degradation for real data and larger transform sizes

so according to gsl developers own admission fftw is expected to outperform gsl

gsl can do fft s but fftw is better at doing that


gsap	greensock	2
for your dynamic purpose if you really really really need to support ie8 i d recommend gsap this is famous greensock s library port from actionscript 3 to js

i highly recommend using greensock gsap v12 for animated effects


wercker	environments	1
i made a docker image to use it with my builds of a project in wercker i did this because i thought having the require packages already installed in the environments is better than installing them in each build of my project


lua	scheme	1
lines may blurry because you can load binary modules in python and you can embed a dynamic interpreter in c python being a little big for this i prefer lua or scheme


translation	transliteration	3
for removal and transliteration there is a better tool called tr translation or delete characters

the issue here is that an automatic translation from sql to linq will often have to perform more transliteration than translation - generating examples of how not to write linq queries

i want the user to be able to tap a spinner and have a choice to select between transliteration and translation


macvim	sublimetext	2
macvim sublimetext is much thicker whereas textmate is slicker and sophisticated

first gvim macvim will be mandatory if you want your colors to match sublimetext s as terminal emulators are usually limited to 256 colors


disk	ram	197
you might want to investigate more than creating ram disk

i understand that ram is typically thousands of times faster than disk but i o speed is not the only code running

obviously reading a block from cache is much more efficient than reading it off the disk since ram is much faster than disk

when i test the app with 2gb of allocated memory instead of 12gb i saw that the performance of the cpu when using ram is better than when using ram disk when i just write data into my db 15 vs 17 cpu usage

this is relatively slow since reading from the hard disk is slower than reading from ram

disk drives and ram are getting cheaper much faster than your time is

but if your shared file system is a raid 5 or 6 array exported to the nodes via nfs over gige ethernet that will be slower than ram to ram transfer via gige using rpc or mpi because you have to write and read the disk over gige anyway

when you re inside the machine ram always beats disk i o whether read or write

the other ram disk questions like ramdisk slower than disk

if the working set is smaller than your ram it should not be disk bound

when disk get faster then so does ram and processors and the demand on devices

there are tonnes of posts blogs on this so just google mongodb working set but as you know access from ram rather paging to disk is quicker

only one disk read - since the disk is much slower then ram -

disk io - even ssd - is many orders of magnitude slower than the ram that the hashing is going though

just wanted to weigh in my two cents what serialworm and thephpdeveloper said share the fact that memory ram is much faster than any disk io bound operation you come up with

or if there is too much intermediate output to be shuffled your job will become slow as you will need disk based shuffle in such a case which will be slower than ram based shuffle

this is well within disk space but far larger than ram

buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk

i ve copied a file over to a ram disk but i get an error message that doesn t make sense as the path is actually shorter than on the physical disk and is certainly less than 260 characters

disk access is much slower than ram

disk io will be slower than ram

however be aware of this to cache pixels to disk is several orders of magnitude slower than using ram

the initial read has to access the disk which is a lot slower than accessing ram

so while the writes my be sequential on disk for datasets larger than ram these random reads will quickly become the bottle neck

a system with a lot of ram will have advantages when switching between different instances of visual studio because their state won t need to be written away to slower than ram disk be it ssd or not

just because you have data that is larger than your ram amount doesn t mean the node should go down it just means that not all documents will be available in ram and the node will sometimes have to fetch from disk slower

the os heap uses the cpu s virtual memory hardware and is free from fragmentation issues and can even effectively use the disk s swap space allowing you to allocate more memory than available ram

the ssd is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude but it s quite reasonable to have a 50gb hash table on disk but not in ram unless you pay big money for big iron

and the whole purpose of maglev is to have a ruby implementation which can deal with heaps that are orders of magnitude larger than ram by storing them in a distributed cluster on disk

modern operating systems usually get in the way especially if the file is larger than ram you will end up swapping code since the system will treat your already stored on disk data as swappable

i m not sure if or how some other limits are imposed if available disk space or available ram are less than the software limits

also keep in mind that once ram is exhausted your program will start running in virtual memory on disk which will probably cause far more disk i o activity than the program itself so if you re concerned about disk i o your best bet is probably to make sure that the batch of data you re working on in memory doesn t get much greater than available ram

since using ram is faster than using disk zram allows linux to make more use of ram when swapping paging is required especially on older computers with less ram installed

that 1st code takes virtually no ram as it creates from the disk making it smaller by simply skipping pixels from the image

to make things even worse in many cases your ram will be smaller than your os es complete disk usage forcing your system to use swap space ie

because hard disk have a much slower memory than ram virtual private server performance may slow down considerably

one thing to note is the soak time you have for your application - if it is big then you might have to provision for more machines with ram and disk

disk i o is about 100 000 times slower than ram

at any rate disk speeds are orders of magnitude lower than the ram speed and i wouldn t be too much concerned about the mode here unless of course it turns out that caching is different in the two modes

because disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

a larger cache reduces the number of reads but up to a certain limit also increases the amount of unsaved data that rethinkdb can accumulate in ram to make disk writes more efficient

in other words the operating system is using some of your hard disk space to satisfy your 13 mb allocation request at great expense of speed since the hard disk is much much slower than ram

if your working set is larger than your ram the operating system will be constantly swapping pages out to disk to make room to swap in pages that an application wants to access

however if this is indeed the case - and the data does not fit ram and you cannot use map-reduce i suspect sorting and iterating - though will be o nlogn will be more efficient using external sort - because the number of disk accesses will be minimized and disk access is much slower then ram access

saving information to a variable and therefore to ram is always faster than direct to disk

using a ram disk is even better though often more of a challenge to get it to implement for you

however they may be cheaper to operate depending on how much data you are expecting to store with each session key holding large quantities of data in ram is typically more expensive than storing on disk

in future these lists may be read from disk and larger than available ram

so even if your ram is much smaller than your disk you could assume you can read data that s already in ram 90 of the time or more

i ve written my own protocol since i need it to be lightweight and i m sending files that may be bigger than the ram available on the device â â therefore the files are being streamed straight from the network to disk

so whatever pandas read_hdf loaded into the ram is less than 100 mb i have 4g ram and my 32-bit-windows system can only use 2.7g and i used the rest for ram disk

ram is a lot faster than disk

access to disk is slower so when you ve written to a file it will be flushed to disk and no longer reside in ram which means that next time you need the file you might be going to get it from disk slow whereas in memory mapped files you know the file is in ram and you can have faster access to it then when it s on disk

1 yes there is a obvious benefit reading from ram is faster than reading from disk

ram is always faster than disk

i just deployed my django project in the cloud server digital ocean with 20 mo with ram and disk are more than adequate

first it creates 10 5gb files 50gb is way more than machine ram so not much help by os file-cache then starts a zookeeper client which is supposed to keep its connection with the zookeeper server up by sending pings heartbeats regularly then makes 10 threads doing random-access into the 10 files creating a lot of disk io but really no real usage of the cpu

i should also mention that this happens once the data is larger than ram and it s increasing size on the disk

using multiprocessing is probably not going to speed up reading data from disk since disk access is much slower than ram access or calculations

if so just throw in some more ram or get a faster disk array.

we all know that the access to ram memory is faster than access to hard disk

if you use map_shared | map_noreserve you can use a memory map much larger than available ram + swap -- but if you run out of disk space or quota your process will receive and die from a sigbus signal.

query speed is mainly limited by disk i o speed which is at least 1000 times slower than cpu ram speed

this means that once you can t scale vertically any more by adding ram disk speed etc to a single server you will have to be careful about how you choose to shard

accessing the main memory ram is much faster than reading values from the hard disk

it is needed for a lookup of repetitions in disk files much larger than available ram

if the table is larger than ram you will likely have a single disk io per access the intermediate index levels will be cached

it is important to give additional space to the ram disk that is 10 bigger than the size of the jvm

once you re out of ram and the system starts swapping - disk access is thousands times slower than ram so any potential benefits of 64-bit code are flying out of window

another option is to spend a bit of cash on a 15000 rpm disk or a ssd solid state disk although that ll be slower than a ram disk

for the stand of file operations writing to memory ram is always faster than writing to the file on the disk directly

if your dataset is larger than your ram you ll be facing massive io delays on the scale of tens of milliseconds and upwards tens or hundreds of thousands of times because of all the required disk operations

reading audio files from ram is much faster than reading audio files from hard disk

the workspace limit is on non-free hosted workspaces any workspace that s private or larger than 1gb disk space and 512mb ram ssh workspaces are unlimited

it sounds like the table is a lot larger than ram so this means something like 5555 disk reads -- likely to be the slowest part

the idea is to get the library and application loaded from ram into ram which is much faster than loading from disk

disk space and ram are far cheaper than your labor and they are cheaper than a delay getting your project completed and into the hands of users

ram is much faster than disk

moving the obj directory to a ram disk can be more efficient without having to buy new hardware if i o really is a problem - but it usually isn t

vs.net makes tons of i o calls and ram disk are much faster than real disk

the difference between disk speed and ram speed is more or less an arithmetic factor

in this case the latter is likely to cause trouble because the insertion of a name hits a random node in the tree i.e the name insertion doesn t follow a pattern and your ram is smaller than the index chances are high that the destination must be fetched from disk

the first load involves reading alot from the hard disk which is slow even ssd is slower than ram subsequent loads should be faster though 3 seconds on the ssd seem to be odd

and ram access is much more fast than disk access

basically if your tables fit comfortably in ram you are better off reporting from them since you are keeping disk i o free for the wal segment commit of your event entry

remember the tuples are saved into the disk which is vastly slower to access than things in ram

edit true the file on disk is not larger than ram but the in-memory representation can easily become much larger than available ram

a cache miss at the cpu cache will load more data from ram a cache miss in ram will load more data from disk all this translates into reduced throughput

it is the ram used for faster access to disk.it is embedded in the disk or it can be portion of main memory set aside

creating the symlink - this because the mysql command by default looks for tmp mysql.sock and symlinking that to our short term ram disk was simpler than constantly changing php.ini files

as you run queries it has to fetch data from disk which is much slower than ram

if your data size is larger than the amount of ram you can afford you can try to compensate with faster disk and using more smaller disk 8 x 74gb instead of 4x 136gb

at some point if you re doing randomish queries and your working set is sufficiently larger than ram then you ll be limited by the small number of random iops a disk can do

ram is 100 thousand times faster than disk for database access from

thus you would get a small performance hit while linux moved it back into ram swapfiles are more efficient at this than mysql would be moving it from the disk

if your working data set is larger than available ram your server may spend a lot of time shuffling files from disk to memory

does pig has a upper hand here by implementing readers and writers which writes in ram memory spill if required and reads from ram and disk if required for better performance

disk even ssd are orders of magnitude slower than ram

this approach will radically reduce heap space usage - disk space is cheaper then ram too

memory is thousands of times faster than disk so if something gets read often having it in ram is drastically faster

since your disk even if it s an ssd is several orders of magnitude slower than ram the systems gets unresponsive

so my question is how to move this database into ram where i can access it via sqlite3_open or if my idea is bullshit and leaving the database on disk is faster than moving it into ram via mapping

this is slow because your hard disk is significantly slower than ram and at 7gb there will be a lot of data being read from your hard disk put into ram then moved back to your page file the file on disk your operating system uses to store data that has been copied out of ram

disk space is probably always going to be cheaper than ram

ram is much faster then disk io

note when the data is much bigger than ram performance degenerates into counting the disk hits .

data in ram can take a lot more space than on disk

but you should consider that disk io is way slower than ram

when your working set exceeds the amount of ram then it will carry on working but with noticeably degraded performance as things will then be constantly having to go to disk which is far less performant

if the worker processes do other things than just calulations read from or write to disk they will have to wait a lot since a disk is a lot slower than ram

for this reason it seemed natural to me to initially load the file into memory and interpret it later at my leisure since reading from ram is supposed to be much faster than from disk

a virtual memory is a concept to work for files bigger than ram by using the pages and swapping with disk and ram

as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram this problem can grind the machine down to a practical halt

it is important to minimize the disk accesses - because disk are not random access and disk accesses are much slower then ram accesses

a ram disk might seem faster but that s because you aren t factoring in the copy to ramdisk and copy from ramdisk times

ram is a lot faster than disk so reads and writes are temporarily stored until the data is requested by the code or the disk is able to receive it

which will lead to performance issue all programs will be work slower because read info from disk is slower than from ram

reloading pages data or program code from disk which is much slower does not usually happen very often as long as the program is actually running and as long as the machine is not desperately low on ram

so bandwidth was probably viewed as cheaper than server ram and disk storage

pros of objects faster disk read is slower than ram lesser dependencies of the system s state

if too much memory is consumed it might swap to disk which is slower than ram

number of cores cpus in slurm disk space and ram are more tricky to get as it might be different on different nodes

always favor disk persistence disk storage is cheaper than ram

when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on it since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting it and reading it multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory

if the hot data won t fit in ram on either machine then disk i o performance becomes more important than ram mostly random read i o and the fsync flush rate

caching and buffering are quite important since disk are just so much slower than ram and ram is much slower than the cpu

the cpu it s never over 20 of use we have plenty of ram and the disk never have more than 0.50 in the queue length

is there any way to read and write in ram instead of file as disk read costs more time

for this reason i deployed a 2 cores 4gb ram and more than enough disk to run through the getting started example of the enterprise integrator

run the following to sort the data on disk this is slower than pulling it into ram sorting and then writing to disk

this particular jboss runs in a vm with 4gb of ram and 2 cpu s and more than enough disk space it has never has less than 5gb free at any time

writing to a local database or handling a data structure larger than ram will impact the disk making network calls will impact the network hardware cpu bound calculations will impact there

it uses swap space on disk to allow for processes much larger than ram

changing it will require a reboot. that will slow things down a bit as the swap file on disk is much slower than ram

however a ram disk is easier to work with

that means that without caching a hit against disk will be 200 times slower than accessing ram

remember disk is 1000s of times slower than ram

relational database systems do their own disk swapping of course partly because they were designed when ram was more expensive and partly because they still sometimes deal with unusually large volumes of data

but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there

no trivial support for cache accessing ram is faster than accessing disk

if the amount of ram is less you ll have a lot of swapping to disk which is a lot more time consuming

alternatively you can use an ssd with file storage in varnish to reduce disk io bottlenecks when using an object cache larger than available ram

the data type text requires more space in ram and on disk is slower to process and more error prone

the table on disk is bigger than your ram

as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram as the memory usage increases your machine grinds more and more closer to a halt

though writing and reading in the same block of code makes little sense in real life as you should still have the data you ve written and because i o to disk are much more expensive than the ram you were using to keep the data so you may just do

and at worst impossible at all ram size is usually much less than disk size

get more ram themore ram you have the more data can live in cache which is 1000 times faster than reading from disk

it won t do anything to change the fact that disk io is orders of magnitude slower than ram

but ram is volatile the data in ram is erased when the computer loses power and ram is far more expensive than disk per unit of storage

actually prefer ram not disk since it s temporary for a period anyway and recreating it only costs much time

so even ignoring practical considerations like disk is slower than ram it will be slower

anyway you will have a huge performance loss due to the fact that your disk is way slower than your ram

ram and disk space is more than enough

you lose two benefits of data base consistency data persists after a crash and you need more ram which is more expensive and scarce than disk flash

the ram is much faster than the hard disk

memory is a bottleneck to performance ram runs slower than the cpu and if you re paging to disk than it s really slow

disk is bigger than ram

i think it is because the disk is slower than ram

your computer ram can hold more byte values before it starts having to use the hard disk as virtual memory

there are libraries that allow on-disk data structures comes to mind and another one whose name i can t recall at the moment but disk accesses are orders of magnitude slower than ram

make sure you have enough ram so that your data set fits with ram atleast your index should fit inside the ram coz each time a data fetched from disk is 10 times slower than ram

there exist battery-backed packages of ram modules which can act as an ultra-fast hdd substitute but if they attach via sata scsi or other typical disk interface the still are slower than system ram

i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access

if lob-storage isn t in ram at the time of a query execution then we need to read it from a disk which is of course much slower than from ram

a disk seek takes about 10 000 000 nanoseconds of course some disk are faster but the best of them are still thousands of times slower than ram

since the files are all bigger than ram this translates to actual disk usage

the amount of data in stream is bigger than machine ram or its disk space so it needs to relatively efficient

disk files are of course an order of magnitude slower than ram and thrashing your virtual memory system could actually be worse than that depending on your access patterns

all of rsfalcon7 s suggestions can be combined into a super rule do as much as possible in unshared resources l1 l2 caches - implying economizing on code and data requirements - and if you need to go to shared resources do as much as possible in l3 before going to ram before using synchronization the cpu cycles required to synchronize is variable but is slower - or much slower - than accessing ram before going to disk

basically ram is more expensive than the disk storage

location of the input sorting algorithms on disk are different from algorithms on ram because disk reads are much less efficient when not sequential

disk is 100x slower than ram

it can be improved via usage of ram disk or adding more ssds to increase iops number routing requests to reduce ping changing modifying os to reduce kernel overhead etc

so if all you need is to serve images instead of doing additional processing in java the ram disk approach is indeed faster also uses less memory

i would say that probably yes as long as we have enough of ram which is faster that virtual memory in case we need to access something from the disk which is extremely slow... but also i know that some applications just require having paging

ram and disk have gotten cheaper but engineering time has not and sharing of source is arguably more portable than sharing of binaries

a solid state drive may even be faster than a ram disk which surprised me

my assumption in the question above is that disk is as fast as ram or faster than ram

on the other hand table variables usually with smaller data are kept in memory ram making them faster to access and therefore less disk io in terms of using the tempdb drive when using table variables with smaller data compared to temporary tables which always log in tempdb

any db tech is fine with me as long it does not need lots of ram and uses less disk

if for any node total resource allocation makes more than all ram cores disk available you are at risk most often at risk of spark task or yarn child being unable to start

but it basically matches ram blocks to disk blocks

i want to cut large csv files file size more than ram size and use them or save each in disk for later usage

that s basically possible but it would take hours as hard disk access is so much slower than accessing ram caches

in the past the redis developers experimented with virtual memory and other systems in order to allow larger than ram datasets but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well data served from memory disk used for storage

as sven marnach wrote in the comments your problem is most likely i o bound since disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

in addition jemalloc tries to optimise for cache locality since the act of fetching data from ram is much slower than using data already in the cpu caches no different in concept to the difference between fast fetching from ram versus slow fetching from disk

ssd disk are good but they are still much slower than ram

so everything here should require no work on your part not consume more ram not consume more disk space impose no other overheads never freeze and give you a nice speedup

loosely speaking ram is 1000 or more times faster than disk and cpu is faster still

as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times

also ram bandwidth is much higher than disk or ssd or network bandwidth and the ram latency is much lower too

there are two reasons that i can think of as to why a ram disk is slower

the diminishing returns means that if you need more swap space than twice your ram size you d better add more ram as hard disk drive hdd access is about 10â³ slower then ram access so something that would take 1 second suddenly takes more then 15 minutes

but ram and disk are getting cheaper and cheaper so scaling up and having a couple hot hot replicas is actually not all that bad these are props to the the second approach you described

more ram means less disk access


ceil	floor	14
so i choose ceil or floor in to realize this

for a fixed value of m the numbers to choose are ceil n-m m+1 and floor n-m m+1 in whatever combination makes the sum work out

rint is measurably faster than floor or ceil

now if floor is higher than 0 or ceil is lower than 0 on any axis it means that there just as many tiles outside of the camera scoop

the floor times the ceil are greater than the floor xy...that s very much possible

â when using drawimage coordinates will be rounded for you you might want to do the rounding yourself since it is floor that is used and that ceil that gives smoother results

treemap is an implementation of navigablemap special case of sortedmap where navigational features such as nearest match floor ceil etc. are allowed

works because ceil a b is always one greater than floor a b except when a b is a whole number

a simple function to follow would be if greater than 0 floor else ceil using a multiplier to raise it above the decimal point temporarily whilst doing it

the expression in cond selects ceil _n 2 if the number of observations is odd and floor _n 2 if it is even

i m trying to create reusable timebar where it accepts a date as prop and returns two dates left and right for example ceil or floor dates...potentially have more logic in it

on the other hand if what you want to do is not rounding but elimination of fractions into one direction then you have std ceil that goes always higher and std floor that always goes lower

in general case you need to determine maximum and minimum shape coordinates along every axis and define minimum axis aligned integer bounding box with values rounded to larger using ceil for max and rounded to smaller using floor for min coordinates

so floor idx is the lower element and ceil idx is the higher


mockito	jmockit	3
but if you re doing this sort of thing often i d recommend powermockito in conjunction with mockito or jmockit to achieve this

comparison between mockito vs jmockit - why is mockito voted better than jmockit

mockito s a much older library than jmockit so you could expect that it would have many more features

argumentnullexception	argumentexception	3
i would recommend using argumentexception or argumentnullexception for parameters passed to routines rather then local variables

an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit

usually you get something like argumentnullexception or argumentoutofrangeexception which derive from argumentexception and give more explicit detail about what s actually wrong with the argument


grafana	kibana	3
if you would like a unified front-end for elasticsearch and opentsdb you could consider grafana which has support for both elasticsearch and opentsdb but less functionality than kibana in regard to elasticsearch

grafana is more of visualization only while kibana is for searching the logs is that right

kibana focuses more on logs and adhoc search while grafana focuses more on creating dashboards for visualizing time series data


nerdtree	netrw	6
vim includes netrw which is already a filebrowser and i like it a lot more than nerdtree

in the netrw plugin it would be easy but this one is not used any more as nerdtree just replaced it

vim already comes with a file explorer that does a lot more than nerdtree called netrw

is nerdtree really much better than netrw

however vim comes by default with another plugin which does a lot more than nerdtree called netrw help netrw

last question is nerdtree really much better than netrw


uwsgi	cherokee	1
so your app code is actually run via uwsgi and cherokee is more like a proxy server


system.data.oracleclient	odp.net	2
personally i prefer odp.net but system.data.oracleclient will get the job done

agreed that using odp.net is better than deprecated system.data.oracleclient


accessor	superclass	1
if i have a bunch of fields in a parent class that all need to be inherited by subclassing is it better to have the subclassing nested in the superclass make the fields protected rather than private or use protected accessor


qstring	qlist	1
there can be a .txt file on hard disk or a qlist or qstring whichever is a better soluion


floating-point	integer	45
therefore ieee 754 single precision floating-point format has 23-bits fractions and int type has 32 bits so if the integer is larger than 2 24-1 the float type can t represent it exactly

but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic

if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead

if all the values vary each time then it seems unlikely that the floating-point division to compute the 1.25 followed by floating-point multiplication is going to be any faster than the integer multiplication followed by integer division

floating-point arithmetics is by far more complicated than integer arithmetics

but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point

i was wondering about some of the math or theory of whether a signed integer or signed floating-point representation in n bits encodes more granularity between its min and max values or if the two encode the same granularity

nsdecimalnumber and the floating-point types may be able to store bigger numbers than the integer types though with decreasing precision

floating-point divide is faster than integer fewer bits to divide assuming your cpu has floating-point unit

it s even possible that you could implement pong using only integer arithmetic which is likely to be faster than floating-point -- but the difference is unlikely to be critical

a floating-point format with a n-bit fractions can t represent the integer which is larger than 2 n+1 -1 because it will lose the precision

as a rule of thumb floating-point is about 2x slower than integer on

my question is why do both integer and floating-point multiplication execute faster than their addition counterparts

generally integer math is faster than floating-point math

historically floating-point could be much slower than integer

on intel cpus before skylake packed-integer instructions can always run on more ports than their floating-point counterparts so prefer integer ops

on somewhat limited processors like those in high-end cell phones floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally within an order of magnitude or better so long as there is hardware floating-point available

floating-point solves the more general problem of representing some real numbers that aren t integers and some real numbers that are larger than the maximum integer up to which all integers are representable here 16777216 all with a nearly uniform relative accuracy at least 1 2 precision

note that your program may report some numbers as prime if their largest prime factor is very close to their square root if the number is the square of a prime because the conversion of number to a floating-point value may round it down so trsq may end up being less than the square root even less than the largest integer that is smaller than the square root

which uses all integer arithmetic is usually faster than its floating-point equivalent likely significantly faster in the case of a floating-point type equivalent to t-sql s decimal type

floating-point division is typically faster than integer division on the cpu

floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally

i did this very successfully with scipy.ndimage in the floating-point domain way better results than integer image processing like this

depending on context floating-point code may be as fast as or faster than integer code or it may be four times slower

there exist processors on which using an integer vector load movdqa to load data that is consumed by a floating-point operation requires more time than using a floating-point load to get data for a floating-point operation and vice-versa

historically floating-point could be much slower than integer arithmetic

rather than using a for-loop and continuously expanding y which is going to be extremely slow for large x arrays you can use the second input of sum to compute the sum for each row and then you can determine which rows sum to an integer by comparing the rounded and original versions using a very small epsilon the proper way to compare floating-point numbers

however due to unpredictable floating-point precision issues it is sometimes little less than exact integer and in this case it is rounded down too much

integer math is often much faster than floating-point so such a function could be a major performance win

because integer types like uint8 have saturated arithmetic in matlab plus floating-point types have more precision when doing certain operations

integer values are easier to deal with than floating-point

the difference between each floating-point number and its corresponding integer is less than 1 or equal to 1 if you really must

they take up more space and floating-point math is slower than integer math

note that it is usually advisable to use an unsigned integer rather than an int to access the bits of floating-point encodings because unsigned integers are less prone to certain issues such as sign issues with bit shifts

there are lots of cpu gpu combinations where a 32b integer multiply is faster than a 32b floating-point multiply on cpu and vice-versa on gpu

since the floating-point value is slightly less than the integer you rounded to thanks to .nextdown the integer part is going to be one less than that integer

i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digit limitation of floating-point variable

floating-point types have a larger range than the integer types so

floating-point representation in memory can t add third link - because floating-point variables is much more strange than integer ones

today s floating-point units are pretty fast and may actually divide faster than an integer unit

an individual floating-point division instruction will take longer than an integer one

because the floating-point value is of a higher rank than an integer it will promote the integer to a float

this feature allows the processor to execute several arithmetic operations simultaneously often four 32-bit integer operations or four 32-bit floating-point operations sometimes more operations with narrower integers sometimes fewer operations with 64-bit floating-point

prefer integer operations over floating-point

you re performing integer division which is coarser than floating-point division


qlistwidget	qitemdelegate	1
having implemented a similar approach for a qlistwidget i recommend using qstyleditemdelegate in lieu of qitemdelegate as it allows you to more easily integrate this widget with your application s style layout


autogrow	scrollbar	1
i am trying to stop a textarea with autogrow.js from growing after 300px height and then destroying autogrow textarea so that it has scrollbar although the code i have used to do this is working fine i can stop the textarea from growing after 300px but when that happens the textarea becomes smaller than 300px suddenly


imagemagick	gdlib	1
i heartly recommend imagemagick check if installed on your server but you can also roll your own thumbnail script using phps gdlib which is bundled with php and most likely available


bokeh	matplotlib	3
they have quite different approaches mpl3d enables the use of standard matplotlib plotting commands but with large datasets bokeh may be more useful

my guess is that imagergba in bokeh might be more similar to matplotlib s imshow but i m afraid i don t know

i m sure it can be accomplished with pure bokeh but i m looking to do a more advanced plot with bokeh which relies on matplotlib so i m looking to use show mpl.to_bokeh


folder	dir	16
i need your help i need to copy a file to one folder before inno setup start or before the the page of select dir i want this file to be copied from the installer and not from an external source if someone can give an example please

for each file in the indicated folder if a file with the same name does not exist in the parent folder remove from child dir command is used instead of if exists to avoid false positive match with folder names

it iterates through the most recent folder returned by the dir command each returned on one line and after it encounters the 4th it stops if there are more than 4 folder

there are no guarantees that dir which is the name of a folder within your source dir will be longer in number of chars than the number returned by the randrange

it will open a box to enter search string then open a dir dialog box to select folder

i thought i could somehow i am totally fresh iterate trough the folder which exists in one folder will all this other folder and check if the dir contains more than one file if not rmdir foldername

using a filesystemobject is more powerful than dir because dir only returns a string while filesystemobject lets you work with files and folder as actual objects which are much more powerful

i solved this myself the problem was just qt errors no problem with the code at all for some reason it didnt like that my project files were in a folder structure of more than one folder before my project files used the exact same code in a new dir and it worked

any ideas how to use the command dir to more than 1 folder in one command

i did first try deleting the .svn folder from the bin directory but all that did was cause it to complain that the bin dir was no longer under source control and halt

folder objects undoubtedly give the fullest access to file information but the older dir function is easier to use and allows specification of a filename template so i have used that

i am running into an issue where for some of the folder there are too many subfolders and it spits out the directory name k really long path blah is too long not the actual dir- the actual dir is longer than 260 chars

things like cmd c dir don t know why - and yes i do cmd c dir in cases i am in some kind of shared network folder with thousands of files and ls is significantly slower than dir

i d recommend folder directory or even dir

iterate over every file in the client javascript folder that match dir command and for f are totally unneeded here though and only complicate things especially when file names contain spaces commas and the like

calculates the size of the first 5 folder in your home dir should work on all platforms fails with an arrayindexoutofboundexception if there are less than five folder in your home dir


unsigned	short	56
firstly though we tend to use signed more than unsigned values which would lean us toward short but also ushort is not a cls-compliant type and there s hardly any point introducing an incompatibility with other .net languages in obtaining compatibility with com

but there s no warranty about it the compiler may choose unsigned chars or int or short any of those types are large enough to fit all the values seen in the enum

smaller than int unsigned short becomes int

it s not an unsigned int any more than unsigned short or unsigned long are it s a distinct type albeit one that can be promotoed quite readily to other types

if limit is anything other than unsigned short it has vastly less output

if int is wider than short which is common but not guaranteed then an argument of type unsigned short when passed to a variadic function like swprintf will be prompted to int

but in case short is a smaller type than int it is always converted to signed int regardless of it the short was signed or unsigned

i know that when we compare signed with unsigned the compiler converts our signed values to unsigned and when we compare a short with int the compiler converts the smaller type to the larger one

the problem is that n is an unsigned short which has less size than a normal int

but i wrote this code to check if we compared an signed int x 0xdeadbeef and unsigned short y 0xffff then after converting the unsigned short to int we should have 0x0000ffff in y at the comparison which should be smaller than the unsigned value of x

as unsigned short int is in some implementations smaller than unsigned int

given your output the short and unsigned short are smaller than int

an unsigned short int has lower rank than int the values are promoted when used as operands to +

an unsigned char is an unsigned value which is typically smaller than and is guaranteed not to be bigger than a short

as mentioned by loã c faure-lacroix js numbers are much more complicated than unsigned short

according the books the variations of type integer occupy more or less bytes of memory depending on the architecture however the type unsigned short values â â can get up to 65 535 since the type unsigned long 4 294 967 295

if short is smaller than int on the given platform as is the case on 32 and 64 bit systems any short or unsigned short will therefore always get converted to int because they can fit inside one

nevertheless unsigned short has lower rank than int by definition and is subject to integral promotion

or would it be good practice to use an unsigned chars in this case since it allocates less memory than a short int

values of integral types narrower than int chars signed chars unsigned chars short int and unsigned short is promoted to int

the only constraints were that int s must be no smaller than short s and long s must be no smaller than int s and size_t must represent the largest unsigned type supported by an implementation

that s not so much the case any more now that we have multiple types larger than int but back when c was young the int types were chars short int and unsigned versions of those so all the other types were promoted to int and all code to manipulate anything was done with int s

branch to target if less than unsigned or unordered short form

on your system unsigned int is apparently larger than uint16_t int is a greater ranked integer type than short in the standard 6.3.1.1 even if they are of the same size

if short is the same size as int unsigned short is larger than int

that does leave one loophole though it s one that would generally be quite horrible that chars and short have the same range size_type is the same as unsigned short and int has a greater range than chars short

i am a little rusty but you should be able to get string to char array then force cast to an unsigned short i prefer unsigned for data manipulation

about 99.9 percent of the data in question is much less than the unsigned short int size but use unsigned int to be safe

integral promotion involves the conversion of int types narrower than int which includes bool chars unsigned chars signed chars unsigned short signed short to an int if possible or an unsigned int

if size_type is defined as unsigned short and int is wider than unsigned short the lhs of your addition will be converted to the rhs and you rely on the addition being performed in the lhs s type

you re telling it to read a value into unsigned int variable but you re giving a pointer to an unsigned short which is smaller so it overwrites whatever is after n in the stack frame causing undefined behavior -- in your case corrupting fact

i have a method that returns a but i want to allow for more numbers than an unsigned short can hold so i would like to convert it to a before i add my bigger numbers to it

btw on some processors unsigned short is much slower than unsigned int because the c standard requires that operations on unsigned types wrap

this will also cause unresolved errors as a wchar_t does not match unsigned short in this case

the rule for performing arithmetic operations in c c++ is that if the type such as short is narrower than int then it gets widened to int if all values can fit or unsigned int otherwise

with unsigned short being shorter than int all values of type unsigned short can be represented by int so the converted-to- int values of current_time and last_time will be the same as their un-converted unsigned short value and the result of the subtraction will be what you expect it to be

if the mathematical result of the addition is outside the range of float which is unlikely or if it s outside the range of unsigned short which is much more likely then the program will have undefined behavior

alignment may fail as unsigned short can be narrower than unsigned int

when integral types like chars short int bool take less number of bytes than int then these data types are automatically promoted to int or unsigned int when an operation is performed on them

this is pretty simple for types sizeof int but unsigned chars short is more complicated and requires compiler specific packing

how often does redis handle strings longer than unsigned short int

additionally there may be padding bits in an unsigned short that cause your program to misbehave or an unsigned short might be smaller or larger than 2 bytes depending on char_bit and the choices of the implementation

so long story short don t compare unsigned and signed integers especially if the signed value is potentially negative

therefore the size of a short or unsigned short may be larger than what i just posted above

i used a short int to represent the numbers from -32000 to 32000 also i used unsigned to get bigger numbers

so if you tell it to expect an unsigned short for example then it will actually expect either an int if int is wider than unsigned short or unsigned int if int and short are the same size

it will get promoted to type int because type int can represent all values of type size_t and rank of size_t being a synonym for unsigned short is lower than the rank of int

i m asking that because storing just unsigned short would be less painfull and could allow small and big models

once you provide a unsigned short it can be promoted to int but unsigned long being in higher rank than int cannot be promoted to int hence you end up supplying wrong type of argument to d which will invoke undefined behavior

if you convert signed short to signed int and int is wider than short the compiler would generate code that does the conversion and that conversion is different from unsigned short to signed int sign extension or not

so in the second expression high-order bits are removed by the cast to unsigned short while in the first expression they won t be removed if int is wider than short

if you really want all 8 bytes in a single number then you need to read more than the unsigned short

on the other hand if size_t were something like unsigned short and int bigger than short then int could represent all possible size_t values and s would be converted to int

a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32 bits and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

if you limit each pool to 65536 items you can choose unsigned short to save space actually it s 65535 to allow efficient circular queue management

later edit your code also indexes an up to str.length elements but the short being bigger than char your array only contains str.length 2 unsigned short indexable elements


wcf	openrasta	4
though openrasta looks more mature than wcf web api i m still a bit confused

openrasta is much more mature than wcf web api

is openrasta better than wcf

building restful services with openrasta is much simpler than with wcf in my experience


atomic	lockless	1
about this time new research into locking and lockless algorithms showed that atomic compareandset was a more flexible primitive to have so more modern cpus have that as an instruction


matplotlib	chaco	4
i m not sure if i m approaching this the right way or if i should be looking at another graphing module but i ve looked at gnuplot and chaco and i felt that matplotlib was more fit for my problem

enthought-dev is chaco faster than matplotlib

matplotlib wx will work but if you are going to be doing more of this sort of thing i found that chaco was a better solution for interaction

one aspect where chaco wins out over matplotlib is in speed so i m exploring ways to get acceptable performance from matplotlib


pdfsharp	itext	1
as noted in the comment by quandary the pdfsharp library offers a more relaxed license mit compared to the commercial or agpl license offered by itext


libcurl	httr	1
however httr would be a better choice since it and the libcurl package it uses deal with web server interaction and content in a more thorough way


fat	xfs	1
actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc


dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream	2
a bufferedoutputstream is more appropriate that a dataoutputstream imho

it will wrap the original stream in a bufferedoutputstream which is more efficient which is then wrapped into a dataoutputstream which offers additional nice features like writeint writelong and so on


codeblocks	codelite	1
we sort of settled on it but later found codelite and liked it better than codeblocks


laravel	slim	3
you can do a good job with php too but i suggest to use frameworks like silex slim or laravel that are better suited to put up a rest api which you will need if you want to use backbone

for a 2014 answer i would recommend laravel slim php ruby on rails sinatra ruby django flask python grails groovy jvm-based language play

edit based on the requirements you mentioned in your comment i would be happy to recommend laravel over slim for this use case


vertica	impala	1
druid seems to compare itself with impala redshift vertica cassandra and hadoop in the field of storage solution


passenger	webrick	3
in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

well i think if you are using rails and you have passenger to your gemfile when you typing rails server always choose passenger instead of webrick

phusion passenger is the de facto apache mod and yes it s better than webrick which is really only good for tiny sites or testing


backbone.js	zepto	1
i d recommend backbone.js and zepto for an html-based app


arc4random	srand	2
results are quite stable srand and 999999999 iterations of rand takes around 6 s while arc4random takes much longer around 30 s

from what i can gather arc4random generates much better random numbers than rand does however i haven t seen a way to seed it and i would like to just like using srand


mef	prism	5
mef seemed a bit easier than prism and i started to do a hello world mef app with this tutorial

this means with mef you have modularity from top to bottom wheras with prism modules are more granular units

using mef for the add-in architecture over prism can be cleaner because the reasons for each project are vastly different and mef has a cleaner model i think it can also act as a basic ioc container

i personally think combining prism with mef makes this type of situation easier though since mef allows for easier dynamic extensibility for roles

for containers within prism i tend to just pick one ioc container- and i usually choose mef


xfce	gnome	7
you might want to look at one of these options if you re running in a vm since xfce is slightly lighter weight than gnome although not all that much lighter these days

if you prefer gnome or xfce gtk qt can also use your gtk theme

don t uninstall gnome just select xfce in the graphical login screen

open suse lets you select xfce as your desktop environment and xubuntu is an ubuntu variant that uses xfce instead of gnome

ubuntu debian with gnome or xfce need more than 50 alpha in its background the alpha value of 128 255 gets the event while 127 255 doesn t

xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured

since the more mainstream wms like gnome or kde become more and more resource hungry it wasn t long before i replaced gnome with xfce on laptops and desktop computers


dbcontext	objectcontext	25
in 6.7 a graph it shown that states that the performance of a objectcontext linq query is better than dbcontext linq query

you just need to connect using the entity framework driver and if you develop in any of technologies that uses dbcontext includes code first model first and data base first but is lighter than objectcontext you can use the list below

dbcontext api is easier to work with than objectcontext but both approaches use the former

dbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needs

if adding 2000 entities and saving the changes at the end dbcontext is 3 to 5 times slower than objectcontext btw. i know that adding a large amount of entities would be better using sqlbulkcopy but that s not the point

you can try to convert dbcontext to objectcontext and use the more complex api

the problem with dbcontext api is even worse because dbcontext api doesn t offer methods to change state of independent association so you must revert back to objectcontext api and use objectstatemanager.changerelationshipstate

ok - it appears that the objectcontext can translate from system.data.sqlclient.sqldatareader meaning i don t need to derive directly from the dbcontext

dbcontext is newer api which should polish developers experience when using most common tasks - simply the api is better designed but you still have to get objectcontext from dbcontext and use the older api if you want to use some more complex features

besides the dbcontext api is easier to use than objectcontext

the description is related to objectcontext api but dbcontext api is just wrapper suffering same issues actually dbcontext api suffers even more issues in this scenario and because of that i will skip solution with manually setting relationships

my understanding is that although dbcontext is newer it s not necessarily better than objectcontext it just provides a different api that might be considered simpler but doesn t that depend on the use case

from what i have read the dbcontext is a simplified version of the objectcontext and makes it easier to work with

when it comes to deletion it even gets worse when saving at the end of all entity removals dbcontext is around 18 times slower than objectcontext

you must either include foreign keys to your entities so they will be tracked as normal values or you must convert your dbcontext to objectcontext and use more powerful and more cumbersome objectstatemanager where you can get instances of objectstateentry for both entities and relations

assuming that what i see that is missing in your code is for you to pass the new instance of databindingprojection to your dbcontext if using 4.2+ or to the objectcontext if using older versions i would recommend migrating to 5.0

and dbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needs

there are many reasons why the dbcontext api is better than the older objectcontext api but in your case it may initially feel like a downgrade

create datamodel with devart entitywizad for ef 6 choose dbcontext template don t why it still write the code with both objectcontext dbcontext

the problem is that to do so you need to use objectcontext instead of dbcontext which makes things harder

i would also recommend using dbcontext instead of objectcontext

dbcontext is a much more pleasant api than objectcontext

entity sql which is not available in code first and dbcontext api - you must access it through objectcontext api is more powerful because it is not dependent on limited functionality offered by linq

it is a feature it is about objectcontext api but the same is true or worse with dbcontext api

i used to use dbcontext for all of my db models until i read ways to optimize entity framework after following the steps i found my self forced to switch to objectcontext instead so there were alot of code changes to be done but i am not sure that i doing the right thing specially after googling the deference i ve noticed that dbcontext is newer and better than objectcontext and also i noticed that i lost alot of things while switching to objectcontext like migrations and find method and much more.


jstl	taglib	2
generally i noted that jstl sql taglib is much slower than java code because it put all the result set into an hashmap

choose jstl and use the jsp core taglib


squeak	visualworks	1
the difference between self and a smalltalk-80 such as squeak or visualworks is less than the differences between smalltalk-80 and smalltalk-72


difftime	mktime	2
another approach would be to convert it with strptime and mktime to time_t and compare these with difftime

chqrlie has pointed out in the comments that this method could also lead to erroneous comparisons for extremely close dates fractions of a second since if difftime mktime date_1 mktime date_2 is less than 1 in magnitude the value will be converted to 0 upon return thus comparing as equal


hash	hmac	11
hmac is better than a plain hash because it is not vulnerable to hash length extension attacks

because you can guess the top passwords and see if they have the same hash but the author points out that hmac is a more secure mechanism

the structure of the hmac algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying hash algorithm

if your goal is simply tamper-evidence then perhaps a hmac keyed hash may be a more efficient way to go

in some cases on embedded platforms where a fast hash function may not be available these may be more efficient than hmac

can you please offer me good reasons against using basic encrypted authentication or to put it in other words why i should prefer hmac hash or oauth

now i can understand that a ghash takes a bit longer than hmac because of the galios field and such but beeing 2 times slower compared to the slowest hash algorithm i know is insane

after looking it s seems that hmac is much faster and better in term of security even if the underlying hash function sha1 is broken which is not the case when using rsa-sha1

an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

if a key is longer than the hmac supports it ll usually be hash to the proper size

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt


rockmongo	mongovue	1
other guis like mongovue and rockmongo seem even more out of date


photoshop	fireworks	3
i don t know either of them but i have always worked with fireworks for things as web design as seemingly opposed to a lot of people who prefer photoshop

i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks

i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill

the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup and error

rpart	party	1
i want to compare cart and chaid algorithm i choose rpart cart algorithm and party chaid algorithm to see the difference between them


primefaces	tomahawk	1
if you re not on jsf 2.2 yet or if you don t like primefaces ui grab tomahawk which renders the same plain html output as but supports a attribute so that you can position the items by the way you want


easymock	unitils	1
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take


reactivex	rxjs	1
the import will give you the typescript source file but i would recommend installing rxjs 5.0.0-beta.11 rather than reactivex rxjs so you can do this


fseek	fread	3
you fseek to offset x whatever data is buffered is now useless you fread 100 bytes and the buffered fread reads more - probably 8 kb

so i guess fseek should be much faster than fread

i probably feel fseek might be bit faster than fread as fseek changes the pointer position to the new address space that you have mentioned and there is no date read is happening


tcpreplay	scapy	1
if you need better performances than what scapy can offer you should probably use tcpreplay


hebrew	persian	1
i am not sure it can satisfy you but hebrew test is 4 times slower than persian


aggregate-functions	sum	20
you cannot nest aggregate-functions - select sum max x will always error

andreiy s query performs about the same as my simplified version aggregate-functions in outer select min max sum makes no measurable difference just two rows per group

select sum total from invoices is an expression it s not an aggregate-functions and it doesn t exist in group by actually you cannot use subqueries in group by

9 for sum aggregate-functions select sum cast id as decimal 5 0 from range 1

i changed out total for sum which is more consistent with other databases sqlite aggregate-functions

i want to take an ado.net datatable and perform the equivalent of a sql select query with aggregate-functions such as sum on some columns and group by set for the remaining columns

group by should only be used if you have an aggregate-functions in your select such as sum or count

anytime you select aggregate-functions like avg sum max min etc.

as an added answer there is also the aggregate-functions which is more general than sum

when using aggregate-functions in your select such as sum and count when selecting other columns as well a group by including those additional columns is required

nesting aggregate-functions in the same select such as sum x count y is not allowed

calculation in sql returns templatesyntaxerror at caught databaseerror while rendering column votes.time_stamp must appear in the group by clause or be used in an aggregate-functions line 1 ... select coalesce sum vote 0 extract hour from time_stamp.

because you can t mix normal column select with aggregate-functions like sum

we re using select sum delivered is not null because we need numeric results in the aggregate-functions for every row

if you only care about the total of partscosts and not the other details you would need to change your query to have an aggregate-functions such as select sum partscost .

i m writting stored procedure which gets aggregate-functions name and column name as parameters and returns value example sum age returns value of select sum age from mytable

that s why you must provide select statement with aggregate-functions like sum avg min max which will produce 1 result from possible choices

system.linq.dynamic is too limited compared to normal linq - many functions are not supported doesn t like sub collections and requres you to use one of the supported aggregate-functions which are no more and no less than any count min max sum and average

aggregate-functions is more general version of sum

best thing you can do is use one of the aggregate-functions on the column s you want to do the calculation on such as select sum columnname from table will give you the sum of the values in that column


phpstorm	webstorm	3
webstorm + pycharm + rubymine + phpstorm though to be fair rubymine has more features than radrails atm

however i do not know if webstorm has a comparable option like that as it has less functionality than phpstorm or even intellij

if you can afford buy webstorm or phpstorm otherwise you may use netbeans or sublime text


layoutparams	viewgroup	1
unless you know exactly what you are doing do not use the same layoutparams for more than one viewgroup


opensuse	debian	1
note that centos software versions are older than debian s but versions of opensuse software are newer than debian s versions


rapidsvn	tortoisesvn	1
with a gui interface along with a command line one subversion has tortoisesvn rapidsvn which is more of a traditional ui or ankhsvn for visual studio integration


emacs	atom-editor	1
so if you do not have hard preference for some of this editors choose between emacs or atom-editor to code elixir in


tostring	getter	1
the reason is that play # select expects getter in the valueproperty and labelproperty params and when not found defaults to the enum tostring


flyway	liquibase	5
the downside is that you are losing the big part of the flyway s appeal in its simplicity and technically could be better off by using liquibase s dsl

liquibase seems to have everything flyway has and more flexibility when it comes to rollbacks

imho you shouldn t use the automatic creation update features to create schema s either do it yourself or use tools like liquibase or flyway to do it more controlled

solutions like flyway or liquibase offer more control over your ddl albeit at the price of additional code you have to write and maintain

possibly flyway and liquibase are better thought of as database versioning tools


qmainwindow	qwidget	3
second you don t need a qmainwindow as top parent a qwidget give a better result

qmainwindow is basically same as qwidget when used as a guess what main window the noticeable difference is that qwidget expects you to have only 1 window in ur application while qmainwindow is more about serving as the most important window which will control all the rest like alert message boxes for example

should i choose qmainwindow or qwidget for this project


filesystems	hfs	1
hfs+ supports much larger files than hfs block addresses are 32-bit length instead of 16-bit and uses unicode utf-16 encoding to name files folders and other filesystems objects


rubymine	radrails	1
webstorm + pycharm + rubymine + phpstorm though to be fair rubymine has more features than radrails atm


bullet	sfml.net	1
i try to make shooter game on c# with sfml.net but i can t imagine how to make an ability to shoot more than 1 bullet because now i have just one null-object of bullet-class and when player presses space key this object gets link to the new bullet


superclass	subclassing	92
you can see that product is my superclass and purchase is subclassing

if new member fields are declared in the subclassing then yes a subclassing presumably uses more memory since it has all the fields declared in the superclass plus all the fields declared in the subclassing

the subclassing overridden method cannot have weaker access than superclass method

watch out you can t query a superclass if you have more than 1 subclassing then something like in jql

as you mentioned if superclass implementation changes then subclassing can break or more worst - will do unintended things silently

better than modifying superclass output would be to modify the superclass so that the subclassing can provide the appropriate shape name

hence your subclassing is accepting less classes than the superclass contract promises

so i inspected the compiled firebasemessagingservice which was the subclassing of com.google.firebase.iid.zzb and had zzae intent method as private but its subclassing firebasemessagingservice had protected access i know that subclassing cannot have weaker reference than its superclass so i guess there is something wrong with firebasemessagingservice library

you can override a method in a subclassing to add more functionality to what the superclass has

still you cannot inherited from a as superclass cannot have a lower visibility than subclassing

right click on project name on package explorer + add new class + type package name name subclassing name and superclass or click on browse to choose superclass

is it possible to iterate over superclass in such a way as to only select subclassing

i then break down that superclass into subclassing that are more specific to the objects they represent

these relations naturally arise when you impose restrictions on what you can handle--then if a subclassing means that the method can handle less acts as a superclass of since can handle everything that the subclassing can handle and more

a requirement that the constructor in the superclass runs before any code in the constructor of the subclassing keeps things simpler

i know you can add values attributes behaviour that aren t in a superclass to a subclassing to make it more task specific

it looked weired to me that you are trying to return a subclassing s instance from a superclass s method since superclass usually means a more general concept

in the subclassing you might need to add code to en- decode the properties of the subclassing and call super to consider also the properties of the superclass

in enhanced er modelling subclassing inheriting from more than 1 superclass is called multiple inherited

technically the subclassing tend to be more specific and the superclass are more generalized

if i have a class hierarchy in which subclassing require use of more specific types than those specified in the superclass ivars is it better to declare the superclass ivar as id or to type it and then cast where necessary in the subclassing

if we are creating an object of a subclassing and invoking the method of superclass and if subclassing extends more than one class which superclass method should be called

secondly if you want the superclass variables to be accessible by your subclassing it s better to use protected than public

i have a class structure in java where one class extends another and the subclassing can have more variables than the superclass does

here having a superclass makes more sense or at least having a realnumber subclassing of number

you cannot have a subclassing with less methods than a superclass

the other way round returning a subclassing that is a more specific class does not break the contract because the subclassing has at least the same functionality as the superclass

creating a subclassing should mean more than just a convenient way to call superclass methods

base class or superclass vs subclassing are better terms imo

generally subclassing have more specialized purposes than their superclass as a result

take note of this there is no way to subclassing more than one superclass at a time

with explicit superclass calling your subclassing can accept more or fewer arguments than its superclass and can decide itself what to pass when calling the superclass

on the other side when hiding a static method the static method from subclassing that hides the static method from superclass can allow more but not less access than the hidden method

because if you think about it semantically a subclassing is not a member of the superclass parent child words is misleading in this case superclass and subclassing are better

on the contrary since a subclassing inherited all public methods of its superclass the subclassing are definitely bigger

a subclassing is more flexible and is treated as an entire object which responds to all superclass methods plus it s own

it not subclassing because subclassing inherited properties of superclass and add some more

in general instances of subclassing may be larger than those of their superclass so you should not expect the subclassing to fit into your vector s slot

subclassing collections is dangerous because for example you don t know whether or not addall delegates to add inside the superclass this is explained further in effective java p.71

if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method

this breaks the inherited and the subclassing is no longer an instance of the superclass

even in your original post the subclassing is actually more restrictive than the superclass so doing something like

superclass defines more general features of the objects of its subclassing

i believe this solution is superior in general to the forward declaration because you re eliminating some tight coupling between your superclass and your subclassing and making a more generic interface besides

if you cast the subclassing to the superclass then the public methods on the subclassing are no longer visible

for example you want to use abstract-class in such a case that each of the subclassing is a more specific type of its abstract superclass fruit apple orange banana grape strawberries etc. and you want to use non-abstract superclass in a relationship such as dad and son

yes but if you think of your diagram as a topographic map the subclassing have higher altitudes than the superclass

however if the subclassing returns a narrower subtype of the superclass method return this is called a covariant return type and is allowed in java since jdk 1.5

if i have a bunch of fields in a parent class that all need to be inherited by subclassing is it better to have the subclassing nested in the superclass make the fields protected rather than private or use protected accessor

you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have

imagine your superclass has an object member but in your subclassing this is now more defined to be an integer

shouldn t a subclassing interfaced be able to take in more than the superclass interfacec and use the same method

here a type gives the alternative subclassing a a relative weight of 1 over the alternative superclass b making a more specific than b

the behaviour with the subclassing or identical classes can be seen easily seen if you explicitly compare with superclass and inherited class

this gives you more flexibility than subclassing because with subclassing you are automatically inheriting all the methods in the superclass which is far more restricting than simply using some of the methods of another class

2 since superclass is smaller than subclassing one should use memory object carefully

usually i subclassing the stock cocoa classes customize to my needs and if i need custom methods in more than one subclassing i will declare a category on the superclass rather than relying on inherited to provide my custom behavior

many of the libgdx and android classes are designed this way they implement a bit of functionality but expect subclassing to implement more and the subclassing is expected to invoke the superclass method

say all instance variables are 32-bit ints for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclassing adds 2 more then each instance of the subclassing will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instance variables plus 12 for the instance variables of the superclass

i expected it to pick subclassing s value since object won t be created for superclass as it is abstract

if you subclassing has less arguments than a superclass and you could make them optional in the superclass just add placeholders in the subclassing

there are tons of subclassing of a a tool generated the skeleton thus i want to create a superclass to make it easier for me to test

the superclass has a more stringent constraint on a property content blank false than the subclassing content nullable true and i am using tableperhierarchy false

for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing

no subclassing can be more accessible than its superclass

however they are not the same because the subclassing has more specific functions and data members that accomplish a more specific task that the superclass

furthermore since at least in java you can only have the access modifier for an overwritten method to allow more but not less access than the superclass method you are still gonna drag either protected member variables or protected getter and setter all the way up in your subclassing

most likely it ll still be tightly linked with implementations generally a bad thing or if not bad it s not especially good but i think a structure like this is better than a superclass figuring out what all of its subclassing are

however you can t use a superclass value where a subclassing is expected because the subclassing is more specific

superclass creates an user interface while subclassing should create a more specialized version

the general problem is that the subclassing is more specific than the superclass

use a singletable strategy and if you thing one of the subclassing has more number of fields and need a separate table then mark that subclassing as a secondarytable using secondarytable annotation and use primarykeyjoin there is an annotation for this to join with superclass on pk column

while it is a debated recommendation to favor composition over inherited my view is to ensure that an abstract-class devoid of abstract methods is not simply a convenient container for methods convenient to subclassing but instead that each subclassing could stand in for its superclass

more mathematically you can think of a class a set of all objects with some similar characteristic and then the subclassing surrounds the superclass and has even more characteristics

in other words if a subclassing is more accessible than its superclass then the access modifier of the superclass loses effect

if you are going for an inherited approach you should keep in mind that subclassing should be more specialized than their respective superclass

so what this says is that provided your subclassing doesn t have any more values than the superclass used to determine ordering implementing is reasonable

i noticed that often times i do not clearly know whether a superclass of a number of subclassing should be more general or more restricted regarding the attributes

it turns out as i now think i understand that whatever method is called on sc will be searched for in superclass at both compile-time and run-time unless subclassing has provided a better version of the method

when your instructor was talking about methods being overwritten i suspect they actually said overridden - where a subclassing can provide a more specific implementation of a method than a superclass or indeed may provide one where the superclass only has the abstract method declaration

i always think of it as b having more stuff in it then a subclassing often have more methods than superclass hence b gets the wide end of the arrow and a gets the pointy end

similarly as the subclassing gains more methods it inherited the list of superclass in the order in which they were named that precede it

in this case superclass is bigger than subclassing that s why the second statement is correct

this issue would make sense if it wasn t a constructor as if it were a regular func you could potentially pass in a type that is expected in the superclass but that has been overridden in the subclassing to be more restrictive

subclassing must allow more than the superclass not less and going from an argument being optional to not optional is allowing less

subclassing which implement more complex state should call the superclass s implementation and apply their state to the result if this basic state is to be saved

the fact that the subclassing is more selective only actually writes about what it writes is new functionality especially in light of the fact that the superclass promises nothing

whether one method s declared arguments are more specific than another subclassing are more specific than their superclass

problem being i have more than one subclassing to my superclass and many instances of each subclassing

however i don t want to reproduce these classes in every sub-project without a good reason and i can t see how subclassing would make anything better the superclass would still be against the 2.3.3 version of

first of all wouldn t that relate to it returning an object that is a superclass which contains less data than requested because a superclass is not a subclassing but a subclassing is a superclass

if you want to work your way from the top down especially if the subclassing selection depends on the choices made when constructing the superclass then it s probably much better to favor composition over inherited


uitabbaritem	uibaritem	1
uitabbaritem is a subclass of uibaritem everything is more painful because uibaritem doesn t subclass uiview


opengl-es	glreadpixels	3
however there is an even faster route on ios 5.0 to grab opengl-es content than glreadpixels which i describe in this answer

in your case you d grab a frame from the camera render that to an offscreen pbuffer then render the square with opengl-es onto the same pbuffer and then grab that with glreadpixels

take a look at the gpuimagefilter class for how i extract images from an opengl-es frame including a faster method using texture caches instead of glreadpixels


wav	opus	2
it is even slower since i could only upload wav which is way bigger in size compared with ogg and opus

now if you prefer wav over opus you could let the mediarecorder away and simply use the webaudioapi pass your gum stream to it and record the data from there


lxml	suds	1
but it s probably easier to at least use an xml lib such as lxml or a dedicated soap library such as suds to make this easier


vp8	ogg	1
i suspect this is because the encoding ogg mp4 vp8 are better suited to forward playback


universal-image-loader	fresco	1
you can choose between picasso vs fresco vs glide vs universal-image-loader


redhat	fedora	4
last version on ibm s website is from 2008 redhat enterprise 5.2 and fedora 9 - has anyone an experience running this ibm sdk on fedora 13 or at least any version higher than stated fedora 9 and is linux available of sufficient testing

for instance if user select redhat second combo box must show fedora linux and so on

gnu gdb fedora 6.8-37.el5 or gnu gdb gdb redhat enterprise linux 7.0.1-37.el5

from experience redhat are somewhat slower to approve new versions of packages than some other distributions so you might want to switch to the redhat-esque fedora or the debian-esque ubuntu which tend to update to newer versions more quickly


jmonkeyengine	ardor3d	2
for 3d i d recommend jmonkeyengine for netbeans or ardor3d for eclipse

for 3d gui s i recommend ardor3d or its parent jmonkeyengine


shapefile	geojson	3
shapefile beats geojson for large not mega data

i would recommend using geojson over shapefile and kml

it s much easier with a shapefile than a geojson as shapefile are much more common in gis software


tstringgrid	tlistview	1
i have just spent a lot of time working with tlistview in view style mode vsreport and i find it is even more limited than tstringgrid for example it provides no in-place edit support


verilog	hdl	2
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first

you seem to be compiling more than one hdl probably vhdl and verilog


many-to-many	one-to-many	4
iâ ve read a so questionâ s comment where inserting order# 68 as pictured wouldnâ t cause any trouble but if i wanted to query orders by certain tags a many-to-many is more appropriate convenient efficient since otherwise in a one-to-many every single order will have to be checked to know how its tags is this true

one-to-many and many-to-many relationships require more care since overuse of them can cause performance problems

first choose between one-to-many and many-to-many parent-child relationship

using two one-to-many associations is always better than relying on many-to-many relations


toolbar	tabs	3
i am trying to implements ads on the bottom of my screen someone told me i have to change the linearlayout to relativelayout but when i do that my toolbar somehow become smaller and the tabs begin to look strange.so i think there might be some things i need to change or add to the relativelayout that i do not know here is my linearlayout down here

however the tabs get a darker shade of orange while the toolbar doesn t

search to each tabs in more than one toolbar


strlen	strdup	4
you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally strdup is simpler since it doesn t require a separate malloc strlen call

because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s strdup then that s cleaner than strlen + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy


jquery	scriptaculous	8
it was working with scriptaculous before but we didn t decide to use that due to jquery working better for us and this is what worked before

jquery is light weight especially in compare with scriptaculous

i have used both prototype scriptaculous as well as jquery in many projects and based on what i am seeing it appears jquery has the more plug-in available so am leaning towards using jquery

i ve worked with jquery scriptaculous and mootools and i would highly recommend jquery which seems to trump a lot of the other frameworks in its ease of use

i also kind of get the impression that scriptaculous drag and drop is better than jquery ui drag and drop based on the online demos

i ended up using prototype scriptaculous which are better integrated with cakephp than jquery to manually do ajax using prototype s ajax functionality with cakephp s requesthandler to determine when to return ajax

scriptaculous can do what jquery provides plus more

i ended up using scriptaculous for most of my animations simply because it provides smoother animations and more configurable than what jquery ui provides


map	quadtree	1
note that a quadtree can be queried very quickly and efficiently but updates are a bit more costly that is if your items move a lot across your map this becomes more complicated to do with a good performance


nsis	uninstaller	1
can a nsis section create more than 1 uninstaller


git-merge	git-rebase	1
git-rebase creates a tidier history while git-merge back and forth may create a complex commit graph in the end


lwuit	lcdui	1
any j2me professionals please five suggestions on whether i should choose lcdui or lwuit


strlen	strcpy	9
furthermore all this strlen +1 -1 stuff is unnecessary and confusing prefer strncpy over memcpy and strcpy for strings and you don t need to deal with that

because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

a normal addition would be to include string.h and use strlen and strcpy or memcpy instead of a loop to find your length or copy characters to plural note for long strings memcpy will be more efficient but for 10 char -- it makes no difference let me know if you have any questions

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

if strcpy is anything like strcpy it will write one byte more than strlen returns to zero terminate the string

strcpy incoming connected will overwrite dataa and maybe datab if your first token pointed to by header is shorter than strlen connected

you must allocate one char more than the strlen for the terminating null character which will also be copied with strcpy

it s hard to guess whether this will really be slower or faster than using strcpy followed by strlen though

but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively


osql	bcp	1
is there a way to get sqlcmd around this limit or does anyone know if another program such as bcp or osql would make this easier


contourf	imshow	1
as an example of the second option i ll use imshow here because it makes more sense than contourf for random data but contourf would have identical usage other than the interpolation option.


git-rebase	amend	1
you can use an interactive git-rebase in stead of an amend and edit an earlier commit


fgets	fread	3
also as others have stated while i took too long to answer fread may be a better alternative since fgets won t necessarily read 10 chars

an alternative approach with getc fgets or fread seems better suited to you needs

note you re using fread fwrite - compare with fgets fputs for strings


kapacitor	metrics	2
kapacitor lets you define custom logic to process alerts with dynamic thresholds match metrics for patterns compute statistical anomalies etc

kapacitor lets you plug in your own custom logic or user defined functions to process alerts with dynamic thresholds match metrics for patterns or compute statistical anomalies


db4o	eloquera	1
i think that eloquera www.eloquera.com is better than db4o and additionally has better licensing


avcapturesession	avassetwriter	1
avcapturesession is far more rudimentary compared to avaudiorecorder - it does not provide any recording facilities by itself for example and so if you wanted to also record the audio you would need to use an avassetwriter to save the samples


fgets	realloc	2
whether you use realloc or a linked list of buffers it comes down to reading usually through fgets reading some more and so on until the buffer you ve just read contains a n

if you re not on a sufficiently posix-ish platform then you ll need to use fgets with checking to find whether you actually read a whole line â using realloc to allocate more space if your initial line isn t long enough


passenger	thin	4
memory optimizations - phusion passenger uses less memory than thin and unicorn

i personally prefer passenger over thin unicorn having run nginx to thin backends for a long while just for the convenience but your proposed setup is fairly standard

it compares thin unicorn passenger torquebox glassfish and trinidad

in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick


elm	purescript	1
okay so i m trying to build a 2d gaming engine in purescript over the html5 canvas context2d obviously purescript-canvas makes an excellent choice for this - i much prefer it over elm s graphics.canvas module as it maps so much more closely to the actual underlying js api and in particular gives me access to the individual pixels of the canvas


eigen	ublas	2
choose eigen if you care the performance and performance gain introduced by expression templates and choose ublas if you only want to learn expression templates

from my own experience mtl4 is much faster than ublas and it is also faster than eigen


eurekalog	madexcept	2
how would you compare madexcept to eurekalog as an exception handler for your delphi application

if you want my advice i recommend madexcept rather than eurekalog


readonly	temporary	2
when an ie user clicks the link of a file residing in sharepoint and user selects readonly access the file is copied to temporary internet files my application is opened and passed that filename as a parameter

is it good idea to make serializer private static readonly to avoid spawning hundreds of temporary objects is it more faster than i did


gentoo	linux	2
update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd

if you want to learn linux for real i recommend gentoo


boost	blitz++	1
there is speed comparison too click compare blitz++ armadillo boost multiarray


qregularexpression	qregexp	1
qregularexpression and i m much more familiar with qregexp


richtextbox	textblock	1
good advice but in the end i decided a bindable textblock was more useful and simpler than a richtextbox


ftp	smb	2
ftp and smb will be more complicated to setup this way because of the different ports used and they way they are used etc

push log files to a central location ftp is faster than smb the windows ftp command can be automated with -s scriptfile


saas	iaas	2
more sophisticated distinctions between iaas paas and saas are also described in quite a few topics here on stackoverflow for instance in what is saas paas and iaas

if you prefer using iaas and not saas you can run artifactory on aws azure or google cloud platform with bitnami


strtol	getchar	1
in general i find it better to use fgets than scanf getchar alternatively if you are using c99 gets_s -- although i still prefer fgets for maximum portability to older compiler environments for all user-based input then if necessary use sscanf strtol and the like to convert the string into other data types as this will read data by line in a way that is buffer-safe and you won t have to worry about things left in the input buffer


jvisualvm	jstat	1
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable


domcontentloaded	onload	1
sometimes it s preferable because onload event takes longer to fire then domcontentloaded


picasso	android-query	3
android-query is better than picasso because while in offline mode no internet connectivity picasso tries to fetch record form server whereas android-query maintains its cache form where it fetched the images

i have tried doing this with picasso image loader and it worked but i prefer android-query and i need to resolve this issue

if picasso doesn t satisfy you for any reason you can also try android-query which does much more than picasso it s not only for images but the same rules apply


notepad++	sublimetext	7
compare with notepad++ and sublimetext

i prefer sublimetext 2 but notepad++ or scite might suit you better

after few search i decided to pick sublimetext 2 for sass haml support and get rid of my old notepad++

sublimetext is decent i prefer notepad++ and brackets for development

get aquinted with some good text editor like sublimetext text2 or notepad++ hardcore programmers will recommend vim or emacs - don t listen to them yet

i prefer sublimetext because it s a little more customizable than notepad++ but they re both great options and lighter than dreamweaver

notepad++ which is often recommended are even more broken than sublimetext 2 which i find to be pretty good actually


mbunit	nunit	10
i would also recommend mbunit which has all of nunit s features along with some good support for the integration tests that you will probably be writing by accident as you are starting out with testing

why should i prefer mbunit over nunit or vice-versa

nunit is more popular because it was there first therefore more articles about it on the web and better tooling and because most programmers don t care about or need the advanced features that mbunit offers

nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it

mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests

even though nunit now includes the most popular mbunit advanced features mbunit is still more feature-rich for example

what i ended up discovering is that out of the box nunit offered more options and plug-ins such as pnunit for parallel testing and another plug-in for performance testing where xunit mbunit lacked all or some of these features

i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

i found light weight xunit.net mbunit or nunit to be far better suited for unit testing

from what i have read on here i here that nunit is more popular over mbunit


ord	toupper	1
i tried solving it using the chr and ord functions but ord s signature is chars - int and not chars - int so it doesn t match with toupper and tolower s


webchromeclient	webviewclient	3
note that you re using to different clients webviewclient and the webchromeclient you need to know the difference between them the main difference is that the webviewclient is more configurable

to sum up the webchromeclient is easier to use but the webviewclient allows you more configuration

my observation is that you get the webpage title using webchromeclient in lesser time than using webviewclient

the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup and error

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

pdfminer	pdfrw	1
if you really want to deeply examine text pdf files pdfminer might be more useful -- pdfrw has not yet really grown the tools to do that too well


countif	named	1
the roundabout method i ve employed is to create additional columns with a regular countif and counta formulae - in other words i count the number of countries a named has visited more than x times countif and then use the counta to sum the number of named in that column who have visited x times


udp	tcp	347
you could probably also configure snmp to run over tcp instead of udp which makes tunneling easier

i know that udp is connectionless protocol and tcp may be a better option but i have to use udp as the client side sends the packets over udp

my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can gurantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet

i think it s related to the specific router implementation because on one hand if a udp packet disappears then both sides probably know it might happen and can afford to lose a packet or two but on the other hand if a tcp packet disappears then by it s fail-safe mechanism it will send another and the problem is solved and tcp packet is much heavier

what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp

only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp

i have a file that i need to transmit through udp reliably i know tcp is the better option

if you could discard any data that came through then you wouldn t waste the bandwidth resending the lost packets in tcp and udp would be a more natural choice but since you care about bandwidth i m guessing that thats not the case

the key question was related to what kind of situations would udp be the better choice over tcp

tcp has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so tcp is much slower than udp

it makes more sense to compare tcp vs udp vs other transport layer protocols -- and http vs ftp vs other application layer protocols

i m working on a game and want the freedom to choose between udp and tcp connections in the future when i decide to add multiplayer

http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses udp providing arguably faster reliable communication than tcp

is there a way to have tcp act more like udp

i know that it uses a custom http based application layer protocol so one might think its tcp but on the other hand it is a broadcast application so udp would be more logical to me

for some requirements tcp is better for some udp

also has nothing to do with whether you choose tcp udp of file

normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but udp s knottier than tcp the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways

i find using tcp to be very reliable and it can also be very fast if the traffic is stream like meaning mostly unidirectional additionally building a message framer on top of tcp is much easier than building tcp on top of udp

udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

while you could use either tcp or udp i think you ll find udp gives better performance

if there is no parent child relationship consider named pipes made with mkfifo 3 or af_unix sockets see unix 7 and scoket 2 .... which are bidirectional af_unix sockets are much faster than tcp ip or udp ip on the same machine

udp protocol is unreliable but much much faster than tcp which is most commonly used for communication

about tcp udp tcp is typically slower but more reliable so by default go for tcp but there might be reasons for choosing udp like streaming multicast broadcast .

http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as their network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads

for video streaming i would recommend using udp instead of tcp as it has less overhead and packet confirmation is usually not needed as the retransmited data would already be obsolete

you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp

why would i choose udp over tcp for a serious high-performance server with the added overhead of message

in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

with udp there is no definite way of knowing whether the packet reached its destination or not compare with tcp which sends ack packets to let the sender know its packet was received

it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

i know that tcp would work better for this but i have to use udp

please note however that this architecture implements tcp which is much slower than udp and will not work for any type of fast-paced data intensive games but should accomplish your goals given your description above

in a congested network yes udp will send its packets faster than tcp this is because tcp takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control

i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to tcp which by itself is slower than udp ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or udp would be ideal to implement such a server

udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency

hello to all i am developing an application that needs to send a image via the udp socket.i know that tcp is a better protocol but playing with kryonet in java i have learnt that udp is better for this type of application.i have this small class that i have made

the mtu is closer to 1500 and this applies to tcp not udp

now imagine writing lots of small packets across a network udp may cause congestion whereas tcp is better controlled

tcp is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails it s more likely that udp will get through

udp communication is connection less as compared to tcp which need a connection

for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum

if you can t afford lost packets then tcp is probably a better option than udp since it provides that guarantee out of the box

thus if the user select udp at first but call settcp i have to determine whether to actually call the function in class tcp or not

1 tcp is connection oriented and reliable where as udp is connection less and unreliable

note i m currently learning udp and how effective a voip system would be in comparison with a tcp system i ve already done tcp so please no one comment tcp is better etc

if you can do everything with udp it is lighter than tcp

i am currently writing a server for a fast paced multiplayer game which should be run in udp i read tcp was inappropriate due to the way it handles packet drops in applications requiring timely delivered data please correct me if tcp is more useful the game is not mass multiplayer and should be hosted primarily by the players themselves probably on local dedicated servers

if the network between the two point have a very high quality udp is absolutely faster than tcp but in some other case such as the gprs network tcp may been faster and more reliability than udp

or is there any specific scenario where udp is better than tcp

udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient

udp might be faster than tcp but it doesn t have the error detection and correction you are going to need in order to have a safe transfer of data

because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp

tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability

tcp will wait for more data for a short period of time and send it together in a single packet where udp will send each individual datagram

udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with

this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp

tcp performance was always lower than the best udp and its performance varied wildly by over 600 depending upon the os

tcp sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than udp cumbersome to setup for web based solutions

so if the average udp packets were smaller than the average tcp packets then the cpu will be maxed out at a smaller number of bits-per-second with udp than with tcp

udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag

i don t think so because tcp basically simulates a stream by breaking up your data into smaller packets and sending it while in udp you have more control over the whole process

since loosing some packets doesn t matter but speed latency is crucial udp is much better than tcp

udp sockets are much simpler then tcp ones

the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

tldr tcp ip is more reliable than udp but not a 100 iron-clad guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong

i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp

tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable

for a simple installation tcp will be faster and simpler than trying to implement your own reliable udp

no sw is running on responder side - allows much lower latency 10 times less than typical tcp udp latency

any byte other than 0xff will introduce a start bit into a serial channel and a missing byte in the tcp udp implementations is even less likely

tcp is very much analogous to a phone call whereas udp is more like mailboxes

in your case i would personnally choose tcp because you will probably end up reimplementing tcp in some form inside of your udp packets otherwise ask for block syn answer i have block syn ack ok send it to me ack ...data push ack .

you can possibly achieve slightly really marginally higher throughput with udp but then you have the hassle of recreating all the goodies tcp gives you for free

that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp

i want to write a server tcp or udp which performs more than one task while listening to more than one port

mostly it looks like tcp would be the correct way for this project since it is a question about reliable communication but i have been thinking about the steps to bind the connection in tcp and udp and there i would prefer udp but then having a protocol like dccp using acknowledgement to make sure that no packets are lost

for fps games or other games where network speed is essential you ll probably want a udp connection seeing how it doesn t have the same level of network package verification as tcp making it faster and then write your own protocol on top of it to ensure packet validity to achieve maximum connection speed

you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp

that is yet another reason to prefer tcp ip over udp for network monitoring imo

still i prefer tcp over udp for these reasons especially reliability

it is worth nothing that in a link where udp and tcp are sharing the bandwidth tcp is better behaved than udp in that it will try to limit itself to avoid congestion

if not - i would recommend using tcp until proved an extra performance gain is required and only then consider moving to udp

when i have to pick between tcp and udp i make the decision more on how i want my networking logic to flow

even the tcp extensions to the ice specification note that tcp connections are much less likely to succeed than udp connections between natted peers

with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features

is sending packets via an established tcp connection after all hand shaking has been done a method to be faster than udp

if making a tcp connection is analogous to making telephone call then sending a udp packet is more like mailing a letter

udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp

to be trying to implement them using different protocols tcp and udp is even odder h323 voip is the only applciation i know of which does this

generally speaking udp has less overhead than tcp allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context

+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

the fact is not all routers support this scenario and always require port forwarding for udp traffic tcp traffic is easier because there is an on-going connection the router can maintain with the client

udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability

i ve considered that udp is more suitable for sending a series of discrete data sets but i need the reliability of tcp

for a game which require quick continous updates udp might be better but i have always gone with tcp

so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp

for example computer b is connected to computer a via internet connection sharing i use my program to limit computer b s download or upload speed to 120kbs or any number i choose with this i would also like to choose udp or tcp

if i use socket which protocol should i choose tcp or udp

in general the tcp protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the udp protocol

also - read more about the protocols tcp udp sockets ethernet the more you read - the better

we propose to use udp over tcp since udp is faster than tcp

i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp

this actually happens more commonly with tcp connections but i see no reason udp can t have this problem as well

keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp

see what happens when tcp udp server is publishing faster than client is consuming

which protocol tcp udp is more common to use in a p2p design

like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

the first possible issue i can think of is that because udp doesn t have the overhead inherent in the transmission control that tcp does udp has higher data bandwidth and lower latency

udp is more of a fire and forget whereas tcp maintains a connection state

udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .

here is what i am thinking tcp is supposed to be reliable transmission but slow whereas udp is does not provide a guarantee of packet transmission like tcp but is faster than tcp

minimum bandwidth use tcp will add more header bytes to the actual message then udp as tcp is connect kind of communication socket type and also has internal check-sum

this is a noob question but how do i allow a user this option to choose tcp or udp protocols

the speed for tcp in comparison with udp is slower

it mean what should i choose between tcp and udp well there s a fair difference between tcp and udp connections you usually use udp connectionless when you have peformance issues like voip apps real time games video chat and so on while in onther cases you use tcp so in your case tcp should suit you good

in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp

i m more familiar with tcp udp sockets and so this looks very similar to af_inet type of socket s ip_add_membership socket option.

the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks

some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

the downsides are that it is unreliable messages can be dropped or corrupted therefore you may want to add some safety and that some isp may restrict udp more than tcp test yourself to be sure but usually there is no problems

this is one of the trickier differences between tcp and udp

my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can guarantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet

instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp

udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp

try to increase timeout value tcp is slower than udp

as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead

udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size

as such traversing a nat through udp is much easier than tcp

i am using udp because it is much faster than tcp but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use tcp at all so i am sending ack packets

then you have to choose between udp and tcp

udp is much faster then tcp but tcp has flow control and guaranteed delivery

the main difference is that tcp packets include extra protocol information whereas udp are simpler packets with just a destination the data itself and a checksum

because of tcp requires connection and provides security it is slower than udp and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming

actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .

note that there are exceptions to the above - for example tcp generally traverses firewalls better than udp which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over tcp for part of its journey at least

i m trying to avoid tcpclient because udp is faster but would this work in tcp since it s streamed

note i am using udp for this just because i want to learn it and i know tcp can be better for things like a chat

when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept

short answer if you can tolerance with any packet loss udp is better otherwise tcp

i would recommend against taking this decision lightly it s a good deal more complex than tcp udp amqp etc

tcp is but udp is faster

use socket for tcp and datagram for udp its a lot faster than tcp but less connection oriented

of course tcp would be the better choice but if you only have udp option i d wrap the data into a structure with sequence and buf_length field

but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads

with regard to using send versus sendto i have found that sendto is used more commonly with udp and send with tcp sockets

tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some

you will notice that the tcp header has more fields than the udp header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake

tcp udp are lower level protocols in the osi model than http https

but with the udp protocol in particular this is easier than for tcp

it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp

maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my udp transmission is slower than tcp

2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not

i ve been messing around with different ways of implementing this and would like a bit of advice on whether tcp or udp is a better protocol to implement the communication between client and server

udp has a much lower overhead than tcp

btw i believe that in some weird cases you might get 0 as the number of bytes returned by write a non-blocking pipe or socket - but that is generally the eagain error - or some weird socket there are more than tcp or udp sockets

on the foundation you have either udp which is unreliable but incurs almost no overhead but very well suited for broadcasts and tcp which is more reliable therefore has more overhead but is easier to use

to be honest i prefer to use tcp but if udp works better then i have to use udp

on most embedded systems i ve worked with using tcp several different stacks udp is lighter-weight outperforms tcp in terms of code size throughput

tcp is reliable but slower than udp while udp is not safe and i have to implement my own fault-handling codes

are all packets the same to the hardware tcp udp or does an idle tcp connection take up more resources in any measurable way other than packet size

we know tcp is better suited for this but the hardware development decided it s got to be udp

as far as i know the two most prominent solutions in the transport layer are tcp and udp with tcp offering more reliable transfer with a cost on time and udp sacrificing reliability for speed

it s said to be better than udp or tcp for communicating by processes in the same os windows xp here

apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse

tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is

isn t udp working faster than tcp usually

as far as tcp goes i think tcp is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity udp tolerates packet loss to lower latency

i though that udp was faster than tcp but do you think that tcp will be faster due to the congestion

i know tcp is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use udp and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do

udp will outperform tcp substantially if the nature of the network is stable and remains stable

i read in a case where a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

fast way - tsunami udp it seems that udp protocols are much faster compared to tcp protocals like scp ftp etc

i assumend that the transmission using udp have to be much faster than using tcp but in fact my tests proved that the udp transmission is about 7 to 8 times slower than using tcp

also remember that dns requests can use tcp if the request or response would need more than 1 udp packet

for a service which just returns a small number when queried such as 30 or 10 but would have to handle up to 5 or so requests at any instance would tcp or udp be a better protocol

also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management

i know that udp would be much faster but it needs to be reliable at the same time hence i m looking for tcp

tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp

for example if the data needs reliability it will create a socket with sock_stream so it will select tcp otherwise if it doesn t need any reliability i will use sock_dgram for udp

udp is a connectionless protocol which has zero error-checking it is that is the trade-off with tcp it is faster than tcp

at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too

-- in which scenario configuration would i get udp to perform better than tcp

tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling

because tcp has its own flow control i choose udp

moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp

any sort of reverse proxing of tcp udp connections is more scalable at a lower osi level ie layer 3 or layer 2 instead of layer 6 7 as nginx is operating at

i ve read in the past that having udp mixed in with tcp causes udp to drop far more often and tcp to slow down just the same

the reason i asking this is because i read tcp is slower than udp because tcp ensures order of packets

real-time interactions like video chat prefer udp connections over tcp connections because dropped packets over udp will not result in a wait for retransmissions

this is a good resource to compare udp and tcp

udp is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than tcp

what is that key feature in tcp that makes it have much much higher throughput than udp

if the query itself and the response are small a few bytes consider using udp instead of tcp it s faster and you can use lower values of sendinterval

the communication between the android app and the pc can rely on a simple tcp socket udp is also a valid option but if you begin in network programming tcp is probably easier to handle and more widely used

tcp is slower than udp and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer

i know tcp includes flow control which makes it friendlier to other services on the network but if i m a selfish bastard who could give a damn about everybody else and want my app to be as fast as possible wouldn t i choose udp in every case

theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control

tcp is way better then udp for that

udp makes sense if you want to make your stream multicast otherwise i would prefer tcp because it is more reliable

so both can use quic instead of tcp and it s usually faster than tcp hence the name which sounds like quick and is an acronym of quick udp internet connections

socket tcp udp uploading is slower than native windows copy when there are more than 1 clients

i d prefer tcp but udp or anything else that will actually send receive data will work as long as it is compatible with coder

udp port scanning is possible but it is harder than tcp scanning

a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack

if you were attempting to beat the performance of tcp by shifting to udp keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with tcp is because tcp tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you

there are a number of reasons to build such a protocol - nat evasion using udp hole punching finer control over congestion control algorithm selection or simply avoiding tcp s message reordering when the order in which messages are received is not important this can help reduce latency

tcp has built in retries and other things so you dont lose reliability with udp directly it is what you do with it that could compare

you have to choose between udp or tcp

tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted

if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time tcp is only slightly worse than udp

in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp

it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp

if you re looking to build it from the ground up i would recommend using udp rather than tcp because the messaging is lightweight and it is trivial to implement automatic peer discovery using udp broadcast if needed

and wikipedia says that snmp can be run over tcp ip but udp is more common

udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day

udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt

tcp - more reliable than udp but this comes with some overhead there is a distinct connection a better match for games which require less frequent data transmission such as turn based games as is your game

in a native application i would use udp for the most data player position ... because it s way faster than tcp and it s uncritical when it is lost

whereas for udp sockets you won t need listen accept and connect methods as tcp sockets are connection-oriented sockets while udp sockets are connection less sockets

first of udp s datagram is simpler than tcp s one

if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in udp will always be better than tcp

udp is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than tcp

note that udp is more difficult to work with than tcp because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered

i think udp will perform better than tcp gcdasyncsocket in your case video transfer

sockets can work as could udp multicast careful there though no way to know if a message was missed which is why tcp sockets are safer

udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp

but when i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp for 10mb of data

as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services

it mean what should i choose between tcp and udp

getting much more information is needed in the packet header for connection less like udp but why the header size of udp is less than tcp

as ip is another protocol in this model at network layer i think you mean to compare tcp and udp as they both belong to same layer transport layer

if there are two parts then you can compare with tcp or udp to see if the first part is the protocol or the server

this was surprising for me as i expected udp to perform better than tcp

certainly tcp has more overhead than udp

also for tcp udp portability is much better

udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged

tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations

i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp

the reason to prefer udp over tcp is that for some applications neither data ordering nor data completeness matter

while udp has less network overhead than tcp it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.

also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and it does not require any connections

which out of udp and tcp would be easier to implement and maintain on a basic level for a beginner looking to get a grasp and experiement some

these are situations where udp is good but in most other situations tcp is better

in fact i recently did a study testing this and it found that snmp over udp succeeded far better than snmp over tcp in lossy networks when the udp timeout was set properly

these effects are exactly why gamedevs often prefer udp over tcp

i also like having the option to choose between tcp and udp

would it make tcp act more like udp if you only ever sent really small discrete packets and did all the ordering reordering stuff yourself on the other end

either the tcp or udp protocols could be used to achieve this although tcp is probably easier

udp is extremely faster than tcp which is suitable to stream a user s voice input

and choose tcp udp

udp is actually expected to work better than tcp in lossy networks or congested networks

if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not

don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong

with tcp this problem doesn t exist but i prefer udp

also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of udp that performs worse than tcp

if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something udp based could be better than tcp but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones

i know tcp is better to send file but i have a homework about sending file via udp protocol

if you are using linux check out netdiscover this uses arp i think arp is lower level than tcp udp and with java you can only create apps from tcp udp and above

i know that in practice this would only happen with a great amount of connection given that processing time of an udp connection is faster than tcp but it could potentially happen

would tcp or udp be more appropriate for requests

see this reply what happens when tcp udp server is publishing faster than client is consuming

tcp ip is supposed to be more reliable than udp ip see this comparison

but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp

udp is significantly easier do you really need tcp btw

the fact that udp s header size is less than tcp s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it

udp is faster than tcp because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order

4 tcp is a slower than udp

and udp is going to present you with some difficult-to-resolve challenges firewalls that block incoming udp packets dropped udp packets packets received out-of-order maximum-packet-size limitations etc so i recommend tcp unless you have a really good reason why you can t use it

the problem with using tcp is obviously that it is a lot slower than udp

i did some research and found that udp may be more suitable in this case because udp hole punching works much better than tcp hole punching

udp is connection less but at the same level as tcp

if they select tcp or udp from the combobox the url string

in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

i am making a network chat server and client in java that runs over udp using datagramsockets even though stream over tcp would make much more sense

tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work

most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability

in practice this means that tcp is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight udp can be used when reliability isn t important

in my loadbalancing service i have port forwarding on udp 7777 though healthprobes are on tcp there is no option to select udp i don t know if that mnatter

udp is unreliable and tcp is more than adequate in sending 1000 s per second

udp is not always faster than tcp

to answer the meat of your question why udp in kademlia i don t think that the spec actually explains why to udp or not to use tcp therefor i don t think there is an authoritative answer but my guess is that the authors are were of the opinion that building onto udp would add more flexibility than attempting to stretch tcp into a direction that it specifically wasn t designed for

instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp

yes udp is much much lighter than tcp

i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp average 65 better

the main reason people would choose udp rudp over tcp is because of how tcp handles out of order packets

regarding udp tcp http i would choose tcp

for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss

a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented

and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp

i was going to use reliable udp but tcp seems more appropriate

hence as compared to tcp udp is more attractive for delay-sensitive applications like audio video

c++ is not my first language and this is small part of code i can t figure out i ve chosen udp because it is always much simpler than tcp

what tcp buys you over udp among other things is the stack s ability to just have to resend one fragment if it gets lost or hosed somehow

udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff

my aim is to send live data through udp would be a better option for this but thought it could also be done with tcp with a good connection

for instance zeromq can leverage udp multicast to run faster than any tcp protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api

tcp is faster for when using a few connections the important difference is that modern nics perform significant amounts of acceleration on tcp and not really that much for udp

udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability

i was wondering if this is the best way and if it is whether udp or tcp would be better

i have a working script to stream over tcp but i understand that udp is the better option for video streaming however i m not really sure how to do it

udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster

i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that udp is slower than tcp

one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data

-- does udp always perform better than tcp

tcp is a bit slower than udp but more failsafe

don t reinvent the wheel and choose between udp and tcp until you re completely sure you need something more sophisticated but not simpler

you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from udp - tcp it s actually a lot simpler than doing udp - udp

choose tcp or udp

udp is quicker than tcp but if you re using quickfix you ll be using tcp

there are many other topics like whether to choose udp tcp ip-multicast broadcast and so on.

from experience i can tell you udp is about 10-15 faster than tcp on dedicated and udp-tuned networks

does udp always perform better than tcp

webrtc prefers udp connections but can also fall back to tcp connections

one often finds the argument that udp is faster then tcp

this test also serves to compare udp and tcp for possible networking solutions

in gaming especially fpss udp tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than tcp

i would also like to ask would using a udp or tcp server be better for this type of situation

i know udp is faster than tcp for various reason

for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client tcp will not perform any better than udp

if i d directly say that udp is faster comparatively than tcp that it is used for such applications

btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case

why the header size of udp is less than tcp

tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive

udp is faster and requires less bandwidth than tcp

this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that udp performs better than tcp

tcp is slower assures data arrival udp is faster data corruption may be possible

if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for tcp but tcp has more overhead than udp

so tcp wins out over udp hands down for mobile devices

the skype protocol prefers udp where possible and falls back to tcp

it can be done to beat tcp for stream transfer using udp if you don t have nat to think about

tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again

i have guessed udp would be faster than tcp due to tcp s three-way handshake scheme but are there any other considerations which need to be made

the decision on yours the tcp protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than udp

udp scales better than tcp because of reduced states that need to be maintained in the operating system

scenario where udp is better than tcp

there is a perception that udp is faster than tcp but i think it depends on the situation - take a look at this discussion for some further discussion on speed reliability etc between udp and tcp go down through all the high scored answers

also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp

i would like to change it so you can send files however udp does not support this and tcp is slower than tcp

i m aware of the differences in general the facts like tcp is more accurate while udp is more fast

with a cable that can hold c packets s and tcp at a rate of c packets s and udp at a rate of 8 c packets s udp would be much faster

the package is bigger than udp s package but smaller than tcp s package

so usually the throughput measured by udp should be higher than that from tcp although the difference should be small 5 -10

udp suits well for passing short messages but for transferring large amounts of data tcp is more preferable

alternatively it can be used over udp which is less hungry than tcp


pascal	delphi	16
ps i prefer delphi pascal but tutorials in any language are welcome

if you prefer tp delphi dialect free pascal is the better choice

since you re specifically designing a database for a delphi app you might want to choose pascal style instead so that the source code doesn t mix different styles

languages that can be compiled in a single pass eg pascal derivatives like delphi compile far quicker 10 6 loc in seconds

from my pov the object pascal paradigm used with fpc object pascal dialect which can coexist with the default object pascal code is more advanced lightweight and integrated than the interface-based plumbing of delphi xe2 compiler with on-the-fly marshalling using rtti

pascal and also delphi is more centered on readability than the c syntax languages which are more centered on character power as much information per character as possible

my other option currently is to learn pascal and buy delphi

in free and turbo pascal file handling is much more easier than in delphi in pascal we have assign instead of assignfile and close instead of closefile

there is the mono project that aims to allow .net code to run on mac and linux but between the two delphi being pascal is somewhat more portable

i know object pascal delphi lazarus more or less but absolutely zero in anything networking-related and these platforms seem absolutely inadequate for the server

you probably don t want to go back to anything earlier than delphi 3 but some pascal programming books can be helpful

i have large amounts of pascal code that i need to compile into android applications and i would like to know how to make delphi generate more efficient code

while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there

for my application i need to create a dll from delphi to be more precise delphi compatible code written within lazarus ide compiled by free pascal under linux using stdcall

delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable

i prefer delphi pascal but i can read other languages if the example isn t overly complex


jmeter	soapui	6
i can recommend soapui or the jmeter application

soapui is also capable for performance testing but for higher workload i recommend jmeter

speaking from personal experience i have found jmeter to be more reliable for performance testing ws than soapui

i have found jmeter to be more reliable than soapui or loadui

testers also could check services using tools such as jmeter soapui they check more things related to the business logic

actually it is much better than soapui because with jmeter you can easily read the data from csv and parameterize it


pow	math.h	1
note if we replace math.h by cmath the program does not compile with a warning of ambiguous call to pow seems a better condition


bluej	greenfoot	1
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old


a-star	dijkstra	1
my question is how does a-star compare with dijkstra


uimanageddocument	nspersistentdocument	1
unfortunately the sample apps are not based on uimanageddocument or nspersistentdocument but if you look at the way they handle backup files you could probably use that approach to create a document based app with less hassle than using uimanageddocument


ati	nvidia	19
there is almost always some driver issue between them but in general nvidia is better for opengl has bugs in directx implementation and ati amd versions only is better for directx has bugs in opengl implementation

are there any third-party reports that compare ati s stream framework to nvidia s cuda framework ie not from ati or nvidia talking themselves up

nvidia is more permissive for example nvidia lets you cast wrongly ie float4 to float only making it a warning ati won t error

for example i ve noticed nvidia s glsl compiler is a little more picky than ati s and rejects some shader code that otherwise works fine

another big plus to this approach is that nvidia ati can release a newer more efficient version of their drivers and you automatically benefit with no effort on your part

i m having an issue where my glsl 130 code wont run properly on my somewhat modern ati 5850 hardware while the identical code runs perfectly fine on an older laptop with a nvidia card i have

a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this

nvidia provide much better driver support in linux than ati do

nvidia and ati architectures differ enough so that for certain tasks such as bitcoin mining ati is vastly better than nvidia

the development tools a debugger and a profiler plus an entire online development community that come for free with the nvidia sdk are way more useful than anything that comes with the ati stuff

just counting question tags on this forum cuda outperforms opencl 3 1 and nvidia outperforms ati 15 1 and there s no tag for ati-stream at all

another reason to choose nvidia is because that s what the hpc system builders have been building systems with since nvidia made a huge push for gpgpu computing where as it s less backed by amd ati

more useful with nvidia than ati for example

ati might be a better between nvidia and ati since it was reportedly faster in 2009 but i m not sure if those stats are still correct

i decided on nvidia for a couple of reasons while ati might be faster on paper nvidia has a more mature platform and more documentation so it will be possible to get closer to the peak performance on this platform

the reason i ask is that it seems like nvidia has way better tools and ati seems to have cancelled rendermonkey

for example on ati cards you ll want to manually vectorize code using float4 int4 data types or accept a nearly 4x performance penalty while nvidia works better with scalar data types

4 is nvidia cuda technology is easier more flexible than ati brook+ language

ati seems to tell more than nvidia


imageview	picasso	1
i would recommend using picasso to load images into your imageview


vaadin	smartgwt	1
thus i think vaadin is more suitable for intranet and takes less time to develop your app while smartgwt is better for more complex gui or unstable connections where additional roundtrips matter


slider	fotorama	2
the problem is that lightbox2 is showing only up to 3 images in popup....even if in fotorama slider there are more images

call to instagram on success of which you call fotogram to initialize your slider but the problem is that since you re loading many images fotorama initialization gets run more than once on each success .after first initialization any further attempt would only mess up the slider.note that if you put it outside 2 foreach that wouldn t work either because at this point even the first request would be in pending state


opera	firefox	77
answers in opera was checking browser support for my page and wanted to search some stuff up. i don t get this message in my default browser google-chrome nor in internet explorer or firefox

worse than opera and firefox on the desktop as well

why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

i already tested it and it doesn t match with opera google-chrome firefox or safari mobile

you may prefer firefox opera safari because it s safer technologically superior or whatever but you may lose several users that way remember firefox has only recently reached 20 of usage share

my site displays just like in need in ie and opera but in firefox i can t get via css to have font sizes smaller than firefox default minimum-font-size

there are some browser compatibility issues but according to this post the guy says that it is compatible with ie 7 ie8 ie9 pr3 firefox 3.0 firefox 3.5 firefox 3.6 firefox 4b1 saf 4.0 win saf 5.0 win google-chrome 4 google-chrome 5 opera 10.10 opera 10.53 and opera 10.60

when using a font declaration of arial firefox and ie11 show relatively huge variations while google-chrome and opera show smaller variations.

google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum

to my surprise firefox managed to remember that password but still i prefer opera

on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome

the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

i do it with firefox opera but i prefer firefox because of firebug

much better than opera firefox and google-chrome

in ie opera and firefox it looks much better because aa is used which is still clearly visible but not that bad

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

all major desktop browsers win ie mac win safari mac win google-chrome win opera mac win firefox

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

we recommend using firefox google-chrome opera etc

we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

click ok select firefox if it exists and remove it then check opera and click ok

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

firefox and opera unfortunately fires many more keypress events than others ie and webkit which have the most sensible implementation the one the w3c is about to standardize in dom 3 events afaict but in that case getcharcode is 0 so you can safely ignore them

i did one design which works for opera win firefox win + mac ie9 safari win mac ipad google-chrome win

i have this working fine in google-chrome osx win firefox osx win safari opera osx

it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera

i ve checked the site on two machines vista with firefox ie6 ie7 ie8 safari win opera win

safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

mozila firefox and opera works smoother

only firefox and opera seem to have this issue opera even worse than firefox but i don t care that much about opera

try to click on the div in google-chrome ie firefox and then compare with opera

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera

i have validated the html and the same page tests fine in ie9 win firefox win and opera win

i m using dinnextltpro-medium font on this site and noticed quite a difference on the rendering between safari 6 google-chrome mac and the rest of the world safari 5 mac win google-chrome win firefox win opera win...

apparently opera ie and firefox works better with

i prefer google-chrome or firefox and i know a few people who swear by opera

browsers firefox win osx google-chrome win osx ie win safari osx ios opera osx

look every browser like mozilla firefox google-chrome opera have thier own design for modal window

for example in the classic browser share example if the firefox is at 45 i want to be rendered inside the pie distance -40 may be and where the slice is less such as opera at 6 - i want it to be shown outside with a connector

i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky

in opera it goes little bit lower than in firefox

ie 7 ie8 ie9 pr3 firefox 3.0 firefox 3.5 firefox 3.6 firefox 4b1 saf 4.0 win saf 5.0 win google-chrome 4 google-chrome 5 opera 10.10 opera 10.53 and opera 10.60

i have the problem in firefox 3.6.13 and have tested against current versions of safari win google-chrome opera and ie where the code all works perfectly

for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox

using any other browser google-chrome firefox and opera it s much quicker

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

firefox has even fewer as far as i know and opera has none

firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

even if you manage to mimic google-chrome s behavior it will probably not match firefox opera or even the next version of google-chrome

i test on win google-chrome and don t know how it works on safari firefox ie opera

i have used some css hacks to get the position pixel perfect on firefox ie 7 8 9 and 10 win google-chrome opera and safari however on mac google-chrome and mac safari it is a few pixels out

most of opera s features are eventually available copied to firefox as plugins but i still prefer opera at home because the text looks better

i am currently testing using various versions of firefox ie opera safari for win google-chrome on winxp and winvista

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

the second happened when you remove everything and starting type and hit enter different browsers behavior very differently google-chrome insert very first line as a just text node of contenteditable container and than put every new line into div opera 12.12 handle it better and it never allows remove last div node ie9-10 starting jump around and after you started again uses p tags instead of div that s not even such a disaster just inconsistency but yet the firefox is not yet even trying to change it s br behavior

i m not sure if google-chrome has the same features but if you don t have firefox or just like google-chrome better then pressing f12 will open developer tools same as in opera and internet explorer although i personally prefer firefox with firebug plugin

i d support both ie still has a big chunk of the user space with firefox and others opera safari etc.. occupying a smaller percentage of the browser market

update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd

incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox

the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

you should find opera matches firefox behaviour as does ie

but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch firefox â time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

the downside is that you cannot use it for browsers older than ie11 firefox 31 esr safari 7.1 ios 7 konqueror all versions and opera all versions

i could use the google-chrome firefox opera driver i prefer google-chrome

but on all of the mobile browsers i ve tried firefox google-chrome opera it s much smaller around 25 of the size specified

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

everything works correctly for me in safari 6.0.2 firefox 18.0.2 mac firefox 10.0.1 win opera 12.12 mac and ie 9

firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

you can use font-weight 100 or lighter this is working with opera 16 and older but i do not know why the h1 tags in firefox are bolder sorry

i think it doesn t work entirely correctly in ie6 but it is fine in ie7-8 firefox safari win opera google-chrome

in fact i ran some tests at dhtml kitchen and found that in firefox opera and google-chrome document.write was actually faster on the first load and comparable in speed of standard html on subsequent refreshes


tolower	ord	1
i tried solving it using the chr and ord functions but ord s signature is chars - int and not chars - int so it doesn t match with toupper and tolower s


zen-cart	magento	1
alternatively zen-cart looks simpler than magento but without some of the flexibility


sdl	xlib	1
in my experience xlib via mit-shm extension was significantly faster than sdl surfaces not sure i used sdl in the most optimal way though


kde	gnome	11
sometimes a linux distribution contains far more than an operating system but is informally referred to by a single name such as ubuntu and so the line between what the operating system is the linux kernel and standard libraries perhaps and the applications that merely ship with that operating system the gnome and kde environments on linux is pretty gray

the kde gnome terminals are more than good enough

inside aptitude you can select gnome or kde files audio video etc - use the _ character to mark them to be purged then hit g to update the packages

the motivation is that font size 12 under kde seems to be much larger than under gnome

on gnome gtk+ can be seen as more native whereas on kde qt is more native

i am trying to explore kde a bit but many of the tools i rely on have fonts that appear so much bigger under kde than gnome even though the chosen font size is the same and the resolution is the same 1920x1200

in general you can choose gnome or kde with any distro and you can even install both

here s a list of lots of choices basically anything that s not kde or gnome will be smaller

using the kde login to choose gnome also gives me this weird kde gnome hybrid

since the more mainstream wms like gnome or kde become more and more resource hungry it wasn t long before i replaced gnome with xfce on laptops and desktop computers

on kde aptana ran perfectly quicker than on gnome at the best of times


initializer	class-method	2
static class-method often allow cleaner code and save you from initializer redundant objects

the simplest thing is probably to define b with a nice straightforward initializer with the same signature as a uses and then additional factory functions defined as class-method to do the more complicated scenarios


qplaintextedit	qtextedit	3
if you want to display your file as plain text the widget qplaintextedit is better then qtextedit

i have tried connecting the qscrollbars but the maximum of the qplaintextedit is smaller than the qtextedit s

i know that qt tutorial recommends using qplaintextedit for text editor implementations and that the question except as mentioned in the title is more general than dealing absolutely with a qtextedit widget but i succeeded in implementing the behaviour line numbers + current line number highlight and i think this might be helpful for some people like me who really want to keep going with the rich text widget and want to share my implementation which is far from perfect - quite fast coded...


mayavi	matplotlib	6
mayavi makes it easier to visualize the data but matplotlib looks more professional

mayavi has more options for moving the camera than matplotlib but it doesn t seem to have a way to rotate around the y axis so i m guessing i ll need to perform some complex calculations on the azimuth and elevation to achieve the same result - but i m at a loss as to where to start i m new to working in 3d space and my brain doesn t think that way yet

personally i ve used mayavi in the past and found the performance much better than matplotlib for 3d scatter plotting though the python bindings are somewhat in question moving forward i think

anyway if you re willing to do advanced 3d stuff mayavi is way better than matplotlib

you could do this in matplotlib probably using patch objects to build up a cube and colour the patches as needed however for 3d plotting mayavi is generally easier better

mayavi might be better but i haven t tried this as i wanted to stick with matplotlib


ienumerable	ienumerator	2
while i generally agree with jon skeet s answer i have also come across a very few cases where working with ienumerator indeed seemed more appropriate than wrapping them in a once-only- ienumerable

even though this is supported by c# via ienumerator ienumerable there is a better idiom foreach


sin	math.h	1
and my test result show it s more accurate than math.h s sin cos at -m_pi angle +m_pi range


centos	solaris	2
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

i would give you more info except a ip aliasing on centos 7 is more involved than i like much easier on solaris and b i m not familiar at all with configuring nginx very easy on apache


qiodevice	qdatastream	1
instead of using the endian conversion functions you could use the qdatastream functionality with any qiodevice which is much easier and more intuitive in my opinion


fgets	strlen	2
read the number in a char array a with scanf s a or better with fgets and output the char array reversed by outputting each character starting from strlen a - 1 to 0

the fgets function accepts the input when a newline character enter key when using stdin is encountered and the newline character n is considered a valid character by the function and included in the string copied to your str2 .hence when you pass it as a parameter to strlen it gives one more than the original number of characters in your string to account for the additional n character


highcharts	gridster	1
if i resize the window and a widget with a highcharts is bigger than the window i want to resize it to make it smaller and gridster should recalculate the positions of the others


gradle	ivy	5
you get the same mechanism for other dependency managers like ivy oy gradle maven ivy ant gradle are more than just dependency managers but it s not the point here

ivy but gradle does it better

if you were to do that gradle would be simpler as it provides a nice abstraction on top of the nitty gritty maven ivy stuff once you are to write your scripts

today gradle comes with a full-fledged dependency management implementation that no longer builds upon ivy except for some traces that haven t been removed yet for backwards compatibility reasons

if you are looking for a more flexible build than ant or maven but at the same time utilize maven or ivy repositories you should consider gradle


uitableview	uipickerview	4
perhaps a uipickerview or a uitableview might be better alternatives to radio buttons

uitableview is much more customizable than uipickerview

there are some libs that are using uitableview to simulate a more flexible uipickerview

the uipickerview is nothing more than a uiview with one or more uitableview and background and selector views


gunicorn	waitress	1
i use windows on my pc to tinker around so decided on using waitress but perhaps gunicorn would be easier


tensorflow	cudnn	1
currently tensorflow supports the older cudnn v.5.1 while there is a newer cudnn 6.0 available on nvidia site


weinre	vorlon	1
i recommend vorlon works like weinre


puma	thin	3
there are times when you should pick thin remember you re in an event loop and times when you should pick puma

so even if you have thin installed but you have puma on your gemfile it will pick puma

i know this question might be a little subjective but googling researching this for the past week has got me even more conflicted since most of the examples are using thin but most articles prefer puma


recv	epoll	4
most particular platforms restrict the list of calls that can be interrupted to a smaller set than pthreads allows so you d have to look at the linux docs to be sure exactly what is and isn t eintr-safe but the epoll family of methods along with read recv write send and friends are almost certain to be unsafe

then accept a client on that specific socket but then you ve still got to either create a thread to handle the client read recv s and write send s or use select epoll to find out when there s input ready to read or more space in output buffers for transmission

there is a scheduling delay between the time when data becomes available in the kernel socket buffer and the time when the receiving process is woken up from a blocking read recv select epoll etc

the usual way is to enable a timeout on the recv call either by setting a timeout on the socket or using a select epoll call and using it to both issue a poll and time it out


fasta	blast	1
i think fasta might be better at finding alignments between dissimilar sequences than blast but blast is better at aligning similar sequences


lwp	libwww-perl	1
you could use libwww-perl perldoc lwp and have more control about the download process


mp3	m3u	1
an m3u file is nothing more than a text file listing mp3 and or other format digital audio files to be interpreted by player software as a series of audio files to be played in succession


required	placeholder	4
in such a case passing by value may no required actually passing anything at all -- the value that s passed is basically little or nothing more than a placeholder for this is the object

then enter as many carriage returns as required then right click the text box and select create placeholder

this is clearer and simpler no need to know what std bind does or what the std placeholder are for more flexible it can support any expression not just parameter binding required no support headers and will probably compile a little faster too

i looked at the relevant portion of the html5 spec and although there is some talk about how the required select interacts with placeholder elements i don t see anything about how multiple+required behaves


django-userena	pinax	1
i was thinking of using the accounts app but django-userena seems better so i created a project zero with pinax and tried to integrate django-userena with it


websocket	pusher	2
i d highly recommend pusher - it s a third party websocket system i am not affiliated with them in any way

the underlying websocket technology is bidirectional more info here but pusher s pub sub model is unidirectional


ienumerable	ilist	25
ienumerable is less specific than an ilist that is ilist has functions that ienumerable does not

if you need the list to be indexed then you should choose ilist - this interface inherits from icollection and ienumerable so this may be what you are after

if your method could return either an ilist or an ienumerable prefer returning ilist

another suggestion change you to because you can keep an extension method for more collections because the ienumerable is more abstract than ilist

the reason why this doesn t work specifically is because ilist is more specialized than ienumerable

so i need to choose ienumerable icollection ilist or may be even list

you need to use tolist to convert it from ienumerable because the ilist interface supports more functionality than the ienumerable interface

i ve read in some of the threads here to choose ienumerable over ilist to pass data from controller to views

if you return collections or instance and if you choose ienumerable iqueryable ilist list or whatever depends on your needs

ienumerable is more abstract and is generally preferred to list or ilist if possible

also i prefer ienumerable instead of ilist if you only want iterate over them

an ilist has the methods for changing the items like add maybe you want to select between icollection and ienumerable

i recommend using ienumerable instead of ilist with it you will have more flexibility

another thing that bothers me is why in nhibernate always it is being used ilist and not ienumerable which has less functionality

ienumerable is less specific than ilist ilist implements ienumerable so unless you want something specific from ilist such as .count as you suggest or perhaps add delete etc i d use ienumerable

generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course

compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

yes i understand that ienumerable is much more lighter rather than ilist but anyway there is a lot situations where we need to have ilist instead of ienumerable and in this approach we need to cast ienumerable to ilist isn t it

i would choose between ilist and ienumerable and wouldn t consider array at all

an ienumerable is less specific than an ilist

basically the methods will range from a base of ienumerable all the way up to ilist which has a larger selection available

ilist is stronger in that it makes more guarantees than ienumerable

ienumerable is less specific than ilist

so that s your call what you want to choose ilist or ienumerable

thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it


opencv	cimg	1
i believe it is significantly simpler than opencv which on a raspberry pi for example takes around 1gb of space and over an hour to build whereas cimg is a single header-only file that you include in your code with no libraries needing to be installed which can do what you ask


dropbox	skydrive	1
you are programming in your ide and want to upload it to the cloud so you click file save as select dropbox skydrive etc


plone	buildout	1
i ve even tried to pin archetypes and atcontentypes so that the buildout uses older versions example those used in plone 4.2 by adding the following to my pinnedversions.cfg file which gets called after everything else


nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue	1
right now all the photos are downloaded with a custom nsoperation class run on an nsoperationqueue .however i have heard about nsurlconnection async being more efficient and was wondering which is better of this situation


d3.js	leaflet	3
i was thinking of generating tiles to serve to openlayers or leaflet for display but my data has a graph structure that i would like to take advantage of and i think using neo4j possibly in combination with a visualization library like d3.js may be an easier way to build my tool

d3.js is not wrong the data is incorrect and leaflet is more lenient

i think d3.js looks so much better than leaflet but for quick zooming panning functionality my first question is is this better off in leaflet or can d3.js handle slick zoom pan even though it s not tile-based


keras	cntk	1
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features


traceroute	packets	2
traceroute proceeds unless all three sent packets are lost more than twice then the connection is lost and the route cannot be evaluated

that will give you the average rtt for each hop small sample obviously you would want to adjust traceroute to send more packets to each hop for more complete average


lxml	libxslt	3
also since lxml is based on libxml2 and libxslt you ll need less calls into the c api which can be quite expensive in my experience

libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

gimel and tim recommend lxml which is a nicely pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries


cdi	facesservlet	1
i want to use cdi with these servlets but it only works for the facesservlet to be more precisely for the beans the jsf actions are routed to


960.gs	fluid	1
i prefer fluid version of 960.gs fluid 960 grid system


scrollable	panels	6
the panels itself is larger than the form and is scrollable autoscroll true

i m guessing that creating a ui including scrollable panels will be much harder in raphael than using pure html which would give me flexbox and divs with overflow auto etc

i am trying to create a jpanel that is resizable scrollable and contains x smaller inner panels

how to add those mypanel s dynamically and making the panels scrollable on adding more of those

when the contents of the panels are bigger than its clientsize then autoscrollminsize should be equivalent to the scrollable area of the panels

i have a scrollable panels that shows content larger than the screen


mp3	flv	2
both formats flv vs mp4 can contain exact same data h.264 video with mp3 or aac audio but mp4 is supported in more devices software

i would recommend using mp3 audio and flash using the free jw flv media player which should do everything that you want except for the low high quality thing but maybe you can just use two players if you need


emma	jacoco	1
the reports from jacoco also look nicer than the ones in emma


udp	rtp	7
for those packets that are udp and between the two rtp ports grabbed earlier fuzz the rtp contents

media goes over udp using higher-layer protocols like rtp real-time transport protocol and this part of communication typically goes peer-to-peer

http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as their network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads

so that your rtp over udp becomes more resistant towards packets losses

in terms of performance rtp udp streaming is far better but there is no guarantee that it will get transported through the internet via routers nat boxes proxies etc

tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling

i think rtp udp would be faster and is built into vlc


ecobertura	eclemma	2
the eclemma plugin is nicer and more mature then ecobertura

also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool


let	curry	1
despite the fact that using the iife approach would let you do more than just one function call in the anonymous method are there any disadvantages to swapping it out for the curry approach


mbunit	cruisecontrol.net	1
that said if you are using only visual studio and will be doing ci builds using cruisecontrol.net or teamcity i d recommend using mbunit or nunit.net


strstr	strcmp	1
also using strstr instead of strcmp might produce better results


youtube	vimeo	9
in terms of interacting with javascript youtube is miles ahead of vimeo and performs much more reliably

youtube and vimeo are probably better choices if you want your videos to be visible to the widest possible audience

video plattforms like youtube or vimeo are faster and would bring this options with them

vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users

i ve been tweaking these regular expressions across multiple projects to match youtube and vimeo urls

youtube and vimeo definitely have a better bandwidth than your hosting company

i m trying to match youtube and vimeo urls on javascript

the youtube approach seems much more efficient as far as amount of code and simplicity of understanding which makes me wonder why vimeo would use promises in this simple fast case

while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos so they ll play on iphone


highcharts	fusioncharts	3
customization and variety of animations highcharts has more customizable animations when compared to fusioncharts javascript charts

i d recommend highcharts or fusioncharts

i personally prefer highcharts over fusioncharts because highcharts provides an insight documentation and api support.i was using it for a stock based application which i felt highcharts had an edge over the fusioncharts.the customization of highcharts was as easy as pie when you go through the high stock api


jlist	jlayeredpane	1
the listener to the jlayeredpane component makes fast successive calls the listener to the jlist calls significantly slower


dreamweaver	aptana	2
i ve been sampling aptana to see if i prefer it over dreamweaver and i definitely want to use it going forward but it s lacking one important feature i need - a simple way to compare a local vs

i had previously used aptana 3 for a couple days and may have come to the conclusion that it is better than dreamweaver at actual html css coding


switching	accessory	1
but when more than on switching in accessory is on - if three switches are on and i turn off one switching then the did select row works


gentoo	ubuntu	1
i use both gentoo and ubuntu and i see that emerge the package manager of gentoo has a higher readability than apt-get aptitude just because it uses way much more color output than the latter


deselect	multi-select	9
hold down ctrl and click to multi-select or do ctrl + a to select all and then deselect the ones you don t want with ctrl + shift +click

the multi-select works perfectly well and i am able to select deselect elements from the list

i have 2 multi-select dropdown boxes ddb i use jquery mobile .once user selects the items from ddb1 based on his selection i need to populate ddb2.i have used jquery.change in ddb1.but the issue i face is that onchange is called every time the user selects deselect an item from ddb1 i understand that this is the expected behavior and not when the whole selection is over

i m using jquery multi-select plugin and i want to perform an ajax request on a select deselect event

you can multi-select with shift and then select deselect the group

you can use multi-select methods select deselect

i have a gwt datagrid with a multi-select model and check-boxes to show selection select deselect rows

i m aware that there are different styles of multi-select widget eg an available list and a selected list vs a single list with select deselect checkboxes vs autocomplete combobox.

update i want to achieve mail app in edit mode where i can select deselect multi-select


bufferedreader	fileinputstream	2
see the referred post for an example that reads a single file in parallel with fileinputstream which should be significantly faster than using bufferedreader according to these benchmarks

bufferedreader is useful when is used with large streams such as a file fileinputstream and in all cases the read method returns one character while behind the scene bufferedreader reads more data depends on buffer size from related inputstream and caches it to improve performance


math.h	sqrt	2
i just want to learn why fast inversion algorithm is slower than math.h sqrt function

it returns sqrt abs x the results match math.h implementation from mine c++ ide bds2006 turbo c++


scipy	pyomo	1
pyomo runs in less than one minute and scipy takes 4 hours


uploadify	swfupload	3
flash-based uploaders like uploadify and swfupload have more liberties here

my rails app is coded in jquery but for file uploading i ve yet to find anything better than fancyupload better imho than uploadify or swfupload

i am considering which to choose swfupload or uploadify


swt	windowbuilder	2
go to menu file new other... and select windowbuilder swt designer swt application window click on the next button

for eclipse i recommend windowbuilder you can build swt and swing applications with wb


operands	scalar	2
vector instructions may use array operands that require a higher alignment than any scalar

the draft c++11 standard tells us that unless stated otherwise the order of evaluations of operands are unsequenced and if the same scalar object is modified more that once by unseqeucend side effects than we have undefined behavior


filehelpers	linqtocsv	1
i also decided to compare filehelpers to linqtocsv


xbee	pyserial	1
i would also recommend using pyserial if you have a very simple setup and only two xbee but if you have anything more complicated then you are better off with a library


xna	spritebatch	2
in xna when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one spritebatch

you could also use silverlight 5 which has a 3d api and audio api that matches xna and has a toolkit available that adds 2d xna functionality like spritebatch and more making the majority of the xna api available


ksort	asort	1
if your sorting needs are more complex than asort or ksort as previously suggested then write a function to plug into uasort


vim	textmate	7
textmate or macvim as the ide gvim or vim for the linux folk usually though some prefer emacs

i d recommend vim emacs or textmate

vim is more powerful and textmate is worth the price tag

i like the idea of the of editing inside the terminal and like the key bindings of vim but the text highlighting in my vim is much worse than in textmate

i like this vim feature but generally prefer textmate

textmate isn t known to perform well on large files but sublimetext supposedly performs better than vim on large files and yet supports legacy textmate syntax parsers

it s horses for courses personally i m much happier with textmate or vim and a nice cup of coffee but it s what feels more comfortable to you


qtwebengine	qtwebkit	2
i ve also noticed that qtwebengine is significantly faster and more stable that the old qtwebkit based widgets

unfortunately qtwebengine has much worse and poorer integration with the rest of qt facilities than qtwebkit

use one of the image loading libraries glide square picasso universal-image-loader or ion ion is actually more of a general purpose async loading tool to do the dirty work for you


margin	height	75
sometimes when enough content items is added this div height is larger than windows and part of div content is not visible at all it stays bellow page margin

css height 100 gives an element height that is actually greater than 100 by the size of the margin

note this looks good because you have defined your height making the smaller ones exactly twice as high with margin as the bigger one

because you are using margin in tabs its height will be more thant 100

so increasing height padding margin or hiding showing earlier elements on the page will affect and push down elements defined later

if the element height is greater than the window height minus the nav bar height then additional margin is added to the bottom of my element so that what was hidden behind the bottom nav bar is now revealed on scroll

you need to leave enough space whether by increasing the height of the footer using a minimum instead of fixed height using a smaller margin on the paragraph or some other means for your content to appear in

since my top content for the homepage is a fixed height through javascript i tried simply changing the top margin to the difference between the window height and that fixed value when window height is greater than the fixed value

can anyone tell me how to keep same height in both list items total height and responsive image height responsive image height will be change according to the resolution what i need to do is according to that height add more list items or change list items bottom margin and height both should be increase or decrease and add remove items to keep a clean look.

when i put an h2 tag into this form area ie reports that the box is taller than the height i assigned by the height and margin padding i gave to the h2 tag

but then the java script adds some margin to top and bottom when the image height is smaller

therefore assuming the container s width is greater than the image s height margin -50 0 should be enough

i have this code for when an image loads in our app and then when the height is greater than the width add a class to bump up the margin

i assume margintop can t be solved since im setting margin top to -820 in order to get at a point of top 275 therefore screens smaller than 1200px height the div will go much higher...

if the list items were of a fixed height i could add margin to put it lower down but because each item of the list can vary in height this won t be suitable

should i just target each images and count the container height and use the remainer as top margin or is there easier solution

infact text inside text views has some internal margin that i took into account using the inset structure so the required text view height will be higher than the calculated string height

you also need to set a height that is greater than the negative top margin so part of the element will be visible so the user can hover over it

when i add a margin to the divs the width becomes smaller and the height stays the same so the aspect ratio changes

also be aware that if the height of the printable area that is page height minus top and bottom margin is less than the height of your cell content then it s impossible for the browser to avoid breaking it unless it can somehow warp the fabric of space maybe firefox has a -moz- property for that

pstenstrm has provided a good solution that appears to display correctly however the actual height of the red div in this case is equal to its children the text rather than the remaining available space of its parent while the inner and outer height take up more space due to the padding margin

once the page height is less than the margin i need to create another page

setting the datatemplate s grid s width and height to be larger than the cell with a negative margin can produce a close result but if you resize the column the problem shows itself again

it seems that that top margin gets added to the 100 height making it higher and causing the scrollbar

if the height is greater than 66px i want to apply a negative top margin equal to half of its height

how to calculate element s width and height with their padding margin values using less code

the margin will be greater than the height of the iframe

your listview item s height is looking bigger because your are applying 17dp padding and 4dp margin at the top and 7dp padding and 4dp margin at the bottom of the textview ...so its taking total 32dp extra space excluding your textview

i am trying to make my div wrap the tag however it doesn t wrap the height is always higher of my div and my tag has no padding or margin i tried many things but doesn t work i am adding my style and the html code i am also going to add some screenshots

margin should be less than or equal to coin image height and also give some left margin to fill effects

the only catch is that this logic of 1.33 times the header region height seems to work only if the header margin b footer margin is less than or equal to one-third the paper-height

so on b element i cannot use nor a negative margin because i don t know a block height nor position absolute because b content height might overflow wrapper height

they appear to scale on the width ok but grow in height leaving more margin between the text and the border

the problem with your logic is that it doesn t incorporate the maximum distance the child is allowed to move in the top direction it will jump in 50 pixel steps and in case the newly calculated child height is smaller than the parent it just stops where it would also need to limit the margin to the maximum similar to what you are already doing for the bottom direction

you keep your buttons which you want to show always at the bottom of the activity out of scroll view and keep the height of the scroll view to match parent with margin required for your buttons height

if boxes 4 and 5 are together higher with margin than box 3 it should be stretched in height so they are horizontally aligned as shown in my image

for width i can use margin 0 auto but height is trickier because it would need to make a div absolute

by actual i mean it must match height padding margin and border

the issue is that without the margin on the bottom the page height is shorter then the window bounds thus your footer div ends and the body of the page bleeds through

where each image will be right-centered and displayed in margin area on the right which height will match height of the font width should be scaled to height

you ll need to set the top margin for whatever item you want under it to be greater than the height of your navbar in order for it to show up correctly

i can handle this using outside position property modifying the margin or padding of an li element if the text height is smaller than the image height

edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

the value of margin top will be equal or greater than height of the fixed header height

the first row has a height that is much larger than the margin bottom of its .content div so that the margin-bottom is contained and should not effect anything outside of its container

#footer s height is more than 800px so the #container should lose its top margin value by touching #footer and continue scrolling the page without that floating div

the trick sets a big padding to all columns in this case 10000cm note it must be a number larger than the height of the tallest column and removes extra space with a negative margin

if i apply a negative margin to it that is greater than its height the first time feedbackview.showtext is called it doesn t animate in correctly

it is treating the floated ul as position absolute but only when its height is less than or equal to the negative top margin on its containing parent

what i want it to do is to center a given image from a database into a div for example if the given images width is bigger than height it echos it with a left margin

if you want to use it then add a bottom margin to the content_main which should be equal or greater than the height of the ad layout

or if you want to keep margin on parent but you don t want height to be more then window height you could use calc 100vh - marginofchildren like this demo

you basically need to make sure that either the content has a bottom margin greater than or equal to the height of the footer or if the content is in a container of some sort that it s container has a bottom padding equal to or greater than the height of the footer

by default browsers add a margin to the body causing the body to actually take up more than 100 height 100 plus whatever the margin is

try to align the margin of image to be in the left of stackpanel and the rectangle height should be less than the image height.try to reduce the corner radius of rectangle this also helps

in activity_main.xml below the feedbackview has a margin top of -36dp which is greater than its height when non-negated

the width and height you provided should be greater than amount of padding for example summing top and bottom margin 18 + 18 36px so height should be greater than 36px same goes for height

you cant see 45 barcodes because their margin is bigger than page height

i used firebug to look at the divs and imgs and both imgs have 0 for margin padding and border yet the computed height somehow is 4.5px bigger in the first instance

however an algorith could be something like if the new margin top is greater than the height of the current note and the difference between the offet of the current note anchor and the following note anchor is less than the height of the current note than subtract the height of the current note from the new margin

also you cannot rely on fixed 300px margin i.e if window height is less than 500px you re already missing 100px

when recyclerview s content height is less than itself - last item has to gain margin padding height and fill the remaining space

i have use height 100vh for .container and pulled .footer up by minus margin

basically if it can scale to 100 height of the parent container margin padding included without the width becoming bigger than the parent container s let it scale up

i removed fixed height from .subgroup and decreased margin to make div more elastic

your wrapper has a height of 100 of the body which also has a height of 100 but it also has a top margin making the total outer height greater than the height of the window

on page load detect if body s height is larger than window s height and if not move #header #content and #footer to the left via padding or via margin on the body

this may be ommited once height is lower than available - thus negative margin may work

gives a way to make the margin transparent but they are still there and the plot is smaller than height and width i set in the saved file

you will need to set android layout_paddingtop on the relativelayout equal or greater than the height of the repeat password field + any top margin it might have

i would recommend adding width height and margin to your code

also you need to be careful about your content - in the fiddle you used h4 and p tags and these have a default top bottom margin set by the browser - if this margin is larger than the space available in the percentage height div it will push the content out of vertical alignment

in conjunction with a negative margin equal to or greater than the height of the top and bottom borders if any to further remove the element

i don t understand why the height of span element more than its font-size margin and padding 0 jsfiddle example

the width and height are little less because my printer doesn t support zero margin


qapplication	qcoreapplication	2
if you need to detect key events globally in the whole application then you can catch and process them in reimplemented qapplication notify for more details how to use qcoreapplication notify see qt docs on that

the error you are getting happens everytime you have more than one qapplication or qcoreapplication


gridview	detailsview	2
at the bottom there s a partial code of a form i m trying to build it has only the upper gridview and details view for now but you can see my problem in the screenshot i took the erased row has personal data the gridview and the detailsview drops lower then the second centered subtitle

personally i prefer listview over gridview and detailsview if possible it gives you more control over your html


ienumerable	icollection	9
the second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual one

an ilist has the methods for changing the items like add maybe you want to select between icollection and ienumerable

if you need the list to be indexed then you should choose ilist - this interface inherits from icollection and ienumerable so this may be what you are after

a better way to do that instead is taking in an ienumerable which is more generic than icollection since icollection implements ienumerable and simply checking it for null and else returning any from linq s operators

compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

secondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generic than icollection and does not even have simple properties like count

icollection also seems like a valid candidate due to its name but i get the impression ienumerable are more user friendly

so i need to choose ienumerable icollection ilist or may be even list

even though this is not quite related to the question since google brings you here i thought it might be helpful to notice that a likely possibility is that your are using ienumerable for you collection you should be using icollection see more here


square-root	palindrome	1
the mathematical reason for this is that once the solution 906609 is found it will no longer be possible to find a larger palindrome where the larger factor is less than the square-root of 906609 which is 952.160.


ifttt	zapier	1
based from this thread you can get the xml link to your gcal in the individual calendar s settings hover over the calendar s name in the sidebar click the arrow that shows up and choose calendar settings and use an rss-to-facebook service like rss graffiti ifttt zapier or networked blogs to post new items to your facebook page


autocompletetextview	spinner	2
if you don t want to write anything on autocompletetextview and select items you have to implement the spinner is more great

also from your requirements autocompletetextview is more suitable than spinner


avd	galaxy	5
then create a new avd with the target platform but choose galaxy tab as a skin

i can select samsung galaxy s2 as the target in the avd manager but the skin is not available from the drop-down list

restart eclipse go to avd manager choose galaxy s4 min set android target to 17 and choose the downloaded skin

then open avd manager make a new emulator and in the target choose galaxy tab addon

re-open the avd manager and go back to the device definitions tab select the samsung galaxy sii device and select create avd


strcpy	malloc	3
or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy

because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it


win64	windows	1
although if your api can be used on multiple operating systems then win64 may be better assuming that its only intended to be used for windows and there s an equivalent for the other os


s-function	simulink	1
right click on the s-function block in your simulink project - choose s-function parameters


csla	.net	1
i would recommend csla .net by rockford lhotka


user-controls	tabcontrol	1
some user-controls s are larger than the tabcontrol and got clipped so i modified its template by wrapping the contentpresenter in a scrollviewer with horizontalscrollbarvisibility and verticalscrollbarvisibility set to auto


factors	matrix	13
consider a model with lots of factors or nonlinear terms like bs ns or poly the model frame is much smaller compared with model matrix

matrix factorization sometimes referred to as matrix decomposition is a general term in ml there are many ways to approximate a matrix using simpler factors sometimes with loss of info

perhaps in the same vein and i had a problem of this sort with some of my other data trying to convert character names in matrix and data frames into factors results in more confusing behaviour

finally note that by default ichol references the lower triangle of the input matrix and returns a lower triangular factors

thus apply outperforms matrix multiplication by a factors of 15

however it still performs worse by initially a factors of 3 but as the matrix size increases asymptotically worse by a factors of exactly 2

however that is much worse by a factors of 10000 than what i am currently doing which is for matrix x for putting and x.getrow idx .todense for taking

i measured the time it takes to calculate the distance between a vector and the rows of a matrix when they are in the object and it work slower by a factors of 3 then the normal distance function

in the code below i use block multiplication to speed up your code for a 1024x1204 matrix by more than a factors of ten 7.1 s with old code and 0.6s with new using only a single thread without using sse avx

which matrix will be better in defining the correlation between the factors

the trick may be to not lose factors when creating the matrix

after that you can use acp on sub matrix to extract factors and understand more the composition of each cluster

eta to answer your question in more general terms let s say we had the number of subjects and levels set up in advance increasing the number of factors is more complicated unless i m mistaken because then it would no longer be a two-dimensional matrix


sudo	passwd	8
of course this is no fewer keystrokes than sudo python although at least you wouldn t need to enter a passwd

sudo is better in most respects but still requires a passwd which asroot does not

as a note the su command is much older than sudo and the normal procedure before sudo was to su to root and then to another user unless you knew the passwd of that other user

although this might ask for passwd twice so i actually prefer using sudo -s or sudo -i

this is partly to make passwd stealing wrappers harder but is mostly useful so that things like some-command | sudo othercommand work even if sudo has to prompt for a passwd

thanks to a suggestion in the comments i removed the passwd from the server declaration since i think getting sudo to work without a passwd is a cleaner solution anyway

you can enable the root account and set a passwd but jumping to it with sudo is the better method

automating sudo is slighly more complex if you need to pass the passwd but still can be done


eruby	erb	1
i see that it supposedly beats erb and eruby now.


multiplying	subtract	21
in other words hardly anything slower than multiplying add subtract but not enough to really worry about

a slightly more sophisticated approach with add subtract multiplying divide

the issue lies within the switch where i try adding subtract multiplying or dividing more than 3 operands

adding and subtract logarithms of factorials then taking the exponential at the end is more reliable than multiplying and dividing factorials directly

similarly if you skip the five first elements your loop takes o n-5 time but that too is the same as o n because adding or subtract a constant is even weaker than multiplying by a constant

division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract

you can choose between multiplying add subtract

but my guess would be that in this particular chunk of code multiplying divide and modulo all take roughly the same amount of time and that time is greater than add or subtract

subtract is faster than multiplying

like this you can add subtract multiplying and divide more easily

when you have multiple extents you can figure out on which extent the cluster is by multiplying the lcn with the size of a cluster and then subtract the size of each extent returned by the ioctl in the order they are returned if the next number to subtract is greater than your current number that particular lcn is on that extent

since multiplication has a higher precedence than subtraction you should subtract 0 to your digit character before multiplying it

if the parameter is greater than 0.5 multiplying lambda by two and subtract one this maps onto and return the interpolated color between color b and color c

p is sometimes chosen to be 31 because not only is it prime but a compiler resolves it to a bitshift and a subtract which is much faster than a multiplying

if you have some binary floating-point values a and b that you know are very near decimal numerals with a few digits then multiplying those values by a power of ten subtract and dividing by the power of ten generally does not provide a better result than simply subtract the values directly

the logic is multiplying by 2 whole number 0.1 2 0.2 and if it s bigger than 1 subtract and continue

the code is used to create a calculator that shall have functions like squaring rooting subtract adding multiplying dividing and more if i feel like is necessary in the future

subtract first field from the other and if the value is not greater than 0 multiplying by -1

multiplying and divide have higher precedence than add and subtract

to give multiplying and divide higher precedence than add and subtract you can do something like this example adapted from john levine lex yacc 2 e 1992

integer add subtract compare instructions but not multiplying are also lower latency than their fp counterparts


uicollectionview	uitableview	22
this cocoapod makes the uitableview uicollectionview loading much more easier than dealing directly with datasource and delegates

you can see uitableview in almost every ios application for example contacts or ipod while uicollectionview are more difficult to see the grid in photos but also the coverflow in ipod

i also read somewhere that uicollectionview has much better performance in displaying variable-sized content would it be worthwhile possible to try configuring a uicollectionview to display the messages and somehow make it look like a uitableview

a uicollectionview works very similar to a uitableview but gives you more control over how the cells should be displayed and aligned

i am not sure what you are trying to do but i think a simple uitableview or uicollectionview may be better for you because they have datasource method that will automatically called when a view will show up in the screen

as abhishekkharwar said there are many other ways to do this better as using uicollectionview or uitableview but you have to decide what fits better on your app needs

on second thoughts in your case uicollectionview is surely a better candidate than uitableview

this are some of things i always prefer uitableview and uicollectionview

in fact i m seriously considering replacing all uitableview in my future projects with uicollectionview which are far more adaptable

finally you might want to look into uicollectionview which provides a lot more visual flexibility than uitableview and can be seen as a sort of generalization of the latter

uicollectionview is more generic than uitableview and you can custom almost thing on it

first i thought to use uitableview but i have read that uicollectionview would be better

2 uitableview and uicollectionview both are better than others when you want to manage complex views

i d recommend checking out uicollectionview the more flexible counterpart to uitableview

you might have better luck with a uicollectionview instead of a uitableview

dictionaries aren t a very good match with uicollectionview and uitableview as they are unordered

i found that uicollectionview is like an upgrade versioning of uitableview introduced in ios6 but when should i choose uicollectionview instead of uitableview

instead of using a uitableview in this instance perhaps you might consider using a uicollectionview - they are built for something like you describe more than a uitableview

if the layout is repetitive a uitableview uicollectionview is a better choice

if you don t want to use it in either a uitableview or a uicollectionview you re probably better of without it

it seems like a uitableview or uicollectionview would be a more appropriate mechanism to do what you re trying to do

i think it is older than the uicollectionview and therfore explains it for uitableview


adc	uart	1
the only problem is that when the mcu is transmitting data uart transmission interrupt has higher priority than the adc reading interrupt the adc is not sampling data hence there will be data loss sample rate is around 500 samples sec


ioexception	filewriter	1
for example public static void copy reader r writer w throws ioexception is more useful reusable than public static void copy filereader r filewriter w throws ioexception

more over i can select each field by hand but the list is dynamic so someone can add f.w and i want the solution to be ready i don t know what are the possible suffix

i update the edited value in the spinner from which user can select 1 option and with some other entries like price item user can save it in the database.this is my scenario what i want now is to retrieve the data from database separately under each value which is selected from spinner.how can i query the database.please help me..i think i have explained my problem clearly..i am ready to give more details

what i need is the script to run on each individual row and be ready to handle more rows if they should come later on

one way i could is write code to ready the file line by line and query the database for that record and compare each and every field

your threads are cpu-intensive it is they don t block waiting for some slow resource to be ready so threads compete with each other for cpu

and platform-specific solutions as kqueue bsd macosx epoll linux dev poll solaris are better if relatively small subset of all descriptors is ready on each cycle

here s the question it seems that only one cfwritestreamwrite call is safe free of blocking per each kcfstreameventcanacceptbytes notification because from the second call we can t guarantee that the socket is ready to accept more data

that way each thread can pick up a link when it s ready which makes more sense than partitioning in advance

the input calls it each time it s ready to accept more data

after each input step is ready you can fix the metadata and order of columns so they match perfectly with each other

i have both select ready but i don t know how to loop over the results of the first to grab each id and use it in the second one

if you would like to prevent void matches you could save the current game session state to the database or other external source and when both players are ready again notify each of them that the match is ready

since each time select returns the fd_set contains only the fds that are ready for the operation that means you have to rearm the fd_set before calling select each time

in previous licensing programs like business ready licensing brl you would have had to define and purchase each granule individually


orchestration	microservices	1
if you want to have content synchronized between all the microservices in your case the header and footer i d suggest zookeeper it s designed for distributed orchestration and has more of a push model - you d update the header in zookeeper and all of your services would receive that update almost instantly


restrict	shared	2
this allows a file shared to offer more restrict access to some files than if the same user were attempt to access them locally

the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time


compoundjs	node.js	1
another way is if you want some exotic i ll recommend compoundjs framework for node.js its good for rest api


free	memcpy	6
in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

the tool recommends replacing realloc with malloc memcpy and free

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

actually i usually don t recommend using realloc for that reason just do the malloc memcpy free yourself

you d be better off with memcpy which is probably close to what your compiler gives you for free if you just write the class the normal naive way with no std array and no pointer gymnastics

as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free


httpclient	jersey-client	1
you can also use jersey-client it is gae compatible and much easier than httpclient


union	distinct	157
select distinct nom_auteur from bibliographie union all select distinct nom2 from bibliographie union all select distinct nom3 from bibliographie order by nom_auteur

union command selects distinct and related information from two tables which will eliminates duplicate rows

select distinct to remove duplicates just as union does

union will select distinct values union all will select all values

i ve tried to use select distinct and group by and even union but as my knowledge is pretty poor with sql - they all error

you can run this inside your original query s where clause or you can just append it to the end of your query with a union and run a select distinct reader_id on that whole mess

union all is generally faster than using distinct or grouping

machine from marstable union select distinct machine from statustable

and then created a query to check if a group by of one column was greater than 1 ie not unique and the group by of then next column was 1 unique and that the previous column was a substring of the next then just union together the result of each pair of columns and finally did a select distinct across the whole lot

to remove the duplicates surround the union statement with a select distinct columna columnb statement

union is basically select distinct so it would be eliminating duplicate null values but it s not the same as equal operation

there is absolutely zero benefit from using select distinct when you are using union do not do both just do one

i would use some linq logic to do a select distinct from the union of the lists.

i tried a select distinct on a union query of several datasets to get the category count ahead of time but due to the dynamics involved this did not return what i was looking for

then create a union query from the two subqueries and finally create a select distinct from this union

columns_priv union select distinct

one more thing to mention your union select s should be union all select because without the all the engine has to remove duplicates just as if you d indicated select distinct

3 union select distinct date 1000 as normalized_date null as from pdu left join pending_msgs on pdu._id pending_msgs.msg_id where thread_id 37 and msg_box

it sounds to me like you are asking for the union of the filtered session values from the two tables and as you want the distinct set you do want union rather than union all union all is actually a much more common requirement than union

you can do union of each field and select distinct from it

as a_horse_with_no_name suggests union is way to select distinct values for here would be union all prefered - just in case i don t know if id is unique

it may be lil dumb select distinct from select distinct from first_column union select distinct from second - not valid sql just logic

select distinct and union intersect except no longer always produce

a union statement effectively does a select distinct on the results set

i want to select distinct rows like when using union only

using select distinct with union is redundant

if you select distinct from union all result set then the output will be equal to the union result set

you need a left join between the actual values you want in your output although this could be a select distinct from another table where all the values reside if available this can be generated using select and union and your query

do the search for every field combine them by union and remove duplicates by means of a select distinct

if doing a union all then do a select distinct on the outer sql

try - select distinct x.name from query 1 union query 2 x

union all select distinct .

from table1 group by id order by likesdesc limit 50 union all select distinct id b as type ....from table1 group by id order by distance limit 50 order by type asc

select command with union operator returns itself distinct values

also if you use union all it will be faster if the result you want is all of the rows as opposed to distinct rows and you can still grab distinct rows by selecting distinct from the view if you need it sometimes

then you might switch to except all similar to union all which might be more efficient than union because it avoids the distinct operation

select t.first a.date from select distinct first from race union select distinct second from race union select distinct third from race union select distinct fourth from race union select distinct fifth from race union select distinct sixth from race as t race a where t.first in a.first a.second a.third a.fourth a.fifth a.sixth

union all is better than union because it avoids a sort you know you ll get a distinct set because you re joining on two different tables

union selects distinct rows union all should select all

in mysql union selects distinct rows by default

keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union all which will not remove duplicates

i ve also tried doing a select distinct query on the union all query and it s giving me the overflow error too..

in most cases union all is slightly faster than union distinct

union all will perform better than union when you re not concerned about eliminating duplicate records because you re avoiding an expensive distinct sort operation

anyhow...a solution would be to union each columns and select distinct

select distinct from subquery1 union subquery2

select distinct cola from tab2 union

i am currently using union all and a distinct in the outer query as this proved much faster than using union s for the uniqueness of data

but if there is an index on col1 col2 in the tables then it can be used for the select distinct reducing the number of rows for the union

i have experienced situations where union s made a query much slower than union all with a distinct afterwards

so my suggestion is after you inserted run a select distinct id from all sources and put them together on a structure table temp table view union whatever.. and run a merge from this source into destination on the ids with only a when not matched then delete

select distinct from select col1 from tablea left join tableb on tablea.sr tableb.sr union select col1 from tableb left join table a on tableb.sr tablea.sr

you d have to probably do a select distinct on the data set produced by the union

i don t think you can do much better than 3 union maybe the last 2 can be combined with count distinct

tables_priv union select distinct

side note union all is faster than union distinct but based on your requirements you need union distinct which can be written as simply union

if using union don t also use select distinct because you are just wasting effort

please see conceptual order of evaluation of a select statement where you will see that the clauses are logically evaluated in this order from where group by having select distinct union order by

the union can result in better performing subqueries which makes up for the increased computation for removing distinct values

also a union all takes longer than a union distinct

since union has a built-in distinct though i am not sure if you are aware of that you might want to use select distinct a._doc_id .

you don t need to use select distinct there union will get rid of repetition from within each subquery as well as between the queries

you can avoid duplicates using union all and still run much faster than union distinct which is actually same as union by running a query like this

union forces a distinct to occur and there s little slower than distinct

so union is much better than the union all with distinct in performance-wise

union is used to select distinct values from two tables

there is no point in using union and select distinct

that s one reason why omitting distinct and replacing union by union all is much faster

now if a given record qualifies for multiple or all parts and you only want it to appear once you might be able to just apply select distinct in the main loop to prevent the duplicates from being pulled in from the artist and label union portions

you could use an union on select distinct the resuling rows are these that don t match

the optimizer may not select this mqt if you still issue select distinct against the union all view so you may need to query the mqt or a view defined on top of it directly

you can union two full sets in a subquery and then select distinct col from that

union distinct and select distinct are used to get rid of duplicates

union is a shorter way to write union distinct

i don t quite understand what is it that you want to get in the results but union selects distinct values so you won t have duplicate values values from #tmptable2 that already exist in #tmptable1

the union might be slower due to it attempting to get the distinct values

in most cases what you really want to say is union all as it does not do duplicate elimination think select distinct between sets which can result in quite a bit of savings in terms of execution time

insert b col1 select distinct col1 from a union select distinct col2 from a

the union and select distinct are redundant

your query is fine but you may want to use union all instead of union a union statement does a select distinct on the results set.

by the way union has optional keyword all when the all is omitted union automatically selects distinct rows from the resultset

now in your query you re doing select distinct on both the query and using union with them

the union operator selects distinct values by default so you should not need to use distinct in your select statements

union operator selects distinct rows

the union distinct would be faster if each clause can use the index and there are relatively few rows returned

if there is a record for the same user in both tables chances are that the postdate will be different and using union instead of union all won t solve the problem because any difference in any of the columns means the rows are not duplicates according the strict definition of that term so union or select distinct does not remove them.

no duplicate entries use a select distinct query and union all to generate the data in an excel sheet you can use an odbc connection within excel

is there any way i can select distinct values of each column not using group by listed columns in one query - also without using union

once you do this you may not need the union all or the select distinct

select distinct cola from tab1 union

union as opposed to union all already returns unique items only so you won t need group by or select distinct

you could restructure your query to use a union with select distinct and only retrieve one user id column for each subquery

sql server will union the results together which is an implied select distinct and then order the results by col1 then col2

select distinct in oracle 10 requires a union and this is not supported for clob

by default union only grabs distinct values therefore your exact result

but here you will be missing ips that are not in day1 unless you first do a select distinct srcip from a union of all days which is pretty expensive

by default union selects distinct results there must be duplicates between your result sets

therefore i recommend saying union distinct since that is few keystrokes for you than array_unique ...

after i finally figured out what it was exactly you were trying to do it is pretty much similar to your version the union in the first subquery is going to basically select distinct values which will slow things down

the union operator will throw out duplicate rows between the two result sets much like select distinct does for a single result set

i dont use the union syntax you ve got and instead select distinct values from union-all d composite subquery combined

the difference is that union all is faster than union due to the fact that union eliminates duplicates from the resultset by using select distinct

if there could be duplicates which the union removes then use select distinct

note in my version of sql union queries automatically select distinct records so the distinct flag isn t needed

check the manual that corresponds to your mariadb server version for the right syntax to use near union select distinct sid sordfrom mchar_actpart mcapinner join staff s at line 9

so there is no need to use select distinct combined with a union

there are ways to discard duplicates select distinct union group by but it is not clear whether users update existing rating or create new ones

you could create a scalar table populate it using insert into select and union and then do select distinct from the scalar table

i have tried the following select with union distinct but the problem is that the limit 0 10 applies to the whole result set

union removes duplicate records union select distinct while union all returns duplicate records

a union essentially performs a select distinct so that it can remove duplicate records

for update from a view whose defining select statement uses at least one of the following constructs in its outer block outer join group by clause aggregate functions select distinct connect by clause or set operation union intersect or minus

the reason for using union all in where clause is that the id 512 exists in both columns source_node and target_node as well so have to select distinct neighbors from both columns is necessary

union works like select distinct on resultset obtained from both the tables

nb this has the same semantics as union all rather than union though you could always select distinct from it

then your union query would just be select distinct user_id from cloud_storage

union the tables together and use that query as a subquery of your select distinct

you can filter this out by moving the lot to a subquery and do select distinct on the main query but the more obvious solution is to replace union all by union which also filters out duplicates

i need to select distinct value from a multiple union

you re getting an error because union generates union all with select distinct

union only selects distinct values union all does not

i m sorry that i m not able to understand exactly what your issue is but i wonder if your issue stems from the fact that the union operator will eliminate duplicate rows kind of like a select distinct over the combined query

it s common to use either strings or enums for these in c# java but discriminated union seem more appropriate in f# because these are distinct read-only values

the two versions are identical union is functionally equivalent to select distinct on the union all

the answer to your question is that you can emulate union using a bunch of coalesce statements select distinct and full join

select distinct table.column from table where column like union

okay there are some things that hurt performance such as an unnecessary select distinct or union instead of union all

since the selects are distinct use union all instead of the default union distinct

you could do this by using something like select distinct period from select period from seta union select period from setb union select period from setc etc... as completeset

would it be quicker to do a union select on all the tables in a temp table and select distinct from that

you can also choose between union all or union distinct the default where the latter will only send rows that aren t repeats

note that union always chooses distinct values

union is implicitly select distinct rows it will eliminate duplicate rows but union all will keep those duplicate rows

the beauty of union is that there is no need make a select distinct user_id since union merges the result sets into unique values

i have tried union union distinct select distinct with a union and all kinds of things

depending on the number of rows returned you may be best using union all on the selects with a select distinct query around it

union distinct is slower than union all but you may need it for de-dupping.

using union all is quicker than using union since a distinct check does not need to be done

select distinct and union intersect except no longer always produce sorted output tom

in order to extract all the info i need i create a view using select distinct on junction_id on surveypoints first using a sample_id is null then a union on sample_id is not null this appears to be required as otherwise the data on surveypoints with no associated samples appears empty as there is no way to say that the sample_id relate to each other

the union all with a distinct gives better performance though i believe..

if so i would recommend select distinct rather than a union query

as other users said union is used to select distinct values from two tables

select distinct cat from select cat1 as cat from fruits union all select cat2 as cat from fruits q

i ve tried different variations of parenthesis and aliases i ve tried using select distinct with union all i have verified the number of

we use union all since we re going to select distinct afterwards anyway and this way we have a single distinct operation rather than repeating it

union all is to union what select distinct is to select.

union all is faster than union distinct

there appear to be lots of similar threads that suggest union select distinct join s or other solutions but i have completely failed to adapt them for my needs

however the tables are huge and the union all i read its faster than distinct takes forever to execute even with just two tables let alone 6

using union without all will effectively perform a select distinct between the two selects in the subquery which would be less efficient

edit union should make each select distinct by default

note that the join potentially returns multiple copies of some stores but because union implies select distinct that won t actually affect your final result-set.

union all performs better than union union works like distinct first order by then remove duplicates

you can avoid duplicates and still run much faster than union distinct which is actually same as union by running query like this

select distinct id from table1 where yacht_id not in select id from table2 union select id from table3 order by id

a side note since you want all rows using union all is faster since it does not need to perform a distinct to eliminate duplicates


sorting	grouping	47
in some cases where table data was uniquely identifying i used intermediate tables and frequency distribution sorting to eliminate things like uncommon names eliminated instances where a count with grouping by was less than or equal to 2

instead knowing that we want to grouping by these columns we can make the application code to do so simpler by sorting by these fields

both have the effect of the order by not being executed at all -- and so not executed after the grouping by in the first case the effect is to remove sorting from the grouping by and in the second the effect is to do nothing more than the grouping by already does

the reason being that sorting less elements which the grouping generally produces is going to be faster than sorting all input documents

but then sorting by age grouping ak is more difficult i think

you can also specify grouping totals in select sorting and grand totals in select print options

if you right click on the grouping and select grouping properties you can add sorting for the individual grouping rather than the tablix

grouping has looser constraints than sorting so in theory it could be marginally faster than sorting but unless you re dealing with a lot of data you re unlikely to see a speed difference

if the database is sophisticated enough adding an explicit order by clause will hint that sorting is more optimal for the grouping operation as well as the sorting can then be re-used in the query execution pipeline

of course ordering could be forced obj.gettype .tostring and using lexical order but since a strict order is not necessary only grouping i was wondering if there s a more efficient way than sorting

you can use groupby to select grouping of cards which have the same value sorting them first to make sure they re all together and then a powerset recipe to generate all the n-of-a-kinds excluding the empty sets

databases usually choose between sorting and hashing when creating grouping for grouping by or distinct operations

also in some cases sorting and grouping operations are faster when implemented in php rather than in sql

alter how i am joining the tables together so that the sorting of the results for the grouping by is more efficient and then hopefully remove the tmp table as well

your desired output does not reflect what you have as input if you want to grouping common sublists you can use itertools.groupby considering you want sorted output using a dict and then sorting makes less sense than just creating the grouping from the sorted list using groupby

1- i have used virtual mode and works fine but i will lose filtering sorting grouping functionality which i need them somehow

i would recommend sorting the products in sql then grouping the results by first letter using the collections groupby

while those queries look very similar i suspect orderdate includes time information so the sorting and grouping is much more expensive and lead to many more rows in the subquery for the second query

grouping is certainly possible with itertools.groupby but that would require sorting making that less performant compared to a defaultdict plus loop solution

i think these paging sorting grouping would get easier while using third party tools

this way only a single int column needs to be sorted grouping which performs much better than sorting two text columns

does linq use any sorting or other mechanisms to make a grouping join more efficient so it doesn t have to loop through an entire collection for every unmatched item

so i started thinking that sorting would be faster if i created an index on the column that i plan to always sort on even if the rest of my query is missing where grouping by having etc

then for each grouping you have double click the grouping select sorting and then add as many sorting fields as you need for the info contained at that grouping level

how to hide certain column if user choose filtering sorting or grouping in xtragridview devexpress windows form

when not sorting before grouping it is much faster but then i get values from random parts of hour

in data tab select grouping to create grouping after sorting accordingly

select specified grouping order from the drop down for grouping sorting

but if you are sorting and only want the top row then a max or min and a grouping be more straight forward

on myisam tables in some cases the subselects tend to be faster than grouping by queries due to the fact that grouping by in myisam is quite expensive due to sorting materialization overhead

if your report processes large volume of data with aggregation sorting grouping having more ram improves performance

in my experience hashing is always faster than sorting for joining and for grouping

for more day-to-day end users having canned reports that might be modified by the end user via a simple user interface that allows them to modify restrictions grouping sorting is more useful

select grouping properties... then on dialog select sorting by default it will be showing the first column name change to the desired column and sorting order by a-z or z-a button

select enable interactive sorting - groups- select grouping name in list - sort by count services

i know how to sort a text file alphabetically but i m trying to do more than sorting grouping

when using sorted comparator on the stream before the collect operation the stream has to buffer the entire stream contents to be able to sort it and the sorting may involve much more data movement within that buffer compared to sorting the smaller lists of the grouping afterwards

apparently groupby with count and sorting the grouping was noticeably faster with sparksql

in addition lets say if i have an search results sorting function i want randomly pick grouping of users to sort it in descending order by time and other grouping to see it ascending order

sorting criteria function simply checks if the count field of the first grouping is greater than the other

if they do choose sorting you might get lucky and the sorting is stable between the application of grouping by and the actual result set consumption

in design mode you need to right-click on an empty part of the report an select sorting and grouping

make the excludes annotation more legibile by sorting the different parameters into different grouping

first sort the dataframe by time this should be more efficient than sorting each grouping by time

for more complex reports you ll need to have more control over grouping and sorting controlling the order of both

in access 2003 with the report open in design view select sorting and grouping from the view menu

sorting rdd by a key sort within a grouping will have not more than 100 records in that grouping


extjs	gxt	2
i have worked pretty heavily with both flavors of the gwt extjs libraries though i ve spent more time with gxt recently

if the added overhead of all the extjs libraries are too much for you in gwt-ext then the gxt project from extjs may be more your speed


shiny	rcharts	1
possibly part of the reason of my problems is that the original code from ramnath uses rmaps while i m using rcharts also developed by ramnath as it is more developed better integrated with shiny and of course includes leaflet


cpu	irq	3
in some cases irq constitutes more than 8 of cpu for a process

cannot sleep run atomically in soft irq context and are guaranteed to never run on more than one cpu of a given processors for a given tasklet

ten years ago intel vtune recommended not more than 1000 irq s www.cs.utah.edu mhall cs4961f09 vtune-1.pdf try to get about a 1000 samples per second per logical cpu


murmurhash	md5	2
murmurhash has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than md5 largely owing to md5 being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that

but as that reference points out murmurhash is way faster than md5 and sha functions although it doesn t do a direct comparison to the object.gethashcode method i mentioned above


opcache	apc	3
i am using yii 1.1.12 and recently upgraded my php from 5.3 to 5.5 and have found that apc is no longer to be used because opcache has been made part of php5.5

i don t want to use apc because opcache is around 10 faster than apc

zend opcache appears to be more performant than apc more fully featured and more reliable


equals	tostring	5
the same result can be obtained also by comparing tostring of each map as you suggested but using equals is a more intuitive approach

if you compare a string with only digits will compare equals using to a number it represents and possibly other objects that have a tostring equals to that

so 0.1m 0.10m and 0.100m may compare as equals they are stored differently as value scale 1 1 10 2 and 100 3 respectively and will be printed as 0.1 0.10 and 0.100 respectively by tostring

tostring itself uses an iterator just like equals but is a more inefficient approach

you can compare performance between tostring + equals and jsonobject.similar


libs	buildpath	13
if you are using eclipse you can import them directly via eclipse to your lib folder right click on project folder select buildpath libs tab and add jar or just copy jar directly to lib folder then rightclick and build path - add to buildpath

project right click properties- java buildpath select libs and add android-support.jar the follow these step

this is my issue to solve the problem right click your project and select buildpath next select add libs and add your private jars

just right click on project then select buildpath then configure buildpath inside buildpath click on libs then click on add external jars and add this google-map or whatever jar file which you need

project right click properties- java buildpath select libs and add external .jar the follow these step

right click on your project select buildpath configurebuildpath and select the tab libs

step7 right click on project2 go to properties select buildpath then click on libs then click ok button then ok

the solution here is to export external libs from the original project configure buildpath - order and export - select libs to be exported instead of adding them to the buildpath of the test project directly

first make project right click properties- java buildpath select libs and add jar android-support-v4.jar the follow these step

right click build.xml --- build path --- configure buildpath --- select libs tab

so after thath right click on your project under eclipse than select buildpath add libs then select junit next select junit version tehn continue

yes you can right click on project -- property -- java buildpath -- and select libs tab and select add jar or add external java into lib folder.

this is my way to solve the problem right click on your project and select buildpath next select add libs and add your private jars


readr	tidyr	1
we can use tidyverse extract from tidyr to split group into group and decision then replace the group value to 1 if the percentage extracted the number with parse_number from readr is greater than or equal to 90


prop	each	5
after running this query how can i memcache entities that match each prop separately

if you really want to you can edit the font-lock-keywords variable set by python-mode to match each keyword separately and instead of just naming a font-lock target as your facespec give a list face face prop value ... with as many props and values as you prefer

needless to say each product has more than one prop which is kept in the producthas table

if you want to select each component individually via prop that also you can do via -

teamcity	jenkins	6
as a solution for .net i can recommend teamcity but you can also use jenkins

it would be nice to compare teamcity extensive notifications setup with the same of hudson or jenkins

i prefer using teamcity but jenkins is much more popular

recently i watched presentation about git+jenkins+gerrit where i saw something similar but for .net development i personally prefer teamcity but if it s much easier to do that with jenkins i change my mind

in contrast to jenkins teamcity produces much more detailed reports and provides the ability to track the history of a test- how often does it get broken etc. suspend tests .

i know that teamcity has a way of achieving this but i think that jenkins is more constrictive


cairngorm	mate	1
i m more familiar with mate than cairngorm but what i do in this situation is to back up my pop up with a model and dispatch the events off of the model


mapply	do.call	2
i don t quite understand why you don t want to use mapply but do.call is probably better anyway

if for some strange reason you can do the obvious do.call would be more efficient than mapply


strcpy	memmove	3
marcus yes memmove is faster than strcpy and faster than python but why

using memmove or memcpy can outperform strcpy handily see why is python faster than c for some illustrations and timing

i modified the c code to produce more stable timings for me on my machine mac os x 10.7.4 8 gib 1333 mhz ram 2.3 ghz intel core i7 gcc 4.7.1 and to compare strcpy and strcat vs memcpy vs memmove


glut	sdl	9
you can use glfw sdl or glut for getting those personally i recommend glfw if you need only one single window

i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better

if you re building a simple demo of a rendering mechanism glut is way better than sdl it takes care of a lot of the details that sdl would otherwise require

recently i migrated over to sdl from glut to get more control over the main loop

however if you re developing a serious application sdl is more likely to be the tool you need to use as glut abstracts more than a real application would normally want to

glut is much more easier while many of people use sdl or sfml they re more flexible and feature-full than glut

if you use another library like glut or sdl it becomes much easier let the library worry about setting up a window and then you can focus on learning opengl

unfortunately there is no shader driven opengl example that i can refer to the provided examples on the glut repo and sdl only use older fixed-function rendering and don t use any shaders that i can see

furthermore glut and sdl make it easier to port your opengl application to different platforms


force.com	salesforce	3
consider using force.com canvas now ga which is an added-value iframe with more security and easier integration with salesforce apis than raw iframes - see

in fact no matter which user license i select force.com chatter free or salesforce platform i still can t see the recruiter profile in the profile dropdown

i work as a technical lead for cloud development at the daily telegraph and i d highly recommend using salesforce force.com for any crm requirements


base-class	derived-class	1
so based on type of the pointer he ll pick base-class method or if the pointer is of type derived-class then he ll pick that method


wunderground	openweathermap	1
i see that the paid version of wunderground has some higher tiers with more features but openweathermap s free tier allows a huge number of uses


avassetexportsession	avassetreader	1
in my experience avassetexportsession is slightly more performant than using avassetreader and avassetwriter for a straight forward format a - format b type conversion however that said it s probably not by enough to be too concerned about


nodevalue	innerhtml	1
nodevalue is a little more confusing to use but faster than innerhtml


vim	gedit	5
normal people prefer gedit instead of vim

if vim seems too much by the moment i think that kate is better than gedit

if you re just going to use vim the same way you use gedit don t bother - gedit is better than vim at being gedit

if you are on linux eg ubuntu you may try gedit for ease of use with some plug-ins but to handle very large files you re better off with vim

i don t know anything about except that it s more powerful than gedit but doesn t have the same feel as vim emacs


matlab	simulink	4
for that purpose i want to transform the simulink model into a c version and launch it from a matlab script so that the process would be much faster than opening simulink environment

it s difficult to tell without seeing the simulink model but i suspect that in simulink you are using a variable-step solver which is able to take much smaller time steps than in your matlab file giving you more accurate results

i d like to use the data signal processing toolbox in matlab if i buy a matlab license and the toolbox do i need to buy simulink too

all charts that i found compare matlab simulink x fortran but do not specify if the matlab code is compiled or not using matlab coder toolbox


fgets	atoi	1
so here fgets is reading more than one integer at a time from file so atoi is not getting the integers in file too


direct3d	gdi	2
so decide what you want to use direct3d is significaly faster than gdi

still i expect the vector based apis offered by opengl and direct3d should perform far more reliably - gdi line drawing is not something driver writers strive to optimize


ssl	https	43
as last resort resolution i don t suggest this for security issues using ssl is always safer switch your registry to use http instead of https

you can handle it on your server side by using your hosting cpanel plesk etc.simply change all request the type on both http and https if you want to enable only https requests then configure it on only https .for more details how to configure and enable ssl on godaddy kindly view full details on the given link

i guess openssl is smth like tool to create a keys ive alredy done this for firstdata.com but if i buy ssl certificate on thawte.com and install it ill have my web-site running over https

the ssl handshake overhead associated with https is more than 50 of the bandwidth currently

if i disable ssl in server.xml then i lose https

i have my site in wordpress initially i have purchase ssl certificate and using https version to show in google search result

if you are using the standard port testing for will also work but of course checking if https is used is better than testing if the port is the default ssl port

in the case of phpmyadmin - if this is running on a webserver on your network then you ll need to forward port 80 too - although i d recommend using https ssl port 443

i m assuming using https without a ssl certificate is atleast more secure than doing the exact same connection over plain http since atleast it s encrypted and an evildoer would have to make a much larger effort to intercept en decrypt the information

if i try to add more than 1 ssl binding i get the error at least one other site is using the same https binding and the binding is configured with a different certificate ...

if you have a secure ftp sftp server or secure http ssl https server then curl can accept ssh keys although using an ssl key is more commonly accepted on the internet. it can use those keys to authenticate and establish a secure connection to the directories which have been made public to your user through the server

i d recommend using https as you do seem to be sending authentication data over websockets which will also use the ssl no

if you need to secure payloads that pass through multiple participants then you need something more than https ssl since https ssl only encrypts one link of the graph

ssl the s in https has more states but since it follows a fairly linear progression does not really have any kind of complex diagram

-security concerns if this is a web application which i think it is as you mentioned lightweight you re better off with a ssl certificate which encrypts all traffic to from your server by using https

this being said the rfc 6125 guidelines meant to be applicable to any protocol that uses ssl tls are more or less the same as those for https which are defined in rfc 2818 http over tls section 3.1

there is a limitation on creating virtual hosts for name based virtual host while using ssl 443 port so if you want to have more than one https port enabled you will need ip based virtual hosting

i already understand that just encrypting form data is an extremely weak practice compared to using tls ssl and won t stop people who are determined to break the encryption from doing it so please refrain from any you should be using https -only comments though if you know a free hosting provider that allows https i d be more than happy too hear about them

choose https from type dropdown then choose your newly created certificate in this case mydevcert from the ssl certificate drop down

always use tls which is ssl which is https more or less

for basic authentication over ssl there are some easier workarounds if it is possible to have the web site change to allow https and basic auth that would be easiest

if you want to debug https traffic as well you ll need to right click on the requests in the list and select ssl proxying and then re-attempt the request

i recommend using ssl https in all cases

as far as i know you cannot configure more than one https virtual host for each ip that s it name based virtual hosting is limited to only one ssl virtual host

https is more flexible than ssl an application can configure the level of security it needs

i m not sure about iis 6 but in iis 7 you select the site and go to bindings and click add select https it will automaticaly chose port 443 and then chose your ssl cerificate

that wouldn t secure the user s browser but would make it difficult for an outside observer who can somehow defeat ssl -- you should be using https

ssl tls provide better encryption decryption over https

is it enough to buy ssl certificate and install it into iis7 to get secure https connection

it used to not support https read more in android downloadmanager and ssl https however it does now

it could be a sni problem if you use any kind of load balancer https proxy or more than 1 ssl certificate on the same ip

buy ssl certificate and go with https

the match specifies https but that site does not support ssl

it is clearly more threatening to browse a website with self-signed https certificate than browsing the exact same website with http so are those modern browser behaviors a scam to make honest companies buy ssl certificate that they may not need

http is slightly more performant than https as the ssl handshake doesn t need to happen however anybody hackers can see everything that your users can see

i am using a java program to send an http request to a website with ssl https to do more exactly so i am sending request with proxy but i have continually errors with connection i am sending the request with jaunt api i get connection 1 or 2 time but then i get error connection searching in google i read that a guy say that i have to enable ssl debugging and he say that i have to use

you could always use https that will work both on http and https websites but loading a https resource is slower than loading a http resource because of the encryption and ssl handshakes

https can be quite slow over a 3g connection as the overhead in terms of number of packets to setup an ssl connection is higher than a plain tcp connection.

you can optionally handle http 403.4 code ssl required more gracefully by automatically redirecting the client to the https version of the page

i searched apple s documentation on webview with cmd+f for https 0 matches ssl 0 matches and even secure again 0 matches

i recommend using ssl https in production or credentials will be passed in plain text or base64

use type https port 443 ssl choose ssl certificate

if you do it over ssl https it is probably more secure


facebooker2	koala	2
relevant discussion here as well is fb_graph or koala ruby gem better than facebooker2 using the facebook graph

is fb_graph or koala gem better than facebooker2


playsound	mci	1
window media player uses directshow which gives you better performance and greater flexibility than playsound under mci


sproutcore	cappuccino	4
like bruz says cappuccino is probably more freeform at the data layer than sproutcore

sproutcore has a better data store api than the one cappuccino has

fwiw i find sproutcore to be easier to work with than cappuccino if you re interested in heavier non-progressive enhancement frameworks

sproutcore makes use of bindings better than cappuccino currently does


wav	riff	1
if you are having to roll your own wav riff writer remember java s data types are big-endian so any multi-byte primitives you write to your file must be written in reverse byte order to match riff s little-endianess


symfony	silex	4
in my case i needed speed right out of the box and silex provided me with the speed and although i am using most of the symfony components it is a lot faster than symfony out of the box

that is for symfony so not sure if silex has some better sugar

one that i prefer is silex because it promotes encourages good programming habits practices and as your projects grow you can seamlessly evolve into the more full-stack world of symfony

also take a look at silex as this has lower overhead than symfony and works with symfony forms


rcurl	httr	3
the httr package is a bit nicer than rcurl for making http requests in my opinion and it sets a user-agent string by default

besides parallelization i also read that httr might be a better alternative to rcurl

the new package httr provides a wrapper around rcurl to make it easier to scrape all kinds of pages


subversive	javahl	1
i like subclipse because it allows me to choose between svnkit and javahl while subversive uses javahl only


ordereddictionary	sorteddictionary	1
it might not be the most efficient way to do it but i ve used ordereddictionary though sorteddictionary is probably more appropriate for handling the out of order issue in the past


lcds	graniteds	1
as an alternative you could consider using graniteds instead of blazeds graniteds has a much more powerful data management stack than blazeds it competes more with lcds and fully support lazy-loading for all major jpa engines hibernate eclipselink openjpa etc


jtextfield	jlabel	2
jtextfield is more than 1 line height and jlabel is not in left side

because copying text result from jtextfield is always easier than retyping it from jlabel note that jlabel is not focusable


hide	fadeout	5
fadeout is simpler because it will hide it for you automatically when it is done so you can save that code and it automatically waits for the animation to be done before hiding the element something your current code was not doing

jquery constructor selector length toarray get pushstack each map slice first last eq end push sort splice extend find filter not is init has closest index add addback parent parent parentsuntil next prev nextall prevall nextuntil prevuntil siblings children contents ready data removedata queue dequeue clearqueue promise on one off trigger triggerhandler text append prepend before after remove empty clone html replacewith detach dommanip appendto prependto insertbefore insertafter replaceall css show hide toggle fadeto animate stop finish slidedown slideup slidetoggle fadein fadeout fadetoggle delay val attr removeattr prop removeprop addclass removeclass toggleclass hasclass blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu hover bind unbind delegate undelegate wrapall wrapinner wrap unwrap serialize serializearray ajaxstart ajaxstop ajaxcomplete ajaxerror ajaxsuccess ajaxsend offset position offsetparent scrollleft scrolltop innerheight height outerheight innerwidth width outerwidth size andself

note the show hide effect is much softer because of the commented fadein fadeout declarations that were triggering console errors probably because jsfiddle uses jquery slim now

according to this test - hide is slightly faster then fadeout since it doesn t use animations

or more ideally you might want to change show hide to jquery fadein fadeout which is more appropriate for back to top indicators


erd	entity-relationship	1
first entity-relationship modeling is more than just an erd


pugixml	rapidxml	2
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of he had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42

rapidxml and pugixml are more preferred


pdcurses	ncurses	4
for cross platform terminal operations like this i would recommend ncurses and pdcurses

i ve found pdcurses which is more like the ncurses but it lacks a lot of ncurses libraries

if you are creating a text based game i would recommend using ncurses or pdcurses for windows

use ncurses or pdcurses might be easier to set up on windows. if you can t then don t clear the screen as that causes flicker


fasttext	word2vec	3
fasttext is not better than word2vec as for as semantic similarity is concerned

i want to compare word2vec and fasttext model based on this comparison tutorial

1 is possible then will word2vec be more efficient in text-based plagiarism detection than wordnet or any other word embeddings like glove fasttext etc


bufferedreader	bufferedwriter	2
on my hardware copying a 1gb text file line by line using bufferedreader and bufferedwriter takes less than 5s in some runs and more than 30s in other

i have coded a routine to compute the cartesian product of different tables as in a database with the only exception that the tables are stored as files in my case and for computing the cartesian product i am using file i o for reading files i am using filereader coupled with bufferedreader and for writing files i am using filewriter coupled with bufferedwriter now as i am performing every computation externally in files i.e i compute the product as follows i take a row from file-1 which is table-1 in my case and concatenate it with every other row in file-2 which is table-2 in my case and write it to an external file which holds the result


copying	overwrite	1
this option is better than simply copying the file as it allows you to overwrite an existing file but you still don t get direct access to the file s properties


prng	random	9
the non-random random behaviour is more a reflection on the quality of the rand prng â it is often not very good

would it maybe be wise to use this somewhat dynamic memory usage as a seed for a prng to generate more quickly random numbers

if you seed a prng from a truly random source and then just keep calling the prng to get more numbers then you will just have a pseudorandom sequence of numbers albeit well seeded

sqlite contains a high-quality pseudo-random number generator prng used to select random rowids when inserting new records into a table that already uses the largest possible rowid

to avoid having to do so many reads from dev random which can run out of entropy you can instead do as indiv suggested in the comments seed a prng to generate more seeds

then you use it as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and its output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker

a proper prng should be much faster than division on big integers so this should be a better trade-off -- but this really depends on the performance of the random source and since it is a question of performance it cannot be fully answered without trying

but a large period prng takes up more memory for maintaining the internal state and also takes more time for generating a random number due to complex transitions and post processing

however the wikipedia article on gamma random variables suggest that more sophisticated methods are used in generating gamma random variables methods which involve multiple calls to the underlying prng


uicontrol	uigesturerecognizer	1
i much prefer using uicontrol over uigesturerecognizer to solve such problems because it handles events elegantly and obeys hierarchy so for instance if a uitableview is its subviews the uicontrol will not interfere with scroll and touch events on the uitableview


nyromodal	blockui	1
after some research and lot of quick prototyping i feel like my old companion nyromodal is the only option left for me which gives me flexibility of controlling it using its extensive api i went through other options given by the users and topup and blockui came closer rest of them are also good but doesn t meet my needs


g++	gcc	31
g++ seems to work better than gcc in my experience

here one should select gcc compiler and specify mingw32-g++ or just g++ or whichever compiler is desired

afaik it uses g++ to be more precise it uses gcc with language set to c++ and of course g++ for final linking

or maybe that is one of the reasons why visual studio gives slower codes than gcc g++ compiler

i am newbie of cmake and i was wondering for a c++ c project in the linux environmental how cmake can choose compilers between gcc and g++

gcc -e and g++ -e break even earlier

i don t believe ios has any kind of compiler built-in so you ll want to try to grab gcc or g++ from cydia

probably you ll need to set project type as c++ or set compiler name to g++ instead of gcc or add parameter -lstdc++ to command line eclipse uses for build

compare gcc -v file.cpp gcc can work with c++ files and g++ -v file.cpp to see the difference in linker commands that often causes the first to fail for example

i noticed though that when re-running the configure script if clang clang++ is in your path it will choose this over gcc g++ for its own compilation

and scons selects gcc instead of g++

i thought the file extension decides when the ide chooses between gcc and g++

to clarify based on the edit in the question the problem appears to be usage of c++11 features which is presumably default in visual studio where the gcc g++ will take a more reserved approach

and then select gcc g++ and msys base

outside of calling the wrong compiler using gcc instead of g++ see answer by dan it is possible but unusual to have gcc correctly built but g++ incorrectly built

i m always having to tune the code for gcc g++ differences - usually the given version of g++ is just more limited in what it allows

the g++ version is a little larger than the gcc version but not 100x larger

if it matters i m actually concerned with c++ and g++ but i thought gcc would be more recognizable as a generic compiler

i strongly recommend compiling with gcc -wall -wextra -g for c code or g++ -wall -wextra -g for c++ code also add other useful options such as

g++ compiler is more strict then gcc compiler

i d expect gcc g++ is more popular on open-source oses

finally to choose gcc an g++ version i followed this answer

unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code

so using g++ is better than gcc

some people argue gcc g++ is more popular on linux while icc is more popular on windows

note - i am using turbo c c++ compiler and ye si know gcc g++ etc are way better but the problem remains same

often gcc g++ code is faster than anything i can produce in asm probably because i am new to assembler and so i don t know very many instructions

but if it s not possible i ll prefer using g++ instead as don t know what else gcc may miss

did you select gcc g++ package devel while installing cygwin

note i think there was also a good reason to prefer g++ for c++ targets rather than using gcc

the package version number compat-gcc-34-c++.i686 doesn t match g++ gcc 4.8.1 20130603


jrails	ujs	1
i wouldn t recommend using jrails at this point because it s fairly outdated and as the episode mentions it kind of defeats the purpose of switching to jquery as the rails 2 helpers generate ujs


nltk	stanford-nlp	1
nltk is shy of stanford-nlp in terms of quality of output and for everything other than statistical collocation analysis as far as i can tell stanford-nlp has a broader range of practical algorithms


marionette	underscore.js	1
some newer with backbone only and older with marionette since marionette uses backbone both uses underscore.js


pandas	prettytable	1
a more lightweight approach than pandas is to use the prettytable module


migrate	staging	1
its not necessary and will potentially introduce bigger issues as you migrate your code to staging and production regions


ocean	petrel	1
if that s the case then for a plugin development company to do full plugin lifecycle development deployment testing can they only buy ocean sdk license and still be able to do it all without core petrel license


google-chrome	firefox	773
firefox for example has a lot in common with google-chrome and safari and google-chrome and safari are even more so closely related

that approach might also help you debug a problem like this because you can load the exported page in google-chrome or firefox and use more sophisticated debugging tools

basically the way google-chrome renders text looks ugly and i want it to look like or almost like firefox or safari which looks thinner and better

to make firefox and google-chrome behave more like ie7 add z-index 0 to all elements with no z-index specified

ie8 is the same and firefox is much better but i ve migrated away to google-chrome now so would like to stick with the one browser if possible

with firefox it was very easy i just grabbed the apk from their ftp server run the adb install command one would think it should be even easier with google-chrome but it s really not

however firefox takes significantly longer to run this code about 180 milliseconds on firefox compared to roughly 30 on ie and google-chrome and does not see that same reduction in run time that ie and google-chrome does

thus i think firefox is perhaps more right but other developers at google-chrome think otherwise

google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum

currently with the 10px top padding the cells in google-chrome look taller than in firefox

you can then access this page in a browser that has developer tools i would recommend firefox w firebug or google-chrome and then look at how long the calls are taking

by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in firefox left the button is 2px taller than in google-chrome right

i guess google-chrome is a bit more forgiving than firefox

google-chrome was more tolerant showed the button while firefox caught the bad selector

you might be able to avoid asking this sort of question in the future if you start using a google-chrome s inspect element context menu command or b firebug for firefox which is more or less the same thing

some css updates may also be needed but this may help firefox behave more like google-chrome for your html

maybe google-chrome is working faster than firefox try adding a wait with expected conditions

google-chrome seems to allow this i do not know why but firefox is somewhat stricter

firefox absolutely destroys google-chrome on these kinds of operations dat asm.js optimization but the results are unclear to me

i used firefox as it can be configured to download to a default directory but i don t think the google-chrome situation is any better

firefox is even slower that google-chrome

sometimes firefox might come out on top whereas other times google-chrome might be faster still

i m trying to normalize the behavior by rotating the camera in firefox to match google-chrome

for my website i noticed that tooltip delay in firefox was much higher than in google-chrome

i have this working fine in google-chrome osx win firefox osx win safari opera osx

i was testing on google-chrome win7 but with firefox it seems worse

the first thing i ve noticed that in ie version 8 to be specific a callback attached to window.scroll or .resize seemed to fire so many times more than in google-chrome or firefox while resizing the window or scrolling

also changing google-chrome s zoom level to 125 to better match firefox s zoom level only exacerbates the problem with a new footer height of 8.297px

the problem with this approach is it works mostly in google-chrome but not in firefox which is slower

but in order to debug your code and find the errors - i strongly recommend using firefox with firebug extension installed or google-chrome with developer tools open menu - tools - developer tools - check out your network tab - you will see there the files that load - the time they take for that - and check also the console for javascript errors

apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

i would also recommend using firefox with firebug or firefox google-chrome with the inspect element context menu so you can see what styles are being applied to the various elements on your page when they don t act like you expect

firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions

it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome it sends more than one requests to servlet and finally there is exception in servlet and it doesn t work

win firefox google-chrome mac google-chrome firefox

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

does google-chrome and firefox use more resources on the scroll method

i recommend firefox as having a superior object browser to google-chrome but you can also.

though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in google-chrome which is worse than extra space in firefox ie

compare safari or google-chrome and firefox click the tabs

but in firefox the left-collumn gets a much bigger height than in google-chrome

it appears firefox and older versions of google-chrome are far less picky with content-type headers on file downloads for apk s

also i would like to tell you that one method fits all works but isn t always good browsers like google-chrome and firefox can use fancier methods like server sent events or web sockets there s a lot of parser libraries that check which functions are supported by the current browser and uses the best one if you re going to use server sent events for example which aren t supported in ie yet you could easily handle that with something like this example and fall back to long polling only in ie

i d say that firefox is correct in being stricter than google-chrome here even though i m not entirely sure the base uri has changed and this new uri should be used for the relative uri #symboltype1 too

google-chrome and firefox are dramatically faster using this method which will destroy attached jquery data

if we remove the font-size it appears properly in google-chrome but shows up smaller in firefox

google-chrome has no issues in this code.the default zoom level of firefox is higher than it was in the earlier version

in any case google-chrome and firefox are smarter than ie

check in firefox in google-chrome we have a cross-browser thinking

i personally strongly prefer google-chrome s developer tools over firefox firebug but regardless which one you choose learn how to use the debugger

google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations

the performance in google-chrome is best less so in firefox and ie

google-chrome extensions are considerably more limited than firefox extensions â â they can only hook the behavior of the browser in certain predefined ways

compare it with google-chrome and firefox to see the problem

for something more manual i would recommend google-chrome dev tools or for firefox firebug as mentioned in another answer

if you are able to enforce browser usage i find that google-chrome on android preserves line breaks when copying and pasting much better than firefox

use firefox rather than google-chrome - google-chrome with dev mode is much slower than firefox

firefox s default textbox includes more padding than ie google-chrome

i know firefox google-chrome provide svg support and i have the feeling that google-chrome is faster at rendering but maybe there are other standalone svg renderers that i m missing

when i compare google-chrome web inspector and firefox devtools in firefox developer edition google-chrome web inspector wins

however mobile device emulation is one of the point where the google-chrome devtools are more feature rich than firefox firebug

a very quick test suggests that the difference is probably negligible in google-chrome but that firefox is substantially quicker with indexof for short strings at least

i recommend using google-chrome or firefox s firebug

in the left size you will see a list of applications choose firefox google-chrome ie or whatever you need and it will display only packets sent and received by that application

if you drop the max-width 100 on the img style rules then you ll see that google-chrome changes its rendering to match firefox refuses to let the logo shrink unless you add min-width 0 .

firefox can get away with more than google-chrome before aborting

after updating joomla to 3.8.1 today most of the admin tabbing and navigation functions stopped working in google-chrome firefox win safari and ie 11

ps google-chrome is recommend firefox tends to crash

in firefox it s less noticeable but in google-chrome it s very noticeable

it worked perfectly with google-chrome but safari 5 and firefox implement a more recent version of the websocket protocol and cramp does not so i couldn t get it to work there

safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

animation effect works fine for the lower image with firefox and ie-9 browsers whereas google-chrome does not show animation

i faced with the same problem in firefox google-chrome limit is greater as i see

button you will notice that the sign in panel fieldset#login-controls is shown improperly compare with firefox or google-chrome

however with this method image in firefox appears to be blurred at least if resized and in google-chrome it looks lighter sic

i have tried firefox and it better than google-chrome crash issue is not always happen but not solved this issue

using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

here does internet explorer beat google-chrome firefox if am not wrong

and i can t use a special browser like suggested here because major browsers like firefox or google-chrome are more reliable in terms of updates and supported features

the text is vertically centered on google-chrome and firefox but on ie 7 and 8 the baseline of the text is centered instead so it is several pixels higher than in firefox .

not all browsers support all operation most notable is firefox not supporting darker use multiply instead but google-chrome edge and firefox support all the others listed above

browsers firefox win osx google-chrome win osx ie win safari osx ios opera osx

i would strongly recommend you use the web developer tools that exist in most modern browsers i prefer google-chrome s but firefox has good ones too

so i wonder the benchmark is also influenced by the installed extensions or google-chrome is really so much higher than firefox in performance

i have been working with linear parsers lately and noticed the performance in google-chrome v37 was much slower than in firefox v30

i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s

latest google-chrome and firefox throw a more accurate one but i think v8 only recently fixed the error message so perhaps upgrading to node v11 will show a correct version

in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

when i open my site with mozilla firefox and google-chrome the font in mozilla seems thicker than google-chrome

in ie8 and google-chrome it runs even faster than firefox in general and this slow down never happens

and of course the results - if they are reproducible - might suggest that google-chrome is faster than firefox or that firefox just prioritises timeouts over dom events

ie handles updates better than google-chrome and firefox

onblur on the select firefox google-chrome internet explorer fires too late only when actually leaving the select

i had created the website www.suezre.com and when viewed in google-chrome or firefox figcaption on the pictures looks good but on safari it takes much more space

this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

is it because google-chrome has much better javascript support than firefox

i assume firefox google-chrome would have better performance than other browsers for innerhtml tag

if forced to pick a required browser i d prefer firefox or google-chrome

in firefox this might be handled a little nicer than google-chrome but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need

now i recognized that safari make more problems then the other browsers like google-chrome or firefox

however since around 2006 think ie7+ firefox 2+ google-chrome etc browsers no longer provide the full file path they only provide the file s name without directory information

this doesn t happen in google-chrome and is less frequent in firefox than in ie

2 install the firefox extension there s also one for google-chrome but the firefox one is more reliable -- so if you re a google-chrome addict like i am then use both

i would recommend using google-chrome s dev tools cmd+alt+i on mac or firefox s firebug extension to inspect the http request

please compare firefox and google-chrome

compare firefox with google-chrome for this fiddle which used this code

this sample rate might be lower as only google-chrome and firefox are supported

of late firefox has had much better performance than google-chrome

there s an awesome tool called jsfiddle that will help - also i recommend using google-chrome dev tools or firebug for firefox

firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie

the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using

i use process monitor then select file nearly 200mb both google-chrome and firefox not eat more memory or reading disk

ie 8 is much worse than firefox and google-chrome runs smoothly

at one point i even had a small scale on the .pan class that looked great in google-chrome but was even worse on firefox

spidermonkey firefox is slower 50 of google-chrome max speed but the speed is consistent

seems to be mac google-chrome related problem works fine on win google-chrome mac safari mac firefox

the next text is an overlay between firefox und google-chrome - firefox is broader

i tried here but google-chrome doesn t show any styling except font color while firefox shows some more

here s a sample to show my problem please compare google-chrome firefox behaviors

we use google-chrome though which i believe uses more ram than firefox

google-chrome extensions are much easier to learn and create than firefox

i want to set my own time limit rather than use the browser s default i believe google-chrome s is much longer than firefox s

why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome on my laptop

using mac os 10.10 i would prefer google-chrome or firefox but i am open to other browsers if it provides a solution

try your current setup in google-chrome google-chrome typically has a narrower minimum viewport width and try something like min-width 600px in firefox and your styles should be applied as expected layout.css will be applied when the viewport is at least 600px wide

i use ie8 from time to time at my work pc even though i prefer firefox and google-chrome chromium

it s clearly visible in firefox and is far more subtle yet also distinguishable in google-chrome

i know different engines render fonts differently and but the issue i m having is that firefox renders the font higher than google-chrome - at the size i am displaying the font this is very noticeable 3 or 4 px - which on a button means they re totally misaligned

firefox and google-chrome are much better

firefox and google-chrome are more lenient here

we wish google-chrome was better but the reality is that it s still not as good as firefox

google-chrome does not check revocation in most cases and firefox might use a shorter timeout and ignore failures

google-chrome shows weird error but firefox shows more specific issue

google-chrome leads over firefox in my tests but it can still take 5-8 seconds for the browser to render 300 records

firefox which is more standards-compliant than google-chrome doesn t allow this

if you re in a browser without a console i d recommend grabbing firefox and firebug to go with it or google-chrome and it s included developer tools

the text-shadow is used for text outline there view the page in google-chrome compare with firefox or ie you will see how bad it is

i m not sure if google-chrome has the same features but if you don t have firefox or just like google-chrome better then pressing f12 will open developer tools same as in opera and internet explorer although i personally prefer firefox with firebug plugin

i would like this function to work in firefox ie google-chrome etc but at the moment it only works in google-chrome and older than firefox version 49

if you re using firefox check out firebug but i prefer google-chrome s tools and find them better integrated and user friendly mostly from having used them a lot more

on the web console you ll see the following uncaught typeerror object 0 has no method match google-chrome or typeerror c.match is not a function firefox or script438 object doesn t support property or method match ie

because the headers positions donâ t match with firefox â œheaders position habitsâ servers can know something fishy is going on the user might use a google-chrome extension to spoof its user-agent

google-chrome and firefox might work better in terms of task prioritization but anyway i don t imagine a case where you try to append 100 dom elements at once while you send a bunch of ajax requests

if you need to test with firefox then use an older version or google-chrome with the chromedriver

google-chrome and firefox being more standards compliant expect javascript client-side code

is there a way to get firefox to behave more like google-chrome when it comes to focus being set by mouse clicks without having to sacrifice accessibility by setting outline to none or 0

i use google-chrome as my main browser but sometimes firefox has much more verbose errors warnings that can make debugging a complex issue easier

i have encounter a problem with google-chrome that is similar to an older issue with firefox at this url scrolling blocks javascript execution in firefox

this does not happen in google-chrome or firefox and happens much less often locally where the response of the server is much quicker

request status is 0 when i chose google-chrome if i choose firefox then another error occurred the error obviously tell me a php scripts dose not work well but it seems really well

i would recommend using google-chrome s developer tools or firebug for firefox and inspect the element of the page right-click then inspect element

i recommend using firefox or google-chrome

svg performance in firefox is slower than in webkit google-chrome and ie10

notably this doesn t happen in all browsers google-chrome renders more smoothly than ie and firefox for instance but is there any way i can make those white lines stop appearing when the user zooms in

firefox is more picky about characters that are set in uris than google-chrome

so far this works how i wanted on google-chrome but it doesnt look the same when on firefox and looks even worse on ie 10

if the loop is very tight time-budget-wise there will simply not be any room for the browser to do other tasks such as gc - for google-chrome this task seem to be secondary versus firefox which gives this higher priority likely to get more performance out of its engine

in google-chrome a basic for-loop is faster than i-- and --i while in firefox it s slower

this problem was harsher in firefox 24 than in google-chrome 29 since firefox would crash sooner around 2000 ms sooner than google-chrome

i have a search positioned absolutely beside my navigation but the top is 10px lower than firefox in google-chrome so basically if it is centered in firefox it hangs low on google-chrome

if you take that segment of html code and run it in a browser i tested it with latest google-chrome and firefox it adds one more th element in the table the final page has 4 columns instead of 3 and i have absolutely no clue why this happens

in my task manager i see how the memory of google-chrome or firefox is getting bigger and bigger up to 512 mb

this jsfiddle demonstrates the problem compare safari google-chrome to firefox

it worked fine in ie9 google-chrome and firefox which are more forgiving

so far i got it working in updated versions of safari mac google-chrome win firefox win and ie11

update3 now it works here which means that i couldn t fully reproduce my bug to show it to you but in general the problem is that the height of 5x5 table in google-chrome is less from firefox on 22px which is 22px gap between table container and a table itself

i haven t tried it on ie 9 but i can only imagine it being harder than google-chrome firefox

however i dont overly like debugging in firefox and much prefer google-chrome

here google-chrome cannot decide weather ma stands for march or may and gives an invalid date while firefox doesnt

the developer tools that should be available in your browser firefox or google-chrome will give better insight as to what s causing the problem

this happens in firefox and also in google-chrome cells shrink less in google-chrome but not in safari

first of all i wouldn t recommend using google-chrome s built-in datepicker as using your approach makes the input box completely unusable in firefox

i ve learned partly by trawling this site that the google-chrome security is fussier and the app loads correctly without errors in firefox and ie but i can t find any resources that are loaded from a non https source

on my computer firefox performs much better than google-chrome on these tests using jsperf

the code looks good in firefox but in google-chrome there are bigger spaces between the items

select inspect google-chrome or insect element firefox

the td with the little content stay shrinked its content stay as is not expanded and this happens in case of ie only firefox and google-chrome are fine both of firefox and google-chrome do expand the smaller td content to fill 100 of that td s height my question is how to expand the content of the smaller td to fill 100 of its height

as per me google-chrome and firefox are better for java script

you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both google-chrome lines up perfectly but firefox seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or google-chrome dev tools

rendering without buffering on google-chrome is faster than firefox so i m actually not sure why google-chrome is having such a problem with drawimage

try to click on the div in google-chrome ie firefox and then compare with opera

as others have encountered it looks great in mac win firefox mac win google-chrome safari and even win ie 8 9

2.open corresponding page in browser with adequate developers console i prefer google-chrome but firefox should also do open js console type name of the js variable and

should make ie google-chrome and firefox react more consistantly

also why does firefox perform way better than google-chrome on this benchmark

google-chrome being probably faster than ie or firefox seems to handle this differently

google-chrome renders longer input fields than firefox and ie

i test on win google-chrome and don t know how it works on safari firefox ie opera

also google-chrome has a great tool that allows you to edit css on the fly which i find more useful and quicker than using firefox s extensions

i think it s simply because google-chrome firefox safari etc. are faster browsers

while clicking open the dropdown before selecting the dropdownoption i wanted worked in google-chrome and internet explorer firefox was less forgiving and showed the weird behaviour

phantomjs achieves a better accuracy than firefox slightly lower than google-chrome but in around half the time of firefox

as for firefox being slower at rendering than google-chrome i can assure you that for most practical purposes it s not

but on all of the mobile browsers i ve tried firefox google-chrome opera it s much smaller around 25 of the size specified

is this due to firefox being more strict than google-chrome

while in google-chrome usually another page refresh fix it firefox is more stubborn

what we can see is that regardless of raw hardware power google-chrome seems to run up to three times faster than edge and also significantly faster than firefox all updated to the latest verion

firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

google-chrome is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than firefox is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause

i think it doesn t work entirely correctly in ie6 but it is fine in ie7-8 firefox safari win opera google-chrome

in fact i ran some tests at dhtml kitchen and found that in firefox opera and google-chrome document.write was actually faster on the first load and comparable in speed of standard html on subsequent refreshes

tested in win firefox ipad safari android 4.1 google-chrome environments

i ve tested this on mac win google-chrome firefox safari android devices iphone4 5 and ipad ios6

in my experience google-chrome will be a lot faster than firefox to debug huge js files

i think from my tests perhaps firefox has more strict standards than google-chrome about cookie manipulation

it fails to run on mac google-chrome win firefox and win google-chrome

to really see what is going on i d strongly recommend you use the developer tools in the browser of your choice - personally i d recommend google-chrome developer tools but firefox has a pretty good set both native and using the popular firebug extension

i have a small table and the internet explorer 11 adds padding to the cells so the hole table is bigger than in google-chrome or firefox

google-chrome and firefox are more forgiving to such careless of developers

reducing cols fix issue on firefox but on ie google-chrome it show more space towards right

on google-chrome it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on firefox it s slightly faster to do this using bool

do you have any idea why google-chrome loads javascript function much slower than firefox

if i choose google-chrome or firefox the breakpoint doesn t work for me

even if you give the inputs a attribute firefox renders them wider than google-chrome

also for animations google-chrome chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in firefox

support exists in firefox and my test just confirmed thisâ but the handle is a little less noticeable than in google-chrome

sometimes i have to open google-chrome and firefox or use more than one computer to plan my journey

for the client side i recommend google-chrome s developer tools integrated or the firebug add-on for firefox

after looking into the issue with the inspection tools of both browsers it seems that firefox is making the #main_nav_bar ul 10px wider than google-chrome

but it does seem like adding will make firefox behave more like google-chrome in this specific case

firefox and google-chrome allow more although i can t remember of the top of my head exactly how many

i m sticking with firefox debugging of my angular 2 app outside of vs code as its user experience is better than google-chrome especially when working with typescript files so i ll stick with that for now unless i can figure this out

i did one design which works for opera win firefox win + mac ie9 safari win mac ipad google-chrome win

note the same element can be located when we choose firefox and google-chrome as browser

there seems to be a couple of points scrolling down the page where it gets stuck in google-chrome also tested firefox it seemed slightly slower at that point but not broken with the scroll wheel or up down arrows only moving a couple of pixels at a time

but the text turns out to be much bigger under firefox compared to that under google-chrome

ie firefox higher than baseline google-chrome on baseline

i tried it on ie firefox and google-chrome and google-chrome processes were faster

select firefox or google-chrome

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

even ios outperforms google-chrome and firefox in css3 transitions

most noticeably if you look or google-chrome firefox and then internet explorer 9 you ll notice that the terms and conditions are slightly higher than in google-chrome or firefox and thus slightly touching the main content area

firefox - good a bit slower than google-chrome

google-chrome is just more forgiving for some mistakes then firefox

the advantage that you have is that unlike upgrading an operating system upgrading from ie7 to google-chrome 8 or firefox 3.6 is a more reachable goal for the average user of your app especially if you provide a link and upgrade instructions

but after one hour i see that firefox and google-chrome got more that 1 gb of memory and sometimes even firefox crashes

i m trying to add a ribbon to a page using css3 linear-gradients but the rendering in google-chrome looks a lot less pleasant than its firefox or ie alternative

what i need is if my anchor tag is near to end of the browser window and there s not enough space for the ui dialog window to appear the ie shows it down bringing the vertical bar the user has to scroll a lil bit to see the ui dialog this works fine in firefox and google-chrome as mentioned earlier

in internet explorer the tabspace has a width of approximately 10 spaces while in firefox and google-chrome it is more like 4 spaces

the points of data in firefox and safari are much smoother in google-chrome they don t go past the dots

i am using google webfonts and have come accross an issue with jagged and choppy font rendering in firefox and google-chrome ie11 renders them better

edit i tried ie google-chrome firefox to test and i found firefox reflects changes faster than others

i am using franklin gothic font for website and font looks good on google-chrome and safari but on internet explorer and mozilla firefox it looks darker

i found programming google-chrome extensions easier than firefox but i couldn t come across something similar to xpcom in google-chrome

but i am still curios why is the policy set stricter with google-chrome than for example firefox

ie is much slower than google-chrome firefox for all js work not only complex ones

in google-chrome it is appearing higher than the original in firefox

works in at least ie7 and later firefox 4.0 and later safari 4.0 and later win google-chrome 14.0 and later

evidently firefox debugger firebug is better than google-chrome debugger

the reason google-chrome is slower than firefox is that the devmode plugin runs in a sandbox so calls and data have to cross the sandbox boundaries

this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie

as you can see here a friend of mine did some testing and it seems that google-chrome and ie work a lot faster with the dot syntax while firefox and safari are more keen on the key syntax

that could be a problem google-chrome and firefox are better at helping to complete broken code whereas ie tends to break

i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb

but also it shows incredible differences between speeds of the browsers ie 50-100 times slower than firefox or google-chrome

i know js and i ve maked extension for google-chrome before but i think making for firefox is alittle harder

google-chrome and firefox are comparably faster

the namespace is supported specifically to make cross-browser extensions with google-chrome in particular porting from google-chrome to firefox easier

you can do this by looking into the source code or better with firebug firefox or developer tools ie google-chrome in the network tab

this all works well and good in firefox but when i try it in google-chrome which supports more html5 features it tries to load the url undefined in whatever directory i m in

i doubt it but sometimes when google-chrome and firefox differ it s been because google-chrome was faster or loaded script resources quicker or something along those lines

incidentally this is also how firefox and google-chrome do it more or less

so firefox is better than google-chrome - but both suck in that regard

we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

ellipsis still wraps in google-chrome but is more user friendly in firefox by adding the .

the funny thing is that for abc_def property google-chrome is actually much faster than firefox and ie as i expected

firefox takes almost 3 times longer than google-chrome

often google-chrome is understanding more thing then it should and firefox is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh

firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object

it is also proper browser behavior firefox is just stricter about it than google-chrome is

google-chrome shows it better than firefox firebug

i ve ran into out of memory errors on firefox with canvas heights greater than 8000 google-chrome seems to handle much higher at least to 32000

in firefox it runs extremely slow 3-4 seconds in google-chrome it runs much faster

maybe google-chrome is more lenient when it comes to illegal characters in the url than firefox or something like that

i recommend google-chrome in-built tools for developers or firebug add-on if you use firefox to check whether elements you built are like you design them to be

mac google-chrome firefox and win firefox are finding them correctly

as you can see in the following pictures internet explorer is sending small bytes but google-chrome and firefox send bigger bytes

in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome

it s just a matter of preferences and browser implementation eg firefox works faster with brackets while google-chrome works faster with the dots

pc google-chrome and safari are fine ie shows the links like in the picture firefox shows more revealed urls

how can i fix the firefox rendering so that it matches google-chrome s

i have used some css hacks to get the position pixel perfect on firefox ie 7 8 9 and 10 win google-chrome opera and safari however on mac google-chrome and mac safari it is a few pixels out

in some cases this was due to microsoft simply not implementing a feature but the problem was exacerbated by internet explorer s slow release schedule it s only at versioning 11 after two decades compared to firefox and google-chrome which are much younger and the fact that users often didn t upgrade their versioning of ie leaving them with an old web browser

get google-chrome or firefox use the developer tools i personally prefer google-chrome and play around with the css of that element - you d want a margin-top rule similar to this

i recommend installing google-chrome firefox or ie9 opening the javascript developer console and making use of the console.log ... function

this is a css issue you can inspect the button using google-chrome or firefox i prefer google-chrome and see what css properties your button has then disable those properties on fly one by one clicking on their checkbox and see if your button is clickable after disabling a property

the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct

now when clicking a time less than 1 millisecond will be displayed however it obviously takes nearly a second on my computer until the changed color actually is displayed where btw. google-chrome seems to be faster than firefox

firefox thumbnail 4 times smaller than on google-chrome

it s more effective with firefox more than google-chrome or any other browsers

i could also use a firefox extension though i d prefer google-chrome

firefox and google-chrome are considerably higher than that but there is still a limit

given these last two complications i am leaning towards a browser plugin as the solution probably firefox since low-level http stuff seems to be better supported than in google-chrome but i am wondering if anyone has an idea for a more cross-browser-y solution and or if there is something out there that might provide a good api for this kind of thing

also i d recommend using google-chrome or firefox and watching the network tab of developer tools so you can see exactly what the server is returning from the ajax call

my guess is google-chrome is caching more agressively and thats why you are seeing worse load time on firefox

i am not concerned about the fact that firefox runs faster as browser js implementations will vary so much as the wide spread of results encountered in google-chrome that makes getting an accurate result impossible

any ideas why google-chrome is apply more spacing than firefox ie

and also does anyone know why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome in 3d rendering

how to standardize the height of a select box between google-chrome and firefox

the effect is more obvious in firefox google-chrome is better

for example if you have a text size of 15px well firefox makes a larger 15px than google-chrome does

generally i prefer google-chrome or mozilla firefox

my website in developing process looking in mozilla firefox with same font-size declaration margin padding and different font-families always a few smaller than in google-chrome or internet explorer

google-chrome is more forgiving or you could call it less compliant firefox less so

the spec has since been updated to match google-chrome s sensible behavior making ie s and firefox s original behavior non-compliant

all good jasmine angularjs tests running now and much faster than with google-chrome or firefox as the test browser

it looks like while google-chrome and safari are trying to do the right thing with 0px firefox is sticking closer to the standard

or if you know any better debugger than google-chrome or firefox please let me know becuase i can r figure out google-chrome and firefox

google-chrome is extremely slow for your code path but grep seems to be 50 faster than array.filter here making it 900 slower than the firefox run

we recommend using firefox google-chrome opera etc

what firefox displays is about 5 inches higher than what google-chrome displays

so when i the broswer resize your height in vw changes according to broswer width it support major broswer firefox google-chrome but ie i don t know

on windows the while loops above is 20 faster than the original for-loop in google-chrome in ie and firefox both loops perform the same

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

i just found out that if you re using google-chrome you trigger antialiasing at 49px or higher however with firefox it s set at 257px or higher

ah looks like you re running into a flash run-time error but not seeing it in google-chrome or firefox cause of no debug player installed this is easy for firefox just install the netscape compatible debug player to see the error for google-chrome the install is more complicated due to it managing flash player updates internally

i m seeing a strange issue on windows in google-chrome the framerate is almost 2 times lower than in firefox on mac google-chrome and firefox have similar framerates

why are google-chrome and firefox taking longer

instead of firefox or ie i use google-chrome and i superficially feel google-chrome is responding better

if you want to inspect elements i recommend google-chrome and it s built in console i like it much better then firefox + firebug

i am curious to know from web developers point of view what do you prefer firefox or google-chrome

so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit

because there s so many differences between browser s javascript engines as you notice with firefox and google-chrome it s harder to do code optimizations for all of them

you can use google-chrome as well but i prefer firefox

until people have more experience with google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice

the reason this is happening is because firefox renders the select box as a taller element than google-chrome and the container of the blue text is getting caught on the select s container element because it s now sticking out lower than the others

firefox is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that google-chrome locks down

firefox recognizes this attribute but webkit google-chrome safari etc don t more info on caniuse.com

ie 7 ie8 ie9 pr3 firefox 3.0 firefox 3.5 firefox 3.6 firefox 4b1 saf 4.0 win saf 5.0 win google-chrome 4 google-chrome 5 opera 10.10 opera 10.53 and opera 10.60

google-chrome provides more detailed information about the ajax errors even when firefox doesn t say anything

google-chrome and firefox seem much more forgiving but with ie 8 the inclusion of a bad caused a blank view to be displayed

tldr in firefox filter is slightly faster in google-chrome that s the opposite

in google-chrome there is more files download 47 than in firefox ie 42

google-chrome can read lots of locale-specific date time formats but firefox is pickier

i ve found that firefox is greatly faster with imacros than google-chrome

the position of the list in firefox is always higher than that of google-chrome no matter how i padding or margin the list

google-chrome has a bigger time difference yet firefox is the one with the gap in the animation

this is a problem because i want to use firefox or google-chrome they are much better browsers

it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

i recommend using google-chrome or firefox for admin work especially adding editing products

i think ie uses bigger font than firefox or google-chrome by default

that means firefox is more than 7x faster than google-chrome here

after some investigation it seems this issue doesn t happen in google-chrome is related to newer firefox version 9.0.1 linux

the application only works in ie so i cant compare with google-chrome and firefox

firefox on nexus 7 is a bit better at producing reasonable sample rate readings but the updating of the display is even more sluggish than google-chrome

i m noticing huge performance issues in google-chrome firefox and safari when adding more nested lists programmatically too many reflows maybe

in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari

in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox

i have an iframe inside a list i m using a slider and on google-chrome sets its size perfectly but on firefox it has a smaller size

on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome

google-chrome always reports 250 for both widths as expected but firefox always reports a larger number though the exact number may depend on the os and or version of firefox and or phase of the moon

my issue affects all browsers ie being slightly quicker than google-chrome or firefox according to that issue ondisconnected was delayed only when navigating to another page in the project - in my case ondisconnected is not called immediately even when i close the tab or navigate to an external page

much better than opera firefox and google-chrome

i d recommend google-chrome s inspect tool or firefox s firebug inspect tool to help you understand and modify element s css

that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it

this works absolutely fine but if user selects google-chrome s duplicate right-click menu option or firefox s reload tab option to open the same page in another tab this btnsubmit_click

its slower than in google-chrome and firefox but now finally

here is a screenshot of how it is displayed on internet explorer better than firefox but not centered like in google-chrome

but google-chrome and firefox take much safer approach by making a http options call to check what all things the web server supports as cors which domains are allowed whether supports get post etc and the next call goes with the actual http get request with authentication

also consider doing a web search for responsive bookmarklet tools for results that can help a-bit more than google-chrome s inspector or firefox s firebug

since every browser has a limitation on the number of cookies they will store for most recent ie versions it is 50 for google-chrome and firefox it is a larger number but still finite the cookies build up until the limit is reached at which time the browser starts discarding the oldest cookies which means the session cookie for asp.net ends up being discarded causing the asp.net session expiration error

looks like for the slice use-case on google-chrome using a literal is about 4 slower on my machine on firefox it s more lke 9 with no difference at all on ie10

firefox has like 40px less width than google-chrome in columns which is causing problems

the very latest versions of google-chrome and firefox can still be installed on windows xp and anybody who doesn t believe new versions of google-chrome or firefox are vastly more secure than ancient bug-riddled ie6 is fooling themselves

i hacked together an alternative approach that achieved a much higher fps 60 or more under both google-chrome and firefox

the google-chrome console gives more information than the firefox console

firefox is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and google-chrome

it s not the first time that the plugin for firefox works better for me than the one for google-chrome

google-chrome renders passwords smaller than firefox

try manipulating the data yourself from the google-chrome javascript console or the firebug console if you prefer firefox

in google-chrome the button is wider than in firefox

so why is google-chrome less efficient than firefox and ie

you can see here the first pci is how does it looks like in win with google-chrome or firefox

turns out there was a chain file missing on the server that although seemed fine when using a browser like google-chrome or firefox ios was more specific in their requirements

is this expected and google-chrome is behaving correctly or is firefox just being more tolerant

the google-chrome renders the letters using pointy ends but the firefox uses more solid and bold effect

other types of firefox extensions are significantly more capable than webextensions google-chrome extensions

in google-chrome the green div is bigger than in firefox i really don t know what is the problem i think in firefox it displays as it should but in google-chrome and ie9 it displays different

why is ie setting the readystate to complete so much earlier than google-chrome and firefox

found an easy way which works with all browsers i have google-chrome 49 edge 25 firefox 44 ie11 safari 5 win safari 8 macos

but google-chrome and firefox do more slowly

google-chrome doesn t implement the sizing correctly and firefox does although in your case the default behaviour of google-chrome is closer to what you want

surly the input type should be text if the value expected is dublin -- google-chrome might be cleaver enough to recognise that the input is actually text whereas firefox and ie might be more gullible and not even try to set the variable

which extension would you recommend google-chrome firefox that would capture post get requests and responses and allow the session to be saved

i m guessing users which encounter the problem have cookies disabled in their browsers firefox and google-chrome users are more switched on than regular ie users

i find that firefox and google-chrome work faster than ie

most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is

on these devices he has different browsers so we have to distinct os x safari os x google-chrome os x firefox win safari win google-chrome win firefox etc

in google-chrome the same flow renders in 13 seconds but firefox takes more than 51 seconds

if google-chrome seems to finish earlier than firefox then that is the freezing glitch in action

as google-chrome s v8 is dramatically faster than firefox s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine

i would recommend using firefox or google-chrome with the web developer toolbar to make html css validation easier

i have a logo with a blue background i ve picked the colour via google-chrome inspector matches firefox colour picker as well yet on mobile the logo stands out on the background

if your primary user base is using ie6 7 or even 8 the page speed is going to be significantly slower than firefox or google-chrome

i cannot tell if this happens in ie or edge also because it never happen to me with them but i m using them rarely because i m more accustomed with google-chrome and firefox s web developer tools - source console etc

on firefox they ask for more information and they show a captcha but not on google-chrome

for example using renatoargh s test google-chrome is faster with option 2 firefox with option 1

the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

i ve tried to load the page on google-chrome not blazingly fast but acceptable less than 1 second then tried on firefox takes more time between 2 and 3 seconds

they use iframes in firefox which seems better but in google-chrome they do this by putting manually defined span and font tags

the blur event is incomplete for firefox mac saf win google-chrome win and google-chrome mac

it displays ok in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it has more space between the text and the bottom border than between the text and the top border

i also would prefer to avoid service workers in the implementation so that this works in more than just google-chrome and firefox

the window.external.addsearchprovider xml_url works fine in firefox as earlier the problem is only with the google-chrome since google-chrome supported earlier and don t know the root cause of not able to add now

this alleviated some of our performance issues but even on subsequent refreshes we noticed ie6 taking substantially longer than ie7+ firefox google-chrome etc

apparently google-chrome is pickier than firefox

i would prefer google-chrome but accept firefox

you can do so by checking out firebug firefox extension or in the webkit dev tools i prefer google-chrome dev tools

look every browser like mozilla firefox google-chrome opera have thier own design for modal window

i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

i prefer google-chrome to firefox and i just found web server for google-chrome

when testing the data channels i would recommend using firefox since the webrtc work was split such that google-chrome initially focused on peerconnection and firefox on datachannel so firefox is still ahead in their implementation of the datachannel

in firefox the render of new tiles and the panning is laggy this is not the case when using maps.google.com so it s not an issue of google-chrome being better than firefox

bad buffering can also be a result of a slow computer because statistics show that google-chrome is better for a normal-fast computer and firefox works best on slow computers

firefox google-chrome have better implementations on rules and can thus fix common logical fallacies in them

the function is available in browsers newer than google-chrome 39 and firefox 31

pd note that firefox s developer tools are better and more complete than google-chrome developer tools but in essence are for the same purpose

how come google-chrome and firefox still open more connections to download seperate files

google-chrome and firefox interpret larger values as 32767 or for very large numbers 0 ie as negative numbers except that 32768 is taken as 0

dialog and select firefox og google-chrome the page is using the correct culture on first view

different js engines are good at different things so depending on the test program you could have google-chrome being 5x faster than firefox say or vice versa

what s interesting is that firefox and ie9 will process the larger data set just fine but i thought google-chrome had a larger stack size limit than either of these browsers so i would ve expected them both to fail as well

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

i m having a problem styling a select box with google-chrome and safari on firefox works fine

based on what you have provided i cannot tell if google-chrome actually does load faster than firefox

and it would look better with the firefox s google-chrome hidden

in that sense real life browsers firefox internet explorer google-chrome etc are much more flexible

unlike google-chrome which dies silently the latest firefox is more helpful

after i visit that website how can i disable the internet connection only for that website in a given browser i prefer google-chrome but i can also use firefox or internet explorer

use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari

the font rendered in google-chrome left have more space on the top versus firefox

google-chrome and firefox are much faster

but do keep in mind you re optimizing for a particular js engine when you re doing that v8-optimized code might generate cleaner memory in google-chrome and safari but for all you know ie might make a complete hash of things or some of the tricks you ve used cause firefox to slow down more than a fairly large array would have done in the first place

firefox google-chrome safari all have prioritized faster javascript execution in recent versions whereas ie may show performance in ie9 i hope they do myself. also realize this slideshow will run slow in mobile devices etc

here is a simple performance test showing that in google-chrome filling is faster than clearing i am not sure what goes on with google-chrome and canvas nowadays but in firefox clearing is many times faster than filling both significantly faster than google-chrome

in google-chrome the font appears to be 1px smaller than firefox and ie and i cannot see why

different browsers do this in different ways f.ex ie has less slots than google-chrome firefox

firefox window was less than 991px so appeared to be working google-chrome window was 991 so appeared to not be working

from all the performance sites i have looked at google-chrome and firefox should be much faster at loading pages than ie

to answer my own question neither google-chrome nor firefox support more than two values in background-position

obviously google-chrome is more persnickety whereas firefox defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary

the logs only seem to work with a google-chrome browser which is a laugh as usually firefox is better at running google apps than google-chrome

in google-chrome it seems .prototype is faster firefox shows no difference between the two although generally performs slower than google-chrome

the height of the blue bar in safari and google-chrome matches but in firefox it is smaller

is it a bug in google-chrome or am i more or less lucky to get this chaining to work in firefox

in my experience firefox is sometimes more lenient than google-chrome but i would definitely test in both

and i get connection was interrupted in google-chrome or connection was reset in firefox for uploading docs bigger than 4 mb

this is changing in recent builds and both those ought to match google-chrome in firefox 19 onwards

probably firefox just ignores it but google-chrome is more strict change code to

firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit

firefox generates boxes containing the 4 hex digits of the missing character for the missing symbols but google-chrome just generates empty boxes - i prefer firefox s technique

cause of the security settings for google-chrome firefox are different higher

i m using dinnextltpro-medium font on this site and noticed quite a difference on the rendering between safari 6 google-chrome mac and the rest of the world safari 5 mac win google-chrome win firefox win opera win...

especially sensitive in google-chrome as firefox had a better response time---

in safari it renders significantly brighter than in firefox or google-chrome

suffice to say ie and google-chrome start having problems at larger heights than does firefox

i have different behavior on firefox and google-chrome for the bellow code and i think firefox is more correct

font-face bold in firefox is bolder than in google-chrome

if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do

my preference is firefox and firebug others prefer google-chrome and google-chrome devtools etc

i believe the error might be how firefox and google-chrome handles these multiple times included jquerys and it might be that google-chrome uses the older and firefox newer version

my firefox adds more chopping to video playing itself google-chrome plays the video much better

the vertical spacing in firefox between the real estate search h2 tag and the form input field for san francisco ca #city-field input tag is perfect but in google-chrome google-chrome is applying more extra vertical spacing than desired

performance is browser and device dependent for example firefox handles objects better than arrays while google-chrome prefers arrays

the second happened when you remove everything and starting type and hit enter different browsers behavior very differently google-chrome insert very first line as a just text node of contenteditable container and than put every new line into div opera 12.12 handle it better and it never allows remove last div node ie9-10 starting jump around and after you started again uses p tags instead of div that s not even such a disaster just inconsistency but yet the firefox is not yet even trying to change it s br behavior

google-chrome dev console works like expected and shows all errors but i prefer firefox dev console and would like to stay with it

fast clicking on ie has slower response than firefox google-chrome and safari

the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie

oddly enough new array size is almost 2x faster than in google-chrome and about the same in firefox and ie measured by creating and filling an array

so is there an issue with the map file i am thinking no cause firefox is able to read ok why is google-chrome referencing the less files

i could use the google-chrome firefox opera driver i prefer google-chrome

if i remove this code the width of green image in firefox becomes smaller but it s still bigger than necessary about 100px the google-chrome images keeps unchanged

the google-chrome apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under firefox

once again google-chrome did this well and while a bit better of a match firefox failed to render a perfect loop

the issue is that when the form is submitted and there is an error or when the form is submitted another page is displayed and the user clicks on the back button ie doesn t display the user chosen value for the second select firefox and google-chrome do

in google-chrome it seems more or less ok but in firefox when i first tried it it should give me not logged in my console

the only case where firefox s output matches with google-chrome is when a padding is added directly to the img tag itself

this is sporadic and i see it happening most of the time with firefox 4.0.1 and 5.0 and to a lesser extent with google-chrome

this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

in ie java-script load slower than firefox safari and google-chrome

firefox handles this better than google-chrome does but neither exactly the way i want

it appears to be centered in ie but in firefox and google-chrome it appears more to the left

in ie6 7 8 and in google-chrome text has proper size but in firefox it s bigger

in my testing google-chrome is nicer it pops-up the unresponsive alert whereas firefox apparently doesn t care

it does however work in everything else i ve tried it on including google-chrome win firefox win and google-chrome android

but i much prefer google-chrome over firefox so.

we recommend google-chrome however the latest versions of safari firefox and internet explorer work great too

in my personal experience it is impossible to modify the browser behavior in google-chrome if the addon api does not allow for it - in firefox this is much easier to change as much of the interface logic is written in javascript and there are api s for just about anything

when i try to access reporting services via the broswer such as google-chrome or firefox it prompts me for username password in which i do enter but then it gives me an error

from the zip folder when i view the pages offline in firefox the fonts are not rendered correctly you can compare it with google-chrome and ie by opening the course in offline mode in both the browsers

this works well on google-chrome but looks different in firefox and would need some tweaking to make it match google-chrome

of course google-chrome and firefox have much better dev tools in general

it seems google-chrome applies some formatting to render better than firefox

i m not mistyping anything in my input - and the programs i want to kill google-chrome and firefox are open

i guess google-chrome is smarter about me being careless than firefox is

i had a hiccup in firefox but found a fix after figuring out firefox is a bit more picky than google-chrome when defining svg attributes

ie seems to do just fine with elements which are defined with with getelementbyid but firefox and google-chrome was more stringent and accepts only elements

it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera

i usually use google-chrome s developer mode which imho already gives even more details than firefox

open up the fiddle in both firefox google-chrome to see what i m talking about - in firefox the positioning of the background image is much lower than in google-chrome safari

therefore code should be written and tested around firefox google-chrome safari which are much closer to proper standards support than ie8 then conditional tags should be used in ie to work around its bugs

the difference between google-chrome and firefox is that google-chrome uses -webkit-transform browser engine and firefox doesn t

interestingly google-chrome matches firefox when you use the white-space pre-wrap style.

it depends on the browser its definitely true for ie and firefox but seems slower on google-chrome

i recommend using google-chrome s developer tools or firebug in firefox and mousing over the different elements in your page to see what space they are taking up

usually i prefer google-chrome over any other browser but for this case i have to say - good work firefox

having said that the google-chrome devtools as well as the firefox devtools have many more features and other smaller and bigger advantages over firebug as the team behind firebug is very small in comparison to the teams behind the other devtools

and modern broswers like firefox or google-chrome requires more bytes to start browser display

ps i ve noticed that in google-chrome situation is better than in firefox but new line still starts beneath tag

that happens because pixels size in google-chrome is bigger than in firefox

is this a google-chrome bug an unresolved issue with the specification or is firefox simply providing more functionality than required

firefox is probably easier than google-chrome these days

i am currently testing using various versions of firefox ie opera safari for win google-chrome on winxp and winvista

i think it mostly depends on the interprter engine in browser which responsible for interpreting th scripts which server sends to your browser and another thing about firefox as you have mentioned the extension in firefox is also responsible for it and another thing which i think matters a lot the developement of the browser as you can see google-chrome has same ui on all windows linux mac since it is mostly written in java so it requires jvm to run hence it is slow as compared to firefox which is written separately for each os using the respective oss apis hence it is fast since it directly interacts with os than interacting with jvm which in turn interacts with os like in case of chrome.still google-chrome is faster in incognito mode because of its intelligence to keep frequently data cached if you ll see the temporary files created by google-chrome they are huge in size as compared to that of firefox

this works in latest google-chrome and firefox and seems cleaner than bind to me

the only thing is that flexbox is not supported by older browser support by ie10+ google-chrome 20+ safari 3.1+ firefox 2+ read more about support so i probably would need to add the flexie polyfill to support this on older browser

my question is similar the same page in my pc renders fine firefox google-chrome but the same one on a server rendered smaller by firefox google-chrome ok

surprising win by google-chrome by a huge margin vs firefox and ie9

there are command line flags for both google-chrome and firefox that make testing easier by enabling fake devices

when i have a lower width for the browser firefox ie and google-chrome that is lower than 980px this fixed menu should not appear

used to be firefox but google-chrome is nicer out of the box

browser google-chrome firefox firefox requires more resizing to get the same effect

the issue that i encountered was that google-chrome was giving me height about 300px more than the firefox ie

we recommend using google-chrome download here or mozilla firefox download here

when i run my http web server on google google-chrome it gives more 324 error than in firefox

i am checking it in firefox and google-chrome and see that in google-chrome spacing between letter is larger than in firefox

i m taking a quite educated guess here that firefox is more forgiving with the irregular syntax than google-chrome

i personally would recommend google-chrome dev tools builtin f12 or firebug in firefox

or does this mean firefox is less secured on that point than google-chrome

google-chrome firefox handled reloading jquery more gracefully than ie so it was a more obvious problem but the underlying cause was on all browsers

however firefox and google-chrome are doing something fancier and set content-range bytes 0- like

firefox seems to animate the element quicker than google-chrome does and so while a duration of 1s is enough for the animation in google-chrome firefox needs it to be 2s to be slower and show the effect

however the font along with other fonts are displayed more boldly on mac firefox display fine on google-chrome mac win firefox win etc

in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari

although firefox is a better browser for developers than google-chrome cause it gives you more tools to work with

google-chrome handles these better than compared to firefox

i need to do the same condition but for less than google-chrome version 46 and for less than firefox version 44

we will be getting audited by a group who uses nvda firefox and jaws ie but our lead likes google-chrome and our client s users like google-chrome as well

secondly the browsers above ie7 and other browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari have a better rendering engine and intuitively handle buggy markup

all major desktop browsers win ie mac win safari mac win google-chrome win opera mac win firefox

google-chrome placed more importance on your body margin than firefox did and used your style as higher priority

and additionally the algorithm that google-chrome uses is better than the one in firefox at least for handling the resizing of text

solved the problem came from css specificity.bootstrap s css was judged more specific by google-chrome regarding my menu s selector but not by firefox and safari

but i guess google-chrome i have version 10 should be much faster than firefox 3.6

on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera

in firefox it s much better than google-chrome but still not as black as ie

i really recommend browsing with google-chrome when you re looking to debug javascript it s error console is very useful for not just determining errors like this but also for pinpointing the location in the script that is throwing the error which might be an advantage beyond firebug in firefox

firefox extensions have much more power than google-chrome and have wider access to browser s internal api

it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that google-chrome will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than firefox when i do things this way

i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

the number of ie addons seems to be far lower than firefox and google-chrome extensions - why s that

also ie and firefox seems to work better than google-chrome

firefox or google-chrome would work better than ie8

i prefer google-chrome or firefox and i know a few people who swear by opera

compared to a non worker version in google-chrome my benchmark is somewhat slower in firefox it is much slower

google-chrome also has a console and debug tools but i prefer firefox firebug

i built a site and the problem is google-chrome display font-size 1px bigger than firefox

i have the problem in firefox 3.6.13 and have tested against current versions of safari win google-chrome opera and ie where the code all works perfectly

also it does appear that firefox consistently handles this better than ie or google-chrome

better than that open the browser s developer console i prefer google-chrome but you can also use ie or firefox + firebug add-on using f12

while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903

i ran a simple test out of curiosity and there don t seem to be any differences in performance between float+calc vs flex other than ie rendering both much slower than firefox and google-chrome

i believe that ie11 only uses software and firefox may be less strict with its blacklisting of gpus but that doesn t explain why google-chrome can t switch to software when hardware is unavailable

after inspecting the test in ie 8 9 and seeing its results look like those of firefox i think there s an explanation for the google-chrome results i m pretty sure google-chrome webkit has a better optimization in the first version of the test especially the parseint part which gives a better result for parseint there

please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome

px firefox will display smaller and smaller shadow while when google-chrome goes below 1px it suddenly displays nothing

i m on a mac os x 10.8.2 running firefox 18.0.2 - it actually runs the game faster and smoother than my google-chrome 25.0.1364.99

in my opinion you re already testing far over the top - ie firefox google-chrome safari already corner more than 99 of the market in pc mac form

better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay

google-chrome decided to treat them as function declarations and hoists them firefox treats them more like function expressions

firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such

google-chrome beats firefox hands-down in the performance department

this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome

whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it

currently there s somewhat of an arms race between google-chrome firefox and webkit s javascript interpreters which has really improved the speed situation with javascript

i am looking for a reset stylesheet specifically intended to make firefox google-chrome etc behave more like ie i m sure nobody will leave obnoxious comments about this that won t break too much of the existing layout which is tested currently only on ie7

because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

a similar tool is now present in firefox you had to use firebug before but google-chrome is more used partly because of its more powerful js engine v8

graph beeing cut in google-chrome is a known issue google-chrome does not respect some print css and works much better with firefox not all versions still

i ve tested the sample on firefox and it s a bit slower than google-chrome but usable

my knowledge of firefox is better than google-chrome so my apologies if i missed something

any idea why in google-chrome it is looking fine but in firefox the margin-top is slightly higher and in ie it is even higher than firefox and google-chrome

what s up with google-chrome that the debugger behaves less conveniently than firefox

btw google-chrome is less close to w3c specs than firefox de 42+ i d opt to start using firefox for your initial testing and then test it in ch to detect quirks

there are some browser compatibility issues but according to this post the guy says that it is compatible with ie 7 ie8 ie9 pr3 firefox 3.0 firefox 3.5 firefox 3.6 firefox 4b1 saf 4.0 win saf 5.0 win google-chrome 4 google-chrome 5 opera 10.10 opera 10.53 and opera 10.60

transparency is also an issue however google-chrome seems to handle all three better than firefox

google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

win firefox google-chrome

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

in your example fn is attempting to call call but it s not specifying the context which typically defaults to the window object but in this case it just makes it undefined which triggers a weird error in google-chrome as you discovered but firefox is clearer about the problem

google-chrome sends back and html collection that is longer really better imo than firefox ie or chromium

this is trickier to work around and you should file a google-chrome bug describing the situation and where it s slower than firefox but you could potentially reduce the amount of buffer uploads by looking into instancing or using uniform arrays instead of updating vertexes for positions textures

i want to make my pages nice in ie as in google-chrome and firefox and do less with css.and not to use more css frameworks

what the problem is my website runs well in internet explorer but when i select google-chrome firefox the images are not displaying.could any one give me a solution

firefox ie10 and google-chrome use the newer hybi variant

internet explorer s limit is lower than firefox s or google-chrome s and varies between versions

i found that google-chrome was easier to get working than firefox but firefoxes tools such as firebug were quite nice to work with

ie7 is strict enough and used to give me javascript errors on them maybe google-chrome does it too firefox is more relaxed d

i am getting better with google-chrome and firefox debugging tools but i still have not found a way to easily examine the local entity cache managed by breeze

alternatively the spec might change to match google-chrome in which case firefox would likely change to match google-chrome and the specification

select firefox or google-chrome but not google-chrome with nebeans connector

i have already run into problems with old javascript code which i thought was standards compliant by firefox or opera standards - which are pretty good but google-chrome was even more picky

fwiw i was able to solve my problem with greensock using tweenmax to animate individual paths inside and this worked in firefox gecko and webkit browsers safari google-chrome it does a better job of calculating the origin not exactly sure how but it worked for me

using any other browser google-chrome firefox and opera it s much quicker

google-chrome is more flexible in this sense than firefox which is why it works there

and i have 5000 test cases some of them prefer google-chrome some of them firefox some of them does not matter

here the working header request with firefox bigger than google-chrome request

i m guessing maybe ie s js engine is a little slower than firefox google-chrome which allows the user to do things they shouldn t but i have no idea how to confirm this or how to deal with it

i suggest inspecting the demo with google-chrome or firefox to get a closer look at it

it looks like it shows for firefox more-so than google-chrome but it might help

also google-chrome s map function is up to 2x slower than firefox on my machine

i ve found that the font-size in firefox is a bit larger than in google-chrome

in my experience google-chrome has better javascript performance than firefox

firefox text is 1px lower than in google-chrome and ie

i worked on it to make it more consistent between google-chrome and firefox

if i manually increase the font-size of a password input element in google-chrome to match firefox then the caret height will be increased too which i don t want

why height in google-chrome is bigger than firefox of input

for example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari takes 5+ seconds firefox takes less than 1 second

let s say you wanted a table border-radius of 50 on google-chrome and safari but firefox is adding more padding by default so you d like to tone it down for that browser alone to 45

i have too problem with text in the firefox is bigger maybe bolder as in google-chrome .

here my problem is date input field in aligning correctly in firefox but in google-chrome it is displaying bigger than all other text boxes

the most interesting thing i noted is that certain test combos in firefox are much quicker than even google-chrome

my menu links seem in google-chrome correctly but in firefox my menu links are 1 px smaller than google-chrome

on stable versions of google-chrome the permissions show allow and it still won t connect even with firefox works older versions of google-chrome work

i ve tried firefox and google-chrome and seems that firefox is faster and comsumes less resources is there anything else that is like text based

i ended up adding position relative to correct a couple ie-specific layout problems but i seem to have made things worse in firefox google-chrome i consider myself more of a systems programmer but my current responsibilities involve more of a web focus unfortunately

however some of the users using the system prefer google-chrome or firefox

now the problem is the css animations which we have are not getting rendered smoothly in the webkit browser provided by javafx but same code in firefox or google-chrome is quite smoother

even then google-chrome s fonts look thinner than in firefox or ie

you can view it live on cssdesk this method works in a lot more than google-chrome but breaks in firefox 3.0 and just doesn t work in a number of ie versions

if anyone runs into an problem similar to this note that pupeteer pretty much matches google-chrome exactly so if you are using mozilla firefox to test it wont match your pdf exactly so test in google-chrome when using puppeteer and will be much smoother

ie is usually slower than firefox google-chrome is fetching lot of external resources

i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox

i generally prefer google-chrome but in this case i find opening a page in firefox that references angular-material.css or the minified version and then navigating to the style editor in the inspector provides a pretty nice view of all of the available classes

firefox works a bit better than google-chrome but the settimeout just seems to delay the final result being shown rather than delaying each step

have i discovered a bug in firefox or is google-chrome just doing a better job of clearing up my shonky javascipt

other modern browsers like firefox and google-chrome provide better support

google-chrome dev tools are by far better than firefox ie whatever imho

however compare with google-chrome and firefox firebug i realize there is lots information missing

browsers like google-chrome for instance won t allow it where as firefox can be more lenient in some cases

you will notice that ie11 edge takes 10+ seconds whereas google-chrome firefox takes less than a second

i see this problem across the board on safari ie firefox and google-chrome -- so any of these would be fine to use though i prefer firefox because the problem seems to be most defined there

firefox produces more space compared to google-chrome

google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome

turns out using onunload is behaving as documented in firefox but google-chrome is just smarter with it or something still investigating but i ll mark this question as answered

actually your code doesn t work on firefox because he is less forgiving than google-chrome about errors

arabic default font in google-chrome is larger than it is in firefox

firefox is easier and better than google-chrome in finding the element from the webpage

here s an example take a look at it with google-chrome or ie and compare it with firefox

i don t actually know how long but the asm.js optimizations are new enough that when i last tried it in early april 2014 it was significantly slower on the command line with node.js than in the browser with google-chrome and firefox was faster still

i thought firefox and google-chrome had a bigger limit than that

this is to get it in firefox to be more like in google-chrome

the gaps and differences in implementation between the spec and other browsers like firefox and google-chrome are much smaller

when i try the demo in google-chrome or safari it is indeed much faster but when i ve tested it in firefox it s consistently slower

secondly i would prefer firefox f12 or google-chrome f12 over ie

you could also just recommend google-chrome or firefox

when viewing my text area in firefox it shows up a correct width col 30 however in ie and google-chrome it s significantly smaller

in ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears closer to the bottom than in safari and google-chrome

but firefox keeps being less responsive than google-chrome or ie

update just tried it on firefox 30 and it did not experience the same slowdown in a worker thread but it was slower than google-chrome when run in the main thread

however if thats the case does this mean firefox is faster in execution than google-chrome

but if firebug donâ t enabled after launch firefox â time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears

i assume google-chrome and firefox are more lenient with the crc

i have been trying to do this in firefox webextensions but if it s easier with google-chrome i will try it that way instead.

however a sdp object local description by firefox does not contain datachannel at all and moreover the sdp is much shorter than google-chrome and less information bundled

google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer

i know that ie s javascript engine is slower than google-chrome and firefox but i m throwing this out there to see if the so community can pick apart my code and suggest better ways of doing this as i am not the greatest front end programmer

ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on

google-chrome is smart enough to guess where things should be closed and still work correctly but firefox has more strict of standards

found that the issue stemmed from using the firefox webdriver which apparently has much higher security than its google-chrome counterpart

firefox doesnt support the date format you have entered while google-chrome is more flexible and does support it

my problem is appearing in google-chrome windows not win firefox ubuntu firefox google-chrome mac firefox safari were the text height is being swashed

google-chrome is letting me get into bad habits and is happy to parse that format but firefox is stricter

so behavior should be just like it was in google-chrome 54 and earlier going forward for shoutcast servers worth noting this does not quite match firefox s current behavior

compare with google-chrome firefox and ie edge and you will see the big difference

i already tested it and it doesn t match with opera google-chrome firefox or safari mobile

browsers devices desktop browsers ie8+ google-chrome firefox safari ipad s browser mobile safari mobile devices browsers android mobile safari

i recommend firefox with the firebug addon for debugging ajax issues even though i use google-chrome for regular browsing

when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s

the date format you are using should conform to the emcascript spec it just so happens that firefox and google-chrome are more forgiving about parsing

install firebug firefox version is better then a google-chrome one

firefox and google-chrome do a better job though.

but given what the note says above i would say that ie and firefox are closer to the intended css3 definition since in google-chrome you can t seem to change a table s box model using the box-sizing property

for example i want to launch win google-chrome only test and mac firefox only test.

also you can use phantomjs is webkit browser without user interface so it is really faster than firefox or google-chrome

this is all per the appropriate specifications and google-chrome at some point will implement this properly and match firefox

the latest stable firefox 3.6 is fast but for example google-chrome is even faster

as you said google-chrome is faster than firefox so the webdriver is trying to interact with the dom before when elements are not yet visible exist

cssviewer a firefox google-chrome extension is way faster for checking font sizes and other typographical properties like font weights and line heights also color on elements one after another than devtools inspect

you forgot to open the so no more css after this line is considered in firefox and ie google-chrome is more cool on the error

as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than firefox 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than google-chrome 9 at least when using sunspider tests

you could apply this error narrowing down technique to different part of your script by hardcoding some values which eliminates the possibilities of error until you find the smoking gun which doesn t kill ie and google-chrome but kills firefox

firefox encodes more characters than google-chrome

but maybe this isn t a regression in google-chrome as per the css spec the google-chrome 49 behavior doesn t match firefox while the google-chrome 50 behavior does

firefox gsap performance is still much worse than in google-chrome but google-chrome gsap does still lag every few repeats or so while in google-chrome the css animations do not

currently only for those who still use ie i prefer firefox or google-chrome myself

firefox may be sniffing the document s encoding with more flexibility than google-chrome is

fancybox 2.1.5 is giving us very slow load times in ie 11 but firefox and google-chrome are much faster although still with a delay

the compatibility table link shows google-chrome firefox edge and safari are more compatible than babel now

it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox

i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome

looks like it is about a half a second firefox google-chrome is less than that when selecting on two elements over 100 000 iterations

it works in firefox because firefox is more lax about this security restriction and google-chrome happens to be more strict on mixed-content errors

i would recommend using google-chrome right clicking and choosing inspect element or using firebug on firefox then the tool to select the hyperlink

google-chrome is more permissive with delimiters when it comes to dates thus formatting the date with dashes works with google-chrome but not with firefox

in phantomjs is it possible to limit the the maximum redirection eg to match google-chrome and firefox

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

i use google-chrome for development as i find it runs faster than firefox and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are

in google-chrome typeof is slower than the other two but in firefox it is the fastest

using firefox even it s slower than google-chrome it s still more respectful of privacy

even if you manage to mimic google-chrome s behavior it will probably not match firefox opera or even the next version of google-chrome

first browse firefox or choose google-chrome

it looks normal in google-chrome every column doesn t resize after updating whereas in firefox it gets smaller and smaller

on my mac firefox has no issues whatsoever but google-chrome is worse than i think you ve noticedâ the text exceeds the bounds of the container after the resize

to use it download the extension in either firefox or google-chrome i prefer firefox and hit f12

after that ie slows down at exponential rate when firefox google-chrome and safari are doing much better

in ie and google-chrome the table ends up under my image while in firefox it takes more that 100 an horizontal scroll bar is displayed

note i found an issue if i debbug select with google-chrome or firefox i

if i pick firefox everything works but i want google-chrome

google-chrome is a bit more strict than firefox here

is it possible to adjust rendering of svg content on safari and google-chrome to resemble more firefox rendering

it seems that in firefox ie the line-through style is a bit lower than google-chrome i am not sure if this is because of the implementation of different browsers or something

there is a firebug version available for google-chrome firebug lite but the firefox version is much better and i d highly recommend you at least try it out

the invisible square link is about 200px higher than firefox google-chrome positioning

and found out that framerate of createjs easeljs is much worse in firefox than in google-chrome ie

answers in opera was checking browser support for my page and wanted to search some stuff up. i don t get this message in my default browser google-chrome nor in internet explorer or firefox

it looks like google-chrome is smaller in your screenshot there so firefox could just not be at the defined break-point yet

why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right

i did a couple of screenshots and firefox canvas was faster than google-chrome capturevisibletab

google-chrome is stricter than firefox when it comes to loading data from your local filesystem

when using a font declaration of arial firefox and ie11 show relatively huge variations while google-chrome and opera show smaller variations.

i d recommend google-chrome as its dev tools are truly sophisticated but firefox with firebug also works quite well

in google-chrome the button should be a tad smaller than in firefox

the same word in firefox look wider than in google-chrome

lastly a native app can in fact be a web browser like safari for example however i doubt you re building a web browser unless you re trying to compete with firefox google-chrome safari etc

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

in general i have found google-chrome to be more finnicky than firefox

i also recommend useing firefox and the firebug plugin to do your testing you will get more debugging info there at least use the developer view in google-chrome or ie

first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool

with firefox google-chrome and safari it s less of an issue because those started auto-updating years ago and more than two years ago they stopped blocking methods other than get and post

what i do is to kill firefox google-chrome with the task manager and then have firefox google-chrome restore the pages

and as bonus on google-chrome firefox is better in this case user will never be able to type any accents on the current page in any inputs without reloading the window

also firefox 4 has hardware accelerated canvas that is marginally faster than ie9 and a lot faster than google-chrome

when i ran the test individually with a timer google-chrome actually performed better than firefox hope this helps

font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox

this style works for me win firefox and google-chrome

in wireshark i note that the number of cipher algorithms being presented by ie is a lot less than firefox and google-chrome

i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better

tried both google-chrome and firefox google-chrome is much worse normally a 2nd or 3nd link clicking will trigger

the html tables on my site look nice and the way i intend them to in safari firefox google-chrome but look far wider than the set pixel size in ie

after fixing css background-image style formatting to get better compatibility with firefox and ie i found that google-chrome intermittingly loses the background images when you scroll up and down on the page

google-chrome and firefox are typically more forgiving of these types of errors â while ie8 and below are not

they show up centered on mozilla firefox but in google-chrome it aligns more to the right hand side

i ve read through the documentation on breakpoints in the devtools of both google-chrome and firefox without becoming any wiser on the questions below

in firefox and other browsers the background is much whiter and brighter than in google-chrome

also about firefox i know still less than google-chrome and i m not sure about how it innerly manage resources among threads and if it is even possible to achieve what i want but if possible i d need to do the same work with firefox threads

firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript

firefox has a more advanced plugin than the google-chrome extension but both work

ie edge s loading time is longer than google-chrome and firefox

this inconsistency with the specification is why it s not enabled in firefox by default as the specification may change to match google-chrome s implementation

if you put your cursor over the categories then right-click and select inspect google-chrome or inspect element firefox you can find the class for that element

compare google-chrome to firefox note how the editor is apparently missing in firefox.

often times google-chrome and firefox are better at guessing the meaning of questionable markup ie not so much

firefox apply the last one contrary to google-chrome and ie it s possible that they consider that the first .gecko.single-portfolio renders the whole rule invalid

firefox has supported the newer functions since v39.0 google-chrome is slated to get support in v50

no and there won t be any time soon because google-chrome s add-on api is more restrictive than firefox

regarding the viewport resizing firefox goes 10 by 10 while google-chrome has a wider range 25 33 50 67 ... and other browsers may have other values

another alternative for javascript ajax is writing a google-chrome add-on easier than firefox or embeding a web browser within your application

right now google-chrome is faster than firefox sunspider tests so your statement it loads faster in firefox is not really correct

regarding frequency of polling when no connection is maintained google-chrome appears to be 3 seconds where as firefox s is much larger

on firefox all seems right and a 200 code is returned but with google-chrome you have more information and will see a access-control-allow-origin error


nsurl	nsdata	2
so if i modify the nsurl path with a new image because nsdata bytes is already greater than 0 i don t make the additional call to fetch the new image

1 it seems loading the sound file through nsdata rather than nsurl works faster later in playing


selecteditem	selectedindex	2
i ve found that setting the selecteditem is more reliable than setting the selectedindex

a better option is to have the list box databound to a list or observableobject collection then also two way databind the selecteditem or selectedindex i prefer selecteditem to a property


easymock	powermockito	2
i prefer using powermockito with mockito but if this is not possible i have no problem with using easymock instead

powermockito is an extension of other mocking frameworks like mockito or easymock that comes with more powerful capabilities


vim	kate	1
if vim seems too much by the moment i think that kate is better than gedit


express	geddy	1
geddy is not better than connect express the big thing that differs is the structure of it


retaincount	dealloc	1
if your array s retaincount is greater than 1 at the start of dealloc some other object is retaining it at least temporarily


django	web2py	24
i think you ll find that web2py is even easier to learn and use than rails and django

django turbo gears web2py which is better for what

django is also a wonderful framework but web2py is just better in my limited experience opinion

to avoid misunderstandings my question is not whether web2py or django is better

anything django does web2py does better

i have just spent a few days playing around with web2py and really like it and i am wondering if django offers something more that i am missing out on

i prefer web2py because there are more conveniences built into the environment than offered by django but web2py is much newer than django and hindsight always makes it easier make new implementations better

we thought of django but we think that is very big for our purpose and we decided that webpy or web2py is a better option

most probably we will choose web2py or django depending on which one offers the easier path to a mockup

web2py has more focus on simple is better than complex but django has more focus on explicit is better than implicit

imho it is harder to learn how to create fast and simple web apps with django which is why i recommend web2py

web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears

as i understand it web2py supports gae better out of the box than django

django s is better web2py s appadmin is for administrators only

personally i prefer web2py because i found myself fighting against the framework more when i used django eg can t write python code in django templates

and web2py is more lightweight than django rails whatever on pretty much all counts

to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py

i also prefer web2py s templating language to django s as it allows pure python and does not require one to learn a separate templating language at all

having said that web2py has a lower initial learning curve than django as it was specifically designed as a learning tool

i think i prefer web2py because it does more for me that i don t have to do but from the pov of say java frameworks django and web2py may as well be the same thing

you will get web2py working faster than either django or ror without a shadow of a doubt

anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails

plus moving from a php mvc framework to web2py or even django would make things easier

django s admin is better and more customizable than web2py s appadmin


qtcore	qtgui	1
you will need more include paths in here if you are dependent on more than just qtcore and qtgui but i just put those too for simplicity


antivirus	norton	1
many other antivirus software that works just as well if not better than norton like avg avast and others do allow you to uninstall from the add remove


illegalstateexception	runtimeexception	1
normally custom runtimeexception are a bad idea because they can result in leaky abstractions but here a custom type in place of illegalstateexception may make it cleaner for you to distinguish your timeout exceptions from runtimeexception raised by the student s code


pushsharp	apns-sharp	1
i m the author of apns-sharp and i d recommend checking out pushsharp instead which i also wrote


nsurlconnection	nsoperation	1
right now all the photos are downloaded with a custom nsoperation class run on an nsoperationqueue .however i have heard about nsurlconnection async being more efficient and was wondering which is better of this situation


ctime	strftime	1
the c format is the same as is used by ctime but strftime is more flexible


git-svn	svn2git	16
you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and should not suffer from oom error

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but the right svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

it is great if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for a one-time conversion you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.

it is a great tool if you want to use git as a frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and also makes proper git tags from the svn tags

a simple git-svn will reproduce the svn branches actually simple directory with copies in it so i would recommend using svn2git and git2svn

even though git-svn or the svn2git you used is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility

would svn2git be better that git-svn for this scenario

there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

it has better translation engine than git-svn svn2git that preserves more svn concepts like ignores eols etc

it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn or tools based on it but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case


org.json	gson	7
for parsing json i d recommend using jackson or gson rather than the org.json library

org.json jackson and gson with gson being 10x slower

quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson

or switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jackson

for encoding data in json yes gson is a good approach but i think that org.json would be more easy to use

for 1 see this benchmark i did using jmh which compares jackson gson genson fastjson org.json jsonp performance of serializers and deserializers using stream and databind apis

well sometimes performance and usability can be at odds but i ve found gson to be easier to use than alternatives like jackson org.json and others


xmlhttprequest	jqxhr	3
both xmlhttprequest and jqxhr which is the object jquery wraps around ajax requests have a getresponseheader method so in the always handler jquery or readystate handler xmlhttprequest do this.getresponseheader location

jquery jqxhr - see jqxhr.setrequestheader x-requested-with xmlhttprequest

so i d rename xmlhttprequest to jqxhr which is more dogmatic jquery


qqmlapplicationengine	qquickview	2
headline qqmlapplicationengine is newer and more powerful than qquickview

since qqmlapplicationengine is newer than qquickview one would naturally assume that it is more powerful


namedtuple	dictionary	16
namedtuple have a lower overhead than dictionary since the duplicate keys don t have to be stored per item but have the convenience of named access

i believe a namedtuple would be more suited to this job than a dictionary

namedtuple instances are just as memory efficient as regular tuples as they do not have per-instance dictionary making them faster than dictionary

namedtuple is faster and significantly more memory efficient than a dictionary

first while your use of dictionary is valid i recommend using namedtuple for representing fixed structures with named fields

2 you probably want a namedtuple - i m pretty sure they re lighter than dictionary and you can access properties using dot notation for which i have an aesthetic preference anyway

if you re really never defining any class methods a dictionary or a namedtuple make far more sense in my opinion

depending on your use case a dictionary might fit better than a namedtuple

using a dictionary or a namedtuple would be a better idea because then you wouldn t have to remember what each element in a tuple corresponds to does score come first or does id

i favor returning namedtuple s instead of dictionary s from my apis it s just prettier

namedtuple should perform better less overhead than dictionary if the lists are long

on my system the three element namedtuple drops the per-item overhead to 72 bytes less than a third that of even the 3.6 dictionary and less than a sixth of a 3.6 ordereddict and three element namedtuple remains 72 bytes on 3.5 where dictionary ordereddict are larger pre-3.6

creating an instance of the namedtuple is easier than creating a dictionary

as namedtuple lighter than dictionary

but it seems like using a namedtuple would be even better since they are more memory efficient than dictionary and your variables suggest you can use a fixed set of fields

a dictionary would be a more common choice though and namedtuple is very neat as well


textarea	textbox	12
this will select textbox as well as textarea

other fields like single select textbox textarea or radio get posted as string

notice that the case textbox is where my code fails for everyother field i generate a plain input select textarea field and push it to the container

using field dependency i can hide show field if its select textbox text textarea etc.

i know how to remove text in a simple html textbox but html textarea seem much more complicated

in my original project there is more than one textbox for currency description textarea chekcbox etc

different form element types textbox radio button select textarea checkbox have different ways of validating them

basically i have a form that ask simple questions and the user can answer either in a select textbox or textarea

how does one filter input fields user input in textbox hidden fields selects textarea etc. in a datatable

how can i select textbox and textarea containing portion of an id

if you want to store text data only using textarea or textbox is easier

edit 3 added a message to warn the user when he s been put offline + changed textbox to colored textarea to allow for longer messages + condition to clear the messagebox so that the warning message doesn t go in the conversation


xlsx	ods	2
note to make this work enter your backup folder s id key then choose ods or xlsx by commenting out the other choice

both xlsx and ods are much more complicated than text csv but are each probably the most straightforward of their respective sets of formats


openlayers	proj4js	1
i personally prefer proj4js together with openlayers over the google maps api


agile	sprint	1
agile could be more successfull when the application is in maintenance mode where the application is already in production and the dev is simply adding more features to the application in each sprint


mathml	mathjax	4
if you are targeting android you can use firefox for android by developing a webapp that has native mathml support and because of it will be much faster than mathjax or other javascript solution

note that you can configure mathjax to allow for more than one input form so could use asciimath for everything else and mathml for this

in addition the need for polyfills for mathml complicates matters further as they may handle the interaction differently as can be seen in the sample below when using the button to load mathjax

i read this post any reason to favor mathml syntax over tex in mathjax


fgets	strcpy	1
fgets of course does not process escape sequences any more than strcpy would


wmv	flv	1
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv


sublimetext	scite	2
sublimetext 3 needs much more time several seconds more then scite before the opened file shows up and i suppose it is because sublimetext does some pre-evaluation of the file content like detecting areas suitable for folding there are fold triangles available depending on indentation of non-white characters in the file

i prefer sublimetext 2 but notepad++ or scite might suit you better


ip-camera	rtsp	1
i m trying to grab rtsp mjpeg stream from ip-camera realtime as described in boehme using_libavcodec.html but ported to newer version

infobox	infowindow	3
but i will recommend infobox since i have got my infowindow to work and styled as i have wanted

is there any way to change infowindow with infobox becouse i need more styling than basic infowindows.

if you want to get more out of infowindow and put html content in them i would recommend trying infobox


xctest	kif	2
for kif 3.0 you must select xctest as kif 3.0 targets xctest by default unless you re explicitly targeting ocunit in which case you should follow the same steps as kif 2.0

kif makes ui testing really easy and useful with lots of great apis that are less complex than xctest


int	chars	822
i understand you re after the security by obscurity but be aware that chars varchar columns larger than 4 chars take more space than int does 1 byte

moreover this even used to apply to all integral types larger than chars until one of the tcs for c99 standard finally required all-bits-zero pattern to be a valid object representation for int zeros of all types on all c platforms.

so yeah you can compare chars just like you compare int

you need to use a factor of 1000 instead of 100 since some if the chars codes are higher then 100 for example int h 104

an int is smaller than a string even if the string is empty because an int is smaller than a reference to chars plus more int for the offset length and hash code

the importer might choose chars 5 and int but the next line might be

another problem what does the arduino string class do if the int is less than 1000 or less than 100 and doesn t require 3 or 4 chars to convert to a chars array

if you allocate a chunk of memory sufficient to store an int and then realloc for a chars you will always get back the same pointer because sizeof chars is less than or equal to the sizeof int

now this seems a good idea but i wonder if the standard allows for the case where the alignment requirements for chars are more restrictive than that for int

we have the following stackoverflow answer for reference which describes the case where chars can be larger than int which backs up the assertion in the discussion above

all three of the above variables can be used in any different way i choose string int chars float boolean etc.

libraries regexp regexp.cpp.o in function matchstate match chars const unsigned int

of course int may be somewhat more performant but at the same time chars is usually smaller

this description does not exclude the possibility that for example an int type wider than chars might have a single padding bit that must always be 1

first the chars array is greater than 8 bytes so we can t use it directly as a 64-bit int

schema is simple like hell one table with autoint as primary index and less than 10 int tiny int and chars 10

on mainstream platforms int is wider than chars it has a size of at least 2

or would it be good practice to use an unsigned chars in this case since it allocates less memory than a short int

the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab ... is implementation-defined

however int and long were 1.21x faster than chars and short

regarding your questions on axes a chars is also of type number same as int which accept smaller values byte syze

answering your question a chars is an integer-type of lower rank than int meaning potentially and in practice nearly guaranteed smaller size and value-range and thus pointers to either are different types too

your string has 12 chars if you give 10s the length of the sting is greater than the int so there is no white space

in our case then we have decltype chars + chars is int because chars s conversion rank less than int so both are promoted to int before the call to operator+

2 you can compare to chars just like int b.charat i c.charat j but cannot compare chars to string

however when using substring int beginindex the substring begins with the chars at the specified index and extends to the end of this string meaning you re selecting more than one chars substring except when you re at alphabet.length-1

in the c standard and therefore in the abi implemented on intel platforms all values of integral types smaller than int chars shorts are passed to variadic functions as int on the stack and all float values are passed as double

in that case i need compare chars varying data type may be a table field with int value

with the clarification in your comment - int following a space chars can be more than one digit

for or int which sounds a simpler case and chars could have been both implemented as member operators or as non-member free operators

the integral promotions turn types that are smaller than int like unsigned chars into int or unsigned int

actually when you are trying to compare any numeric value to chars value its not giving you any compile time or run time error because chars is actually represent int16 or 16-bit int value so when you try to compare double int or long with it it will simple compare its ascii value of that chars with it

continuing the int_least8_t example hlp will be promoted to type int which is larger than chars

are chars and small int slower than int

moreover int must be wider than chars hence it can accommodate more than 8 flags which you re not gonna need

if your int value uses more than one chars and includes the sign as you mention then it is more complex

the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined.

a chars literal with more than one chars is of type int and has an implementation-defined value

if so is there some correlation such as 40 digit double int is 50 more efficient as a uid than using 20 chars string

this data setter script is generated automatically i chose to do it int by int to take less space than chars by chars in my .c file

so you must understand that s type mismatch on string to int is more then of int to chars

the compiler warning mentions int because the c++ standard 2.13.2 1 says that chars literals that contain more than one chars actually has type int which has an implementation defined value

varchar requires more processing than an int int or a short fixed length chars chars field does

when small integral types smaller than int such as chars short etc are in arithmetic expression they are automatically promoted to int

you can define the mapping in a dictionary with the keys as the chars to be mapped and their values int with the lower value chars having smaller int as shown below

since chars types have lower precedence than int types the query is basically the same as

use charat int index instead of split which is o n time complexity and compare chars not string s it s faster

when you use a varargs function int types smaller than int like chars are promoted to int

an int chars constant includes more than one chars or a wide chars

it promotes all arguments int types smaller than int chars and short are promoted to int

i thought does that mean id can be any int between -128 and 127 no more than 4 chars

for one thing an int can easily be more than 1 chars in length which would stop single chars conversion from solving my problem

if z has a type that shorter than int chars you can try the following trick

intuitively the partial specialization does not match chars int because chars does not match int

a narrowing conversion like int to chars if int has a larger range than chars yields some implementation-defined conversion

since every possible byte short chars int float double can be represented as a double its is much more efficient as its a primitive instead of any object and simpler to use double instead of number you would need specific types if you need long accurately or bigdecimal or biginteger

thus when you use it with objects of type chars which is smaller than int these values are automatically converted to int before the operation happens

x is of type chars chars to int is a better conversion than chars to

if you try to print a chars whose int value is greater than about 127 you might find it prints gibberish

can anyone please explain why the compiler chooses chars over int for inh p1 in this example

i d expect int to to be a better choice than int to which could be allowed by int to chars conversions

you can t index like that it makes no sense since you only have room for 8x8 elements and the int value of chars is often larger than 0..7 which is your index space in each dimension

macro int vkill this is the subscript for the kill chars in the

1 at least for 8-bit chars s signed chars s or int s with higher precision than chars so virtually always

guids works much better than chars or binary they are fixed size and are often used as keys indices instead of int when more bits are needed due to their very high speed and low space consumption

the max size of an int is much larger than a chars so your cast may truncate the value

a chars is smaller than an int so you can return it and it will prepend zeroes to make a longer number

by the way it returns an int with 1 more int than chars in msg last int is zero

for example an int might occupy more space than a chars or it might be that the chars lives at an address where no int can ever live.

while it reserves enough space there s a problem when you re comparing chars to chars you compare int to int multi-char to multi-char probably what you want here and you probably had warnings about pointer types that you ignored

the types shorter than int the chars types and short types â i m assuming that short is a 16-bit type which is usually but not necessarily the case are automatically promoted to int

simply because a chars in c++ is a single byte or at least it s guaranteed by the c++ standard to be less than or equal in size to int or short whereas the size of an int is usually larger than a byte

this creates the possibility that even on a system where chars is only 8 bits wide and so int is wider than chars chars constant notations can exist which provide int values wider than chars

if the file is in text format you may be able to fit it in memory just by converting things to int as you read them in since an int stored as chars may take more space than an int stored as an int depending on the size of the int and the type of text file

now i can use sed to switch x y to y x but i don t know how to select the first int without select chars so i have to add a chars in front of pattern 2 to accomplish the task

what i ve tried is similar to list of int s to define iterator de-reference it and compare with chars with if and do this for all vowels and that doesn t work

shouldn t all short or chars types fit into an int by default given that int is larger than either in size

the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars

like other said it happens to work because the internal representation of an int on your machine is little endian and your chars is smaller than an int

int values are easier for sql server to deal with then chars values

the raw storage of your array assuming a 4 byte int should only be 60mb but since each chars of an int in ascii is 1 byte any int with more than 4 chars are going to be larger than the binary storage hence your 130mb file

lets explain this little more by using int instead of chars

so if most are just a few chars a varchar 20 key will occupy more space than an int key

instead you need a way to compare chars with int

int is usually bigger than chars â more suitable for calculations but not so suitable for byte-level manipulation

now the finalstring should result the value in int of all chars but if the value of that particular chars in int is more than 100 then keep it as it is if less then append 0 before that 2 digit int and make final string contains the all value of chars

the int value of the chars 3 is smaller by 2 than the value of the chars 5

i believe it was one of the early pdp machines in which a chars was larger than an int

as soon as your user enters more than sizeof int chars this can cause a segmentation fault

treating the string as an array of chars int would make this easier to compare as you can do a simple comparision on the entry

chars chars varchar is slower then int because integer-integer comparison is easy

well then an int field may just be a better bet than a chars 50

in your code you should compare chars not int

i ve always been taught that if an int is larger than a chars you must solve the byte ordering problem

by allowing an instance of enum to be smaller it takes up less space much like a chars may be smaller than int as is usual

the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars is implementation-defined

the above code doesn t compile but of course if i type annotate quux to be polymorphic everything works fine rightly complaining that it couldn t match int with chars

when you perform arithmetic operations in data types shorter than int for example shorts bytes and chars the end result of the operation is returned as an int

so if you would assign 08 to something bigger than a chars like int or long it would even be valid

to base and the meaning of main changes - it calls base f because int is a better match for chars - it s an int promotion rather than a standard conversion

you can directly compare chars and int types in c so the following code

6.4.4.4p10 the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or

i need to write a template function that can compare int chars and strings but there is a condition strings must be compared by their lenghts

a multi-character-constant is a literal int uses the character-literal-syntax with more than one chars and has an implementation-defined value

this line will cause ub as in these array you don t left space for null chars .also format specifier to read int is d

because a chars would be only one byte but an int is easier to handle for the processor as far as i know

because a single chars can be converted to a unicode value and can be easily stored as int taking up less space than a single chars string

if you are talking about compiler implementation yes i think the c standard doesn t impose any upper bound only minimums like chars is 8 bits or more and limits on relative sizes like long can t be shorter than int

they are often surrogate keys as int create faster joins than chars fileds and especially than multiple field chars joins

i.e. for int you can select between chars short int long

5.2.10 paragraph 7 says that assuming int has a stricter alignment than chars then the round trip of to to generates an unspecified value for the resulting

i.e string chars allocate more than two int allocate we can use

if you compare as int you will need to check alignment and check if count is divisible by sizeof int to compare the last bytes as chars

please note that this won t work for strings longer than 8 chars because mssql builtin xor works only with int and the largest of them is 8 bytes long

a chars can be implicitly cast into an int because an int is bigger 32 bits versus 16

on the other hand i suppose that having a shorthand as int or chars may appear as more acceptable for primitive types

if in that example we input a string larger than 3 chars which are four if we include the null terminator or the int chars type contains less more than 4 1 byte the program would have crashed because we corrupted other areas of memory

if you just have 3 possible values use an array of chars and that will copy 4 times faster than int

when you store a number choose int when storing few chars choose varchar n when using lots of chars use text and so on.

since int is normally wider than chars truncates the value of int being assigned

edit i understand that cin can take in chars or strings but i need to check to see if it matches int because in this example a user may enter his or her age by typing it twenty-three for example

it will take more lines of code but it will likely still work out faster than tostring ing each number as that requires more computational steps to determine the chars value for each digit and put them together and less memory as int values can be operated on more or less in place so instead of needing a string for every number you need three int variables for the whole loop

returning an int when a chars would make more sense is simply an old c cultural decision

i think you can convert the binary to int which occupy less space because they have less chars eg

this is probably due to the arithmetic conversion rules first any int type of conversion rank less than int eg unsigned chars will promote to int or unsigned int

if the same chars appears more than once i put a counter on it and place it back into the map incrementing the int frequency

from portability viewpoint chars cannot be smaller than 8 bits and nothing can be smaller than chars so if a given c implementation has an unsigned 8-bit int type it s going to be chars

as the int are less than 50 and not less than 0 and the chars is meaningful readable

as long as the int is less than 127 then the chars is stored in one byte

never use to compare int objects or float double short chars byte long bigdecimal... for equality

i am guessing that it happens because the size of int is larger than that of chars as such the memory controller the thing which controls memory in c -i don t know the technical term has to move a larger distance

i m looking for a regular expression that can match chars that are preceded by a number int decimal or fractions plus 0 or more spaces

now why chat to int works because every chars is represented as unicode in java so you can think of it as at backend chars is a smaller version of int

this will work if the int are only on chars long but will return false positives on more than one chars

on most machines int is faster than short chars so there s not much to think about there

2 chars has a lower rank than int

same problem as before - you want to treat as an int but you ve declared it as a pointer to chars and you cannot directly compare int values with pointer values

store the set of target int in a set then loop on the string and check if the chars are in the set this is good if the int is more than one digit

make this change and your program will run but be aware that casting an int to an unsigned chars might lead to loss of information as the unsigned chars is a narrower type than the int in most implementations

realloc allocates chars but your array is int which are almost certainly larger than chars

in theory code working with int will run faster then 4 individual chars operations

in c programming language signed int when converted to smaller signed int say chars for the sake of simplicity are of implementation-defined manner

my idea is not to compare chars by chars but insted typecast it to int 4 byte comparison and do the xor operation to test whether they are equal or not

i assume intconvert ... converts an int to a string and thus you get lexical comparisons which meahs 25 is greater than 100 because the first chars is greater 2 1

the following assumes that bool is a synonym for chars or a similar type of size 1 and int is larger than chars

you need to compare chars not int values

1 the assumption is that alignment requirements for type int are be higher than for type chars

sou you either have to change type of a to int or compare chars with chars -

how can i convert it into an int if the string has more than one chars

the firs one is more common and works on all systems where the size of an int is greater than the size of a chars

10 - ... the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars

if chars or short happen to be smaller than int on the current platform they are implicitly promoted to int which is a major source of bugs

so that is a condition saying that p pretending to be a chars pointer needs to be less than 5 int lengths past the start of a pretending to be a chars pointer

in your example the command-line input would be stored in a variable larger than chars such as int and later assigned to chars truncating the bytes

chars columns have encodings and collations and comparing them could involve unnecessary switches between encodings so my guess is that an int will be faster

it will destroy your memory if there s more than 100 chars on a line or more numbers than array can hold but you won t get a faster routine to read in lines of unsigned int

and size of chars is smaller than size of int

but of course you ll have more than one chars or long or int or... to extra bits from

in a lot of code the size of a variable isn t critical because the number is within such a range that a few thousand is way more than you ever need - number of chars in a filename is defined by the os and i m not aware of any os where a filename path is more than 4k chars - so a 16 32 or 64 bit value that can go to at least 32k would be perfectly fine for counting that - it doesn t really matter what size it is - so here we should use int not try to use a specific size

you were trying to compare int with chars

when i try converting ascii int to keys that have more than one chars i always get an incorrect result

...the value of an int chars constant containing more than one

two int will use more space varchar should be replaced with chars cause you size is fix

the set of strings of 1 or 2 chars is therefore larger than the number of int and any hashcode calculation methodology will produce collisions for strings that are 1 or 2 chars long which qualify as short strings i suppose

this is an artefact of your compiler s chars type being a signed int type and int being a wider signed int type and thus the chars constant is considered a negative number and is sign-extended to the wider int type

because unsigned chars type is narrower than as it requires fewer bytes int type - implicit type promotion performed by abstract machine compiler and value of variable c is promoted to int at the time of compilation before application of the complement operation

if i correctly understand when we are using comparison algorithms for alphabetical sort we compare chars codes their int presentation and sort depending on their values

note you can encounter failures if the sum between the two int is higher than the maximum chars value available

since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants

anything more complex than an int or a chars or similar is usually passed as

enter model number or cartridge code and 4201 convert int select chars 113 +char 112 +char 97 +char 122 +char 113 + select case when 4201 4201 then chars 49 else chars 48 end +char 113 +char 119 +char 99 +char 121 +char 113 and

int is faster for where queries from chars

they are the same they both cast the value to an int one is just terser by four chars

as the alignment for a chars might be different from an int that is probably less restrictive assigning a to an might lead to pi being misaligned

so i substring the first chars to compare int values

for this task i think is true for all db because indexes for int values and comparison of int are commonly faster then for chars

as for the int thing in arithmetic expressions which comparison is the compiler converts types smaller than int to an int so a chars type chars is automatically converted to an int with the same value and then you use that int value in the comparison with the pointer given by the string literal

if you want raw binary data first let me tell you that instead of unsigned chars you are better off using bigger containers such as long int or long long

int produce smaller and faster indexes than chars strings

so as per my knowledge the size of the int remains higher than chars so when i am assigning the int variable to chars pointer it must point only first byte of the int variable because cc is a chars pointer

it seems pretty silly that your presumably 16-bit int takes more than twice as many instructions as an 8-bit chars

however chars 36 and int 10 are far away from being equal because a int 10 is much smaller than chars 36

the basis being that an int is larger than a chars and as such there is no chance of loss of information in the conversion

objects or expressions of an int type whose int conversion rank is less than or equal to the rank of int and unsigned int roughly speaking any smaller int type such as boolean or chars types

basically i am trying to be able to get a string of digits that can be longer than an int which is why it uses chars to insert into the myint object using the overload for

chars is just another int type usually 8 bits and smaller than int but still an int type

you can t really concat an int and place it inside a single chars for starters the int itself is larger byte-wise than your entire chars so obviously it can t fit in there

converting to chars assuming a chars is narrower than an int will keep the lower-order bits and lower-order bits are lower-order bits no matter how they are stored in memory

the default display width for an unsigned int is one fewer than that for a non- unsigned int simply because you will never be displaying a - chars

using default string comparison rules chars with larger int codes makes string larger j b

it s going to be a performance memory trade-off anyway because writing one int is generally faster than three chars separately

however an explicit cast is required in your second case where there is potential to lose information since a chars is smaller than an int

should not have more than 6 chars and it should be an int

any type smaller than int so chars or short is promoted to int and float is promoted to double simplifying slightly

since int is bigger than chars an pointer could require less information to indicate what it points to

if there are any ascii control chars or values greater than 127 and it doesn t think its in a utf-8 locale then it will just print int

int types shorter than int short and chars in their various forms are promoted to int and float values are promoted to double

for example a column specified as int 3 has the usual int range of -2147483648 to 2147483647 and values outside the range permitted by three chars are displayed using more than three chars

compare chars instead of converting them to int

the real sha1 algorithm uses blocks larger than a single chars and state larger than an int but basically that s how it goes

also there is no point storing a chars in an int 1 unsigned int 3 or unsigned chars 4 since those can store values larger than chars

do not compare chars with eof which is int

it takes a pathname and an arbitrary int id uses only lower 8 bits so a chars is usually used and generates a probably unique key_t

how can we compare chars stored in ch variable in code #1 with int value returned by eof

as chars has a lower rank than int it is promoted to int zero- or sign-extended

a handy mnemonic is that the small version of the boolean and works on smaller pieces bits instead of bytes chars int etc

well the int uses more slots since chars are usually only one byte

so in this case it s free to use a smaller type than int such as chars

the rank of long long int is greater than the rank of long int which is greater than the rank of int which is greater than the rank of short int which is greater than the rank of signed chars

the stack array must be an int as the pid can be larger than a chars variable can fit my pid was 25689

so if you know that the word will never be more than 50 chars and the offset will fit in a four byte int you can create record entries in the index file that are 54 bytes assuming ascii for the words adjust accordingly

there are 2 32 different values for an int and a string just a few chars long has more possible values than this

you need to type cast the int into chars but still the precision will be lost because you just can t fit int into chars but if the int value is smaller than loss precision can be ignored

int has wider range than chars and you should check if your int value is in chars range before converting back

the problem is that if i enter more than one chars on first cin it doesn t request to enter int value

note that if the arrays are not chars int the optimization does occur and data_p is fetched only once because chars can alias anything but int is more limited

int has a higher precedence than chars so sql server cast - to int implicitly here

on your platform a int is bigger than a chars so you are walking off the end of the array and undefined read really bad things are allowed to happen when you do that

if i remember correctly int take up less storage than chars so you should go with int

before i looked into this i suppose i knew it subconsciously but i never actually thought about it but a 5 chars is smaller than a 6 chars in the same way that 5 is less than 6 so you can compare the chars as int essentially for this intent

but it is a narrowing conversion because the rank of int is higher than rank of chars

theses two links are great specially about to know more about the main reason of this header that is portability but for me what i like most about it that i think uint8_t is cleaner than unsigned chars for storing an rbg channel value for example int32_t looks more meaningfull than simply int etc

or change counter to 32b int should be still more than enough unless you expect thousands of transactions per second - that would remove 8 chars

assuming that you can use a random int generator to pick chars from the strings of the alphabet and digits to arrive at two arrays

anything smaller than an int such as chars is first converted to an int and float is converted to double

an int has larger capacity than a chars so the conversion is not guaranteed to work

you don t need to convert it into a chars vector although int would make more sense

is there anything like.. operating on int are faster than operating on chars

1 pow 2 64 takes 20 chars but the input needs to account for n and 0 so should use 2 unsigned long int could be larger than 64-bit - it must be at least 32-bit

update the reason why int doesn t work in oppose to chars and short is because that when both numbers are added there is a possibility of overflow regardless of being int short or chars while not forgetting integral promotion but because short and chars are with smaller sizes than int and because they are promoted to int in expressions they are represented again without truncation in this line

so for example the value of the chars 3 is 3 greater than the value of 0 so when you subtract these two values you get the int 3

chars 1 takes substantially less space than an int

so i recommend use numbers whenever possible as operation of int data is faster than chars data

100 strings of value x00 take 24 bytes per value too -- but notice that listofstrings is one chars shorter than listofintegers so the 1-byte string takes up 1 byte more than the int 0 and the same amount of space as the int 255

the lexer and parser would not contain any validation that the int was less than or equal to 6 chars

now since you need and p chars instead of int seems better

we are in agreement this this could have been more reasonably defined to mean concatenate given that strings and chars are much more distinct entities from int than they were in past lives the c programming language

you need to compare chars 9 not int 9 as you have a string here

you re attempting to set the value of customerid to the 45 chars long string select convert int customerid from inserted

in you are adding a chars to an int an int can be much bigger than a chars so it chooses the bigger data type int to be the result a.k.a

since an int is 32 bits wide four times bigger than a chars when the pointer is being decremented it is printing out every fourth chars in the reverse of the string

and when given a chars julia s int is more like python s ord

yes you can compare int s and chars s within reason

for example for your case a string chars comparison takes longer to carry out in general considering the int boolean alternative

the compiler may generate warning messages for such conversion as sizeof int is greater than sizeof chars

usually the chars type has no more than 8 bits while int must have at least 16 bits so every unsigned chars will be representable as an int

and will the assignment of int be more efficient then assignment using chars for the same chunk of memory since i would need to loop 4 times as many times if i use chars versus int

i know int can hold data up to 4 bytes much bigger than chars but what s the use of providing data types in c if we can use any of them

how do i choose int only and sort them in descending order and put in their position leaving other chars position intact

this is the same as -ascii except a case is ignored except as a tie-breaker and b if two strings contain embedded numbers the numbers compare as int not chars

given 4.13 says chars has lower rank than int this means chars can be converted to int if needed but why is it needed

so you will compare int x int in yours tables and chars 2 x chars 2 with this new table and the third party table

a longer string of int is larger otherwise compare chars in order

however im encountering an issue were if the int entered is more than 10 chars long the program will still say that the lenght is 10

on my system int is bigger than chars and chars is -128 to 128 so assigning a chars with an int outside that range gives a compiler warning

i am trying to determine whether int will perform better than compressed or hashed chars

it would probably make more sens with a chars instead of an int so you could just do case c case i

which even if some technique is used to prevent promotion of unsigned chars to int before doing the comparisons in the loop operations on int may be more effective anyway

in fact having an int array takes up more space if each int represents its own chars

but still iâ m facing issue when the inputs given are showing as #### if the int exceeds more than 4 chars

php int maximum value is about 32 bits mine is no more than 5 chars

the only difference between a chars and an int is that chars must be smaller or equal to short int

chars and int have different sizes int being much bigger

on some hardware platforms it might turn out that int types work faster than chars types so the selection of the specific type becomes a speed-vs-memory trade-off but once again in many cases when the range of chars is naturally sufficient it might make more sense to use chars instead of int

how come static chars allocates more disk memory than static int

yet c allows unsigned chars to have a wider range than the positive number of int

the problem is that depending on your hardware int can be bigger in size than chars

it s wrong because chars is smaller than int

this is pretty simple for types sizeof int but unsigned chars short is more complicated and requires compiler specific packing

if you want to being able to compare double float int int and chars then use ord

before this happens the value of a in this expression is promoted in int so the result can be larger than a chars

imho a chars 1 code is better than an int for employee types

this is a non-portable way of storing more than one chars s in one int

my results so far have got me splitting the string up and putting them into an array of chars but this is where i ve stopped since i am trying to figure out how to compare chars to operators and chars to int

the value sizeof chars is less than sizeof int

value8 is promoted to int assuming the conversion rank of unsigned chars is lower than the conversion rank of int usually the case on most platforms

wchar_t is just an int type which may be larger than chars

value of an int chars constant containing more than one

the argument promotion for variable argument function follows the normal rule types smaller than int chars short etc are promoted to int

if you want to convert an int to a chars you ll need to instruct the computer to interpret the bytes of an int as ascii values - and it s been a while since i ve done c but i believe the compiler will complain since chars holds fewer bytes than int

i assume this is because comparison between int is much easier than between chars strings but i was looking for some literature to back this assessment ideally some database structure book

alphanumeric keys longer then 4 bytes 4 chars will perform less then an int 4 bytes

the first is that you re trying to compare int values with chars values meaning none of your cases will execute

i want to validate the data contained by value objects before inserting into the database check that php string is smaller than 255 chars before inserting into a column of type varchar 255 or that a string is not inserted in an int 11 table column php date has the correct format etc.

+ is going to be the numeric addition operator and not the string concatenation operator because implicitly converting chars to int has higher priority than the other way around which is unfortunate

depending on the system you may arrive at an int with the internal bit representation which matches char0 char1 char2 char3 followed by another int with the internal bit representation that matches chars four through seven

also please compare with chars values t instead of int

it seems that the const int version is better optimized than the and the even more surprising const chars version

operations on unsigned int are typically faster than on unsigned chars because your processor cannot fetch single bytes but has to get at least a multiple of 4 and mask out the other 3 bytes

i must confess i expected create int to play a bigger role and didn t thing accessing the data in the list and casting it to chars s will cost that much

so even as a chars is smaller than a 4-byte int you have to move them one-by-one into the register to do a comparison

plain chars having unspecified signed-ness allows compilers to select whichever representation is more efficient for the target architecture on some architectures zero extends a one-byte value to the size of int requires less operations thus making plain chars unsigned while on others the instruction set makes sign-extending more natural and plain chars gets implements as signed

i tried solving it using the chr and ord functions but ord s signature is chars - int and not chars - int so it doesn t match with toupper and tolower s

you always have to consider that the id column has any meaning or is it really necessary if you have chars codes using only ascii chars with less than 4 chars length the code will be smaller than the int id column int is stored on 4 bytes bigint on 8 bytes

small update after comments this will not give issues with non-ascii chars and won t match int which is already handled by the other tokendefiner

both chars and int has lower precedence than datetime so your query is the equivalent of

tablea id int match chars 15 multiple chars 10

i see absolutely no reason to write it like this since int main is shorter 9 non white-space chars vs 15 concise and perfectly valid code

in which case the rank of unsigned chars woudl not be less than int and therefore the promotion would be to unsigned int

this will work if the range of int is greater than that of unsigned chars

second int simply take up less room than almost any chars key except chars 1 assuming the use of unicode

the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined

in c enumeration types chars and the various representations of int form a more general type class called scalar types

the only way it could fail to be a no-op is if the range of chars is larger than the range of int for example if chars and int are both 32-bit but chars is unsigned.

the size of an int is certainly larger than the size of a chars

i d expect chars to to be a better choice than chars to which could be allowed by chars to int promotion

an int is a bigger memory area than a chars and when you read you ll pick up other values beside the chars and end up with an effectively random value

this assumes that your int will never be more than 10 chars long

chars is guaranteed to be smaller than int

int and chars are numeric types and chars is guaranteed smaller than int therefore supplying a chars where an int is expected is safe so in a nutshell yes you can do that

chars whose int value is more than 127 7f hex will be converted to uxxxx

i would also recommend against int for nrcombinations because with only six chars with your base 36 alphabet you will get in trouble 36 6 2 31

since a chars is a single byte by definition and since int can t be less than one byte and since in practice all bits of an int are value representation bits it s at best only in the most pedantic formal that a chars can be converted up to a higher type than int

it allows string and int values which is correct but i want to require my text to be greater than 4 chars long

i suppose you also want to match int abc123 as correct string so you need to include letter to other chars

another way to look at it is we assume only a-z was used then with 7 or more alpha chars there are more than pow 26 7 or 8 031 810 176 combinations and an int assume 32-bit has at best 4 294 967 296 combinations

if chars is smaller than int which is true on all but some rare embedded systems this difference can be computed with a simple subtraction both c1 and c2 being promoted to int and this difference is guaranteed to fit in the range of type int

i tried to loop each chars and i have no idea to compare between chars and int

since chars is smaller than int the input will overwrite the variables which is why x has the wrong value

int are much faster than doing string comparison but i think your better of using chars m or f

if i remove the operator then the warning is always emitted and that is probably good as the result of the expression after int promotions is larger than unsigned chars

chars and int could be the same size and chars is unsigned with a positive range more than int

if id was given a concrete type meaning without type variables in it such as then id a would be a type error because a s type chars doesn t match int

... the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars

i m implementing a 128-bit aes encryption algorithm in matlab i m implementing this code based on a functional code in c the big problem is that in the c code all variables are defined as unsigned chars making it easier to manipulate in matlab i declared all variables as uint8 unsingned int 8 bits a part of encryption is almost ready however i came across a problem i was running the code and realized that some values â â were sent wrong from the vector s- box debugging the codes i found the problem there is a moment without code that a letter below returns me the value 255

both of them are wrong because they will cause out-of-range access if sizeof unsigned int is larger than sizeof chars

an int can be more than one chars

select chars cast 90 - 65 rand + 65 as int as alphabets from table1

if it s a text medium int values are safer all non-digit chars are erraneous if it s binary strings make for easier visual inspection r13_55 is clearly an error if your ids are just alphanumeric but is 12372

this creates a list of int corresponding to each letter with 0 if the letter doesn t match chars and 1 if it does and then sums them

the unsigned chars would be converted to 152 as an int which is greater than 7

i ve written chars counter c extension to python looks like 300x faster than collections.counter and 150x faster than collections.default int

the specific reason that you have to pay close attention to byte-order when handling ipv4 address and port numbers is that the structures sockaddr_in and in_addr have data members with int types larger than chars and whose contents are required to be in network byte order

i also wrote 3 functions to compare int float and chars

if you copy int larger than chars like short or long you have to make sure to correct the byte order depending on your cpu architecture

although outer foo chars is a better match for the call foo c name lookup stops after finding outer inner foo int outer foo chars is hidden and so the program prints inner

with strings of 6 chars you already have more possible strings than int values log 2 32 log 69 5.23

int is bigger has more space than chars

original response in the first program you are trying to print a float but you pass an int chars is a smaller int

which takes an int a string and a and while the first element in the has length less than the int we take chars from the string and append them to it

i can write code that successfully returns the int of a single-character string however when it comes to ones that contain more than one chars i can t because of this type error

all the data i am putting into this table is short enough to fit into the require columns product names are less than 200 chars int values are 5 digits or less

you can t use int to store more than 10 or 11 chars long string int because it ranges from -2147483648 to 2147483647 and for unsigned int ranging from 0 to 4294967295

the null chars constant has the same value 0 with type int but is more explicit for the purpose of representing the null byte

note that chars is typically narrower than int but on rare systems chars and int may be the same width

so i ve noticed that chars only moves when my velocity is greater than 1 and is an int but the question is why i can t use move_ip function to have my chars move slower than 1 velocity and in between 1 and 0

in my choose chars scene when a player chooses one of the chars its supposed to change the value of chooseplayer which is initially set to int and then transitions to the next scene

what it does it loops through the chars using int pointers and compares them as int 4byte at a time

a chars is basically nothing more than an int whose value is the encoding of the chars

how do i get the unicode chars from the user whose int values are greater than 255

although they technically can contain more than one chars the endianness of the resulting int constant is implementation-defined and they re not what you want in this case

you could use select chars int but please note it will only work for 27 chars before returning since it s using the chars codes from the ascii table

for the given set of chars by user choose int only and sort them in descending order and put in their position leaving other chars position intact

meanwhile chars can be more than a chars -- you can also treat it as an int type

the type int is an int which is usually wider and so can keep all the possible values a chars can keep

first of all never send int s and other types larger than chars like that - you will ignore endianness and the recipient might be unable to interpret the data properly

i already know how to compare chars type with newline n but i would like to know how to compare an int with the newline n

working with int is faster than chars

so choose int or chars based on what suits you more and not based on which will be faster as you wont notice a difference for data set of this size

i want to know which rules determine chars does not match int

if your main function has two short local variables and not one they will take 4 bytes of stack space so short is better than int and chars if it has 8 bits is even better

here is sample example to compare value with int and exact 5 chars

example to test the first bit of a chars in a system where 8 bit chars are much slower to access than 32 bit int

consequently it is deemed to be a function that returns an int and its arguments are subject to default promotions â float is converted to double and any int type shorter than int so short and chars are promoted to int

but to answer your question the main reason it is failing is because int cannot compare themselves with chars

long long int is greater than long int which is greater than int which is greater than short int which is greater than signed chars

each word that has more chars than the int put in from the user is supposed to be printed

a chars will be 1 byte and int will be more than 1 byte

i tried getsubstring long int but it only works for strings smaller than 4000 chars

also note that when java compares chars to int it uses the ascii value of the chars therefore chars a equals to the int 97 and 1 equals int value of 49 and so on..

and sizeof int is greater than one and the compiler adds padding for the chars member variable - is the compiler-generated code allowed to change the values of the padding bytes

edit but as bali182 said just casting the chars to an int is more readable

because that transfers the computation into the int domain instead of chars which is more natural for computers

if not you ll could eat up more space as the chars 4 needed for the key column uses the equivilant space an int so you ll be using 2x the space for each one you change

also assuming sizeof int 4 your strings must not be greater than 4 chars as you have now and 1 of those needs to be a null termination

another improvement prototypes make it possible to have functions with parameters of type float and of int types narrower than int the 3 chars types and the two short types

note that in k r-style functions function parameters can t have types narrower than int so while void putchar c chars c

however you can easily get int representations of chars so you can compare chars like so

there is no way that you can detect if the user entered more than a chars by scanning a character.you ll have to use an int .since all your case s consist of numbers you re in luck

i know that chars are in a sense int and have lower precedence so my question is very simple are there any major cons to declaring an int array and using it to store chars

so i understand that you can have an implicit cast of int to chars and vice versa in most cases and only need to explicitly cast when the int value is greater than a value of ffff but there are still certain places i m confused on in relation to when exactly you must explicitly cast an int to a chars and when you can do an implicit cast

you will be searching for them chars searches take longer and are more expensive than numeric int searches

instantiate a random int number generator and use it to pick chars from the string representing the text

even half as many int are bound to require more than 3000 chars or bytes

i would either cast the chars to an unsigned int if the unsigned int s value is greater than sizeof chars

compare between chars and int via ascii value is the most efficient way

if the int were all smaller than 128 strings max 7 chars could be stored in 7 bits with the most significant bit to indicate it s a compressed string

since you declared the name as single chars and user enter more than single chars test first chars is assigned to name and rest are placed in the buffer as it is and because those are not int cin doesn t care to ask you at console

i need to convert a given int my int are always less than 30000 to its corresponding hexadecimal value and then get the chars of that value

the reason it happens is to enable you to work with int which is faster than working with chars values

similarly if the score values don t need to be unsigned int make the array smaller by using chars or uint16_t

loss of precision means that int has a larger value and chars is smaller so you can t fit something which is to large for that space

an int though is defined as sizeof int being greater than or equal to a chars c++14 3.9.1 2 and that an signed int must be able to represent c11 5.2.4.2.1

int promotion means that int types smaller than int are automatically converted to int if int can hold all values of the original int type obviously the case for chars signed chars and unsigned chars -- otherwise they re converted to unsigned int

a compromise if you can t redesign the tables that i think will work is to add a persisted computed column with value try_convert int c.answer_text1 or its best equivalent based on what you know about the actual data in the table - perhaps the int value of only columns containing no non-digit chars and having length less than 9

this warning comes up because int typically has a greater range than chars and so some loss-of-information may occur

if a signed 8 bit int or chars is assigned to higher bit int say int it s sign bit will be shifted

if you give more than one chars in a chars literal you have a multicharacter literal which is of type int with implementation-defined value hence the number you got as output

you can add chars and int so try something more like

in java chars is a more specific type of int

reading it into a chars buffer makes it easier to access those four bytes in the int

the int will be faster for joins than a 64 chars string primary key would be

a chars is generally 8 bits and an int is generally more

in c++ ...the value of an int chars constant containing more

and in this example you can see that i compared two chars just like i would compare int egers - with simple

for example if the string is going to store a decimal-formatted 32-bit int you know that you do not need more than 11 chars to do so

you should be using chars s instead of int s since int s are typically larger they commonly occupy a size of 4 or 8 times that of chars on modern platforms

as largest unsigned chars is greater than largest signed chars largest positive int in the range

if the int turns out to be 38 i need the version string to come out as 380 only one zero was added to the end of the int because i wanted a max of three chars and if the int is less than three chars zeroes will be added to make it three

you are allocating sizeof int bytes of memory for your strings which is most likely 4 your input strings read by scanf must not be longer than 3 chars

for instance a plain old c-array of 100 000 chars is smaller than the same 100 000 int by a factor of four but if during an enumeration reading out each index involves a cast boxing unboxing of sorts will we see overall lower performance despite the saved memory overhead

a chars is commonly smaller than an int

is there memset that accepts int larger than chars

it s stated in the standard that unsigned chars has less rank than int and with this the type of the switch condition will be int which further means

as int is larger than a chars the memory gets corrupted

compare chars value to int 1

first the method that gets executed as soon as the user types in more than 3 chars int

if you want to point to more than one int you would need to define an int array which is four times smaller than your chars array - make sure your sizes are correct

basically every chars has always a smaller rank than int and they can all be represented in an int and so the overload with unsigned chars is not a better match because it would involve a conversion from chars to unsigned chars instead of a promotion

but it is type of a chars i connot compare int and chars

compare chars with chars not int

that s why even picky compilers do not issue a warning if you shift a chars wider than 7 bits try it - you ll get the warning only if you shift wider than an int allows

error 185 error lnk2019 unresolved external symbol __imp_pcre_exec referenced in function public bool __cdecl booster regex match chars const chars const class std vector class std allocator int const

number of bits in int should be not less that 2 byte_bit or one of chars will be lost

is there any reason why i should choose int statusid over chars 4 statuscode

also if r_smppid is fixed width change field type to chars 40 or whatever the length of the content is or if it can be converted into an int that s even better

since 8b chars is smaller than 32b int the value is extended to 32b but the sign is preserved when calling printf

does a unique index on an int column perform faster than a chars 5

assuming you are trying to create a 32 bit int out of 4 chars there is probably more checking you can do but at a minimum i would turn this into two methods convertchararraytouint and another one that does each shift shiftcharleft chars numbits and hide all the casting ugliness in there

if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be shorter than a int one

you have to count chars then match with int

as per you requirements your int will have no more than 6 chars 999999 and the encoding should be max 7 chars so a xor of 24 bits will do it

it is likely that one of the types int and chars is a more natural fit to the intended use of member key

c language never performs arithmetic computations withing the domain of chars short or any other type that is smaller than int

it s an int and you cannot print more than int_max chars that way

also teradata implicitly compare chars with int so no need to cast areacode

in c an int is considered true if it is any value other than 0 and all three of those printf calls print more than 0 chars so it will run the first one which returns a value logically equivalent to true so it will stop execution of that line and go onto the next

nb according to the standard the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab ... is implementation-defined.

note that in c# and in .net chars s are more similar to int than to string

but there s no warranty about it the compiler may choose unsigned chars or int or short any of those types are large enough to fit all the values seen in the enum

but if unsigned int foo had a bigger value you will be losing bytes at the moment when storing it in a chars variable and will get unexpected results on your program

provided a string i want to convert the chars from the string to an int add a value from another method getkey to this number and if the result is greater than 26 subtract 26

since you give no information about what it is we can only guess it s either a pointer to the first chars followed by more chars and ending with a 0 or it s a pointer to the first chars and the previous 1 2 4 8 bytes describe the length as an int

however in int expressions types smaller than int are promoted to int so you can don t need a cast to convert a chars to an int

an int key is smaller in size then a chars field for holding 100 chars

specifically any int type with a rank lower than int a chars in this case is promoted to int in an expression

use the select int int method first to select the last chars

the damerau-levenshtein algorithm includes many comparisons and int compare much faster than chars

i guess that the original exercise would ask you to get two different int of probably more than 1 chars each

if the int s can be more than 1 chars use this else see below simplification

however accessing a single chars via a pointer to int is also invalid because on most systems int is bigger than chars so you read or write bytes beyond the end of the object

this will also work on things larger or smaller than int s such as chars s short s long s etc

to answer your question you re currently checking if the ascii value of the chars at the index of i is greater than the chars value of 0 or less than or equal to the int 9

string.substring int startindex int length might help if you need to split into chunks of more than one chars

127 so when you trying to compare int 128 with chars it casts to chars and becames chars -128

there have been machines where sizeof int will be one value probably 4 but where sizeof chars is larger

that s not so much the case any more now that we have multiple types larger than int but back when c was young the int types were chars short int and unsigned versions of those so all the other types were promoted to int and all code to manipulate anything was done with int s

why did you get 0x38 instead of 0x8 because here 8 is a string not a chars variable a bit less obvious than int is the other of the plain integral types the chars

this means bool s size is no more than a chars which is an int type

you can compare chars to chars just fine the same way you can compare int to int and floats with floats

if you mean you want the exact bit pattern in one of your int variables to be treated as a chars that s easier

sizeof int is larger than chars on your system

zim s advice is excellent and searching on int will always be faster than chars

except when your string column contains only 2-3 ascii chars an int always takes less space than a string

storing data in the int form is always more reliable than the chars or string

you should probably always use an id number that way if you change the type name you don t need to update the user table it also allows you to keep your datasize down as a table full of int is much smaller than one full of 45 chars varchars

the test you really want to perform is after i successfully read an int are there any more chars which are leftover in the stream and have not yet been processed

tinyint or int for that purpose is indexed faster and gives better performance in sort or selects than varchar or chars

when you re printing using the default x format the value to be printed is interpreted as being an int much larger than the chars

int is better because with chars n you ll be comparing one chars at a time and unless you collate latin1_general_bin then you ll also be doing a transformation when comparing chars

chars keys are indeed slower for joins compared to int keys

br.read returns a int which has a larger storage capacity than a chars

but in many common situations you can simply compare chars as you do it with other int types

you re comparing chars with int so currently you re comparing them with the control chars u+0003 and u+0004 - you want to compare them with chars representing the digits

the type you use to pass the value around almost don t matter you shoud use a byte-aligned type chars is fine for this although it will likely be upcast to int after almost any numeric operation so int might be easier

if instead your data is stored one chars per int you need more code

for int chars you get -61 but if you use an unsigned chars you get 195 higher bit is used for value not for sign

assuming we re discussing a platform in which length of an int variable is longer than or equal to three bytes i want to access third byte of this int and put it in the chars variable with that said i d write it like this

i understand that a chars is a smaller size than an int

on all of the computers i work with int is faster than unsigned significantly faster than signed chars

this is largely due to the fact that comparing int values is much faster that comparing chars values

note that if you want to do this with strings of arbitrary length you ll need to work with a big int library like gmp or openssl s bignum - the longest type in standard c long long cannot be mapped one-to-one onto the set of c strings that include strings longer than 8 chars because its guaranteed range includes only 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 unique values

i am just stuck on when more than 5 int bytes are entered it wont re-prompt as it does when i enter in a chars data as it continues to dump extra bytes data to tty

a chars is not fundamentally different to say an int it s just shorter 1 byte as opposed to 2 or 4 or 8

indexing on int datatype gives you more performance than indexing on chars or varchar datatypes

in the world of low level languages assembley c java etc. a chars is an int utf may require more than one int whereas a string is an array of int

as for converting to chars arrays as mentioned in the comments it s worth to notice that the convertion function will do similar arithmetic operations in order to convert the int to chars array so doing the reversing using int seems more convenient

the comment is interesting for which purpose would an unsigned chars be faster than an unsigned int on win32

secondly you re trying to match chars to a list which contains int so the in checks are always going to be false

there are only two int types that could be smaller than int chars and short

int values are smaller than chars strings you can fit much more per page than you can with nvarchar and mathematics are more easily done on int

the range of a signed chars is usually -128 to 127 whereas the range of an int is far greater

a memcpy call would take eight or nine depending upon whether count is an unsigned chars or int with only 192 bytes of ram total unsigned chars should be more than sufficient

a conversion from chars to int is needed because no operators are defined for chars you can t check if a chars is greater than another or if a chars is in a given range without converting to int first

you can compare chars byte short int long double and float with without any issues

the sfinae protected function will be preferred if it is valid because int is a better match than chars for 0

the good thing about this macro is that it should work with c89 and c99 compilers 1ll can be replaced with 1l and long long can be replaced with just long and ll with l of course if your c89 compiler does not have the extended long long type from c99 and it also correctly supports types smaller than int chars and short

int is bigger than chars but the result of your operation is typed int which you re then storing in a chars

typically int take up more memory than chars so i will end up with a larger value than c after they are both incremented

because int can become arbitrarily large in clojure the resulting number becomes bigger with every chars thanks to the

you can compare the strings chars by chars the same way you compare int

1 this time involves an integral conversion since chars has lower rank than int and 2 still involves a floating-integral conversion both of which have the same rank conversion

int has a higher type precedence than any of the n var chars types and so it tries to convert all of the strings to int s to see if they re 0

note that in c++ literals having more than one chars still have type int although their value is implementation defined

when using getchar i was told that it is better to use type int than type chars due to the fact that int can hold more values while chars can hold only 256 values

keep in mind that uuid guid is not a basic datatype like int or chars but is more of an entity that has a defined format just like jpg or mp3 files

but to answer your other question in c you can compare chars literals with int

because int comparisons are more efficient and simpler than unicode chars comparisons

operands that are actually narrower than int may depending on the implementation be chars short and wchar_t .

i m not aware of any architecture where --counter or counter-- asssuming we re talking about simple datatypes like int chars etc is slower than ++counter or counter++

writes should be a int which can only contain 0 to 9 and be less than 10 chars

int values have less overhead than chars values

so my guess would be that that chars requires more than 16 bits so it would need to be treated as an int code point

when you do math on a chars it converts to int which is a larger type

to the best of my memory according to the c standard for example a chars is one byte short is wider or the same as chars int is wider or the same as short long is wider or the same as int and so on

here d will match int within string and replace it with x chars

however when you compare int with chars the latter gets automatically promoted to int and then two int are compared

java will allow you to assign chars s to int s since int has a larger domain than chars

the value of an int chars constant containing more

two chars long if the sum of the two int is greater than

you should compare chars with chars and int with int only

but what about signed types smaller than int such as short or signed chars

furthermore the int type is on most platforms a 32 bits wide integral type and chars a 8 bit wide integral type â i say usually because the sizes are not formally defined more than just in terms of int being larger or equal to chars

you are using a chars against a switch of int s that do not match chars codes that you wish to select

thus int is a more restrictive type than chars

however as x and y match int and chars and head z returns type chars i don t see what is causing the problem.

the chars -1 gets promoted to int to be able to compare it with int -1

an int will use less memory space and give faster indexing than a chars

even if it returned chars since both chars and int are integral types of the same signedness and int is wider than chars an int can always store a chars using an implicit conversion sometimes it s called an upcast but it s not really a cast since it s implicit

i have to store about 10 int is it better to use 10 int columns or a only varchar column whit values splitted by a chars

if you need to compare add and or subtract time only values think about the possibility to use a int to store the time value and then to convert it to chars when displaying the result

you will get your data faster comparing chars strings is much longer than comparing two int

the rank of long long int shall be greater than the rank of long int which shall be greater than the rank of int which shall be greater than the rank of short int which shall be greater than the rank of signed chars

certainly faster than iterating chars by chars if not you can try r.matches s index to find matches occuring after index with index being a random int less than s.length

running the same test on linux with gcc similarly pegs int and long as similar and both faster than chars although the difference is less pronounced

for lookup tables with a low volume of rows you can use a 3 chars code as the primary key as this takes less room than an int but the performance difference is negligible

this is commonly true with all dbms int are always faster than strings you compare it using artithmetical ã¼ber fast cpu operations instead of comparing strings chars to chars

weren t the case a chars is always smaller than an int and will thus always fit inside an int so it can safely be promoted

this program is designed to take an int and a name of less than 15 chars and store them in arrays

here int is higher datatype and chars is lower datatype.

since an int is bigger than a chars casting unsigned chars to signed int still retains the chars s original value

one digit per int in which case i d recommend using chars rather

in my program i compare chars against hexadecimal int and i get different results for

another thing is that chars 32 consumes much more space 32 bytes 256 bit where an int 10 only is 32 bit long

the rank of a chars is less than or equal to that of an int so chars is included in here

in most cases int is a lot larger than chars

so instead of having chars name 30 surname 30 friendsid 30 prefer using chars name chars surname int friendsid and use malloc to ask for as many memory as you need

thus when you compare chars you are really comparing the int that represents the chars in a particular charset

do note that the size of a chars is less than an int so the conversion from a chars to int doesn t make you lose anything

when smaller types are involved in an expression with larger types for example chars is smaller than short which mostly is smaller than int which may be smaller than long the involved types are promoted to the larger tyoes

for example if you compare signed chars and a unsigned chars with the value 0xff to a signed int with value -1 you will get different results

some suggests storing it in int is better but other suggests tinyint and enum but some others suggests store it in a chars 1 m for male and f for female

if chars as in is a signed chars or an unsigned chars narrower than int 1 of these 2 is almost always the case will be promoted to int

as mentioned in other posts senderid and sequencenumber are both of type int which is likely to be larger than chars so these values will be truncated

int is sizeof int times larger than chars

the chars array has a lower memory address than the int i variable

using a chars might be slower than using an int

in a certain sense int is a more abstract data type than chars short long or long long as you cannot be sure about the bitwidth

note that there is no need to convert anything to hex - you can just compare chars or int values directly since a hex constant such as 0x3f is just another way of representing an int value

you defined the option variable as chars while you compare it as int later on

it initially has type chars because the expression a has type chars but variadic arguments are subject to default promotions which promote any int type with lower rank than int up to int

this means that as long as you verify that every java chars in your string is less than 128 int value you are going to get one byte per chars with utf-8

normally range of int is much wider than that of chars

name no more than 10 chars last name no more than 12 chars id# a string of 6 chars and 6 int test scores

how many chars you can pack into it depends on the size of int which varies across platforms typically one of 16 32 or 64bit but it could be anything else greater than 16-bit

if chars is smaller then int usually it is so the structure mystructv1 can be smaller than mystructv2

chars whose int representations are 0-31 less than ascii space

also change chars to int it is safer that way as pointed out in comments below

people either use int or chars - though it seem that int might be more frequently used than chars

your limit is in fact less than that since even if the int are unsigned most tokens in practice would be larger than one chars and many tokens require whitespace separation between them

and int is longer than chars typically 4 vs

that does leave one loophole though it s one that would generally be quite horrible that chars and short have the same range size_type is the same as unsigned short and int has a greater range than chars short

the difference between the two pieces of code int vs chars will be clearer is you write

on other machines an unsigned chars can hold values larger than a signed int since chars and int are the same size

operations on int are likely expensive so a chars might be faster

as int is having more precedence over chars will be converted to int

so my question is is it possible to convert the int to string which is longer than 10-12 chars fixed length if possible mix of chars and numbers which can be reversed to the original int

however if your scope is only english language chars would be the best choice as when you use int it consumes more bits that are unused bit which are been padded off with zero this are just extra bits with no significance to match the length of a int

why is f handled by the compiler as an int while it could help be handled as a chars which occupied less memory

for the given set of chars choose int only and sort them in descending order and put in their position leaving other chars position intact

the code could probably be improved a bit by preventing expected being incremented with negative int values coming from random.nextint 1024 by using random.nextint 1024 instead of random.nextint 1024 but i assume no one ever ran into issues because no one uses a shutdown command longer than 1024 chars

either compare chars to chars or int to int

while using chars there is probability of getting garbage value as it directly stores the chars but using int there is less probability of it as it stores the ascii value of the chars

c99 6.4.4.4p10 the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined.

since unicode is a 21-bit chars set it cannot return anything smaller than an int and it can be argued that technically it should be a long since an int could be a 16-bit quantity

and the redis python api makes it very pythonic.essentially the database store would have 200 odd keys and a value in long int associated with 80 of keys or in some cases chars fields that are less than 200 chars

your switch statements are wrong because you read an int then compare it with chars which doesn t mean the same thing

int compare chars op1 chars op2

use int or in this case where the int were larger than 2 31 giving rise to the coercion to double and loss of accuracy iiuc chars instead

i think the conversion to builtin int types for the binary-and operation is likely to make it much faster than working chars by chars because python s int is written in c rather than python

when applying an arithmetic operator each of its operands is first promoted to int if its rank is less than int such as chars or short

and int must be larger or equal than short int accordingly this usually makes chars 8 bits short in 16 and in 32 nowadays

when you do an arithmetic operation like addition with a value of a type that is smaller than int like chars in your case then that value will be promoted to int and the operation is done using two int values

however i m getting an error when the value i assigned is more than the chars int short range eclipse is showing compilation error

we know that chars will have a higher address than the int because once again the standard says so

all of the data in the weight field is less than 6 chars in total length and is either a whole int or a decimal

additionally even if that is fixed you are storing the computer s random move as an int but trying to compare it against chars values to get a result

enter model number or cartridge code and 3733 convert int select chars 113 +char 113 +char 104 +char 106 +char 113 + select case when 3733 3733 then chars 49 else chars 48 end +char 113 +char 106 +char 113 +char 107 +char 113 and kzhp kzhp

int are also faster than a string of chars

i know that that chars s value is actually an ascii number and that 0 is 48 but how do i compare int s 0 value with chars 0 value in an if statement as a example

key is string so will be chars and you are trying to compare with int zero not chars zero

5 is an int which represents a bigger domain than chars

each int value represent a chars this gets more complicated with unicode but that s beyond the scope of this question

when integral types like chars short int bool take less number of bytes than int then these data types are automatically promoted to int or unsigned int when an operation is performed on them

indexes on int columns perform faster than on large chars values

and adding two chars together performs int addition of the chars codes producing a higher chars code which is probably above ascii range so something which looks garbage or graphical symbol

is a search through numbers int faster than chars in an mysql database

first int arithmetic is never performed with operands smaller than int so in the case of both the short and the signed chars operands are promoted to int the two int values are multiplied and then the result is an int

the last thing that you need to know is that whatever the int equivalent of the chars 1 is the actual value is unimportant it is 1 more than the int equivalent for 0

int is bigger than chars typically 4-bytes vs

6.4.4.4p10 the value of an int chars constant containing more

senderid and sequencenumber are both int and will take up more than sizeof chars bytes on most architectures

this package and my answer here may not solve your problem because reading the numbers directly as chars is an easier way to achieve your goal but i thought i might post this anyway as an information for users who may need to use large int with more than 22 digits

you compare chars in the same way you compare for example int just with standard operator

string is a more complex datatype than chars or int for example

it might choose int or it might choose chars

putting chars into int is ok - both are int and int has wider range and chars will fit

i am kinda new to c and i am having trouble using if statements to compare chars input from the user to an int stored in an array

then the multiplication part is the same for both variables the operands get promoted to int because the conversion rank of unsigned chars is less than the conversion rank of int and we end up with the equivalent of

and to prevent having int with more than 7 chars modulo can be used like this

yes it is because int is bigger than chars but using chars instead of int would not be safe for the same reason

it should at least output that the the preferred width of chars vector is bigger than the int vector

in general the result is unspecified 5.2.10p7 if the alignment requirements of int are greater than those of chars which they usually will be

because it s faster and simpler for the computer to compare int than chars for example

there are many options for you like visser suggested you could convert the date time into a long int which allows faster computation or you can keep them as strings or even convert them into chars like what you have done with chars array2

for filtering out the first six letters you can just compare chars like int

let s assume for a minute you re using unsigned chars same applies to larger int of course

integral promotion involves the conversion of int types narrower than int which includes bool chars unsigned chars signed chars unsigned short signed short to an int if possible or an unsigned int

so int that are less than 12 chars are just written normally

thus using a different instantiation of vector with chars or even int will consume more modifiable memory but might due to more efficient code no bit-twiddling be more efficient

what i need is a jsp using jstl that will output column labels as chars a b c... instead of int 1 2 3... and just for fun when the int is greater than 26 it should output aa ab ac...oh and when the int is greater than 52 it should be ba bb bc.

formally they re promoted to int on a usual machine where chars is less than int and then the arithmetic operation is performed

i know that using int is a better paradigm here but the value is a guid with a few chars appended to the front

use the smallest int type for tape elements which is enough use unsigned chars if the alphabet surely has less than 256 chars

the indices to int conversion is harder i need to split the index 4.5 get the number of chars in the 3rd sentence and add up 5

however if you are using or on chars that are beyond 127 then you will need to use unsigned chars or some other solution such as casting to int and masking the lower 8 bits

second problem is that every time a new line feed is allocated to the end of chars sequence when the input is smaller than the int n-1

if you have no more than 16777216 chars of underlying string data 120 000 strings times an average length of 10 chars 1.2 million chars you can take the low-order 24 bits of each int and store the starting offset of each string into your backing array of chars data and take the high-order 8 bits of each int and store the size of the corresponding string there

note that int has a larger range values than a chars so you should check that the value stored in myint will fit into a chars

the if type chars can be converted to else type int without any loss in precision as int has higher range but if the else type int is converted to the if type chars the lower range of chars can cause loss of precision the value of i could be outside the range of chars

as the so link in your question suggests int comparison is faster than chars comparison and yield faster fetch

thus we must choose between int indexes and chars names

public int compare chars x chars y

it is 1 greater than the chars int value returned by strftime so an adjustment would be required if you wanted to use it directly

enter model number or cartridge code and 3733 convert int select chars 113 +char 113 +char 104 +char 106 +char 113 + select case when 3733 3733 then chars 49 else chars 48 end +char 113 +char 106 +char 113 +char 107 +char 113 -- zgiz

in this case i happen to have the flexibility to read the ord of the singular chars and compare int 0 with int 0

by examining the int values of the chars printed you can tell whether the line has more than one chars and what those chars are

if you will have more than a chars 1 can hold go tiny int 0-255 1 byte if you need more go smallint 32k 2 byte if you need more go int 2 147 483 647 4 byte

if int is 4 bytes and represents 2 bytes the int consumes more memory than the chars -array so you are not initialising the full int -memory to 0 by setting all chars -variables

boolean true is more meaningful than int or chars 1

int are 4 bytes while chars are only 1 byte so it seems reasonable to believe that accessing a map item at a given chars key is faster than accessing a normal array item at a given int index

if you use chars x where x 4 your chars key will be greater than a int one

when an int is declared using a chars constant of more than one chars it is sensitive to the byte order of the machine for which the constant was developed

for types for example chars or unsigned chars that have rank less than int the integral promotion will be performed

for example if i declare and only use it in a way that it could have and should have been declared since chars uses less memory than int will gcc optimize that or does it not even matter since it will be converted to assembly

warning language-lawyering follows. there might be a loophole that allows for extended int types with a wider range than _bool but a narrower range than chars

then you need a function called int scanback const chars s const chars matches int start which starts at start goes down to z as long as the chars being scanned at s id contained in matches return the last index where a match is found

my question is how come when the order of declarations are reversed as seen below the int variable i is still at a memory address greater than the chars array

also answer compare as int not as chars

what i want to achieve is to execute a select statement upon chars so that _checking int values are replaced by their respective checktype texts which could be different of course

you could also get interesting results from getbit if the type of a is an int type bigger than chars and the values in the array have bits set outside the last least significant 8 bits of the number

since chars is smaller than int it would be the same

sometimes chars type is more usable than int - fixed size chars doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated values directly in database fields

while shifting the types are automatically promoted to int which is wider than chars most often

the best choice for primary key are int data types since int values are process faster than chars data type values

a chars 3 field also uses less storage than an int

but for 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors data alignment and bulk data access is key int accesses are frequently much faster than chars accesses and long long 64 bit may be faster still for some systems

but it is even beter to avoid this int conversion altogether and compare chars directly

i also think that using read with arguments like read chars int init int end is a better way to read a such a large file

the case of int versus unsigned chars is more complex

an int is usually 4 bytes i m thinking i don t really need more than 10 chars so a varchar 10 would do.

chars and int are two distinct types but this works because an int has more precision than a chars

so b would not be less than c as the ascii values for the chars in 2000 would be significantly lower than the int value 1055

an even number of chars s followed by an int may well therefore take up less space than a chars followed by an int followed by an odd number of chars s

the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars 6.4.4.4

that means that first chars will be 0 if there wouldn t be anything there int is less then 10 and second chars is digit

if your int value is more than one digit you can never expect a single chars to hold it

so obviously you can t compare int with strings so you can t really compare individual chars strings using index s

and int has higher rank than unsigned chars

so i create a custom operator for compare chars varying and int

shouldn t a chars 3 variable be larger than sizeof int

so i am interested in only ascii table representable chars which i assume after conversion to int should be less than 256 am i right

now the three chars types have the same rank and a signed type has a rank always less than int

please note that fgetc requires an int well something larger than a chars -- int is customary for its return value eof is a possible return value in addition to any of the values that chars might take

the second case does the same thing since a signed int is more than capable of holding the full range of unsigned chars values in this implementation

in the do-while loop you are trying to compare chars literal 999 with variable total that has type int

you are comparing a chars not a string ultimately a pointer and you should get a warning here compare int to pointer

in order for this to work reliably c should have type and unsigned int should be strictly wider than unsigned chars

however if i call the function once with a file call it again with a nonexistent file then call it one more time with the original file the chars string buffer is larger than the int length

so choose solution 2 if your key size is bigger than a int or chars

the rank of unsigned chars is less than that of int

there is an important caveat to that though in that while aggregating statistics for reporting sum of how many numbers or calls chars strings are much slower to count than int

since the numbers used can be greater than one chars ie 10 is two chars it would be best to just use a regular int variable

a int type as a wider range than a chars type see this data type range table

a pipe write read is atomic up to pipe_buf chars and an int is way less than that so the reads are predictable

in this case to int as int has a higher data type precedence than n var chars data types

auto is one chars longer than int so the lexer definitely has to do more work

when i edit the main.cpp the content is to defect with int main int argc const chars argv .... more code..

if i had to assume a 1 byte chars is compared faster than a 4-byte int

it is assumed that an int can hold more values than a chars or at least more values that the system s narrow multibyte encoding uses and getchar returns a special constant eof when there it failed to read more data

int are represented using more bytes than chars do

a chars is closer to an int than to a string

this means that the compiler is free to choose chars short int long or another numeric type as the underlying type of myenumtype

you should consider that in c a chars is nothing more than an alias of an int so casting a chars to int is a no-op

the only reason i can think of is the objective-c designers micro-optimising storage because the chars will use less memory than the int

i expect to compare int representation of chars values

i.e if we use int and chars then union will allocate space for chars which has the bigger size and the int too ll be stored in the same space overriding the last one

for example a 32-bit int won t take up more than 11 chars to represent in decimal with an optional sign so your particular example won t need more than 44 chars unless i miscounted

this example is actually undefined since int could have stricter alignment constraints than chars

but there are some exceptions for small int between -5 and 256 and small strings interned strings with a special length usually less than 20 chars which are singletons and have same id actually one object with multiple pointer

i ve heard that for example short can use much less numbers than int however its advantage is that it uses much less memory is there something similar with chars and string

since you take 32 bit int type input the hex representation is not more than 8 chars

sscanf will match chars for chars white-space handled differently though until it reaches d then it will try to match an int

it just means that you can t use one single vector of int to fill more than 4gb so no more than 1g entries in the vector or 4g chars entries

but safe does not mean useful as int is bigger than chars usually we do the inverse to save some memory

in fact quite a bit of i o depends on eof having a value that couldn t originate from the file which basically translates to a requirement that chars have a range that s smaller than int not just smaller than or equal to as the standard directly requires

everyone know int needs aroud 4 times more memory than chars

its because the literals for int or smaller than int as byte short and chars is int

primary keys should be short but typical size abbreviations are rarely longer than 4 chars -- xxxl --- which is the same size or smaller than an int on most database engines int typically being 4 or 8 bytes

when i add any alphabet in the int number or int number is greater than 4 chars in length the string match should fail but it is not failing

i ve tried setting kill as int smallint bool even chars and trying to use t f as values for it

for instance on an architecture where the int are 4 bytes and must be 4 byte aligned an int pointer could be two bits smaller than a chars or void pointer

i changed the input parameters from chars to int to give longer delays.when i checked its not giving accurate delays

i m using strcmp to compare chars arrays in c++ but i get the following error for every occurrence of strcmp error invalid conversion from int to const chars followed by error initializing argument 2 of int strcmp const chars const chars

the rest are at least as large as chars and it s hard to imagine how you d make the i o system work correctly if int wasn t larger than chars

overload resolution in base gets to nearest match chars - int and call using virtual dispatch

actually it does matter in some cases due to integral promotion and the fact that explicit conversion of int to chars truncates higher bytes

this does implicitly at least sort of assume that chars has a smaller range than int so the conversion to int allows at least one value to be represented that couldn t have come from the file

if a variable with a rank lower than int is used in an expression such as chars or unsigned chars it is promoted to an int before the expression is evaluated

third in some architectures chars short are faster than int

for example for types smaller than int if two types chars and short int are added they are promoted to int before any arithmetic operation and result is an int type

i have more than one chars arrays to copy into one string or void or int

as indicated a standard ipv6 address is at most 45 chars but an ipv6 address can also include an ending followed by a scope or zone string which has no fixed length but is generally a small positive int or a network interface name so in reality it can be bigger than 45 chars

this does not only mean that int consumes less space it also means that chars 36 has about 4 times more different keys

if you need to read more than one chars you should use nextline and assign its value to an int

it worked in this case in my first part with chars i tried to look at my first part which works fine and i noticed that chars is easier to convert to int basically i don t need to convert it but with string it doesn t work this way i tried to google it but i can t find proper solution

but you can compare chars with standard operators as chars is just a kind of int type

unsigned chars is smaller than int which means that fscanf overrides destroys some memory you don t own

â the rank of long long int shall be greater than the rank of long int which shall be greater than the rank of int which shall be greater than the rank of short int which shall be greater than the rank of signed chars

in your code on line in the for-loop does no more point to an arrays --the compiler has no information about the length of the variable that it s pointing at whether it is an arrays a single chars or an int or something else-- but it is just a plain pointer presumably a pointer pointing to a default int

enter model number or cartridge code and 3733 convert int select chars 113 +char 113 +char 104 +char 106 +char 113 + select case when 3733 3733 then chars 49 else chars 48 end +char 113 +char 106 +char 113 +char 107 +char 113

actually storing a large number of int values within a string 4 bytes or chars for each int saves more than 80

but chars consume much more bytes than little int for id and position and longs hp

my original solution was naive - it didn t deal with the case when the int hash is less than 100 base 36 - meaning it would print less than 3 chars

regarding the last portion of your question the number of bits of int is always more than chars so it won t cause a problem

so yes inasmuch as the range of type int is in practice invariably larger than that of type unsigned chars you can pass a value larger than unsigned chars can represent to fputc

while this is perfectly acceptable its typically how i do it unless there are more than one chars in a row alignment issues will force the next variable to waste 1-3 bytes anyway which could otherwise have been used for free by an int

be sure c is declared with a datatype larger than chars int is usual

if you re only dealing with arrays of chars or only dealing with arrays of int it s irrelevant because endianness is a property of int and other types bigger than chars

it generates a random number takes a chars from bufferedreader associates the chars with an int through an enum and outputs whether or not the int is higher lower or equals to the random int

i assumed the version using chars variables would run slower than that using int s due to the conversions but on my 64bit dual core ii system the int version is slower

variables that are larger than a chars like int or double are often allocated at an address even dividable by their size

that answer is pretty clear a chars is smaller than an int and when objective-c was designed back in the 80s shaving off a few bytes was always good

2 i have also used int 5 instead of chars 5 cause i need to store only exactly 5 digits in that field i am going to do that by application with regexp and string length cause i know that int 5 could be more than an int with 5 digits

the columns that i am matching on and updating just contain int and chars types none with more than 7 chars max

if all your int are small it might make sense to store all 5 values in a more appropriate type a chars which will use less space than an int

change the match chars on the int portion of the numbers to if you expect lat long without int very unlikely

integral promotion is applied to chars short int etc types narrower than int and the result needs to be casted to destination type if destination is not int

for int and chars it s often more tricky to pick a good value

since int is larger than chars this allows eof to be somewhere inside the space of numbers expressible as int while being outside the set of chars

dr printf uses the stack overwriting some of the space pointed by str but since the int array is bigger in memory than the chars array it is far ahead in the stack and doesn t get overwritten

sizeof chars is not greater than sizeof int

note that since chars are smaller in size than int this casting may cause a loss of data

the value of an int chars constant containing more than one

this likely means that scanf is overwriting adjacent array elements since sizeof unsigned int is most likely greater than sizeof chars

the scan function skips non-digits then reads 1 or more digits as an int into n and finally skips a single non-digit chars

for completeness to see that unsigned chars rank is less than the rank of int we can go to section 4.13 int conversion rank which says

yes you are trying to compare chars with int which wont work

running either id value through a function will prevent any index use the simple mathematic operations on int would be faster than a cast to a chars type followed by a substring comparison

in case on string length should not be more than 64 chars and in case of int value should be in int limit

implicit conversion loses int precision unsigned int to bool aka signed chars

on some platforms an int might be no larger than a chars

if you write more than one chars inside apostrophe compiler can not convert it to chars and will convert to int

the second solution to error checking for input failure doesn t rely on the size of an int being larger than the size of a chars

value of an int chars constant containing more than

so 250 chars long texts are certainly much slower than int ids

i want to insert values in such a way that int value increments when both const chars values are more than 50

far better to use a surrogate key and yes a join on an int is often faster and you can join in delete staments in many databases not use the slower subquery especially since names tend to be longer than a few chars

most importantly you would pick int or chars at the language level depending on whether you wanted to treat the variable as a number or a letter to switch you would need to cast to the other type

although note it s not safe since an int is larger than a chars

this means that num to chars is now better than num to int so the first overload is now a better match and should be selected

int needs more memory than what chars occupies and the conversion cannot be done in a safe manner

-- the rank of long long int shall be greater than the rank of long int which shall be greater than the rank of int which shall be greater than the rank of short int which shall be greater than the rank of signed chars

also formatting string is wrong you want to write int d not array of chars s more here

obviously that number has to be something wider than a byte since there are more than 256 chars java uses a version of unicode where every chars is assigned a 16-bit value and this is why java chars are 16 bits wide and have int values from 0 to 65535

you can also run into type conversion issues if the data types of the columns don t match int fields won t take alpha chars etc. but it is not a necessity that the column names match

therefore i m wondering if there is a hashing function that i can use to return a 32bit or 64bit number of a short string about 5 - 40 chars so that i can compare by int instead of by string

values of integral types narrower than int chars signed chars unsigned chars short int and unsigned short is promoted to int

for functions like printf that use variadic arguments any integral types smaller than an int chars and short are implicitly promoted to int

in many languages ie c etc bytes and chars are more or less 8 bit int that you an perform math operations on

however an int can hold a lot more data than a chars can this is going to give you a warning about overflow and you should listen to it depending on the implementation chars holds -128 to 127 where as int holds âˆ 2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647

you are using int buffer to initialize cv mat with unsigned chars elements that explains why values are written at each fourth element int seems to be 4 times larger than unsigned chars on your machine

short and chars and other int smaller than an int are weaker types than int

even if you think an int hash isn t such a good idea using a 32 chars digest sha-1 md5 should be much faster for selects than the raw string right

the result should match int a and chars b but not int func int a

as it happens the int value of the chars 9 is nine greater than the value of 0 similarly for the other digits

your problem appears to be using an array of chars to store the counts of occurrences rather than an array of int i m guessing that is never less than zero because a chars cannot be less than zero

then your inner loop only has to look up 1 index number for each chars in the string and compare int

since chars is smaller than int it has to be converted to an int

naturally using chars would result in more operations than int

you can almost think of an enum as a stand-in for an int or chars to make things more readable

if an symbol along with a random word is detected while being read i want to drop the symbol and replace the word with the int 16 and if a different string of chars is being used along with the symbol i want to set the number 1 higher than int 16

it has one drawback but i believe it s ok with the question as it compute an int divider to make line shorter than 80 chars the longest line is shorter than 80 chars not exactly 80 chars

once that is done you can go in and tweak the data types to better fit your needs if desired and you can add your own restrictions to the data such as requiring that an xs int value be in a range of 0 and 50 or an xs string value be less than 10 chars long - there are dozens of other possibilities but that should give you the idea

though i m having a problem where a const int within the struct basically is cutting off the productname-string if it has more than 32 chars which is quite annoying

it s theoretically possible that an has a smaller sizeof than a for example if int has stricter alignment requirements than chars this could be a reasonable thing to do

because sometimes the input is larger than 500 chars so i can t store it as an int

this is made more confusing because of the the names of chars and wchar_t you shouldn t see wchar_t as a chars but more as a int which size isn t dependent on the architecture but on the size of the biggest locale and on the value of weof

it would probably be more consistent to use the bits from the lowest value to the highest value and 1 must be cast to uint64_t to avoid arithmetic overflow on int for strings longer than 31 chars if int is 32-bit wide

when you compare chars with an int actually ascii value of that chars gets compared with that int

finally you wrote an int into the memory of the chars object chars n which causes an overflow because the size of an int is always larger than size of a chars

assuming that utdc_samples is also an int type but larger than a chars then the assignment is fine

i m not an expert in the inner workings of mysql but it intuitively feels that retrieving and sorting int fields is faster than chars fields i just get a feeling that a z is more work that 0 1 and seems to feel much more familiar from a computing perspective in which 0s and 1s are the standard on off flags

so uint8_t unsigned chars will be a better candidate in comparison to int

so before calling this method you should verify that all data that come from a user are as they should be if you store an int then that the data passed is an int the string is less than 255 chars ...

your int is larger than your chars - you get the a value + some random data following it in memory

depending on what chars and int on your system are to not assume that int has more bits than chars your intermediate sums may be overflowing

i has lower rank than int chars integral promotion up to int has better rank than a conversion foo to int so 1 is unambiguously preferred

the designers of c thought int main int argv chars argv looked better than main int argv chars argv int

in some cases it will be exactly defined in java or c# an int is exactly 32bits and a long is 64bits while in others like c c++ only the relationships among the types are defined long is not smaller than int which in turn is not smaller than short then chars ...

the chars type is smaller than int and hence can represent less values than int can

an implicit cast is disallowed as an int is wider has a greater range of values than a chars

also you can do this with textarea or better with pre html element

textarea has one more line than pre


boost	allocator	16
i think that the boost manual could have explained how the allocator is used more explicitly

boost intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second allocator to hold the reference count

if what you re really after here is just fast allocator deallocation then you should look into memory pools. i d recommend using boost s implementation rather than trying to roll your own

once you implement that block+vector approach a better performance comparison at that point would be to compare boost s pool_allocator vs std allocator

just to goof off a version using boost string_ref is much faster still due the reduced allocator


erlang	scheme	1
just for the record the tipc addressing scheme is several years older than distributed erlang


nsbuttoncell	nsmatrix	1
building a reverse column order solution as recommended for nstable here for the nsmatrix require some more work since i use a single column nsmatrix with nsbuttoncell


strtol	strtod	3
note atof and similar functions don t detect overflows and return zero on error so there s no way to know if it failed not sure if it sets errno see also keith s comments about undefined behaviour for certain values so the point is you should use strtol for converting from strings to int and strtod for converting to double those have much better error handling

though strtol strtod are probably more useful functions since they also tell you how many characters they parsed successfully

if you want to guarantee that people can t mess up the input like that i would recommend using strtol and strtod in conjunction with fgets instead

the compiler is free to choose a method that is more efficient than memmove


httphandler	httpmodule	3
it is possible to write httphandler or httpmodule which give you more flexibility without requiring asp.net mvc

i need show files from qfilesystemmodel in qtreeview and customize that tree to show one more column with qcheckbox so user can pick 0..n files from that qtreeview


pdfbox	itext	5
i explored itext and chose it over pdfbox it is perhaps 2-3 times faster than pdfbox and adding page is implicit and automatic

i have noticed that content extraction is faster in itext but searching words using regex in the content extracted by itext takes longer time than pdfbox

start with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext s

the trick is that the coordinates i used with pdfbox and the ones we get from the system generating the pdf don t seem to match up with itext s

on the downside pdfbox is less mature than itext so it has less features and documentation available


scipy	sympy	2
another even simpler option than canopy and anaconda is just to download spyder s dmg which comes with the latest versions of numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sympy and the sci-kits

scikit-learn	liblinear	2
you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn

also linearsvc class from scikit-learn performs even better than liblinear whch is also surprising considering that it s a wrapper of liblinear


tinymce	freetextbox	1
if you re using mvc i recommend tinymce or if you re using webforms freetextbox is great


integer	radix	5
note parsefloat and pareseint for compare integer and you need to specify the radix will give you nan for an empty string compare with nan will always be false if you don t want to treat empty string be 0 then you could use them

if this is not the case a standard comparison-based sort algorithm or even an integer sorting algorithm like radix sort is asymptotically better

integer.parseint takes string as a signed decimal integer and that integer must be less than and not equal radix value base

so when using radix sort make sure the longest integer is shorter than the array size or vice versa

a radix search tree trie might be more suitable than a hash if you re mapping from string to integer


ant	maven	116
while ant is cool maven is cooler

while i won t start a war of ant vs maven maven is much more than just a build tool and that may help you in future

you can take a look on gradle which for me could provide more freedom than maven but is easier to use than ant

so i suggest you build a p2 repository can be done in ant but seems simpler in maven tycho and split the projects to several repositories

i personally prefer maven as a packaging and building tool although others prefer ant

i d recommend ant long before maven

while you can munge together a solution with ant maven is a better solution for managing dependencies than ant

you already know the answer to the very oriented body of your question there is no ant equivalent to this minimal pom.xml because unlike maven ant does not define a set of standards patterns conventions in other words a lingua franca or shared language for project management that would make it possible so ant can t beat maven on this sample

note that for more complex builds a java build solution like ant or maven is probably more effective

troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins

ant and maven may be better suited to java than make or as hank gay points out they may not

i feel like using scripts ant maven is more natural for this task whereas java needs to work hard to read all the files folders to heap and write them to another folder

if the ant tasks are doing more complicated things which cannot be achieved by maven then you could still look at using the maven antrun plugin

the quotation you brought up just claim that maven does more than ant so that it s not fair to compare the two

i also find ant with ivy to be better documented than maven although that s not too difficult

ant is simpler and older and the default just called a java project maven is newer more powerful and flexible

maven is a better alternative as build system compared to ant

i personally prefer maven than ant

i know that ant would be better for this but i m using maven in my project

often running the equivalent commands in the terminal be they ant maven etc. is clearer when failures occur because you ll see the full error output

to echo other sentiments i find there is more configuration to do with ant so i prefer maven

first of all ant is older than maven and therefore does not include core support for dependency management

maven is more of a meta-program that can use ant scripts and run your junit tests

for long term i am assuming you re a first year student or similar use i d recommend learning ant or maven

maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known

i don t know exactly how your sources are structured under jdeveloper but you best option here to automate the packaging and the deployment of this ear is imo to use ant or maven but if all this is totally new for you i would recommend using ant

trust me i did this before for another job where the system architect decided that maven was better than ant and all of our projects must be converted from ant to maven

however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven

does this make ant more complex than maven

there are practical as well as stupid reasons to prefer ant over maven and vice versa

also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool

it has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but it does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven

i think updating dependencies with maven is pretty easier than dealing with ant but of course you could select the other way if you feel more conifrtable

in the longer term you should really be looking at a build tool such as maven or ant they are much more flexible and they are less dependent on eclipse so changes in your project configuration in eclipse won t affect the final build so much

1 - why ant script generates more .class files than maven

i would prefer maven for a new project because i can follow sensible maven conventions but would use ant build scripts for existing projects

maven is more or less an update concept of ant

a hood technique is to tag milestone releases of your projects giving then a version number and then manage dependencies with maven or a similar tool a bit more sophisticated than ant

this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java

i personally prefer gradle over ant or maven but it is newer and might be harder to find examples for

if you are looking for a more flexible build than ant or maven but at the same time utilize maven or ivy repositories you should consider gradle

maven can t be compared with ant as in maven vs ant maven is more than a build script than ant is

some people prefer ant as it is more flexible powerful for custom task builds where as some people prefer maven as its a lot more succinct and simpler

also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial

maven definitely has better integration with flex than ant

i find the ant one much clearer than the maven one

the second build can run a shell script or ant instead of maven allowing you easier control of your remote server

i prefer ant over maven personally

i find the simple solution ant calls maven more obvious

i m interested in gradle too but the industry does still favor ant and maven

i had my issues with maven when we migrated from ant and i still have certain concernes on it like were is the advantage of maven if 80 of our swes apply wrong scopes types and so on leading to a massive drawback if they just need to add a fcking jar as well as to refactorings lead by maven gurus

i think that inventing something better than both ant and maven wouldn t be that difficult but that tool doesn t seem to exist yet

and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy

i also prefer ant script over maven

the scenario you described is perfectly fit into an aggregation or multi-module project from my own experience compare with ant maven provides a more efficient reasonable and native way for managing multi-module project with inter-module dependencies

the size of maven jar is bigger then ant jar i don t know why help me please

i know maven is more powerful than ant

its not correct to compare capistrano with ant and maven

if your long term goal is to migrate to using maven to manage the entire build process which one might intend to do for new greenfield projects then i heartily recommend using maven pom.xml files to manage dependencies on behalf of ant build.xml files

for small sub-projects it is perfect the ant i would recommend maven for bigger one

while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2

also if you are just now starting the project i will recommend using maven instead of ant

instead you should use an external dependency management system such as maven or ivy ivy works if you use ant but maven is both a build tool and a dependency management system so i would recommend maven if you can

also note that while maven is no slower than ant for multi-module projects of this sort importing your maven project into an ide will generally result in far faster builds than maven can perform itself

since ant is more of a scripting tool and doesn t impose structure or lifecycle like maven and gradle you simply manually invoke ant when you want to use it

but as i checked-out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant

there are plenty of articles on the net that compare ant and maven so you can look at those but from my experience its always worthwhile to consider how you can improve a project

ant is much more powerful than maven in many respects but maven excels in dependency management and ease of deployment

maven is more like a replacement for ant

and also if i do need which one should i choose maven or ant

this is to learn something new but also because it seems like implementing maven within ant is less of a standard than is just pure maven.

did maven has achieved more then ant or ant is still alive

if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation

but instead of ant i d choose maven because it will require less work imho and it has a built-in feature called profiles that is perfect to manage environment specific stuff like here

i would recommend maven over ant any day

can maven examine and resolve internal dependencies of non-mavenized jar library defined earlier by ant

i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well

it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration

having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management

the use of jenkins should be to configure your ci process pipeline where as for builds you should be using a tool like maven ant there are any more which most of these tools are pretty easy to configure

ant pre-dates more modern tools like maven and gradle that have this feature baked in

maven is better for managing dependencies but ant is ok with them too if you use ant+ivy and build artefacts

first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications

i read a lot about gradle and it seems to be a better solution than maven or ant

i d recommend trying ant first and grokking it before tackling maven

i personally recommend using maven over ant since the dependency management is wonderful for larger projects

but maven and ant are so different that there is no real point at comparing them and maven is still much more than ant + dependency management

if you need to run all 3 in 1 click then you are better off with maven ant or something similar that has a good integration with eclipse

i find it most disturbing to see so few people around here are actually using maven or at least ant though i prefer maven for the dependency handling.

as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application

i agree with previous answers but i would also recommend to use proper java build tool - like ant perceived easier to use but not necessary or maven perceived more difficult to use but really worth learning

in jacoco 0.7.9 there are jacoco ant tasks and in 0.8.0 there will be jacoco command line interface - both provide more freedom than jacoco maven plugin in specification of what should be included into report in particular can be used for arbitrary third-party jar files

but practically how do i decide if ant maven fits my project.let us say that i choose ant for my project.is this a correct decision

i guess that the maven version contains much more than the ant version

you get the same mechanism for other dependency managers like ivy oy gradle maven ivy ant gradle are more than just dependency managers but it s not the point here

if you want to stick to lower level basic file operations ant is better bet than maven

alternate build tools ant lots of configuration gradle conventions again less verbose than maven

i would recommend creating maven or ant scripts to build outside eclipse

while you could use -cp to javac to add the required dependencies to this compilation you d be far better served by learning ant or maven

you can do things easily in ant that are harder to do in maven

ant is older and while it is still used in a number of projects it is rapidly losing ground to maven

if you do end up splitting them out i can recommend maven or ant ivy to help you structure this

in maven you can define a.k.a testing.staging live etc which allow you to configure settings for different environments.all you need to specify maven about the environment for which you want the things to move and maven is capable enough to take care of this.though this can be done with ant also but i believe that maven provides more flexibility

it s a lot easier than ant fully compatible with eclipse use maven eclipse eclipse to create eclipse projects and easy to configure

i would recommend using ant or maven

they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant

if you re just exporting from eclipse directly - i d recommend using ant or maven to get a repeatable build process not tied to the ide

i personaly prefer maven over any other build scenario - since i migrated from ant i did not like maven in the first place but after investing like a day or two into the documentations i started to love it

gradle support is much newer and somewhat less mature than ant or maven but it works

it will depend on the complexity of your builds if you have basic java builds then maven might be more suited as the pom.xml files maven build filds are pretty simple but if you need to do a lot of custom specific stuff you may well end up having ant scripts to perform also if you already have one system in place there isnt necessarily a huge advantage of swapping

maven is higher level than make makefile the classic c c++ build tool or ant build.xml

lots of people love to hate maven but it gets the job done and beats ant by a mile

maven is definitely better than ant and well used for big projects

testing and support of ant code is quite expensive and integration with maven adds even more complexity

the sensible thing is to use ant or maven maven is easier better in most cases

this could be ant or maven i personally prefer maven for it s dependency management


helpers	actioncontroller	1
actionlink helpers is more often used to generate url properly based on the actioncontroller route values etc and anchor tag based on htmlattributes etc


abc	isinstance	1
the fact that checking with isinstance the membership in a concrete type is not so good while checking the membership in an abc is more often useful lies in a principle that the gang of 4 expressed clearly and intensely in the first part of their wonderful book design patterns in a mostly c++ context but it really applies much more widely than that


crossover	mutation	5
when i use only mutation i find better solutions than when i add in crossover

i want crossover and mutation to have less complexity less condition checking

bits so more crossover points are possible also inside a floating point number or is the better solution to set the mutation rate higher and let mutation add more variation in the next generation

in fact each crossover or mutation has less than a 1 chance of producing viable offspring

mutation is typically easier to do this with than crossover


singleton	facade	1
can any one tell me which one is better between session facade class and singleton object design patterns in asp.net


lxml	celementtree	5
instead doing it with lxml which i found to be the fastest somehow even faster than celementtree

i have no recent experience as to how pyrxp today compares with lxml or celementtree

while celementtree is fast the world standard lxml library which also implements the elementtree is faster still

the lxml library is proven much faster for parsing and un-parsing xml but celementtree is much faster for certain kinds of manipulation

as a side-effect of implementing proper parent traversal lxml is a bit slower than celementtree for parsing


spring-data	mongotemplate	1
why does a mongodb query via spring-data mongotemplate is slower when my entity contains an empty array


ganglia	nagios	1
however ambari-metrics is better than nagios ganglia


robotlegs	puremvc	3
carnigorm and puremvc are good choices but my personal opinion is that robotlegs is far easier to work with

puremvc is generally much faster than robotlegs in terms of performance

any large scale flash flex app can get pretty unwieldy without a micro-framework adobe has pushed cairngorm but i personally prefer robotlegs there s also puremvc which i used before robotlegs i prefer rl because it uses native as3 events as well as dependency injection which is easier to test


rubygems	rvm	4
if you aren t in this scenario you should probably not use system ruby or rubygems at all and prefer rvm

you could now use rvm to uninstall the older versions of rubygems in your system and only keept the latest ruby version

if you need it for a production system rvm is already seen as mature enough to maintain rubygems updated with newer versions

something else simpler you could try is to force rvm to reinstall the older version of rubygems and then update it again if required


h.265	webm	1
if you strive to use h.265 to embed better quality video in your web content you should also consider transcoding and including webm


ecdsa	rsa	11
ecdsa is much faster than rsa for private key operations so it should definitely be preferred over rsa when high efficiency is required unless rsa is still fast enough something that may very well be the case

using ejbca 6.2.0 after adding an ecdsa entity certificate on the ejbca s admin server i tried to use the ejbca public web to enroll this entity certificate however it only provides the choice to select rsa key bit length but not the named curves that i need note i have all the certificate ca profile configured as ecdsa

if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signatures - ecdsa signatures are considerably smaller than rsa signatures of an equivalent security factor

rsa is much faster then ecdsa at verification

from the central authority point of view ecdsa also allows better performance on my pc using a single core openssl crunches out more than 6500 ecdsa signatures per second in the p-192 nist curve and only 1145 rsa signatures per second with a 1024-bit key

for the signature part you may want to use dsa or ecdsa they yield much shorter signatures typically 320 bits for a dsa signature of security equivalent to a 1024-bit rsa signature

in this case you d want to choose rsa or ecdsa

- prefer ecdsa over rsa when both certificates are available

dsa and ecdsa both produce shorter signatures with much greater strength that rsa

rsa has much simpler math and can directly encrypt decrypt data you should never compare rsa and ecdsa

suppose the server and client both are capable of handling rsa and ecdsa the client sends a list of cipher suites and server chooses ecdsa for authentication


metaspace	permgen	1
in java-8 permgen was replaced with metaspace which is more flexible in terms of memory usage so you rarely need to tune its size explicitly


boxlayout	grouplayout	2
as a concrete example this boxlayout example is better done using grouplayout illustrated here and here

some don t take too well to added components for example grouplayout while others do better such as boxlayout


memset	memcmp	1
if both were initialized to some common value with memset first before their members are initialized to the same values then they will also compare equal with memcmp unless their members are also structures then the same restrictions apply recursively


atom-editor	lighttable	1
but although atom-editor looks so nice and powerful compared to simple editors with realy huuuge number of available packages plugins lighttable is more elegant


slony	bucardo	1
for just a local setup i would recommend slony but if you would like to offer the developers a local database local machine i would recommend bucardo instead as it offers asynchronous replication


cpython	pypy	68
but for a really useful explanation you d have to tell us exactly which database and library you re using and which python versionâ cpython 3.3.2 s csv module seems to be a lot faster than cpython 2.7.5 s and pypy 2.1 2.7.2 seems to be faster than cpython 2.7.5 as well but then either one also might run your code faster tooâ and so on

i haven t tried comparing the two but this pypy bug seems to suggest that multiprocessing in pypy is slower than in cpython

in the competing programming a lot of problems are never meant to be solved with cpython but with pypy which has a faster integer-arithmetic and a git-compiler but otherwise a python interpreter just as cpython

pypy does not automatically pick cpython paths

i know many of pypy s data structures are actually smaller than cpython s but again that has nothing to do with the jit

edit again one completely different approach would be to use pypy s sandboxing mechanism which should be much more secure than cpython plus a sandboxing module

i have seen some people recommend cpython pypy weave

oh and it can use cpython for its innermost loop or psyco - but pypy is faster than either especially on 32 bit systems

pypy particularly benefit more from the second approach while cpython fared better on the first approach

pypy is supposedly faster than cpython while gevent is based on co-routines and greenlets which supposedly makes for a faster web server

for python there is a pypy project which it includes jit making possible the code to run faster than in cpython in many cases

that site does not claim pypy is 6.3 times faster than cpython

in other words a future cffi release should give an alternative way to do embedding simpler than both cpython s and pypy s custom solutions respectively using the cpython c api and following

i would expect a real cpython version using a custom-built data structure to outperform pypy significantly

just keep in mind most of the time c is faster than python but then again most of the time pypy is faster than cpython

part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython

under cpython tests run 4 times faster than under pypy

secondly the current version of pypy consumes much more memory than cpython in a rather large set of cases

some people may argue with me on this one but i find pypy to be faster than cpython

links to some benchmarks that compare pypy and cpython using a small django framework so i guess it just benchmarks how long it takes to create a view

one of the reasons why pypy can be faster than cpython is because pypy is compiled to a completely separate native executable and does not depend on nor execute in cpython

you could try running it in pypy - for some cases it can be significantly faster than cpython

unfortunately as martijn pieters noted there are no accepted solution for python 3.x and only one for python 2.x and according to the amount of memory spent for solving it numerix could have used psyco the library on which pypy is based much faster than cpython

for example you can compare cpython 2.7.2 with pypy 1.7.0 using the example of praveen gollakota

you might want to try running your trainer under pypy if you aren t already -- it s significantly faster than cpython for some workloads

long-term evidence is showing that pypy runs certain python codes slower than cpython and this drawback seems to be rooted very deeply in pypy

can someone please help to how use that script using the pypy as i heard it is much faster than cpython

pypy which in general is much faster than cpython is considerably slower for this use case

now there are some implementations like pypy rpython which run a static-typing phase and should favor much better than cpython here

note that there are plenty of python implementations other than cpython out there - for loopy code pypy tends to be much faster than cpython

can pypy be expected to catch up and beat cpython also for those two tests

cpython is faster than pypy on the two tests slowspitfire and waf

other things you can look into are using pypy which includes a jit compiler -- you probably won t reach native speeds but it ll probably beat cpython the most common implementation or writing extensions in c fortran using the cpython-api cpython or f2py for performance critical sections of code

pypy is faster than cpython s sum intrinsic because it can figure out that all the elements of the array are numeric and slice out a bunch of per-element overhead

if pypy succeeds to be better than cpython in general which is questionable the main weakness affecting its wider adoption will be its compatibility with cpython

the pypy jit for python is also much more complex than cpython but also typically much faster â increased complexity is a fairly typical cost for speed. the four levels of disassembly for julia code give you access to the representation of a julia method implementation for particular argument types at different stages of the transformation from source code to machine code

i did a search on the web but i was unable to find any evidence that suggests that pypy s memory usage is much more than cpython

if the dominant memory usage is program data structures then i wouldn t be at all surprised to find pypy using significantly less memory than cpython whether or not the jit was enabled

i have read pypy -- how can it possibly beat cpython

i ve tried using pypy because i ve heard its faster than the cpython interpreter but still no good

the answer is simple here - pickle on pypy is slower because it s implemeneted in pure python as opposed to c in cpython

so at this point in time pypy is just over 9 times faster than cpython in this micro benchmark

pypy compiled with jit is almost always faster than cpython frequently by a large margin

jython is more unpredictableâ sometimes almost as fast as pypy sometimes much slower than cpython

as mentioned by ifloop this would be running a cpython c extension module on pypy which often works not always but is slower than on cpython

when people talk about pypy using less memory than cpython this is a major part of what they re talking about

cpython runs on more architectures than pypy and has been successfully adapted to run in embedded architectures in ways that may be impractical for pypy

i finally ran it through pypy and was delighted to discover that when the lists got really deep pypy was running significantly faster than cpython

if that isn t sufficient a lot of standard python code can be run on the pypy implementation which generally faster than the cpython implementation

further the relative speed of profiled code may well differ hugely between them - pypy code is low-level and so introducing profiling is likely to slow it down relatively speaking more than cpython

pypy has a higher recursion limit than cpython normally

i prefer using cpython since it s pre-installed on many systems but if you need access to .net libraries from python or need faster code i guess ironpython or pypy would make sense to use

as gnibbler pointed out cpython is slower in the simple implementation but pypy is jit compiled for much faster code when you need it

pypy s jit can make python code execute much faster than cpython

this is why pypy may be slower than cpython sometimes it needs a warm-up phase in which it can actually optimize repeated operations

as you can see the program is much quicker under pypy than cpython which is why i moved to it in the first place but at the cost of a 10-fold increase in memory

pypy is now faster than cpython in most cases

judging from the benchmarks posted on the pypy speed center it appears as if pypy is faster than cpython for all but two of the tests presented

profiling is known to slow pypy a lot more than cpython

the waf benchmark has less of a pronounced difference in performance and i d guess that the answer would be more complicated some factors pypy does better some factors cpython does better and overall cpython comes out slightly ahead

here is a recent benchmark of jython 2.5.2 running on jvm 7 where jython is slower than pypy but faster than cpython

shed skin becomes fastest pypy surpasses cpython

i saw that pypy is generally faster than cpython

so how is it possible for pypy to be faster than cpython also becomes fairly obvious

i presume it s why is pypy faster than cpython some of the time

pypy is currently more than 5x faster than cpython on average

however consider that pypy might do the linear search 100 times faster than cpython then a few times might be dozens

the most straight-forward c implementation is 100 times faster than cpython pypy is 10-30 times faster and passes the challenge


nofollow	noindex	2
there is an easier method than using noindex nofollow

we ve got a module that you can select noindex index follow nofollow on the admin section of each page


nsurl	nsstring	3
a lot of the time it doesn t seem to be an issue of space storing an nsstring would be more efficient if the nsurl wouldn t contain any other specific data but not to the point of making a difference in most applications

generally for path related operations you should prefer nsurl over nsstring because the path information can be stored more efficiently in nsurl according to the class reference for nsfilemanager

if you need the result as a string you can use the absolutestring method of nsurl it s typically better to use nsurl instead of nsstring for urls though


satellite	altitude	2
vertical position altitude needs one more satellite in view at least 4 so is not always reliable if gps sees only 3 satelites

quote from the third link - the altitude error is much greater because it is a satellite based system

dependency-injection	singleton	1
i did some research and read that singleton aren t exactly good practice and dependency-injection would be a better solution however i have no idea how to achieve this with dependency-injection


nstextview	nstextstorage	1
the nstextview process is much simpler as you only need to attach the nstextstorage object


cagradientlayer	calayer	1
however i wish to use a custom calayer that uses an internal cggradient for drawing instead as this should produce smoother results than cagradientlayer see here


gunicorn	uwsgi	10
i always used uwsgi but realized that gunicorn is easier for simple projects like mine

take your pick between uwsgi and gunicorn - i use uwsgi

according to many benchmarks uwsgi seems to provides better performance than gunicorn and if the performance doesn t change significantly you ll be able to focus your investigation on nginx or ec2 configurations

as other already suggested nginx + gunicorn or better nginx + uwsgi are better options than apache + mod_python to serve your django app

i ve been using uwsgi in production on heroku for over a year and it seems to handle everything a lot better than gunicorn

it suggests that you will need mod_wsgi when you come to deploy to your production server although goes on to state that other deployment options are available such as uwsgi personally i prefer gunicorn but never mind

i sure would like to use uwsgi as it is an ambitious project but at the end of the day i am a developer and not a sys admin and gunicorn is much easier to just get working in the common use cases

many recommend nginx or apache along with uwsgi or gunicorn

it was specifically developed with containerised systems in mind to make it easier and can be a better choice than uwsgi and gunicorn

during setting up production environment you can choose between uwsgi gunicorn mod_wsgi and many others


haskell	scheme	12
i personally believe that it is not worth the effort because basic is a nearly dead language and there are lots of languages better than basic ocaml haskell common lisp clojure scala scheme go d ...

i would recommend learning haskell and a dialect of lisp such as scheme or common lisp if you master either of those you ll gain insight into how things are accomplished with the functional paradigm and it ll help out your python as well

on the other hand higher-level languages like c# or java ruby python perl haskell scheme etc have a more or less substantial underlying runtime support system

haskell and f# are statically typed which is a big advantage for real-life projects but imho they have a little too much syntax and are not as easy to pick up as scheme

i ve also read that scheme or haskell could be better languages to achieve this task

scheme is perhaps more approachable than haskell however

some background i m learning haskell now having earlier worked with scheme and cl and a little foray into clojure

i recommend scheme or haskell

i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

once you get more familiar with haskell you will be able to rewrite standard recursion scheme such as the one above in a more compact form exploiting a few higher order library functions

if you want to learn functional programming on its own terms languages like haskell and scheme may be better choices

i really like thompsonâ s â œhaskell the craft of functional programmingâ because itâ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme


wildfly	glassfish	6
shortly what you need is an application server with java ee 6 full profile support - i would recommend glassfish or wildfly or weblogic from commercial end

i m was trying to use wildfly 10 as application server but this error also happens win glassfish 4.1.1

also note that for example glassfish and jboss wildfly are more than just a servletcontainer they also supports jsf ejb jpa and all other java ee fanciness

a time ago i change glassfish to wildfly it works better than glassfish but i m having some problems with this exception

these days you d better grab wildfly oracle jboss minded and already java ee 7 ready or tomee apache minded but not java ee 7 ready yet as alternative to open source edition of glassfish

my target is wildfly but glassfish documentation is better so i figured i would start there


padrino	ruby-on-rails	5
padrino and ruby-on-rails are more appropriate tools for building an entire web application but if you re just building an api i would recommend keeping things simple

but i don t know anything about sinatra and padrino is the footprint and speed really that better than ruby-on-rails

as wuliwong said sinatra and padrino are way less complex than ruby-on-rails

the nice thing about letting the plugin install it for you is that if you re more familiar with ruby-on-rails than padrino as is my case this will not only set things up for you but also show you were the directives need to go

sinatra and padrino are not automatically faster than ruby-on-rails


tidekit	tidesdk	1
here is the blog post about the comparison how tidekit would be better than tidesdk


salt	md5	32
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed

decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5

i don t recommend using md5 because imho it s easily breakable nowadays especially without any salt

so instead of finding anything that matches md5 foo they need to find something that when added to the known salt produces md5 foo.salt which is very much harder to do

after reading a bit i realized that people doesn t recommend using md5 anymore and use sha256 or above instead i m thinking of migrate to a better hashing algorithm and create my own salt

you can md5 or encrypt for better security the client ip using a secret salt + date and pass this as a parameter in iframe src url

i think i understand the purpose of using sha1 as it s supposed to require more cycles than md5 to hash unhash and the salt is supposed to prevent the use of rainbow tables

having looked at the existing accesses listed i can see that it doesn t appear to be using the salt md5 hash that s stated in the apache docs the hash password that s stored is different to what i m thinking i should expect the salt is significantly more than 2 characters and for security reasons i m reluctant to embed a particular password hashing algorithm in my code

get md5 js implementation and compare salt

now personally i generally use a salt sha-256 hash on my passwords because i thought that md4 and md5 were no longer secure and that hashing a password multiple times would just put too much strain on a server for no practical benefit

encrypt the passwords with one-way encryption algorithm with a random salt like the common opinionï¼š sha-256 is stronger than md5

4 md5 can be made more secure by using a salt

passwords stored as md5 without a salt are much more easily cracked

so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + phpass

hashing with sha md5 or any other algorithm solves the problem of key protection because you don t need to keep any secret value other than salt but salt is significantly less sensitive than encryption key

this uses pdo and prepared statements which patches the sql injection vulnerability in the most elegant way possible not mysql_real_escape_string and also uses bcrypt for hashing passwords which is infinitely better than one md5 with no salt

using sha256 with a salt will be much more secure than md5

a construction with a salt may be md5 answer || salt where || denotes concatenation

if you care about your user s passwords at all use something more complicated than md5 and ideally you should have a salt string of some form

select md5 concat id salt from table where .

please do not just a md5 better use something more secure from todays perspective and salt it properly to minimize the risk of rainbow attacks

it is not better than md5 plus salt

using a encypted method with a salt would be even safer but this would be a good next step past just using a md5 hash

actually you can insert the passwords as a simple md5 hash it will still work for letting the user login though it is recommended to then change the password through the front end system as the salt passwords are more secure

bcrypt is considered the most secure way to implement password hashing with salt because it is slow - much slower than an md5

for the password hashing there are lots of discussions about this out also good answers on so you should probably move away from md5 and use a better salt

if your php installation is too old even salt hash with md5 are better than two-encrypted password

an md5 encrypted password usually includes a random salt to make it more difficult to perform dictionary attacks

you might like plain md5 or sha salt md5 or sha better or some time-consuming method like blowfish recommended

so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + super-extra-cool_hash and quite enough

even with md5 salt it is weaker besides them

if you want to check the password on login - get the password and salt fields from databse get users password from post and compare md5 salt


free	malloc	101
the reason is that you must match malloc and free not malloc and delete

you could have some initial guess for maxsize 8 and grow when needed your data perhaps by using realloc or just by malloc -ing a bigger new chunk copying the older chunk inside then free -ing that older chunk

as long as malloc can allocate it you can fill it up with fread although fread is free to read a smaller number of elements

i m not totally sure what you are asking malloc minus free is less than the actual usage because of the memory fragmentation if you really need that number you have to use custom allocators which are tiny wrappers around existing ones everywhere in your code which is going to be painful

will malloc free be slower than allocating a big chuck at the begining of the program and running my own memory manager over it

in c you would use malloc to get memory realloc to get more memory and free to release memory

further you are passing pointers to free which are no more returned by malloc family functions

malloc finds 10 more free bytes and marks them as used

it s 4 times faster than using malloc free and copying your data when scaling up

to release it even though what it actually does is little more than malloc and free but by having you call these functions they provide a well-defined and clear api which assumes responsibility for knowing such things

this avoids malloc free but is less extensible and more prone to buffer overflow issues so i rarely ever use it

passing 0 to malloc either returns null or special pointer which can be used to call free it is better to make it initialize simply with null or better an empty string with a 0 character

if the constructors and destructors are empty like for built-ins new and delete shouldn t be slower than malloc and free are

the standard doesn t specify anything deeper than malloc and free which leaves c libraries free to implement them to work in their target environments

you have to match malloc with free

the c++-way is more readable in my opinion and new and delete are safer than malloc and free

although allocating with and freeing with is probably more c++ than malloc and free

you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers

using malloc free directly is safer

will malloc free be slower than allocating a big chunk at the beginning of the program and running my own memory manager over it

most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position

now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

this is not the case openssl documentation says you have to add something like a block size or so thus i believe you have a buffer overflow in the malloc ed buffer during the encryption which causes a crash during the free ... call --- that s quite usual thing when you destroy malloc free data structures by overflowing an malloc ated buffer

when you use malloc you allocate the struct on the heap the data will be valid wherever accessible 1 until you manually destroy it with free the free function will simply release the memory it doesn t care what will be done with it later it just gives it back to where it came from

fiddly stuff and this is one case where i d recommend using malloc free realloc rather than c++ memory management

i feel the need to mention that java s good garbage collection in general is better than malloc free of c

the overheads are typically smaller than malloc free in c or new dispose in c++

one interesting experiment you can try is to try and malloc more memory after you free d that pointer

suppose char p malloc n assigns more than n say n bytes of memory are allocated and free p is used to free the memory allocated to p

presumably the mac malloc aligns to bigger boundaries and so it s spotting the pointer you re passing to free can t be correct since it has the wrong alignment

additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it

i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free

a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

i have written a memory allocator that is supposedly faster than using malloc free

but as programs grow and structs deepen keeping track of what s been malloc d where and what s appropriate to free gets harder and harder

you also have to ensure that you do not destroy free the old block if the malloc fails - you just return 0

but conversely malloc free typically makes better use of memory than a modern copying gc .

dr deallocate memory with the correct corresponding function c s malloc with c s free and prefer alloca -style functions or foreignptr if that s not possible

malloc is much easier to implement if there is no free

in addition to the previous answers the strncpy char pointer which seems unsafe for my opinion and the malloc which is safer but you need to remember to free it outside of the function and its inconsistent with the hierarchy of the program you can do the following

why new delete is slower than malloc free

actually on linux systems allocating a big chunk of memory using the mmap system call is fairly quick but malloc implementations try to avoid mmap and prefer reusing free -d memory

that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

you are not allowed to mix and match malloc and free with new and delete the draft c++ standard refers back to the c99 standard for this and if we go to the draft c++ standard section 20.6.13 c library it says emphasis mine going forward

on linux these syscalls are often mmap 2 perhaps with sbrk 2 and since linux systems are mostly free software you could actually study and improve the implementation of malloc musl libc implementation of malloc the more common gnu libc malloc implementation is perhaps more complex to understand

as you suspect a normal free and malloc would be faster but that s because they do less

but apparently tracing garbage collection is so good that it is better than using malloc free

using malloc and free will require more space in the executable

garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory they need and work with that

the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free

malloc free would be faster on this case

allocating more memory with malloc does not prevent the memory error if the free call inside the dosomething method is incommented

speed-wise the above seem to be at least an order of magnitude slower than glibc malloc free on my machine

use of malloc free is even more rare and should be used very sparingly

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does

remember malloc is quite expensive action and free costs even much more than malloc

if you choose malloc remember to free the memory when you re done with it

generally new delete and malloc realloc free arrange for more memory from the os using sbrk or os-specific-equivalent and divide the pages up however they like to satisfy the program s allocation requests

if your .so are statically linked to c++ runtimes - you should free objects in the same module where they were allocated since new delete is something more than malloc free and need some extra info to work properly

yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors

i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free

you know -- operations such as new or malloc actually consume more memory than they allocate -- the system uses their own tree structures to keep track of where memory is free and where it is not

on top of that the memory allocated with malloc will take up more space than the actual string both because the malloc and free functions need a bit of information next to the memory block to be able to do their job and because typically the size is rounded up to some good size 8 16 or 32 bytes

finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility

if so destroy free the s buffer malloc it again and rebuild the indices you have to do this since if d has changed all your indices are stale

in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

you can almost certainly get away with not free ing allocated memory when your program terminates since it will be reclaimed by the operating system but just as a matter of style and good practice you should still match malloc s with free s.

the only reason to prefer malloc free is if you want to optimize reallocations with realloc which isn t supported by operator new delete realloc is not a simple free+malloc

if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent

i would prefer using malloc and later free it so that i dont have to worry about when the read only string literal get destroyed

i ve seen mention that it is two orders of magnitude slower than host malloc and free

the tool recommends replacing realloc with malloc memcpy and free

writing a fast memory allocator that consistently outperforms malloc free is non-trivial work however and there are issues to consider like memory alignment

actually i usually don t recommend using realloc for that reason just do the malloc memcpy free yourself

in this case using malloc and free is likely easier though to help with compatibility you may want to define them as new and delete

with malloc and free you have a more simple situation

if you prefer malloc you have to free memory with free otherwise you have to use new delete

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

1 okay so it is technically possible to allocate it as one big blob and then wire up the 20-element array to point into the desired offsets into the blob.â â this convolutes free ing though and usually isn t necessaryâ for most use-cases the performance gains would be negligible and you d still need to malloc a separate array of pointers that address into the 2d blob .â â you typically only see 2d-blob allocation when data is massively 2d â such as image data â and access syntax is eschewed in favor of syntax because it s no less efficient than what the compiler would do and doesn t require more than one malloc free pair per blob of data

how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc

i have the line and line number from running gdb but i need to know if malloc and free have been called more than once to confirm that there is indeed at least one case where it runs smoothly

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

instances are created on the stack which is a lot more performant than malloc free calls

the term heap may also refer to a particular data structure but in the context of the c++ malloc free new and delete operations the terms heap and free store are used more or less interchangeably

malloc and free are nonetheless more low level as they just reserve a chunk of memory space which will probably be associated with a pointer

you d probably want to compare malloc and free with operator new and operator delete and their array forms this is how the memory is allocated independent from the construction of objects

if you want better guarantees about zeroing or to get free zeroing on smaller allocations though it s more wasteful the closer to one page you get you can just explicitly do what malloc calloc do implicitly and use the os provided zero-ed memory replace

just use a factory function to create a new object through malloc and do not forget to destroy with free any allocated object

i recommend using malloc free when passing structures to just created threads

is it always necessary to match malloc and free calls

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

for example it is extremely hard to beat malloc and free if your goal is just to write a memory allocator as general-purpose and as well-rounded as malloc

secondly i notice that when i run my program i m seeing the free function call more often than the malloc calloc calls 98 to 16

new delete operator are usually invokes constructors destructors and they are a little bit slower than malloc free

there is no garentee that an access out of bounds of an array will produce a seg fault as it could be part of a different array that was malloc ed earlier or part of free space that the standar library is keeping track of for future allocations and therefore will not segfault

in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc

when the sampling rate becomes higher than the free malloc frequencies of a program spikes start to become visible on a graph where the cpu usage seemed smooth

additionally i try to add the code to delete destroy free as soon as i add the code to create init malloc

avoids n calls to malloc free it s faster and simpler to allocate deallocate

here is a solution which encapsulates the call to malloc allocates a bigger buffer for alignment purpose and stores the original allocated address just before the aligned buffer for a later call to free

it is also non-standard unsafe and non-portable basically worse than using malloc and free in c++


doc	rtf	3
i can help you for docx files rtf files are easier and doc files are quite the same as docx but less well organised

there s a post on the subject on the birt world blog here specifically relating to xls emitters although the tribix emitters mentioned should also enable output to rtf a microsoft format readable by word that is much more concise than doc

if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format

nsscanner	nsnumberformatter	1
i was originally using nsscanner because it was easier than nsnumberformatter to use but i ran into the same problem it doesn t parse the entire string just the first number in the string


ddms	adb	5
you can wait more or kill adb process manually and click restart errors from adb ddms can t bind to local 8600 for debugger

i also check after kill adb in ddms but its don t detects.i am using ubuntu 11.10 and eclipse kepler version

1 goto ddms select reset adb nearby camera icon in the down arrow icon menu

sometimes this also helps go to eclipse window perspective ddms and than from device sub-window choose reset adb

go to eclipse window perspective ddms and than from device sub-window choose reset adb


stringr	stringi	3
you may also want to consider exploring the stringi package which has a similar approach to stringr but has more flexible functions

stringr is newer based on stringi internally and is often even faster

stringr provides more human-readable wrappers around the base r functions though as of dec 2014 the development version has a branch built on top of stringi mentioned below


uilabel	uistackview	1
in this way your uistackview would be dynamic in the sense that when the text in your uilabel gets bigger the separators on both sides would shrink


extjs	sproutcore	2
since you are an advanced javascript user sproutcore or extjs 4 are more apt for your evolution apart from the already mentioned dojo

if you compare extjs to other comparable ria frameworks dojo yui sproutcore then things like footprint css html complexity debugging etc

i have been reading for espresso but i don t find anything great at all if i compare it with appium

for android you can go and use espresso or appium probably appium would be easier for a novice

hence i conclude lubridate to be more practical here also because ggplot does not understand xts objects right away


laravel	silverstripe	1
the silverstripe cms is a great php framework better than laravel the most popular at the moment but its documenation lacking


postgresql	greenplum	5
according to the postgresql which i gather greenplum is based on documentation for sequence manipulation functions it should return the value most recently returned by nextval in the current session.

for high consistency and availability- choose mysql postgresql greenplum vertica neo4j

it would execute the select statement against postgresql to make that available to an external table in greenplum

greenplum and other similar solutions should work a bit better than postgresql depending on your data sets and use cases

at the moment both postgresql and greenplum are open source products so you are free to chose any of them but of cause postgresql community is bigger atm


set	bag	9
since you stated in your comments that the array is a result of a db query you can simply include the bag value in your result set by adding select bag as type to your sql statement

the inverse is adding an item to a bag can be faster than using a set because uniqueness does not have to be enforced

to do this right-click onto your frame and select set layout grid bag layout

take into account that lazy mappings will be disabled so it may be useful to evaluate what will be need to be set to fetchtype.eager with fetchmode.subselect if more than 1 bag is needed to be initialized with it

i d also add that i suspect set semantics instead of bag would be more appropriate for the employee.team and team.employee properties

i ve been reading game coding complete 4th edition and i m having a few problems understanding the pseudo-random traversal of a set path in the grab bag of useful stuff section in chapter 3

for your immediate purposes in your inspector view right-click on the jpanel and select set layout - grid bag layout

a set or bag is easier to map in hibernate and requires fewer database columns

returning the actual set is explained with more details in the thread how to find which elements are in the bag using knapsack algorithm and not only the bag s value


mamp	wamp	7
if you are running windows or mac you can set one up using software like xampp win + osx wamp win mamp osx

but if you d like an all in one approach like wamp with a nice clean and easy to use interface then we d strongly recommend mamp

i recommend using wamp server windows or mamp mac for testing pligg locally

you might need a server for that to work tough in which i case i recommend wamp for windows lamp for linux and mamp for os x

if your just looking to set up a site locally for development i would recommend using wamp pc or mamp mac

differences between wamp and mamp are much less common than server configuration differences between two servers

if all else fails it may help to try another version of sql workbench for a easy-to-use sql sever setup i d recommend wamp or mamp assuming you want a http server bundled with it

updatepanel	scriptmanager	3
in case if updatepanel takes more time to process set asyncpostbacktimeout property of your scriptmanager

i have found that using jquery javascript inside an updatepanel is more hassel than it is worth as you always need to output the jquery javascript using the scriptmanager or the scriptmanager.registerclientscriptblock

if you are more comfortable with updatepanel these should still work if you have everything inside a form tag and a scriptmanager within the form tag too


memset	calloc	23
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset

prefer calloc over malloc + memset

if this were intended to initialize the array memset or calloc would be better to use

as mentioned earlier memset is available but if you choose calloc instead of malloc it will zero the memory for you

only use memset on dynamically-allocated buffers and then prefer calloc

see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc

and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc

malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions

my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc

one reason to use calloc over malloc plus memset is that calloc may be more efficient

if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous

actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest

in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out

an aligned calloc would have required more than wrapping on many platforms to offer more than the aligned_malloc + memset pair thus could be considered inventive and thus was left out

calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram

it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset

it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo

in other words calloc is no more type-wise than memset

your core graphics surface should be cleared to all zeroes before you render to it so i recommend using calloc instead of malloc or adding a memset after the malloc

calloc returns tha address of a block of memory initialized to all bits zero which has the same effect as calling memset but is potentially more efficient

the pattern above is very likely recognised by your compiler and replaced by highly optimised code which will be as fast if not faster as memset but not calloc

in some cases calloc will do less work because it can skip memset entirely

this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed


phpmyadmin	mysql-workbench	1
i think you should install phpmyadmin on your server this will allow you to access your database from work school cafe etc mysql-workbench is more advanced and gives you more features so you can deal with changing the structure and editing any rows columns relations and much more look at phpmyadmin s features it has most if not all

inherited	subclassing	47
since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept

if i have a bunch of fields in a parent class that all need to be inherited by subclassing is it better to have the subclassing nested in the superclass make the fields protected rather than private or use protected accessor

it seems like you re a little confused about what a subclassing and by extension inherited symbolizes instead of thinking that a subclassing belongs to its parent class pretend that a subclassing is a more specific version of its parent class

while it is a debated recommendation to favor composition over inherited my view is to ensure that an abstract-class devoid of abstract methods is not simply a convenient container for methods convenient to subclassing but instead that each subclassing could stand in for its superclass

if you are dealing with large numbers of subclassing instances prototypical inherited may serve you better

since object clone is protected and since java favors subclassing inherited over interface inherited the automatically generated subclassing overrides clone as a protected method rather than a public method

the behaviour with the subclassing or identical classes can be seen easily seen if you explicitly compare with superclass and inherited class

i generally use interfaces are too enforce a common behavior that a group of classes share whereas subclassing is more appropriately used in cases where you can achieve serious code re-use through inherited functions properties

with inherited this is less likely to happen due the contractual nature of subclassing abstract classes

perhaps the class should be decomposed in other classes or subclassing if in your case inherited is more valuable than composition so every class has a well defined responsibility in the system

if we just use concrete classes here and inherited the anotherserviceclass from the serviceclass we will be able to pass it to the mainlogger registerservcie but besides violating dip we will also violate lsp as the subclassing can not be used as a substitute of the baseclass and isp as we clearly have different interfaces here - one to report results and another to do the useful job and you ll also violate one more good rule to prefer composition over inherited

although this problem sort of yells delegate it s much easier with subclassing since you intend to inherited almost all the same functionality

if you still want to favor inherited without necessarily thinking in terms of base class and subclassing you can simply define an interface ex

i don t see any straight way to restrict subclassing from choosing a wider visibility for inherited members

if a subclassing needs more information than the standard parameters which came up for us you have the option of a second parameters class type that you use as a second parameter but then you have two types of constructors in the tree or using inherited in the parameters class hierarchy

if you are going for an inherited approach you should keep in mind that subclassing should be more specialized than their respective superclass

usually i subclassing the stock cocoa classes customize to my needs and if i need custom methods in more than one subclassing i will declare a category on the superclass rather than relying on inherited to provide my custom behavior

still you cannot inherited from a as superclass cannot have a lower visibility than subclassing

with subclassing is trickier because any private members of a class are not inherited by the subclassing but protected and public are

if you really need this consider making a a utility class and embedding it inside the subclassing as a member favor composition over inherited

since simplefactory is not final you can definitely subclassing it gaining more flexibility than with a factory method because simplefactory replaces inherited with composition

but i prefer not to subclassing node classes unless really necessary favor aggregation over inherited

on the contrary since a subclassing inherited all public methods of its superclass the subclassing are definitely bigger

also i recommend you use hashmap instead of subclassing it prefer composition over inherited

the tostring method is inherited from object but can be overridden in a subclassing to get more meaningful output

depending on how your application is structured this means you may want to have your own base class implementing iresource which creates your custom not found resource for all of its subclassing or better make a wrapper since composition is better than inherited

similarly as the subclassing gains more methods it inherited the list of superclass in the order in which they were named that precede it

it not subclassing because subclassing inherited properties of superclass and add some more

now i could make those subclassing of my orientation class but the googles have told me to prefer composition over inherited

there is one careful gotcha if you add an overload to ifoo of a method not an override an overload the order of the virtual methods changes and if you add a new virtual parent the layout of the virtual table can change and this only works reliably if all inherited to your abstract classes is virtual in your public api with virtual inherited the vtable has pointers to the start of each vtable of the subclassing so each subclassing can have a bigger vtable without messing up the address other functions virtual functions

even if you do plan the have more subclassing i would probably still recommend against inherited here

instead subclassing group and let your subclassing wrap a line basically this is favor composition over inherited from effective java by joshua bloch

for classes in an inherited tree that defines __slots__ subclassing will have a __dict__ unless they

creating the views with code only i think one is better off with subclassing if it comes to more than one level of inherited or many ancestor classes for just one base view

the idea is that each state will inherited from a base class called state and the state manager will create and destroy subclassing instances during state transitions

this breaks the inherited and the subclassing is no longer an instance of the superclass

we prefer composition over inherited because when we add particularly or change functionality by subclassing we couple that new functionality to the class - so anywhere we need the new functionality we need that class

in enhanced er modelling subclassing inheriting from more than 1 superclass is called multiple inherited

also consider favor composition over inherited unless the base class is specifically designed for inherited as a change to the base class might break the subclassing

this example is a bit looser than the inherited model provided by languages such as java -- an animal instance can have any behaviour at all rather than one of a specific set of behaviours depending on its subclassing

prefer encapsulation over inherited having each of your current subclassing contain a complex properties with all the common fields

you should generally prefer composition over inherited -- unless you want to customize the behavior of the graph class itself you don t need to subclassing gt.graph just have one as a member of your own class

but native hibernate support regarding inherited mapping is more powerful than standard jpa and single table per class hierarchy or table per subclassing mapping strategies are more suitable for polymorphic queries and associations than table per concrete class strategy

it s conceptually more sound as subclassing a thread suggests specializing its behaviour while runnable s are more like task containers - favor composition over inherited

inherited is more useful when a new subclassing wants to change the way a method works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick

with single table inherited one table must have all the attributes that any of the subclassing need more information

if you want to work your way from the top down especially if the subclassing selection depends on the choices made when constructing the superclass then it s probably much better to favor composition over inherited


client-side	server-side	68
since you don t want to repeat yourself it s very tempting to put all your validation on one side or the other but there are tradeoffs either way and it is true that server-side validation is going to be slower than client-side

my guess is that server-side implementation may turn out to be more flexible and more powerful than client-side as i can add functionality to the server easily as long as the client understands it

the guys from the zk framework actually recommend separating server-side from client-side

storing that info on the server-side is probably more common with the client-side only given his the session cookie

since eventually i d have a button that runs some script on the smeow values and send it to a different request i had a look at the tabletools plugin but it doesn t really play well with server-side tabletools is more focused on the client-side source

ps again i am aware that relying on client-side script is way less secure compared with handling all execution from within the server-side

if the value is changing based on some other input you should capture that input server-side and use it to calculate the value that would have been posted back the same way you calculated which value to select client-side

client-side will also be more responsive than server-side because there s no request-response but that s really only a perceived performance issue for high-latency connections

this would be easier with server-side php plug-in s unless the file is loaded client-side

server-side validation is more secure than the client-side as the user cannot see the code even he does a view-source

i ve scripted server-side but i prefer client-side for the obvious reasons that the experience for the user is generally smoother and there is less load on the server

now my question is two-fold would you recommend paginating the posts server-side or client side i guess i would prefer client-side in this case

first vb.net can be used to perform this xslt transformation which is really simple as you said just applying the xslt stylesheet at server-side if it is considered better than at client-side or even just sending the processing instruction for that to the browser

if you have less than a few thousands records in books table i would recommend disabling server-side processing mode by removing bserverside true to enable client-side processing mode

i am curious to know if detecting the visitor browser with client-side script is more reliable than server-side script

i d recommend exploring client-side ui technologies to use in conjun ction with your java ee server-side stuff

at this point i m putting off worrying about client-side validation since server-side is more important

that said client-side javascript is much more common and if you were using server-side javascript you would probably know the answer to your question

from a web page you can only choose between client-side mail letting the user confirm what they re sending and losing some proportion of respondants who aren t in a position to send mail or a web-accessible server-side mail forwarder either a third-party service or your own server in which case you have to work out the security yourself

how you handle things server-side is far more critical than client-side validation which can and will be ignored by malicious users

so honestly just have them all in one request you have a server-side race condition with client-side latency

as a general rule of thumb at least in security you should trust no user so i think it would be the wise choice to validate the data client-side it s also faster and then if the first validation passed validate it server-side to double-check or to have a safety net if the user has javascript turned off something you don t see that often

i agree that we should prefer server-side checking over client-side but client-side checking is still possible

server-side checks are better than client-side

now if you aren t generating your html server-side and are instead writing it by hand you can make your life just a dash easier with a client-side transformation like this

yes it can be done using jquery but i prefer server-side scripting because as you know client-side code can be disabled by user so check it on server-side and then use redirection feature to take user wherever you want

the easiest solution is to upload it by parts you can do it using flash silverlight js html5 or whatever way you prefer client-side and then joining them server-side

jspm is more commonly used to bring in client-side front-end libraries and npm for server-side ones

as most everybody said the client-side considerations are sharper -- unless you want to try a server-side generator of client-side code like gwt i m told the latter works well but personally i m always wary of code generators esp

long story short my question is why should i prefer client-side over server-side hashing

if getting these in sync is an issue make the client-side timer shorter than the server-side one

a lot of the solutions i ve seen are client-side - i think a server-side solution makes more sense for my needs since i can give feedback to the user if the javascript is invalid and only save it on the server once it s clean

i think the best way would be for you to write some clustering logic on the server-side and leave the client-side to deal with fewer data points

so you do have to be careful not to lose track of what code is client-side and what is server-side which is slightly more difficult when both types of code use the same language but is still not very hard

either a server-side c# or a client-side jquery solution is acceptable although i prefer server-side as that is where the pdf is being generated

are client-side binding grids better than the server-side ones

i know i can do a client-side redirect with html but i understand that the server-side redirect is nicer

it seems simpler to me because i m more experienced with server-side than client-side development

client-side validation is faster than server-side because the validation takes place on client side on browser and the networking time from client to server is saved

the key thing in the client-side logic is to have a consistent manageable api to grab server-side data with and to never represent anything as changed or finished until the server confirms that it s in fact happened

it s can be done in both server-side and client-side but in server-side there s more benefits like database searching before parsing page html and testing routines

maintaining the focus client-side will be much easier than trying to force it through the server-side

in theory encoding client-side is no more dangerous than encoding server-side

to that extent i had to make a few changes to my server-side presentation layer but as a result i think my client-side code is cleaner and more focused on processing actual user events

client-side i could quite easily disable the button onclick - but i prefer server-side solutions to things like this

the server-side way is more reliable and browser-independent while the client-side approach will decrease the amount of incoming traffic to server

but i was working on server-side and probably for client-side it s much easier

i ve found that rendering client-side is nice for small controlled internal uses but for anything where you want tight control over the output server-side is more reliable

not all of the reasons given are necessarily valid but one important one is that unless you re google server-side cpu cycles are a lot more valuable than client-side cycles so it s easier to have the client compile optimize what is quite often dynamically generated html javascript rather than the server

not only is it a good learning language it is still a very useful language to know in regard to getting jobs and will remain so as both client-side and server-side javascript become more important

since servers omit the working copy you should generally expect server-side bare repositories to be smaller than client-side non-bare repositories

i think this method of manipulating the dom from the client-side is easier than using regex from a server-side language

use unique security token for each connection with client save security token on server-side session and compare with client-side stored value

using a slow hash with a cost factor is mandatory usually it is done server-side because client-side languages are slower and can do less rounds

while not really a console skulpt.org runs python code client-side with no plugins or anything which makes it a lot faster than a server-side prompt

i would advice to switch to server-side processing of table data instead of using client-side it is more preferable if your application works with a lot of rows more than several hundreds

this approach isn t working because you re trying to build the page server-side then expect input client-side then do some more server-side work to build the page

because merges are performed client-side they are much faster and less error-prone than initiating a server-side merge

client-side validation is more responsive to the user but always back it up with proper server-side checks

client-side validations can be overriden hacked thus server-side are more secure

with node.js you ll also have one of the faster server-side interpreters at your command faster than python and ruby roughly equal to lua and sometimes up to java s level and somehow v8 has the fastest regex engine in the world and then server-side code matches client-side code which makes things like rpc layers much nicer to work with

first what would you recommend server-side or client-side approach

you can use a customvalidator and perform the regex match server-side and also on the client-side as well if you want

finally after figuring out what i needed was a page access token i gave up trying to do this client-side realising server-side makes more sense at least security wise

in this case your server-side and message transfer will be quicker but your client-side will be slower

is there a way to load it in node.js or is there another proxy that can be used to monitor changes in array for server-side code that will work far greater than client-side code as it will be receiving yuge requests

to solve this i prefer client-side solutions javascript but if you insist on server-side solution then use sessions

the problem is that the server-side selectedindexchanged event triggers earlier than the client-side change event so the data never reaches the server-side


coffeescript	livescript	4
livescript derived from coco which itself was derived from coffeescript it has the more appealing syntax to me it even has my beloved pipeline | operator from f#

coco and livescript on npm or github both are derived from coffeescript and are more space sensitive which allows you to do

i couldn t recommend livescript enough as an alternative to coffeescript

livescript is coco but much more compatible with coffeescript more functional and more feature rich


exponent	modulo	15
in rsa signing a message m means exponentiation with the private exponent d the result r is the smallest integer 0 and smaller than the modulo n so that

so no choice of the public exponent for this modulo is better than 19 using the public exponent to decrypt will work for at least half of the messages when eâ² 9 16 and in many cases for almost all the messages when eâ² 1 16

1024 bit private exponent large number lower than the modulo

little wonder you get errors the exponent is normally shorter than the modulo which is always the same size as the key size

the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero

this size includes some extras like exponent and modulo is there more

the rsa private exponent may actually be shorter than the modulo

edit as gregs points out in the comments you cannot be sure that the private exponent of the key you want to encrypt is smaller than the modulo of the key you want to use to encrypt with

using the pow function and passing a modulo value is faster than computing the full exponent and then taking the modulo because the modulo can be applied to the partial products at each stage of the calculation which stops the value from getting too large 10 6 to the power of 10 6 has 6 million decimal digits with a modulo applied at each step the values never have to grow larger than the size of the modulo - about 13 digits in this example

when i generate rsa key pairs by openssl it seems like private key private exponent is always less than public key modulo

note that the private exponent is limited to value of the modulo but may sometimes be up to a few bytes smaller than the modulo

rsa parameters contains more parameters than modulo and exponent if i remember correctly

the private exponent must not be longer than the modulo

in the most simple way you can look at rsa one key of a keypair is nothing more than an exponent and a common modulo .

i must also add that designing the rsa key so that the private exponent is substantially shorter than the modulo to speed up operations is a security risk if the exponent is smaller than 29 of the modulo length then the key can be cracked


move	drag	21
in other words if i press the image and there is no move recorded for more then 1s nothing happens during this time but if i suddenly move the finger i already see the resized image but if i start moving in less then 1s i see how the image gets resized in the way while i drag it

i also added drag drop fix for chrome browser compactability select move within same column and remove events

the correct solution to this problem is probably to implement a kind of handle on top of the table or something that users could grab drag drop to securely move the whole table at once

i have n rows of content that user should match using drag and drop user move items on the right to the corresponding item on the left

i reimplemented the mouse move press and release events for the inner widget in order to be able to move it inside its bigger parent with drag drop

by setting the move distance to 4000 i am basically saying if your drag is less than 4000 treat it as a click

a mouse-down followed by a mouse-move is a drag if the move is greater than some threshold to allow for human motion while clicking

but if he move the mouse cursor away from the slider while he is still dragging the slider s thumb the drag speed is lower

user can select some images to the screen and be able to select drag move zoom rotate each image

pick move finder items and drag it to your workflow

i have tried moving the files using the repo-browser right-click drag the files and select move items to here as well in the working folder right-click drag select svn move versioned files here and commit the parent folder

but as david said in that way you can only select rather than drag move using mouse

if you want a really really simple example to get you started i have re-implemented a couple of basic features all nice and clean no copyright restrictions - left click to select drag to move right click to connect

i got a draggable object done with jquery ui and when i drag it it s way slower than i move my mouse

i use all the events for the drag operation so maybe the initial move is less laggy perceptually in this case

this is easy to implement with buttons select items click up or down buttons to move - just loop through and apply the move to each selected item but much more difficult with drag reordering

for example i could determine if the intention was to drag the scrollbar position or to interact with some of the child widgets activate select move caret ...

it ends up in a state of confusion...you basically cannot release the drag of the table it keeps getting bigger and smaller as you move your mouse - but you can never let go and release it to get the size you want

do you know of such a three.js project that just like buildwithchrome shows a list of parts and allows the user to select drag drop translate rotate remove snap unsnap parts and move the camera around

the overall effect is that the drag force increases as the spaceship move faster making it harder to accelerate in the direction of motion when the ship move faster

textbox autosizes to its content that s ok but when drag apperas the listboxitem becomes wider and move other items it s not ok


shadowbox	lightbox	1
for a lightbox effect i would recommend shadowbox and it s simple enough to use.


libcurl	typhoeus	1
tldr i would choose typhoeus for its speed and libcurl if you re willing to set things up yourself


knitr	texreg	1
i recommend using texreg and knitr


ndepend	fxcop	1
it would seem to me that tools such as fxcop or ndepend are more appropriate in this case


facebooker	koala	1
facebooker is no longer supported i recommend using koala gem


jms	jta	1
you ll have to use jta if you need transactional access to more than one jms session


jquery	tooltipster	1
however lately i ve been using tooltipster instead because its integration with jquery validate is somewhat cleaner


crossfilter	dc.js	1
i cannot say about how to integrate c3js with angular and crossfilter but if you really want to make use of the wonderful features of crossfilter on your data you may want to prefer dc.js which is intuitive and easy to work


vert.x	netty	3
why should one ever prefer netty over vert.x

also vert.x has little bit better benchmarks than netty

so by asking why should one ever prefer netty over vert.x


qkeysequence	qkeyevent	1
in general you cannot compare qkeyevent and qkeysequence objects


strncmp	strstr	1
you may prefer using strstr instead of strncmp


spreadsheetml	presentationml	1
the one thing to keep in mind is that spreadsheetml is more similiar to presentationml than it is to wordprocessingml in file structure inside the package for every sheet there is a seperate file


16-bit	64bit	15
since a 53-bit mantissa is too large to fit in less than four 16-bit registers or two 32-bit registers performing an addition with a 64bit mantissa isn t any slower than using a 53-bit mantissa so using extended-precision math offers faster computation with no downside in a language which supports a proper type to hold temporary results

some older 32-bit x86 cpus also worked internally with 32-bit integers and operations on 16-bit integers required more clock cycles due to translation to from 32-bit this is not true with more modern 32-bit or 64bit x86 processors as they allow copying 16-bit integers to from 32-bit registers and operating on them with fewer such penalties

most machines now end up with sizeof int sizeof long because 16-bit is no longer convenient but we have long long to get 64bit if needed

the standard only requires that int be larger than 16-bit and no larger than a long so it s not 64bit safe

any char can be to the compiler various lengths depending on the compiler settings including 7 bits rare these days 8 bits what most people think it is 16-bit getting more common especially with unicode i have even come across machine compiler combinations that would store each char in a 64bit locations

that s obviously quite a bit more than the 16-bit that s mandated for an int but equally obviously less than the 64bit mandated for a long long

sometimes when a less than 32-bit 64bit variable is accesses from memory the processor will read 32 bits set the apprpriate 8 or 16-bit then write back the whole register

it logically follows that 64bit integer is faster than 32-bit and when it comes to 64bit cpu s using a 16-bit data as fast as possible int_fast16_t would have int_fast16_min defined to int64_min instead of the int32_min specified in stdint.h

in that case the answer is basically both. normally int won t be bigger than a processor register unless that s smaller than 16-bit but it could be smaller a 32-bit compiler running on a 64bit processor

fixed length different settings best explained with an example - the first 4 bits indicate the length 00 means there are 2-bits following to indicate the distance 01 means 4-bits 10 means 8-bits 11 means 16-bit if there s a chance of more than 16-bit you may want to do something like - 110 means 16-bit 1110 means 32-bits 11110 means 64bit etc

in fact for x86 64 processors performing 32-bit or 16-bit operations are less efficient than 64bit or 8-bit operations due to the operand prefix byte that has to be decoded

let s assume that a chooses 16-bit b c and e choose 32 bits d and f choose 64bit and g chooses again 1024 bits

on today s desktop systems an int is usually 32 or 64bit wide for a correspondingly much larger range than the 16-bit 32767 32768 you are talking of

a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32 bits and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

how many chars you can pack into it depends on the size of int which varies across platforms typically one of 16 32 or 64bit but it could be anything else greater than 16-bit


azure	hdinsight	2
running with azure batch is also an option as the .net will work well and azure batch is cheaper if the custom activity is the only reason for having a hdinsight cluster

for our cloud platform and hadoop we are trying to choose between azure hdinsight and amazon aws emr


unicorn	webrick	5
you don t have to--if unspecified heroku will use webrick by default but they recommend using unicorn as the web server instead for performance since webrick is a single-threaded single process and might break under high load

i ve also found unicorn to be faster than webrick especially in production applications and apps running on heroku

unicorn is supposed to be faster than webrick

in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick

my personal experience is that webrick is faster in my development environment than unicorn and thin os x in a pretty big rails app lots of gems routes etc


lxml	libxml2	6
also since lxml is based on libxml2 and libxslt you ll need less calls into the c api which can be quite expensive in my experience

libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

gimel and tim recommend lxml which is a nicely pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries

but i prefer libxml2 and lxml for python because it seems to be more actively developed and tested

the chapter starts with short course to xml general talk but with the atom syndication feed example then it continues with the standard xml.etree.elementtree and continues with third party lxml that implements more with the same interface full xpath 1.0 based on libxml2

lxml uses libxml2 and provides a nicer interface the elementtree so you get most of the benefit of libxml2 s speed and all of the benefit of it s xpath evaluation


readxl	tidyverse	1
i would recommend using readxl from tidyverse


uilabel	uitextview	15
instead of using uilabel using uitextview gets better results

i m aware that uitextview is much more suitable for this as it implements uitextinput protocol which has all the methods i need but due to a bug in ios i m limited to uilabel

i choose uitextview instead of uilabel because i want to detect phone number link in the supplied text and utilize the built-in function to invoke dialer and browser when users click the phone number or link

using a category on nsattributedstring in priority before uilabel could be more interesting in case you wanted to use the custom nsattributedstring for others kind of object like a uitextview

i too had a similar requirement initially i used uilabel and then i realized that uitextview is better

my problem is uitextview is more complicated than uilabel

you would have to use a uitextfield or a uitextview - uitextview being more like a uilabel than a uitextfield

what i found is that if i build the app using xcode 4.2 base sdk 5.0 deployment target ios 4.0 the size of the text in my uilabel and uitextview renders smaller by maybe 3 points or so

textcontainer s height need to be set depending on the content height for it to work and that is no better than using uitextview or uilabel

so as for now and until i rather prefer using uitextview for displaying simple text on multilines despite the fact uilabel must work for this purpose

or even easier rather than adding uilabel objects to a uiscrollview you could just use a uitextview

i think the problem happened because the padding left right of uitextview is bigger than uilabel

it isn t clear what you mean when you say the problem seems to be with the difference between a .text and string. ui objects like uitextfields uitextview and uilabel have text properties .text in swift syntax that hold the current value in the field

also consider using uilabel instead of uitextview if you don t need to edit information inside since uitextview take longer to allocate and init and are generally slower than uilabel

try to use uitextview rather than uilabel could be better cause uitextview use a contentview that maybe won t be resized immediatly


case-sensitive	case-insensitive	8
string compare is case-sensitive therefore you should either upper-case everything using yourstring.touppercase or lowercase with yourstring.tolowercase if your code needs to be case-insensitive

this tiny overhead on add is vastly outweighed by the savings on lookups since all programmers should know and understand that case-insensitive compares are vastly slower than case-sensitive especially with unicode - the cpu can t just do a block compare of data but must check each pair of characters specially even using a table look-up this is vastly slower

btw a case-sensitive search done with removing i is much faster than a case-insensitive search

works fine for normal latin names but when the name is in utf-8 with non-latin characters then the select becomes case-sensitive how to make it also case-insensitive like latin characters

windows filesystems tend to be case-insensitive while most other operating systems prefer case-sensitive filesystems

the second line compares case-sensitive the file name string in which all occurrences of .tmp are replaced case-insensitive with an empty string with the file name string not modified at all

one thing i have come to notice is that the termquery seems to look for an exact match case-sensitive whereas if i construct a booleanquery with the same termquery it does a case-insensitive search

assuming that your casing is correct and you want case-sensitive matching use i to make matches case-insensitive i would suspect that your second file is unicode-encoded


wadl	wsdl	5
so while wsdl 2.0 competes with wadl as rest web service description languages wdl 2.0 has more but lets forget that for now xrd is a metadata discovery format for any uri openid discovery being one of the primary use case

and when somebody needs wadl may be then better to use ws soap service + wsdl

wsdl 2.0 can be used to describe rest web services and thus competes with wadl

like the rest of rest wadl is lightweight easier to understand and easier to write than wsdl

my conclusion now a days wadl is more common that rest and integration frameworks like camel cxf already supports wadl generate and consume because it is similar to wsdl therefore most easy to understand in this migration process soap to rest


stringbuilder	bufferedwriter	1
i wanted to ask if there is a better solution than using stringbuilder to cut some part of a string which is parsed from a method through bufferedwriter to a file


qtablewidget	qgraphicsscene	1
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent


nlopt	quadprog	1
for quadprog ipopt would be a much more powerful solver than nlopt


memcpy	strcpy	35
the proper way to copy strings is using strcpy or strcpy_s on windows the difference is memcpy is faster and used in other situations such as pointers buffer management

but sometimes memcpy performs faster than strcpy because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here

moral 1 always prefer memcpy to strcpy if possible

memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy

at which point strcpy becomes safe because you know it s not too long although i prefer memcpy because it makes it obvious to future readers of the code that i ve thought about this

memcpy is faster than strcpy and also enforces you to specify a buffer size

memcpy can be more efficient than strcpy since rep movs is highly optimized on intel cpus esp

furthermore all this strlen +1 -1 stuff is unnecessary and confusing prefer strncpy over memcpy and strcpy for strings and you don t need to deal with that

memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster

because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy

notice that memcpy is faster than strcpy unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.

memcpy is usually faster than strcpy for longer strings

i modified the c code to produce more stable timings for me on my machine mac os x 10.7.4 8 gib 1333 mhz ram 2.3 ghz intel core i7 gcc 4.7.1 and to compare strcpy and strcat vs memcpy vs memmove

memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute

if size is known normally a non-naive implementation of memcpy is faster than strcpy since it takes profit of the cpu s data bus size

but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively

a normal addition would be to include string.h and use strlen and strcpy or memcpy instead of a loop to find your length or copy characters to plural note for long strings memcpy will be more efficient but for 10 char -- it makes no difference let me know if you have any questions

memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object

the only time strcpy or any of its safe equivalents would outperform memcpy would be when the maximum allowable size of a string would be much greater than its actual size

performance difference memcpy is usually more efficient than strcpy which must scan the data it copies

using memmove or memcpy can outperform strcpy handily see why is python faster than c for some illustrations and timing

i recommend memcpy because strcpy and related function do not copy null character

you could use memcpy memset for strings too but strcpy is simpler

edit as pointed by whozcraig prefer memcpy i forgot the null terminator with strcpy

is memcpy usually faster than strcpy on most real platforms

information - use memcpy as it s faster than strcpy and we know

your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy

compare memcpy and strcpy function definitions

for example for small amounts of data an memcpy optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a strcpy that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data

on almost any platform memcpy is going to be faster than strcpy when copying the same number of bytes

although it s possible that strcpy might outperform memcpy when copying a string of only 1-3 bytes or so on many platforms memcpy is likely to be more than twice as fast when dealing with larger strings

so i feel that on x86 memcpy is faster than strcpy

structures are also memcpy ied by some newbie programmers because they either confuse structure assignment with the assignment of a pointer of a structure - or they simply overuse memcpy they often also use memcpy where strcpy would be more appropriate

we keep track of what cmd s length ought to be in a variable and copy the string with memcpy which is slightly faster than strcpy and does neither check string length nor copy the extra zero at end of string

the reason for not having strcpy i m guessing is that strcpy can be replaced more efficiently with memcpy for constant strings and if the string is not constant strcpy is a bit more complicated than memcpy anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for


jsonb	hstore	5
i admit that gin index on hstore is much more expensive than its equivalent for jsonb but even then it is faster to just do seq scan on hstore than use index on jsonb

there s really no reason to prefer hstore over jsonb if both are available

i guess the only reason to prefer this over hstore is my fear that hstore will be abandoned someday but jsonb lacks the same features

json jsonb fields support any json-encodable data type not just key value pairs but also tend to be faster and for jsonb more compact than hstore

also assuming someone figures out the difference union functions for jsonb arrays or text arrays would the bulk updates for hstore perform significantly better


fullcalendar	jquery-week-calendar	1
in some ways the jquery-week-calendar has more features at the moment but fullcalendar has a bigger following and is closing the gap on features


jrebel	hotswap	2
it is worth mentioning that there is a commercial product named jrebel that is much more powerful than jvm hotswap

i d still recommend jrebel for improving the experience since it goes far beyond what hotswap can do and it integrates with a large number of java frameworks to eliminate redeploys


attoparsec	uu-parsinglib	1
if you are decoding some formatted file rather than something like a programming language attoparsec or similar might be better than parsec or uu-parsinglib


paperclip	shrine	1
is this something that would be easier with paperclip shrine or refile


requestfactory	gwt-rpc	3
go with gwt-rpc or better newer with requestfactory

so although many gwt afficionados recommend using requestfactory over gwt-rpc i don t think requestfactory can be used for this scenario

my understanding is the requestfactory is more efficient and recommended over gwt-rpc but it s more of a data entity persistence framework than a request-response framework like rpc


d3.js	rickshaw	1
rickshaw is a graph library focused on time series whereas d3.js is more of a framework so it gives you much more functionality


jtextpane	jeditorpane	3
jtextpane is more high level as jeditorpane strange naming

jeditorpane and jtextpane are far more suitable for styled text display and even support some html formatting

if you can choose jtextpane instead of jeditorpane then it will solve the issue


express	hapijs	1
we started experimenting with hapijs on smaller services and kind of like it more than express


d3.js	chart.js	2
also i started this out in d3.js and was thinking chart.js might be faster

d3.js has a steeper learning curve than chart.js but once you get the hang of it you can do pretty much anything graph related with it.official site is here


opensuse	centos	2
i d recommend you to choose centos or opensuse

note that centos software versions are older than debian s but versions of opensuse software are newer than debian s versions


braces	reformatting	1
most developers and style guides would recommend reformatting that to remove the nesting and extra braces


gridbaglayout	miglayout	8
edit for clarification miglayout is probably easier to use than gridbaglayout but if you get familiar with gridbaglayout it s not that hard to use and it doesn t require a download since it s part of the core java library

for more complex layouts i lean towards gridbaglayout although there are others who prefer miglayout

same effect but this approach is less verbose unlike in case of gridbaglayout and i personally think that miglayout is easier to use

it sounds to me like gridbaglayout would be a better fit for you either that or miglayout though you ll have to download that first since it s not part of standard java

miglayout is another nice layout and it s easier to pick up than gridbaglayout but it also is not perfect or at least it wasn t a couple years ago when i last used it

miglayout works similarly to gridbaglayout but is more powerful and more expressive

look at the quick start guide on the miglayout site it s a lot less difficult than gridbaglayout and much more powerful

you can also check out the open-source miglayout which is much more convenient that gridbaglayout and also a bit more powerful


struts	wicket	7
for example for orm you may choose to use hibernate over jpa or toplink for front end you may choose wicket over struts or springmvc and so forth

while this is much less convenient than stateful wicket i still find much better than say stateless jsf or struts

for some people action based frameworks struts spring mvc are easier to grasp while for others component based ones jsf wicket come more natural

i can recommend wicket you won t have licence restrictions it s an apache licence and it s a time resistent solution jsf are too complex for simple use cases and struts is quite as complicated but a rather old technology

you could argue that the struts style is simpler and you can do it in wicket too it just isn t optimal but keeping the state only in the server has many advantages

if your requirement is for a more traditional web application then compare click with struts stripes wicket tapestry etc

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt

it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

if you to bind events and use the benefits of a normalized event system you ll use the first version for regular blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error or your custom events

the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup and error

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout

imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker

i prefer using mouseleave and mouseenter then mouseover and mouseout

i don t think that this kind of javascript library exist you could easily build one with jquery just listen to all the event blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

because jquery doesn t use mouseover and mouseout it uses mouseenter and mouseleave which are more suited to this scenario

i would also recommend using mouseenter and mouseleave rather than mouseover and mouseout since you will have child elements with your menu

also instead of mouseover and mouseout use the better ones mouseenter and mouseleave or simply the .hover method

the available events are blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

i tried changing the event but sagepay overrides all these events blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu

i have no idea about the classes but i think mouseenter and mouseleave are better alternative for mouseout and mouseover

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

val css html text data width height offset blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout

bind works with almost every event you need possible event values blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error


vim	emacs	71
you might want to try emacs - it has an inbuilt tutorial and some people like me find it easier over vim no flames pls

emacs and vim are generally smaller faster and optimized for text editing and navigation

being that i don t know the first thing about emacs and prefer vim myself how do i go about changing the default editor for svn commands to vim after it s already been set

that said modifier keys are important in vim even if less than in emacs

although the classic editors which the guru s will recommend vim and emacs have auto-complete as well

as for an editor if you like cli stuff then emacs or vim is the way to go i prefer emacs

it provides editor modes for vim and emacs the vim one being more polished now and i believe it is the right answer to the problem of getting incremental information on partially-complete sources -- it will do better than typerex for that

a number of people at the company i currently intern at prefer emacs or vim

on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is

rather like editors do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preference

i ve been using emacs for few weeks and it s been great so far - coming from vim was easier than i expected actually - emacs keyboard shortcuts feel more.

in vim it s much more difficult to run a subprocess than it is in emacs so in vim you need to have a separate running idris repl

also whichever editor you prefer vim or emacs learn it back forth

it s an emacs mode that makes emacs feel more like vim while giving you full access to the wonderful mind-boggling complexity of emacs if you ever want it

emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs

i don t know anything about except that it s more powerful than gedit but doesn t have the same feel as vim emacs

get aquinted with some good text editor like sublimetext text2 or notepad++ hardcore programmers will recommend vim or emacs - don t listen to them yet

in many cases emacs or vim is more productive than a huge ide that makes coffee

you may want to add aliases or functions definitions into your .bashrc which you would edit with a source code editor i recommend gnu emacs some people prefer vim and there are many others

of course the emacs crowd says the same thing regarding emacs-style thinking but i gave up on learning emacs because vim was simpler and did the job for me

textmate or macvim as the ide gvim or vim for the linux folk usually though some prefer emacs

i am capable of using vim in a pinch but i really prefer emacs

i m just looking for something a little more polished than vim or emacs but not quite as heavyweight as netbeans or eclipse

i don t know about emacs but i would recommend learning vim for a beginner in a heartbeat

a lot of people in the #python channel of freenode seem to prefer vim emacs nano and similar text editors in favor of ide s

many people also recommend vim or emacs both of which are probably available through your distro s repositories

available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platforms too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be installed separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systems

personally i m using emacs right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste

emacs is more powerful than vim it s scripting engine is far more flexible and there are far more scripts modes and the likes built around emacs

i don t think you would want to wait 10 seconds for your text editor to become ready ...if you are going to spend some serious time coding then spend some time and learn to use vim emacs too but i recommend vim

edit going into why vim or emacs is far more powerful in many respects than your typical ide could get quite lengthy and there are already several questions on so which cover that

in fact i d recommend learning vim or emacs even if you wind up mostly using a more modern editor simply because they exist when nothing else does

i am starting to understand that even though emacs is more powerful than vim vim is at least 10 times easier to use less keystrokes and requires way less modifications

like are vim emacs better suited for more advanced users than for beginners

i m using vim right now but i prefer emacs for my text editing

vim was always faster to start up than emacs

i m saying that on any machine out-of-the-box installs of vim will start up faster than out-of-the-box installs of emacs

you can also use another text editor from the command line really any of your choice but i would recommend vim or emacs if you re just doing a quick review

i suggest using the editor or visual environment variables people set those to preferred editors for programs to use ie if someone prefers emacs and can t even exit vim they won t get confused

cut and paste in vim takes more steps than in emacs iirc

i ve used vim for 10+ years but never really into vim scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where vim was weaker than emacs

but it s a lot less powerful than vim emacs

i prefer using emacs and vim for writing c++ code

emacs and vim have a bigger learning curve but they re also very powerful especially if you re already using them for something else

i can choose vim or emacs

i have only used emacs briefly and while i prefer vim i am jealous of some of its features

maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent

and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs

for someone just starting to program would you recommend using vim emacs or should you use some ide

since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine

i always recommend vim emacs to anyone because

i ve tried vim but it s modal so i prefer emacs

worse than that i m wondering if learning vim or emacs could make me slower with visual studio as i d confusing short cut keys

it is also usable from emacs and vim but this time the emacs interface seems more polished

i now think the combination of emacs and vim is better than either alternative

it is more intuitive for than vim or emacs for the beginners

for example emacs s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than vim s qq and q

i d recommend emacs or vim but i m sure you ll have your favorites

i would recommend trying out vim or emacs

i d recommend vim emacs or textmate

one of the primary distinction betweeen vi vim and emacs is emacs is designed and supposed to be run at times without quitting where as given the quick load time of vim it is easier to quit and start for editing tasks

if you prefer using vim emacs running on say terminal or any other external editor you can just create your xcode project add files and whatnot and then switch to editing said files using whichever edit suits you best

you will always be using the best editor for the job if you re able to choose between vim and emacs

i recommend vim with slim or emacs with slime

i d recommend vim if you are going to learn one or the other but i know emacs users will strongly disagree

i realized that emacs would load slower than vim but this seems ridiculous for a fresh install

there are definitely some advantages using external editors however emacs is ten million times better than vim

although you can look on vim or emacs i prefer emacs - they are hard on the beginning but very when you are experienced user - they give you many cool features

but when organizing text structure or work with other applications i prefer vim in emacs

even though i use emacs all day every day and love it unless you intend to spend a lot of time in the program you choose i would pick vim

it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa


snap.svg	raphael	1
this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at raphael which is snaps older brother d3.js is very well established as well


ratingbar	textview	2
the thing is like ratingbar is smaller than the textview i don t get a correct aligment

unfortunately i dont understand what you mean by stating ratingbar is smaller than textview


stringtemplate	xtend	1
please consider also to use xtend for code generation that s much nicer than stringtemplate and integrates smoothly with xtext infrastructure


revmob	marmalade	1
this one is more promising than revmob because banner positioning and event callbacks appear to be possible but due to marmalade and cocos2d-x s gl conflicts this might turn out to be just as bad a solution as iwgameads


caliburn.micro	reactiveui	1
imho any modern mvvm-framework like catel caliburn.micro mvvmlight reactiveui is much better than prism


keras	tensorboard	1
you should check out losswise it has a plugin for keras that s easier to use than tensorboard and has some nice extra features


memcached	ncache	1
ncache expresse would work fine too there is no mistery on it but i recommend going with memcached because ncache express has the 2 servers limit so if you ever need to add an aditional node you ll have to change anyway


invariantculture	cultureinfo	1
linq2sql does not support any way to provide a cultureinfo and i m not sure the sqlite server compares invariantculture or ordinal


momentjs	datejs	4
the two libraries i can recommend are datejs and momentjs

i d like to recommend momentjs - a very lightweight yet surprisingly capable datejs library

nowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained so use momentjs which is much better as pointed out by t.j

you should try momentjs i think its much better than datejs


uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	4
basically if the user is on a view under the more tab the actual current uinavigationcontroller you want to use to push a uiviewcontroller onto is the uitabbarcontroller s morenavigationcontroller property

when you add more than 5 uiviewcontroller objects to your uitabbarcontroller ios will automatically create the more button for you

i m trying to push a view controller from a tableview displayed inside a uiviewcontroller that is included in a uitabbarcontroller it s more simple that it looks...

add one more uinavigationcontroller between uitabbarcontroller and uiviewcontroller


puts	fflush	2
the implication is that if you re writing a lot of small puts your memstore fflush will run faster but will produce smaller hfiles on disk than expected

for batch puts it s better if you construct a list of puts and then call because it uses a single rpc call to commit the batch but depending on the size of the list write buffer may fflush it all or not


innodb	myisam	288
since you select innodb when creating tables all of your tables are innodb not myisam

so i have ot select myisam instead of innodb

nothing is 100 safe but innodb properly used is a lot safer than myisam against data loss and corruption

it s true there are some cases where myisam can use less disk space but disk space is cheap and i d much rather get the benefits of innodb

i am trying to compare the myisam and innodb write read performance but i am suprised that the myisam s read is much more slower than innodb while its write is much more faster this is totally opposite compared to what i have learned

while the myisam type takes around 10mb average of 15b for each row the innodb type takes more than 30mb average of 44b

if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if its not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index

innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam

as far as i am aware the only non-trivial reason to choose myisam over innodb is for full-text indexing

i am creating an commerce website and i am stuck in a database problem i am storing customer orders please tell me which is better myisam or innodb i have to use transaction like feature in customer order table and i personally prefer myisam because it is much faster than innodb and it also supports full-text searching is there any way to use transaction like rollback feature in myisam so that if anything goes wrong table will be rollback to its previous state how to do that without any external library or any other server side access and i have to use mysql

the comment of hanky that linked to myisam versus innodb tells you more about the differences

please notice that counting with where is not slower with innodb than it would be with myisam

if you ve tuned innodb properly for your server and are running proper server-grade hardware innodb should be able to compete with myisam on most queries excluding full table scans but you re not doing many of those right

firstly i switched from innodb to myisam which is better designed for mysql spatial extensions

myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win

innodb does support transactions and referential integrity but the trade-off is that it is a bit slower than myisam

innodb would be a better choice than myisam for a high-write table

innodb table is a bit slower than myisam tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system

it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use myisam as it is better than innodb

myisam for reads may well be faster than innodb

a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam

i heard correct me if i am wrong that innodb is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to myisam s table locking

oracle has kept improving innodb by so much that they declare that it is better than myisam in virtually all situations

myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities

myisam is often faster than innodb but isn t safe to use in a production environment for critical data

edit for the read-performance this link shows that innodb often is actually not slower than myisam

however innodb tends to be slower as myisam

myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases

i d recommend innodb over myisam because of better transactional properties

you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but innodb is vastly better than myisam at data integrity

myisam delivers better read performance compared to innodb at the cost of being less acid compliant

innodb outperforms myisam in many situations until it can t keep the indexes in memory then performance drop drastically

myisam is faster but does not support the use of transactions like innodb does

i ve figure out that even though myisam has locking contention it s still faster than innodb in most scenarios because of the rapid lock acquisition scheme it uses

innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out

you can change your database to myisam -- i m guessing you re only reading from the tables in the database otherwise if you have read write transactions innodb is the better choice

it is possible that the config of your innodb engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have myisam set up

innodb was faster when data was present already and generally performed better except for hdd-space - myisam is smaller on disk

general rule to choose between innodb and myisam is

generally speaking innodb is slower than myisam as innodb is atomic while myisam is not

we recommend innodb as the default choice of storage engine whereas myisam is recommended only in exceptional scenarios when one can prove that it has some advantage prove it through benchmarking your app with both storage engines

innodb is much much stricter than myisam

now the response i got from my boss is that i need to prove that innodb will run faster than myisam

since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario

myisam is often faster than innodb in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid

in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates innodb performs much better than myisam

i am using mysql server and i came to know that mysql uses both innodb and myisam engine.so i want to know for any big project which engine should i choose innodb or myisam

this also affects how it is stored which leads to myisam being slower than innodb on insert due to myisam requiring a full index re-write on every insertion

therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb

innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb

myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads

generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that

myisam supports longer rows than innodb does

innodb uses row level locking while myisam can only use table level locking that is why innodb has crash revovery is better than myisam

i am not a mysql expert but its capacity features and performance are very much depending on the table type you select innodb myisam + others

myisam table locking so innodb can handle more concurrent requests

if you have way lot of reads from the table i would use myisam but in other circumstances like this one i would prefer innodb

myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns

at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam

innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam

innodb when tuned well performs better than myisam

you are right because myisam is really faster than innodb

to answer the real question why is myisam slower than innodb i can t give an authoritative answer

myisam can be faster than innodb because it has a simpler design

plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb

1 in mysql engines myisam is better or innodb

i do this all the time because i prefer innodb for the fks but i sometimes need myisam for the full-text search

while myisam can be faster for some queries innodb is usually quicker if properly tuned

innodb wins over myisam frequently enough that it s clearly not possible to say one is faster than the other

there is a difference between the different storage engines though myisam is faster for a lot of select innodb is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes

so i guess myisam would be better suited than innodb

additionally i ve changed the db engine from myisam to innodb to have better foreign key support

oh and just incase you were thinking innodb is slower than myisam - the myisam implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts

while on antiquated hardware myisam was a necessity on modern hardware innodb actually performs better

innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties

if you use insert and update high performance uses innodb over myisam is better

as you know myisam table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same innodb tables

this is a huge performance boost look like myisam is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than innodb

i would also recommend myisam since you don t need the transactional integrity provided by innodb when dealing with a read-mostly warehouse

with innodb there is less time lost from table locking while myisam is faster in table readings

this blog does provide one reason to prefer postgresql you can have full-text search and still be transactional while in mysql full-text indexing only work on myisam tables not innodb except if you add sphinx of course also see this follow-on for a bit more on full-text search in postgresql and lucene

the oracle guys are claiming compared to myisam innodb delivered 35x higher throughput on the read write test

have you considered changing to innodb - it has much better concurrency support and in some contexts will run faster than myisam

after all innodb shouldn t be slower than myisam when using count + where but that s exactly what is happening here

it was therefore deemed safer for the beginners to default to myisam and expect those that now what they are doing to amend the config or specifically select innodb in phpmyadmin when they know that is the table type they want to use

innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

myisam might be quicker in this instance but when you have 100 concurrent connections all reading and modifying this table at the same time you ll find a well-tuned innodb will win and myisam will choke on table locks

myisam has some problems with many recordings and other bugs and innodb is now better

myisam used to be faster years ago but if you use any reasonably current version of innodb then innodb is faster for most workloads

innodb is relatively newer than myisam and is transaction safe

but in certain scenarios myisam works better than innodb

someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam

innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb

the engine is myisam i ve heard people recommend switching to innodb but many others said myisam is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and innodb better for safe transactions

innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash

innodb has a higher resource consumption rates then myisam so keep that in mind

after testing it seems that myisam is faster than innodb when using when there is no where clause

myisam is more space friendly than innodb you can start with that one

myisam is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to innodb s row level lock

concerning the inability to upgrade a mysql versioning there is no reason why one cannot mix and match myisam and innodb tables in the same db

i converted my products table to be innodb as the fulltext capabilities are supposed to match myisam s and the search time went from 38 seconds to 0.4

i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads

in fact oracle is so sure that innodb is better that they removed myisam from 8.0

innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam

innodb shouldn t be much slower than myisam

as a sub-question do you think innodb would be a better choice of engine here than myisam

for instance myisam is widely held to be faster at selects than innodb

to our suprise innodb took hours more than myisam

yes it is an old wives tale that myisam is faster than innodb

if your database has a large innodb buffer pool and a small key buffer then innodb performance is going to be better than myisam performance especially for large tables

innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose

innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

2 - i have read about myisam vs innodb the conclusion for me was that myisam is faster when it comes to read-only whereas innodb is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently

innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism

analytics -- when you can scan via the clustered pk you get better performance with innodb than with myisam which has to bounce back and forth between the separate index and the data

myisam is more susceptible to data corruption than innodb and usually innodb performs better because it caches both data and indexes

this would help myisam come closer to innodb s model and performance but would add complexity to your code

you don t choose innodb or myisam on a database level but instead on a table level

why is innodb so much slower than myisam in my case

innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as

innodb not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than myisam in many benchmarks

and now i have learned that innodb uses more memory at-least while reading than myisam engine so i am trying to change the default engine of mysql to use myisam

there are several q a for why is innodb much slower than myisam but i could not find any topic for the opposite

the script was tested using myisam and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than innodb

as well i used innodb engine but myisam is better if most of the queries are select and you are not going to do many writes

myisam is better for high read volumes innodb for high update volumes due to table vs row locking

and it s rarely faster than innodb since innodb uses row locks and mvcc as opposed to myisam s full-table locks

innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns

also i can t see your table engine but myisam is better for full text searching rather than innodb

myisam tables are generally more compact in size on disk when compared to innodb tables

3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

innodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achieving

myisam is much faster for reads but since it locks the whole table for writes this is where overall throughput drops compared with innodb

innodb is more scalable and myisam doesn t support any of the properties of acid

mostly innodb is better choice than a myisam

this is one way in which innodb is sometimes better than myisam

myisam table is much faster than innodb but no rollback is possible

i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more

one thing is that if your inserts are not in the order of increasing primary keys innodb can take a bit longer than myisam

i know innodb tends to be a bit slower than myisam on counting but this is far too long

if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully

their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average

sometimes i got asked on some interviews what benefits does innodb have against myisam and when myisam is better than innodb

i had read through hundreds of docs and forum posts regarding whether innodb or myisam is the better engine to use most sources giving vague evaluations or at best overly complicated benchmarking with vague settings claiming to increase or even decrease.

also table type of myisam will import faster depends on if you need transactional support innodb

i considered changing them to innodb to make the database 100 the same but then read the myisam is faster

tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default

innodb consumes more disk space than myisam -- typically 2x-3x

as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here

innodb can be slower at searches because it doesn t offer full text search like myisam but that isn t a big problem when you compare it to table-level locking of myisam

i currently have myisam and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than innodb in my case but i heard that innodb has acid transactions

speed does matter here myisam is still slightly faster than innodb especially for reads

since myisam is better on selecting while innodb is better on writing

the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb

anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares

i did a search online comparing myisam and innodb but all of the articles i read judged myisam being faster than innodb on select queries

for an oltp type system innodb is usually more sensible than myisam did you check the contention before trying a different engine

the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s

edited to add myisam is faster than innodb because it is simpler

it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb

as you are no doubt aware from your searches innodb is primarily better than myisam for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to innodb and myisam respectively while myisam is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to

google myisam vs innodb to find out more about the differences

if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to myisam its quite faster than innodb with much less overhead

in a thread i came to know that myisam is faster for reads innodb is faster for writes

in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb

even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that innodb is on par with or faster than myisam under most workloads

myisam locks the entire table while innodb do a better handling of rows being changed

myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth

memory and myisam would be faster when inserting updating but if you are experiencing frequent dead-locks then innodb would be the way to go

in terms of pure speed it is not always the case that myisam is faster than innodb but in my experience it tends to be faster for pure read working environments by a factor of about 2.0-2.5 times

then i thought about innodb but then i read that myisam is better with many write operations

for mysql performance you should probably choose myisam over innodb as the storage engine provided your definition of optimal doesn t include most reliable

newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly

if your db storage engine is not wisely chosen like myisam instead of innodb you ll lose more performance than you might win with avoiding sessions

therefore innodb can handle higher levels of concurrency better than myisam

select queries in myisam runs 2x faster then in innodb but the updates and insert queries are much slower in myisam

also note that some mysql engines are faster than others for example myisam may run faster than innodb at expense of the lack of real foreign keys

database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine

myisam beats innodb and tokudb on full table scans since it is basically just sequentially scanning a file

here myisam and memory perform approximately the same and beat innodb by about 50 for larger tables

maybe i have to choose innodb over myisam

ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance

myisam also tends to store data in less space than innodb

innodb is a better choice as myisam is really old engine and would fade away in near future

from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb

innodb is slower than myisam but in which cases

if there are more than one innodb tables that need a composite auto_incrementing primary key add an extra primary key to the myisam table

some people have said that for reads myisam is faster but recent improvements in innodb have either alleviated or eradicated this difference

myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries

there may be some exotic corner cases where myisam performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be innodb unless you can prove you have a case that myisam does better

am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam

and innodb indexes are even slower to rewrite than myisam

finally even if somehow you could manage myisam to perform better than innodb that doesn t mean innodb is inadecuate at all

innodb handles inserts with composite primary keys quicker than myisam

it is also good to know the database engines when using mysql choose carefully between myisam and innodb nice answer is here what #39

if so chane it to innodb because if you need the database to enforce foreign key constraints or you need the database to handle the changes made by set of dml operations as single unit of work then you would choose innodb over myisam since these features are absent from the myisam engine

use myisam usually much faster than innodb if your data base isnt transaction oriented

your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query

if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam

i have heard that myisam performs better than innodb on read-oriented tables

if i choose myisam i will have to give up update null if i choose innodb i will have to give up fulltext and search speed

myisam generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions innodb has such as rollback... but it has only table locking

myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth

innodb is newer while myisam is older

in innodb the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in myisam because the row count is not stored internally

most of the literature that says myisam is better faster whatever then innodb is old literature

most dont bother to close wampserver down cleanly and therefore innodb can get corrupted more easily than myisam

but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam

so for such an application is it will innodb be a better choice over myisam

often myisam is fine in certain other cases innodb is better

myisam is almost 4 time faster than innodb which is not acceptable in the environment we are working as i mentioned earlier that every second is worth many dollers for us

the main reason to choose innodb instead of myisam is that myisam use per table locks which will become the bottleneck of your performance while innodb implements mvcc multiversion concurrency control which means locking at row level

so that means that in practice an innodb write will take 3 times longer than a myisam write

in general is myisam faster than innodb

furthermore i do not have control over the engine â myisam or innodb innodb performs better due to row based locking instead of table as in case of myisam

overall i would recommend innodb for most purposes and myisam for specialized uses only

you can also try using innodb since it s said is better than myisam handling bulk inserts with data already on it

i was told that innodb had worse write performance than that of myisam

imho you should always prefer innodb over myisam because of the transactional support which is at the heart of every relational database system

myisam is actually better than innodb for spatial data btw because it also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis. if you just need points though innodb or myisam b-trees are adequate

beststat is innodb so i have row-level locking and consindering i do a lot of inserts-updates it should be faster than myisam

you will need about six times less disk space to store and memory to process your dataset compared to innodb or about 2-3 times less than archived myisam

innodb seems slightly faster than myisam but this is really marginal

innodb performance has been improved to the point where it is hard to come up with a benchmark that says myisam is faster

if your application generates a lot of updates you ll prefer innodb storage engine which allows to lock only one row when updating vs all the table on myisam

first question is it normal that innodb is much slower 7x slower than myisam for such usage

by the way the reason this happened is because you are likely using myisam instead of innodb - it is a good idea to switch to innodb as innodb tables are less likely to crash

myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries

not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma

it s also worth mentioning that innodb supports row-level locking while myisam only supports table-level locking - which is to say that for many common situations innodb can be dramatically faster due to more queries executing in parallel

i always recommend innodb as a default choice over myisam

i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it

also mysql version starting from 5.5 - innodb performs faster than myisam

3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to innodb which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than myisam has

mind that i ve seen weird behavior from myisam tables -- innodb tables are more consistent

note however that for high traffic websites we do modify the joomla core and we also switch the tables from innodb to myisam regardless what others might think here myisam is much faster than innodb

although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think myisam alters take longer than innodb because myisam requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well

almost always innodb is a better choice than myisam

by the way i use mysql 5.1.62 and the myisam tables but i also tested innodb which was even slower

in this area i think innodb s change buffer does a better job than myisam s do it now

put another way let s say i start with a new innodb table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess innodb stuff i realize data stored in innodb is larger than myisam then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data

innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking

out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer myisam for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking myisam is faster but innodb is more reliable

innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc

myisam is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while innodb is transactional and more concurrent

you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today myisam is better than innodb in this case

there are other optimizations available but general rule is that innodb will be quicker than myisam is even with table growth

i don t want to use myisam because innodb is more advanced

myisam uses less memory than innodb and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for innodb

we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts

innodb is more reliable than myisam

during my tests of innodb v myisam i found that when i did resolve any contention issues the innodb model was 40 slower than myisam

innodb tables are even slower than myisam tables for inserts and the delayed key write option is not available

innodb is also being developed more than myisam

innodb scales better than myisam

you could try switching between myisam and innodb to find the better suitable engine for this table in your application

in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed

innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

innodb is affected by the primary key much more than myisam and it could make a noticeable difference

if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries

i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research

only drawback is that innodb need more server resources than myisam so if you have proper server resources then you should use innodb

innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select

myisam is also considered a good read performer however my benchmarks show me that innodb indexes are faster

try using innodb instead of myisam innodb has more optimization tricks for select statements especially if you only select indexed fields

if you use a where clause though it changes the execution pattern to use indexes so in general innodb will be slower than myisam on full unrestricted counts where as the performance matches up on restricted counts

the first using transactions is most likely to help but i m not sure if it works on myisam tables with innodb it does a very good job - i only use those when i m forced to use mysql i prefer postgresql

generally you can have as good performance for reading as in myisam in innodb tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in innodb table scan will be slower than in myisam

myisam has proved to be faster than innodb for me

innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs

myisam will be quicker definitely because it s losing the acid-compliance that is inherent in innodb

there are some situations when myisam is infinitely more efficient than innodb when manipulating large data dumps offline because of table lock

the default myisam does not support transactions i recommend using innodb

if you use myisam as the db engine you will need to keep track of the ids manually but if you choose innodb as the engine you can use foreign keys

myisam is the perfect choice since the database is almost only used for reading and myisam is significantly faster that innodb

innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering

you should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because it s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases

tokudb blows innodb and myisam out of the waters in specific situations but is not a general replacement db engine for everything under the sky

but when myisam is really better than innodb

myisam is more prone to locking problems than innodb i believe

a last suggestion is to convert your db from myisam to innodb but i think this requires some investigation because it not always the case that innodb is faster

at what read write ratio does myisam beat innodb in performance

anyway if you don t need to have foreign keys checks myisam would be faster than innodb

innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts

in some benchmarks i see that myisam is faster than innodb but seems i have a little improvement

innodb is more concurrent than myisam since it provides row-level locking


summernote	fckeditor	1
i know summernote does that but fckeditor is a more complete tool than summernote so i cant switch to that


puma	unicorn	7
sergio suggested nginx + unicorn or nginx + puma but nginx + passenger which replaces unicorn puma is much easier to setup performs great uses less memory works better and has more features

if puma or unicorn makes this easier or more robust i d love to hear that

something where the app is about serving different pages you want low memory and good context switching things like preforking unicorn or running on the rubinius version of ruby with puma that makes concurrency easier to code because it will perform well with threading as opposed to something like mri with a global interpreter lock

heroku recommends puma as the webserver you can also use unicorn

it uses less resources than unicorn but has more requirements to your code it better be thread-safe because puma is a threaded server

puma will tend to optimize itself by spawning more threads and its performance should range from no worse than unicorn in the pure cpu case to being vastly better than unicorn in the case of an app that sleeps a lot

for example it looks like unicorn is a better choice on heroku than puma


median	max	11
select min of next 50 rows by ordering the rows in desc in case if column count is even this will be median or else max of firsthalf+min of secondhalf 2 will be the median

if they are outside i will get many results - should i choose min max median average

to find the median and left right you probably want to call it to find the median and then just do the max of the components of the array to the left and the min of the components to the right because you know once the median selection phase is done that all elements to the left of the median will be less than it and to the right will be greater or equal

i usually choose min in those cases but max avg median all have the same effect when there is only one row in a partition

so after calculating median of first k elements delete the first element directly from heap min or max according to whether it is greater or less than median using pointers and then use heapify at that position

i also microbenchmarked and the mean median min and max were all faster for the lattice plotting function compared to the high charts rcharts plotting function

select max of first 50 rows by sorting the rows in asc which should be the median in case if column count is even

so the t 7n 10 is the part of continuing the equation with the max segment of numbers that is larger smaller than the median of medians..

i have 3-d masked array of dtype uint8 and i want to do something like but instead of always picking the max i want to either 1 find first or last unmased element 2 pick random arbitrary unmasked element or 3 pick median or mode along axis like numpy.ma.median or scipy.stats.mstats.mode

therefore the max number of elements you could have that are greater than or less than the median of median is 3 10 + 2 10 + 2 10 7 10

mysql select min measure select measure from customer_data order by measure limit 0 1 as firstq select measure from customer_data order by measure limit 5 1 as median select measure from customer_data order by measure limit 8 1 as last_q max measure from customer_data

i have to create this attached pdf document from a existing word document.being apache open office is installer and have to be started as a service every time when i want to convert a document i am dilemma to choose between jodconverter +open office and apache poi hwpf + itext .please suggest me which to use


virtualenv	setuptools	3
anyway i would recommend installing setuptools and pip first then you can install virtualenv from pip pip install virtualenv

development and deployment of python code is made much easier by setuptools in combination with virtualenv and pip

as a side-note i recommend using virtualenv 1.10 or higher as it is the first release that recognises the setuptools distribute merger for both python 2 and 3

watson	luis	1
api.ai is free the performance on big enough training set matches ibm watson and microsoft luis


wav	ogg	11
it is even slower since i could only upload wav which is way bigger in size compared with ogg and opus

it is likely that wav is using a more compressive codec such as mp3 or ogg internally

bass is an audio library to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

it is a high level 2d and 3d cross platform windows mac os x linux sound engine and audio library which plays wav mp3 ogg flac mod xm it s3m and more file formats and is usable in c++ and all .net languages c# visualbasic.net etc

stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via

but better ogg than wav

able to read from some sort of audio file i d prefer wav or ogg but i will gladly use less popular formats if need be in memory i ve seen the use of a memfile struct and user-defined i o callbacks

i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg

its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via os codecs and add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

its purpose is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample stream mp3 mp2 mp1 ogg wav aiff custom generated and more via add-ons mod music xm it s3m mod mtm umx mo3 music mp3 ogg compressed mods and recording functions

regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg that is not really the case


jung	jgraph	2
can i use jgraph or is jung better

i ve created an application with this library instead of jgraph because i thought that jung is easier to learn than jgraph for newbies even if it provide less features


serializable	deserialization	48
i have an issue with serializable in c# .net where if i serializable in one stream multiple references to a same object these references are no longer equal after deserialization

much faster than serializable deserialization though

the serializable seems quicker but deserialization much slower and the app is doing more deserializing than serializing

if you d like broader support over the serializable deserialization you can always use jackson to do so

in fact you may want to separate out the serializable deserialization aspects to their own discrete method class so you can feed in other serializable or be more clear from the stack trace where the issue is or simply to make your methods do one thing and one thing only but any more rewriting refactoring is really left for code-review anyway and not valid much for the question at hand

the question is a bit wider than serializable deserialization and applies to any situation where some object could be uniquely rebuild from jpa persistent data and vice versa

you should have static xml data that can be used to compare against serializable output and to use as input data for deserialization

also test and measure serializable deserialization may be slower than the normal methods of object creation - note that you d probably be deserializing twice from session to string then string into object of that class

but you are stopping your singlton to have more than one instance during serializable and deserialization which is of more importance in the context of singleton

i don t have any experience with serializable but i was expecting deserialization to be faster than normal processing at least for the cpickle module

here s code demonstrating how to serializable like you want however deserialization will be more tricky because it s not straightforward to deserialize into an existing instance see how to use xmlserializer to deserialize into an existing instance

i ve reworked it slightly so that the deserialization code looks more like its serializable counterpart

this i suspect serializable takes more time to process serializable and deserialization

java object serializable deserialization is not faster than xml writing and parsing in general

it also caused a bigger problem with serializable and deserialization

gut feel is that the expression tree serializable deserialization will take much longer than just evalling some conditionals

you don t need to write any new members - it s just a marker interface - but there are other methods you can add to give more control over serializable and deserialization

davidxxx was indeed right that deserialization was only failing when the serializable number was greater than long.max_value

it comes with xml serializable deserialization of graphs for wcf and also its own binary serializable for remoting much faster than the default binary formatter and also much more compact

in my mind serializable deserialization should be faster than parsing and reinitializing a wavefront model however my benchmark shows otherwise

deserialization is harder than serializable

side note check-out the json.net serializable which gives more options and better control over the deserialization process

however i can t tell you right now if this cost is higher than the serializable and deserialization cost

i would like to find better solution than serializable and deserialization

note that while serializable is now optimized deserialization is doubly slower because i deserialize to object to then reserialize to string

you ll need to implement serializable to have java handle the serializable or externalizable if you need more control over the deserialization process

i considered using linq to modify each but i thought serializable deserialization made more sense as i need to prompt the user for most of the fields

i m trying to figure out how to better deal with json serializable deserialization of nested java objects in spring mvc

is there a serializable library or some way that i can have deserialization be less strict like if there is an extra field added to the class then it just fills that with null upon deserialization of the old version of the class

you can also use javascriptconverter when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process

have you considered creating an object structure for these files and serializing them java object serializable and deserialization is much faster than parsing an xml this is again considering that these 500 or so xml files don t get modified between reads

you can use the javascriptconverter class when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process

if the orb implements local object optimization sometimes collocated objects then it will not open any sockets but it will perform serializable deserialization which is typically faster than marshalling

this question is not to discuss if using copy constructor is better than serializable deserialization or not

serializable and deserialization process runs slower

if the taskproperty class is decorated with datacontract attribute and with datamember attribute for each property the deserialization is much faster than when it is decorated with serializable attribute

serializable deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state

the transmission size is bigger using datacontractserializer but during serializable and deserialization it is faster to use datacontractserializer

the micro-benchmark included ensures that this solution is not slower than default serializable deserialization

using the same code for serializable and deserialization is even more of a pain i cannot off hand figure out how

when it comes to serializable deserialization i find it easier to convert to from a generic representation of your object that the serializable could recognize and interpret it as needed

instead of bson deserialization i see more critical how the to_json method handles the serializable of date and time ruby object

if what you are trying to do is create something and then store divergent types in a single generic list your serializable and deserialization just got more complex but it is still achievable

use json.net it allows for far greater control over serializable and deserialization

these formats allow various data compression codecs note that snappy is now much more popular than lzo and can also provide other benefits such as fast serializable deserialization column pruning and bundled metadata

if i understood your need correctly i believe you have two options - register multiple de serializable or put more logic into your deserialization implementations

that kinda makes sense since session state mode in production was sqlserver and serializable deserialization was apparently slower than just assigning values to properties from a datareader

3 if i have a large object to cache i find serializable and deserialization takes a longer time in ignite and retrieving from distributed cache is slow


ilist	icollection	10
if possible you might want to consider changing to use an icollection or ilist icollection being more widely scoped than ilist which has a count property on it

icollection or ilist being higher up in the layer exposes more features that you may not want to allow such as adding something to the collection removing things like that

ilist is a more specialized interface that extend icollection

an ilist has the methods for changing the items like add maybe you want to select between icollection and ienumerable

if you need the list to be indexed then you should choose ilist - this interface inherits from icollection and ienumerable so this may be what you are after

icollection adds counting and ilist then gives richer functionality including find add and remove elements by index or via lambda expressions

compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access

idictionary and ilist are more specialized interfaces that extend icollection

so i need to choose ienumerable icollection ilist or may be even list

for list explicitly yes it should be private depending on what the functionality you re exposing is supposed to do interfaces such as ienuemerable icollection or ilist would be a better choice or if you re exposing a collection see slaks reply


imagemagick	im4java	2
you should prefer im4java before using the command line directly to call imagemagick

if having imagemagick installed on your maschine is an option i recommend im4java


debian	linux	5
personally i develop on the windows but deploy on debian where couldn t find the scrapyd package at all at the time i was working on it and noticed that performance of scrapy is considerably worse than on linux box so you might reconsider your target

the device in question will have a arm cpu with 400 to 900 mhz clock a vga or wvga display and about 256 mb ram or more with standard debian linux minimalistic install

it is widely used to have a separated tag with the postfix -alpine in it to indicate that alpine linux is used which is a much smaller base-image than the debian image

in linux the git-core debian package is much smaller and the process is much quickier

if your system linux is older like debian wheezy for example your glibc version will be older than the required one


zen-cart	oscommerce	1
it seems to be younger than zen-cart and oscommerce


pysimplesoap	suds	1
you might be more comfortable with suds pysimplesoap or flask-enterprise to consume the soap data


rxtx	jssc	2
i prefer jssc library rather than rxtx

however i would definitely recommend jssc library over rxtx


node-webkit	nwjs	3
electron should be a drop in replacement for nwjs node-webkit and offers more flexibility over when to show and hide windows

nwjs node-webkit is a better solution if you want your app

me personally prefer node-webkit renamed to nwjs for this kind of things


libstdc++	libc++	11
now if i want to use c++11 features in my own code i d have to select libc++ in xcode and additionally link against libstdc++ to satisfy the static library

i want to choose between using gcc and clang and also want to choose between libstdc++ and libc++

where i can choose libstdc++ instead of libc++ but i am still getting the compiling error when setting this to libstdc++

with clang you can choose between libc++ clang s and libstdc++ gcc s

libstdc++ does this a lot more than libc++ and the former is the default library for llvm-g++ gcc llvm the latter for clang apple llvm which means a lot of errors will seem to go away when you switch to gcc llvm or just stick with apple llvm and switch your library but your code is still wrong

libc++ is not 100 complete on gnu linux and there s no real advantage to using it when libstdc++ is more complete

if you want to use c++11 you either need to use clang with libc++ or install a newer gcc to get a newer libstdc++

note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports

in crystax ndk both gnu libstdc++ and llvm libc++ are much more stable and fully conforming to c++ standard at least at the same level as they conform to it on gnu linux

the above links to libc++ which is the preferred c++ standard library for mac os x with clang and a lot more complete than libstdc++ even when considering the newest gcc

if you want to go for option 2 and are using xcode you can go to the build settings of your project and under c++ standard library select libstdc++ instead of libc++


navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller	1
if it s a navigationcontroller just call revealcontroller.frontviewcontroller pushviewcontroller animated


dns	spf	2
the usual tests include reverse dns match spf record match clean from dnsbl and of course the domain must exist

your spf record requires more than 10 dns lookups to process


negative-number	zero	1
numbers less than zero however you might use the more descriptive negative-number tag


rijndael	twofish	1
twofish was much more scrutinized than blowfish so even for symmetric encryption you should not use blowfish but twofish or better yet use the aes aka rijndael which was preferred over twofish


rational-numbers	integer	1
so when you feed 1+2 to the reader it consumes 1+2 as one token which then fails to match against integer float or rational-numbers patterns


memcpy	realloc	9
in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

the tool recommends replacing realloc with malloc memcpy and free

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

hunch a clever implementation of realloc should execute faster than a brute memcpy to a new array

for example realloc may be allocating more memory than you actually request or allocating contiguous memory just after the end of the previous block so your code is doing more memcpy s than realloc

actually i usually don t recommend using realloc for that reason just do the malloc memcpy free yourself

it wouldn t do a memcpy -- that s only necessary when the realloc size is larger and there s no room to expand

as we can see copying manually with memcpy is always slower than realloc because in this scenario malloc is guaranteed to allocate new memory and you re forced to copy the data in every allocation which shows us that realloc is indeed reusing the same address and enlarging the block size in some cases

as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free


automake	autotools	1
in the case of autotools it is slightly more complicated because not everybody who compiles the software would need automake and autoconf installed only those that need to change the build system adding new files counts as changing the build system


cublas	openblas	1
first of them works quite good on cpu intel i7 and on fermi gpu gf 540m cpu time is near to openblas and fermi gpu time is near to cublas about 18ms but this implementation works 10x slower than cublas on maxwell gpu titanx - 5 ms vs 0.4 ms


mocha	node.js	1
edit vs code 1.9.0 has added an add configuration option in the debug configuration drop-down and you can pick node.js mocha tests which help simplify most of the above


gitolite	gitorious	1
if you have some product-specific stuff git could be installed with gitosis gitolite gitorious provide more details as to how you ve done it


xjc	maven-jaxb2-plugin	1
however it may be that maven-jaxb2-plugin uses a newer version of xjc than you re using with enum


hk2	guice	1
if you want to bridge guice and hk2 it s little more complicated


antialiasing	transparent	5
and it seems working fine antialiasing is much better however this beats the idea of a transparent background in the process

note on my fuzzy select tool my gimp settings were check antialiasing uncheck feather edges check select transparent areas uncheck sample merged and select by composite

primitives such as rectangles and images will be antialiasing by adding more vertices along the edge of the primitives so that the edges fade to transparent

the way i fixed it was to open up the png in gimp choose the fuzzy select tool set the threshold to 150 check antialiasing uncheck feather edges check select transparent areas

minus doesn t truly work for antialiasing less than 100 transparent pixels


partcover	opencover	2
opencover is newer and is also on github opencover on github it has 64 and 32 bit support and overcomes some of the limitations that partcover has memory and results delivery

you may also find that opencover will work better than partcover as it has 32 and 64 bit support as well as supporting .net2 and .net4 - and copes much better with target processes that spin off more processes to do the actual testing


erlang	ocaml	3
ocaml is a great language -- one of my favorites -- but if your interest is distributed systems than i d recommend going with erlang which is head and shoulders ahead of the other fp languages with regards to distributed systems although there s an offshoot of ocaml called jocaml which has some interesting aspects

while erlang is more expressive ocaml pattern matching is simpler which means a simpler language definition compiler etc. and you still can do what you need at the cost of writing more code

haskell ml ocaml miranda alice oz erlang twelf coq prolog all demonstrate more rigorous applications of mathematics to programming


directwrite	direct2d	2
i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net space

i suspect that they re bypassing gdi and using something more direct like the new directwrite and or direct2d apis


gridbaglayout	grouplayout	4
i recommend you not to use grouplayout is really hard instead of you can try to use gridbaglayout it s simplier

i haven t used grouplayout much but i prefer gridbaglayout

i find grouplayout to be fine to code by hand certainly no harder than gridbaglayout though i can certainly see why it would be a favorite for tools to use

so maybe a gridbaglayout will be easier to use than the grouplayout


lxml	beautifulsoup	64
how can i find all div and span tags with order preserved.with beautifulsoup it is very simple but i switched recently to lxml since it is much faster than beautifulsoup

lxml enables you to search for elements using xpath which i think is easier than using beautifulsoup s api

alternatively you can use lxml module which is lot faster than beautifulsoup

i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now

between lxml and beautifulsoup lxml is more equivalent to nokogiri

according to some benchmark tests lxml is nearly 100 times faster than beautifulsoup

we used beautifulsoup in house for a project and found going to lxml gave us more control over the html parsing we were doing as well as less odd issues

i found a solution to this problem using beautifulsoup at beautifulsoup-where-are-you-putting-my-html because i think it is easier than lxml

if you have a bulk of files you want to do this to what you re probably going to want to do is write a script in a hll with a decent html parser i recommend python with lxml or beautifulsoup and then run it over your code

out of these i would recommend lxml html5lib and beautifulsoup

as you can see from this short list of only the 0 scored questions on the converse operation get content from html with python every one recommends beautifulsoup lxml and other similar modules

lxml is also much much faster than beautifulsoup

lxml is much faster than beautifulsoup and probably the fastest parser available for python

i would recommend using beautifulsoup or lxml it s worth the learning curve

i would recommend lxml for html parsing it s simple and considerably faster than beautifulsoup can be as much as two orders of magnitude

the reason for using lxml for such a task is that it cleans html files better than beautifulsoup do

it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it

you ll probably find that lxml runs faster than beautifulsoup but in my uses beautifulsoup was very easy to learn and use and handled typical crappy html as found in the wild well enough that i don t have need for anything else

people tend to prefer lxml these days over beautifulsoup

lxml will let you use xpath here which i think will be less painful than beautifulsoup s interface

beautifulsoup is more suitable for html parsing than lxml

sgmlparser has convert_entityref method but instead of deprecated sgmlparser i would recommend using lxml or beautifulsoup which have better parser api

ian bicking once wrote that surprisingly lxml could be better at parsing soups than beautifulsoup just mentioning for reference haven t tried that personally

i prefer the beautifulsoup syntax as i find it more natural but i find that lxml is better when i m trying to parse unknown quantities on the fly based on variables-- generating xpath strings that include variable values which i will then use to extract specific elements from varying pages

i prefer to use beautifulsoup better than lxml

i prefer beautifulsoup s api over using lxml directly

regarding beautifulsoup lxml is more efficient and in my experience can handle broken html better than beautifulsoup

note that using the beautifulsoup parser is a lot slower than lxml s default parser

one of the things that makes lxml better than beautifulsoup is support for proper css-like class selection or even supports full css selectors if you want to use them

i prefere lxml it s a harder to understand but much faster than beautifulsoup

i ve been trying to do this with beautifulsoup though it looks like lxml might work better

for starters beautifulsoup is no longer actively maintained and the author even recommends alternatives such as lxml

so if you are just starting out beautifulsoup may be easier to use instantly but in the end i believe lxml is more pleasant to work with

i d recommend lxml over beautifulsoup when you start scraping alot of pages the speed advantage of lxml is hard to ignore

beautifulsoup will use the parser it considers best and thus prefer lxml for speed reasons if installed

since you re using lxml why not use it in a more direct manner lxml is believed to be faster than beautifulsoup

according to the above posts and my own experience lxml is definitely faster than beautifulsoup

i found lxml to be more efficient consistent to use and even robust than beautifulsoup

i think you want to surround tail text and i would choose lxml better that beautifulsoup to handle them

i recommend beautifulsoup or lxml

from reading this website it seems lxml is the most commonly used and fastest while beautifulsoup is slower but accounts for more errors and variation

edit don t use this for html work use the lxml library it s python based and much faster than beautifulsoup

lxml is faster than beautifulsoup i think and has much better functionality while remaining relatively easy to use

i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautifulsoup

speed isn t important here but in other applications it is good to know that regexes are very fast 100 times faster than lxml and 1000 faster than beautifulsoup

since beautifulsoup is no longer being actively developed i would recommend lxml since it does all the things that beautifulsoup can do and a lot more

note that lxml is probably a better option than beautifulsoup for this kind of task nowadays for the reasons given by beautifulsoup s author

it s generally accepted that lxml is faster than beautifulsoup ref

pyquery is based on lxml so it s also much faster than beautifulsoup

these days lxml has an html module which the beautifulsoup implementer himself recommends over beautifulsoup

as a side note many folks recommend lxml for parsing html xml over beautifulsoup now for performance and other reasons

i think beautifulsoup or even bare lxml would be easier

beautifulsoup is a python package that parses broken html while lxml does so faster but with high quality html xml

if you choose to use python and are new to the language check out the codecademy python course and don t forget to check out lxml as some people prefer it over beautifulsoup some people also use both in conjunction so it s all a matter of personal preference

if you insist on comparing the string representation of xml trees i recommend using beautifulsoup on top of lxml

lxml is a good one i personally prefer using beautifulsoup as it uses lxml for some of its heavy lifting but has other features as well and is more user-friendly especially for quick matches

lxml also has more features and offers beautifulsoup too

it uses lxml underneath and is much faster than beautifulsoup

i d recommend using lxml or instead of beautifulsoup among other great features you can use xpath to grab your links

it provides similar css selector syntax as jquery does and it s much faster than beautifulsoup because it relies on lxml to do the parsing work

ian bicking agrees and prefers lxml over beautifulsoup

lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup

lxml is significantly more powerful and robust than beautifulsoup in my experienced opinion

i do understand that traditionally they are saying that lxml are stricter than beautifulsoup however what i do not get is the following


igraph	networkx	2
by instance i would recommend using networkx python or igraph r

networkx is much easier to deal with and usually performance is good enough but for large brute force algorithms like this igraph will probably be at least an order of magnitude faster


cfstring	nsstring	1
cfstring has some slightly better functionality than nsstring but is a bit harder to use


armadillo	eigen	3
i have used it and the api is cumbersome and the performance is overall lower than eigen and armadillo

i have recently started to use eigen version 3.3.1 running a benchmark against armadillo on a simple matrix operation at the core of an ols regression that is computing the inverse of the product of a matrix by itself i noticed that eigen was running slower when compiled with mkl library than without it for this kind of operation

i find eigen s syntax more cumbersome than the other numerical linear algebra libraries i ve worked with numpy matlab and armadillo


facade	command-pattern	1
i guess the point that the article is trying to make here is that a facade is easier to implement when you already have this command-pattern in place


gtk	pygobject	2
to avoid this use pygobject build earlier than 2.90.1 if your gtk is old

it looks like python-mpdor is using gtk 2 which would be pygtk as opposed to newer gtk 3 which is pygobject


filesystems	ntfs	15
i m wondering if there s a possible race condition with ntfs when you have two processes cooperating in this way where process b s delete calls have not been completely flushed to the filesystems

when ms switched to the fat32 filesystems that used longer names and later to the ntfs this created migration issues

it won t work on linux but then linux filesystems are less likely to need defragging than ntfs

ntfs filesystems actually supports longer names 32k

generally the performance of hard filesystems like ntfs is better than that of traditional unix filesystems

for the ntfs filesystems one could mention block size set to 4k ntfs storing files less than block size in mtf size of files number of files fragmentation etc

now on windows if the ntfs filesystems has less than 5gb disk space it displays

the problem is that windows ntfs is slower than typical linux filesystems for these lookups

ntfs filesystems actually supports longer names 32k but there is no easy way to allow long names for programs

if you need to load from a well-defined filesystems fat or ntfs this is more tricky you have only 450 bytes of space because 60 of the 512 bytes are used by the filesystems internally for code that interprets the data of the filesystems finds the file containing the code and loads it into memory

when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above

ntfs is much more complex and time consuming due to the more complex nature of this filesystems

although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job

actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc

it s not too hard for the fat filesystems as it s quite simple and well documented but it s more difficult for ntfs as the filesystems is much more complicated and not-so-well documented


rbac	acl	1
in your example i would suggest to use rbac rather than acl because rbac is more flexible for enhancements and maintenance which will be always in system like university management system


xdebug	xhprof	1
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server


fseek	fgetc	1
instead of reading the complete file content with fgetc to get the character count i recommend using fseek ftell see answer from this thread


dplyr	lubridate	1
the lubridate library and dplyr will make this easier


libc	tcmalloc	1
the tcmalloc library for example can be easily inserted into an application to evaluate performance gains in heavily threaded applications where tcmalloc tends to perform a lot better than libc s malloc implementation


expander	itemscontrol	1
basically what is happening is that when i expand one of the expander items and that itemscontrol contains a larger amount of items 25 the rendering of the list appears to be truncated


fuzzy	lemmatization	1
lemmatization implies a broader scope of fuzzy word matching that is


m2e	pom.xml	2
if i right click on my project and select maven -- update project configuration after modifying the pom.xml file etc m2e seems to re-order the build path libraries so that maven dependencies come after the jre system libs which i don t want

another way to build the ear file is using the m2e plugin right click on the parent pom.xml file and choose maven install then start the application server and use the wls deploy in order to deploy the ear file


ubuntu	linux	76
in my opinion windows is not the best for development i have so much problems using windows and had the same problem later i ve switched to ubuntu just learn more linux and c - it has so much built-in programs so you don t have to install it by yourself and you won t have any problems with that little problems and get even more knowledge

linux however is less forgiving and has a filesystem that is case sensitive at least my dev ubuntu version does but i guess it is the default for linux

see but if you are using a linux distro there may be shortcut instructions that make it simpler under ubuntu for example there are shortcuts in

windows starts correctly but if i select linux bootloader ubuntu stucks in emergency mode

ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

seek_hole support in the ext4 filesystem was added to linux in the 3.8 kernel ubuntu 12.04 uses an older kernel than that - your kernel version is 3.2.0-45

is there any way or i have to choose ubuntu linux instance and manually install libraries such as keras tensorflow etc

also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long

at home w ubuntu linux virtualbox is easier to maintain performs as well as i require and is free

i m working with both ubuntu mac but i like staying with the linux system feels faster and more stable for me

i took the linux distro chooser at and it recommends opensuse mandriva ubuntu

it works fine in ubuntu linux as do more complicated apps

i always prefer linux or ubuntu to be very specific when it comes development

i am new at a firm and i was given a project that was on amazon linux ami now we need to transfer project on another server and because i am more familiar with ubuntu than with amazon linux ami i was wondering if there much difference and will project work perfectly

however linux pretend i said ubuntu is even better environment for ruby on rails development and it installs great in vm

all you have to do is install linux i prefer ubuntu and select php apache and mysql

and in the future i think you will get better help by posting ubuntu related questions to unix and linux stack or to dedicated to ubuntu

under a gnu linux distribution like ubuntu everything is much more easier and you can just plug in your device without installing anything you just have to set the right permissions for the device once

i used to code on linux ubuntu to be more precise but now i am using a windows machine 7 and 8.1

i am running a windows 10 pc - i7-6700 3.4ghz 4 cores - hyperthreaded - so 8 logical cores 32gb ram and have a linux vm ubuntu 16.04 using hyper v

install it in a virtual machine on a linux distro i recommend ubuntu

you install ubuntu i recommend linux mint 17.2 rafaela - xfce rc 32-bit as it s lighter on your cpu and ram and dual boot

the original linux version obtained similar speeds to windows but recompilation with gcc 4.8.2 under ubuntu 14.04 provided much faster results but not as good as qpar

while ruby and rails don t change as often as they did a few years ago the dev ecosystem still evolves faster than linux distributions like ubuntu can keep up with

i don t know why arch linux is slower than ubuntu on your machine

i usually prefer linux for programming i program in django on ubuntu

one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it

if you really want a linux box that is easy to use i recommend ubuntu

the recommend linux system tends to be ubuntu 14.04 lts download page

i am developing a small application in linux ubuntu to be more precise and at this point i have an executable a shared library .so a configuration file .conf with some settings to be read by the application at the beginning a data folder with images and other resources to be used during the application life-time resources that can be also modified deleted and of course i would need some file for logs and messages right now i am using syslog

although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution

on linux ubuntu adding one more empty line doe snot work

if you are on linux eg ubuntu you may try gedit for ease of use with some plug-ins but to handle very large files you re better off with vim

select linux and ubuntu 64bit

if you just want the fun of linux command line programs without access to all of ubuntu cygwin is smaller and might be faster

would switching to ubuntu linux be a better option

sometimes a linux distribution contains far more than an operating system but is informally referred to by a single name such as ubuntu and so the line between what the operating system is the linux kernel and standard libraries perhaps and the applications that merely ship with that operating system the gnome and kde environments on linux is pretty gray

it s pretty easy to install linux side by side with windows i recommend ubuntu as the linux distro

when i need to use linux based os i always choose ubuntu

if you are new to linux then i defiantly recommend ubuntu

your best options are likely windows server or linux i personally prefer ubuntu for developer-friendliness but there are many options and some will perform better in a production environment

it has been now over one year i have trashed windows and moved to linux ubuntu to be more precise and i am using the ide zend studio combined with aptana studio for developing oo php5.3 websites

i d recommend ubuntu if your new to linux on a desktop

edit i am using a linux os ubuntu to be more precise

to be independent of the operating system used win linux ubuntu .. mac execute this command

usually i prefer using linux centos ubuntu for production server

base r seems to work fine in linux windows 10 uses 20gb of disc space whereas ubuntu only needs a few gb the ram needed with ubuntu is slightly lower

i m testing some simple benchmarking calculations on win7 and linux ubuntu 16 to compare the timings and being wonder win appears to be much faster than linux

i like ubuntu linux which has more than 27 000 packages in its universe repository. now you can run linux and windows at the same time

here is a bash script that can use after you installed bash from msys or you can sort it with a linux box - ubuntu is no bigger than 800mb and can run as livecd without interfering your current windows system and the livecd can double as a system saver when needed

i ve used python on windows and on ubuntu and linux is much cleaner

also i would recommend doing a dual boot to ubuntu it s much easier to work with opencl in a linux cli fashion

then under java se runtime environment select linux x86 if you re using ubuntu 32-bit or linux x64 for 64bit

packet size that send to linux based android and linux ubuntu are larger than packet size that send to windows based device

i would certainly recommend ubuntu linux for simple reasons

if you re new to linux i d recommend ubuntu as it s a popular and well-supported distro

i can understand windows 10 performing faster than linux on vm but why is the baremetal ubuntu so slow

shameless plug i also made a package that easily abstracts opening things on mac win linux basically abstracting xdg-open ubuntu open mac cmd.exe win so you don t have to think about it

sometimes people recommend installing ubuntu linux on top of windows in a virtual machine for rails development

also keep in mind that we provide downloads for ubuntu select ubuntu linux from the drop down

ubuntu linux is more strict when it comes to opening files that are already open the line

however i am using ubuntu now how do i change the user_agent variable to match linux standards

if you are new to linux i would recommend ubuntu as that is a popular linux distro and is well documented and has a super active community that can help you out if when you get stuck

hard to beat ubuntu though i personally use mostly macs that s because mac os x still offers a superior laptop experience and my personal machines are mostly laptops by now -- my workstation at work does run ubuntu -- though i m pretty sure other modern linux distros would be shoulder and shoulder with it

you can totally install shiny server on a old computer and i would recommend using linux os like ubuntu and it will save you some time following the tutorial

questions about using a desktop or laptop gnu linux system are better directed towards super user unix linux or ask ubuntu

even if you re on linux it s much easier to get a precompiled version sudo apt install r-cran-rgl on ubuntu if you have the appropriate cran repositories set up

ubuntu is the more user-friendly of the two i think ubuntu is actually one of the most newbie-friendly linux distros so if you are new to linux ubuntu is the way to go

if you do mind using linux you can use ubuntu which is more user-friendly but not really recommended as a server at least for the default version

what is the best gui development package for python on linux ubuntu being more specific

i already have everything working on ubuntu but i can t seem to get inkscape installed on amazon linux to have a better renderer

if you choose linux then i suggest going with ubuntu as that has one of the best automatic hardware configuration i have seen

also symfony on windows with xampp will run much slower than on linux ubuntu system

this python3 cgi https server used to work a few weeks or months ago but now no longer works under linux ubuntu

you can use alpine linux docker image it is very light and is better than both ubuntu and centos image to be used as the docker

my call is not working but if i have a colleague run the php on his linux box running an older version of ubuntu php it works fine


nsscanner	nsstring	2
use the floatvalue nsstring method or a nsscanner which is more powerful and flexible

of course you might be able to make the first step from long string to number easier by using nsscanner or by taking a substring of your long string cutting out everything except for the number itself and then using the nsstring method integervalue or doublevalue


tex	mathjax	1
i read this post any reason to favor mathml syntax over tex in mathjax


minimum	max	60
the syntax is min max where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

see if the max se value at the minimum cobble is less than the min se at the maximum cobble value

the syntax is min max where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

i would just iterate through the array keeping track of the total and check at each iteration if the value is smaller than the minimum or greater than the maximum and if so store those as the new min max

the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes

i want to set limits to the picker such that the max date is today s date and the minimum date is not more than one year ago

another o n solution for this task can be done by using local minimum and maximum finding the best deference profit between max and min knowing that max should have greater index then min

from here you also need to take into account if the user inputs a value higher than the max year of the data and also less than the minimum

my question is can we set max stack size lower than the minimum stack size which may be 4 kb for the goroutines

take the max of the child s preferred height or a hard-coded minimum whichever is larger

this way the first value read will most likely be lower than the minimum at the moment and the first value will also be higher than the current max value

and you need to define the minimum and maximum for generate_series - doable with select min time_utc and max time_utc

i want to validate a number as decimal up to two decimal and minimum range is greater than 0.00 and max range is up to 99.99

if it were possible to find such a cut then max-flow min-cut would not be true the max flow of the network would be greater than the minimum capacity of an s-t cut

why is the max time which happens on the first iteration of the loop 2-4x longer than the minimum time

in case if you wanted to retain one entry and remove others select minimum or max values of observation_id from observation table

this way if the next number n is greater than max + 1 then a gap would have been made and max + 1 is the minimum unobtainable number

how can the max value be larger than the minimum

the test taker passes if all their max scores are greater than all the test minimum scores or the total max scores is greater than the basictest qmscore

the max value is start when user select minimum value

for group 1 the minimum value is actually 2 however i need minimum indexed lower than max value index position

here i have an algorithm that adds a number to another number e.g current + step and if that number is greater than the max value the remainder of the step is added to the minimum

look-up in the case of failure should be constant time if the current element is less than the minimum element of the heap containing the max m elements we can reject it outright

the minimum requirement and smaller than the max requirement

i have my query that select minimum date and max data for receipts returned will have a much later date that when it was first created

so i use the formula you have in your second query to first calculate the bounds -- the four lat long values at the extremes of the allowed radius then take those bounds and do a simple query to find the matches within them less than the max lat long more than the minimum lat long

all numbers will always be equal to or greater than the minimum value or equal to or less than the max value

i know how to do this by creating a subset table by taking the minimum timestamp and self joining but is there a lag lead max partition function that can do this instead

the syntax is where min is zero or a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

i wrote this assuming that you might adjust the minimum to be more visible but you d keep the max at 1

in this example i would want to flag the following records in my data 2 lower than the minimum for x and 4 higher than the max for y

a bit of an rtfm answer open the file in csv format see the csv library and then iterate line by line converting the field that is a date into a date object see the docs for converting a string to a date object and if it is less than minimum so far store it as minimum similar for max with a special condition on the first line that the date becomes both min and max dates

you can use union and then select minimum from max values and max from minimum values

the minimum week number is a single int value like 1 the max is never greater than two-digit int like 24 because there are 52 weeks in a year

i m simply checking the values of two input textboxes and alerting the user if the max price is less than the minimum price but they re evaluating backwards

if you per se wanted the minimum index for a set of values with more than one minimum you d just swap out max for min at the front of the expression

for the above dto when i m trying to submit a json object with username length is less than the minimum length in the class length min 3 max 30 i got http 400 bad request

trying to put together regex that can match minimum 4 digits maximum 16 digits and those digits can be separated by characters - x+ but should not be part of the min max count

the syntax is where min is a positive integer number indicating the minimum number of matches and max is an integer equal to or greater than min indicating the maximum number of matches

first i run a query to find the min and max for each security id then find the difference between the min and max and finally find a value that is 10 more than the minimum like this

- preceeding symbol template is expected to appear exactly minimum min times but not more than max times

now you are iterating exactly like your example with one change to know what is the next set you are moving to you have to replace every number in the current set with the next number in the array and replace the max option that less than the minimum you are saving

4.if minimum value is greater than the current value in array than add difference of than in ans add the difference with current value update max from left

when running above query and first date popup open so if i enter nothing in it so it must be choose minimum value from the database and if another date popup open and i will insert nothing in it so it must get max value from the table ..

for albania i want to select minimum and maximum values of date for the last value of city_code here it s 20008 of albania the min value of date for 20008 is 18.01.2013 and max value for 20008 is 20.01.2013

figuring out the necessary exponent range is much more straightforward if you can describe the max and min possible absolute values of your input you can easily find suitable corresponding binary minimum and maximum exponent

still you must increase max also if your minimum is anything less than 15 the adk is now building an extra folder new stuff in truth the new version of the adt is annoying i am just starting and now you will see they have enforced the use of fragments

the path to your minimum sell node is marketstat type sell min or if you want to use shorthand says anywhere in the document so you can specify just sell min to get all of the minimum sell nodes and buy max to get all of the maximum buys

if u want the second minimum then just change the max to min and change the less than sign to grater than

15 is the highest number for n you can pass as 16 16 is larger than the minimum max value for unsigned long long 2 64 - 1

in general case you need to determine maximum and minimum shape coordinates along every axis and define minimum axis aligned integer bounding box with values rounded to larger using ceil for max and rounded to smaller using floor for min coordinates

assuming that your machine has less than 19.7 gb of ram the option -xms5048m effectively sets minimum and maximum heap size to 5048 mb the default max is 25 of machine ram so the max will be higher if you have 19.7 gb ram

to make sure no path shorter than max can be found one has to monitor the minimum possible length of a path until the current point the minimum over a column in the distance table

now i want to select max x from all minimum x for each group

you can pull the minimum select min and the maximum select max you can determine how many results are in a set select count

matches a-za-z with minimum length of 2 and max length 6

if i is rather little just iterate and keep i minimum datas insert every new data in a binary tree of the i most little datas if it is less than the max of these datas

which means minimum of min repetitions but not more than max repetitions

assuming width and height are both positive numbers the only way to get a negative output value from the scale is if you input a number that is less than the minimum domain value for the x scale or more than the maximum domain value on the y scale -- which implies that the max min functions aren t doing what you expect

just iterate through values choose minimum and maximum values and set y axis min and max values


ninject	linfu	2
how am i supposed to choose between castle-windsor unity structuremap spring.net autofac ninject funq linfu etc etc

mef linfu and spring.net are faster than ninject but still pretty


redmine	trac	20
the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac

i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac

redmine s installation process is not easy but trac installation became also more complex these days so manual database creation etc

trac and redmine are more than just wiki s

i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin

redmine handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than trac

i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis

grab redmine or trac and take on the challenge of getting everyone to standardize

i wound up going with redmine and it s way better than trac

i haven t tried coded or retrospectiva but i ve used both redmine and trac and in my opinion redmine is better because

i would favor trac over redmine

we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use

redmine is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than trac and seems to be much easier to administer

redmine is definitely much more popular but trac is getting more popular in particular as 1.0 version is around the corner

for next projects i m going to try redmine seems more clean and hipe than trac

redmine handles multiple projects and sub projects far nicer than trac

redmine was written to be a better trac than trac

we have previously used trac but have found redmine to be much more intuitive flexible and user-friendly

we ve recently switched from trac to redmine where i work and i think i like it a little more than trac and use the wiki functionality almost everyday

i would recommend redmine similar with trac in many aspects


tapestry	wicket	7
wicket s goal is to support static typing to the fullest extent whereas tapestry is more about saving lines of code

beyond ones already suggested i would recommend checking out tapestry and wicket many developers like them

tapestry and wicket are two more modern ones haven t used them though

click is tapestry-like but much more easy than tapestry and wicket

in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s ioc container makes it more powerful than wicket

if your requirement is for a more traditional web application then compare click with struts stripes wicket tapestry etc

and beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives or fragmentation than in .net some more oriented to the mvc pattern struts struts2 stripes spring mvc some more component-based jsf tapestry wicket and some others gwt


gtk	xcb	1
you might use a low level x11 library like xcb -or the older xlib - it is used by graphical toolkits like qt or gtk or fox etc.. which are both free software toolkits so you could study their source code and xlib xcb are also free software


dynamic-languages	typechecking	1
if anything i would imagine scope and availability through passed params in a dynamic-languages would be considerably easier to establish without the typechecking concern


joomla	typo3	1
i didn t work with these applications yet but afaik typo3 and ezpublish both php are considered much more professional than joomla


junit	powermockito	2
powermockito might integrate a little easier with testng but i have never used it with junit

i am going to need to use powermockito - mockito to create some more tests but before i start writing those tests i am just switching the junit runner to powermockrunner


xctest	ocunit	2
to get tests that run on ios6 create a test target and select ocunit from the drop-down xctest is ios7 only or you can use something like ghunit which also supports ios6

for kif 3.0 you must select xctest as kif 3.0 targets xctest by default unless you re explicitly targeting ocunit in which case you should follow the same steps as kif 2.0


clearinterval	settimeout	3
as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array

my solution was to increase the settimeout to create a bigger delay before the next part of the script commenced but also to add an additional clearinterval as the top line of the script running within the setinterval

i d also recommend using settimeout rather than setinterval clearinterval since it doesn t need to be run on a recurring basis


for-loop	while-loop	10
and now we know that for-loop is faster than while-loop

edit just realized a while-loop may well be a lot cleaner than a for-loop for this

i would prefer for-loop over while-loop because if not used properly while-loop can go into an infinite loops

ok i think i may have fixed my problem i changed the logic and so i m now using a for-loop i could have still used a while-loop but i think a for-loop is better

also it seems like a for-loop is of greater cost to the compiler than a while-loop

i have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop

i searched a lot and discovered nice approaches of others that do solve my problem but out of curiosity i would love to know if there is solution to my problem that keeps the while-loop despite a for-loop would be more appropriate in the first place as i know the range but the day will come when i will need a while loops

you can think of the for-loop being a more compact way of writing the while-loop

if you re just going to loops through point use a for-loop as while-loop is more prone to dropping into an endless loops if you forgot to increment counter or doing wrongly or do it in multiple places

the reason for the second case much slower on sorted data is that a while-loop is cheaper than the equivalent for-loop when there are zero iterations


fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	2
for this fileinputstream and fileoutputstream are better

at first i tried reading the original pdf with a fileinputstream and finding the signature hex strings to split it into smaller files with a fileoutputstream as i have done with jpgs


onchange	onblur	7
onchange is a better choice than onblur or focusout because blur and focusout also fire when the contents of the text field hasn t changed

i can get onblur to do the job but would really prefer onchange

also onchange won t work you ll need to use onkeyup although onblur is probably more sane

also i am not sure why everyone is suggesting onblur isn t onchange is better for validation purpose

so i found the answer in ios select onchange not firing referenced by itsgoingdown it seems that what work like god but not so smooth in pc is to put a onblur action directly on the select tag and reference to a change the location to the value of selected item

select onblur onchange onfocus

edit you probably only want to validate when the value changes and field loses focus that s why imo the onchange event would be more appropriate than onblur not onblure


phpstorm	aptana	1
phpstorm takes a few minutes to synchronize the project and aptana takes even longer to rebulild the project


boost	armadillo	1
there is speed comparison too click compare blitz++ armadillo boost multiarray


pyenv	virtualenv	3
python versions you install using pyenv go into its directory by default pyenv root is .pyenv so are more global than virtualenv

pyenv operates on a wider scale than virtualenv - it holds a register of python installations and can be used to install new ones and allows you to configure which version of python to run when you use the python command

there are other tools on top of virtualenv like pyenv which are easier to use


carrierwave	minimagick	1
aside i would recommend using carrierwave minimagick over carrierwave rmagick


odoo	qweb	1
qweb is nicer templating tool and it was created by odoo and its designed to work cross language originally which can be forked from git - qweb


webclient	webrequest	11
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest

to get the html instead of hardcoding it as above use the webclient class since it has a simplier api than webrequest

a webclient is much easier than a webrequest

webclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequest

and for rest if you need more than the webclient webrequest

webclient is a shorter and more concise syntax but behind the scenes it uses a webrequest so in terms of performance it won t be faster it will be equivalent

update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest

webrequest just offers you more functonality than webclient

for finer grained control you might find webrequest to be more useful but webclient seems the best fit for your needs

the latter example is much more appealing since i obviously prefer webclient but legacy webrequest will do

webclient is simpler to use than webrequest


nasm	fasm	2
while this works if you are using fasm or nasm it is much easier to use a far jmp if you are still in 32-bit mode

from what i have heard intel releases cpu families x86 for instance with an instruction set reference and the various assembler programs masm fasm nasm etc provide a higher level human-readable language which is used to make machine code instructions


catransition	uiswipegesturerecognizer	1
if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case


scipy	scikit-learn	3
i uninstalled earlier versions of numpy scipy and scikit-learn as suggested in earlier posts and again installed all three numpy scipy and scikit-learn 0.15 but warning still shows

i didn t dig on why scikit-learn gives such unprecise result but it seems scipy gives better precision

scikit-learn seems to beat scipy for both build time and query time


onclick	onfocus	2
also the onfocus event would be more appropriate than onclick because it handles other scenarios such as pressing the tab key to change the active input

you will notice i have put select onfocus and onclick but it still doesn t always work


web-inf	facesservlet	1
this example will move the resources folder into web-inf hereby ensuring more security it is now not possible anymore to access those resources independently from the facesservlet


css-preprocessor	stylus	1
i would suggest kicking bootstrap and using plain media queries optionally using whatever css-preprocessor you like like stylus sass scss less ...


dxcore	coderush	1
dxcore is the newer name for coderush dxcore and coderush are a refactoring and productivity tool by devexpress that extends the functionality of microsoft visual studio 2002 2003 2005 2008 and 2010


configobj	configparser	4
i have heard that configobj is easier to use than configparser even though it is not a built-in library

check out configobj its the slickest method i ve found so far and definitely more flexible than configparser

personally i would recommend using configparser which comes with python or perhaps configobj which i like better

i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser


rmdir	mkdir	2
it seems when lotus notes domino thread creates folder a and some files in it using lotusscript mkdir rmdir and other io methods and then executes java vm which tries to delete folder a with all files in it parent thread lotus notes domino gets corrupted and loses directory structure handle which results in error above

but if it exists instead of deleting the folder and create a new one i ve already figured out how to do this using the kill rmdir mkdir functions i would like to create a new one using the same folder name but with something like 1 2 at the end of the folder name to differentiate between them


pkcs#5	cryptojs	1
regarding the padding itâ s more tricky as cryptojs does not list pkcs#5 as supported and java does not list pkcs7 in fact it lists very little so it might be implementation depended which padding algorithms the aes provider supports but at least nopadding is supported by both java and cryptojs


wxhaskell	gtk2hs	3
both wxhaskell and gtk2hs are more or less complete

wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases

in practice i ve never had resource management issues with wxhaskell although i agree that it s possible and is an area handled better by gtk2hs which uses reference counting in the underlying library


glsurfaceview	renderscript	1
both a renderscript and opengl are used for getting high performance graphics and animation s.but still opengl is the best option to get high performance graphics because it is well documented and you will have more control over the glsurfaceview .but in renderscript some of the classes are depreciated in the current versions .its almost not possible to make a rssurfaceview to transparent


jpgraph	phpgraphlib	1
jpgraph has far more capabilities than phpgraphlib


cntk	cudnn	1
finally i don t expect to learn many meaningful lessons from this benchmark both cntk and theano are calling the same cudnn implementation the advantages of cntk are more around higher level things such as a comes with a high-level library b the user doesn t have to worry about the batch and sequence axes except for a few specialized operations c efficient recurrent networks d efficient i o e easy distributed training


nsstring	nsdata	1
however converting from nsstring to nsdata gives more reliable json data


tablelayout	margins	1
you can use gridbaglayout instead of gridlayout to divide the components in rows and columns just like tablelayout that gives you more control on grid width height margins padding column rows etc


memmove	memset	1
what more it seems to beat memset too when memset seems like it could benefit from optimizations that memcpy or memmove can t


feof	fgetc	2
you could instead check say with if feof stream to see if you are at eof but i think just checking the return value of fgetc is nicer

you should call feof or ferror to determine why fgetc is returning no more data


treeview	tabcontrol	1
i can t find any way to make the treeview s height smaller or the tabcontrol s larger


tablet	galaxy	8
in your case whats happening is that your galaxy tablet has a lower pixel density and android down-scales the image from a xxhdpi to whatever density the tablet has hdpi or xhdpi ....so it your image is a 512px image android would down-scale it to 341px for xhdpi or 256px for an hdpi device

minor differences between two identical target devices samsung galaxy tab 10.1 one tablet always performs fares better

so for example a galaxy note 1 calling a gs3 experiences more delay than a galaxy note 1 calling nexus 7 tablet asus and galaxy note 1 calling a xiaomi mi-2 phone

i ve tested this on a few devices a nexus 10 tablet which gets the bigger version of the file from the xhdpi folder a generic tablet using mdpi a galaxy ace phone mdpi again and everything works ok

tablet have larger displays but the pixel density is not as high as on for example the iphone 4 samsung galaxy nexus etc

i ve tested this on an emulator running with haxm 2gbram 256heap size and a galaxy tab of which i don t know the type anymore both having the same problem altough the tablet can handle more entities before the loop begins

nexus one has 32mb galaxy nexus - 64mb tablet can have even more

i can t use screens size because of devices like galaxy note with huge screens and some phones have higher resolution than some tablet same with dpi i think


queue	fifo	16
when any counter gets decremented to zero you add the unlocked question to a queue or stack you can choose whether you prefer fifo or lifo order

yes because the queue is implemented as a fifo one which is sent earlier is on the front part of the queue thus leaving sooner

true fifo message ordering longer delays and so on but sadly smaller message sizes. push queue allow you to set up push subscribers which then receive an http post any time a new message is put onto the queue

i need a class that user select work with fifo or lifo the combination of queue class and stack class

as of jquery 1.5 the fail and done and as of jquery 1.6 always callback hooks are fifo managed queue allowing for more than one callback for each hook

so if your intention is to have a fifo queue the class name queue could be easier to read maintain than any linkedlist

i used a queue fifo array to track order of added values to know which items to remove from the median array when they the queue is longer than the wanted size

i found the single timeout thread and multiple fifo queue to be more flexible - any old object could be timed out on it as long as it was descended from timeoutobject - no extra os calls handles needed

in practice the fifo queue approach is often faster than using a priority queue dijkstra as mentioned in this answer are there faster algorithms than dijkstra

choose fifo option so that all messages are delivered in the same order they came into a queue

i don t know how fast do you want to process the messages but if you need to have a real fifo don t allow azure s queue to get more than one message at a time

i can t imagine though why you d use a max heap as your default data structure when a fifo queue would be a more reasonable choice

i have to develop a better queue that works more efficiently than the fifo queue

a queue is defined much more abstractly it has to support a couple of specific operations adding and retrieving items and an order relationship between the two fifo

as emphasized these new fifo sqs queue provide more options to cover the use case at hand but are not yet available in all sqs regions initially only in us east ohio and us west oregon

a fifo queue might be a better approach than recursion as suggested by the wikipedia article on breadth-first search


bazaar	svn	7
i personally prefer git but some people find svn simpler to use and some people like mercuiral bazaar or darcs

you can not have multiple physical branches under one repository with mercurial like svn or bazaar but the good thing about mercurial imho is the easy user interface that is really straightforward and the performance that is faster than bazaar although bazaar is getting faster and faster in their recent release

i recommend git but there are plenty of vcs ses available svn bazaar cvs...

i worked on a project for one place that were forced to use a locking system and opted to use no control at all so i set up a secret svn branch even though i much prefer bazaar or git

now i want to work on this read-only also i have better experience with bazaar than svn so i want to change this repository from svn to a bazaar repository for working locally how can i do that and one additional thing does svn support local repositories like bazaar

bazaar seems much more like svn with branches just being separate directories so maybe not

that makes bazaar behave more like svn in that every commit automatically goes to the server and you can t forget to push


zend-framework	codeigniter	1
in codeigniter and zend-framework which is the better option


uninstall	upgrade	6
for example if you tried that and it only installed newer files with higher versioning then your major upgrade logic is incorrect by definition because that will uninstall the older product before installing the newer one

then i tryed following changing upgrade code of product - and make high versioning again then uninstall and install lower versioning - and it worked fine

the old upgrade was more an uninstall and a reinstall

one thing before the problem the upgrade from one wix packaged sw to another wix packaged sw is actually working fine i am able to uninstall the older versioning and install the newer versioning

the upgrade works correctly but if uninstall new build for example build 9 and install an old one example 3 i got an error although nothing currently installed on my machine this versioning is older than installed one

i did it an upgrade test on a dummy machine and when i get to the real thing i had to uninstall and remove all leftover db s tfs_configuration you can see migrate data from tfs 2008 to an already working tfs 2012


uniq	comm	1
sort | uniq is good but comm might be even better


mtu	icmp	3
any device in the path of communication between the sender and receiver whose mtu is smaller than the packet will drop such packets and reply the sender with icmp destination unreachable datagram too big message containing the device s mtu

what happen when icmp is disabled in an router and when packet size greater than mtu how the router fragments that packet

anything sent larger than the mtu with df set will result in an icmp error message being generated


opencv	vlfeat	1
have a look at sift and surf and at vlfeat which has a good sift implementation and also implements mser and hog and is much smaller than opencv


d3.js	highcharts	5
i found d3.js to be rich library but highcharts is more interactive i guess

i achieved the desired results in highcharts but i prefer d3.js

for something more robust check out highcharts or d3.js or something built on top of d3.js like nvd3.js

d3.js is the way to go if you plan to do a lot of heavy duty custom visualization work of a type that isn t supported by other libraries but if you want a diverse selection of out-of-the-box visualization types that are still highly customizable you can t beat highcharts

for graphs i will recommend using d3.js or highcharts


nsexception	nserror	2
aside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to

nserror is generally used to pass information between different code interfaces that are expecting a possible error where as nsexception is more so for errors that are unexpected or caused by the developer and thus should be handled during development


cldc	midp	1
the confusion comes from the fact that javame is so much more than just midp cldc


jar	manifest.mf	3
putting it in the jar file among the classes or adding its jar-relative path to the class-path entry of the jar s manifest.mf file is more than sufficient

i think that s why i can t use to launch my project this way works but jar way is better because everything including the main_class is described in manifest.mf

to partially answer the question asked if on windows which you didn t say and isn t the only system with a command prompt a jar file is really a zip file underneath and explorer in all supported versions xp s03 can treat a zip file as a directory subtree so just rename to have the extension .zip and open in explorer go to meta-inf select manifest.mf and open with plain-text editor of your choice such as notepad


querypath	phpquery	6
it is said that phpquery is often faster than querypath because of fewer overall features

hence i d recommend using phpquery or querypath for such occasions

or better yet use querypath or phpquery which are easier on the eyes

usually querypath or phpquery are also easier on the eyes

that s easier with phpquery or querypath

it s easier with phpquery or querypath


erd	diagram	3
personally i prefer erd diagram for databaser data models

the circle in erd denotes the lower multiplicity bound of 0 see diagram bellow

erd diagram uploaded with more explanation about the diagram


subtraction	modulo	10
with regard to implementation it also takes advantage of a bit of a non-obvious property of r precedence rules actually this is true of other languages as well such as c c++ and java namely that unary negative is higher than modulo which is higher than binary subtraction thus the calculation for is equivalent to

as i said this may increase the speed especially in an environment where modulo is more expensive than simple subtraction but you would want to actually benchmark it to be certain

the conditional test and subtraction is typically less expensive than a modulo especially if the sum does not frequently exceed mod

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

the reason is that the modulo is slower than subtraction

that is essentially the one case in which repeated subtraction 0 or 1 times a special case of repeated subtraction can be and commonly is but not necessarily faster than division-based modulo

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations

and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction

as you can see modulo is about an order of magnitude slower than subtraction


margin	text-align	2
the text-align center is for old ie6 whereas margin works for newer browsers

using margin 0 auto or an inline-block div with a parent with text-align center are both better bets


spring-data-commons	spring-data-jpa	1
you may encounter noclassdeffounderror if the version of spring-data-commons is older then required by spring-data-jpa


pbkdf2	md5	1
so we can use pbkdf2 with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than md5


janusgraph	titan	2
janusgraph is a more up-to-date version of titan despite the low version number

if you are just getting started and are just interested in learning about graph databases then i likely wouldn t recommend starting with titan janusgraph as it requires a bit of configuration to get started schemas backend selection etc


qvboxlayout	qwidget	1
the center widget is a qdockwidget containing a qwidget with a qvboxlayout containing more stuff


glibc	newlib	1
note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports


qlistwidget	qstyleditemdelegate	1
having implemented a similar approach for a qlistwidget i recommend using qstyleditemdelegate in lieu of qitemdelegate as it allows you to more easily integrate this widget with your application s style layout


pexpect	telnetlib	1
i got it to work by using a child process from pexpect which is much more flexible than telnetlib


scrollmagic	skrollr	1
should i go for parallax scrolling or should i prefer skrollr or scrollmagic or just simple css with few jquery code


cs-cart	magento	1
if you don t want to start from scratch i recommend cs-cart small site or magento huge site


passenger	puma	4
sergio suggested nginx + unicorn or nginx + puma but nginx + passenger which replaces unicorn puma is much easier to setup performs great uses less memory works better and has more features

phusion passenger 4 enterprise bring many advantages over has more features than puma and rainbows for example it has out of band garbage collection can dynamically adjust the number of processes based on traffic completely automates rolling restarts so you don t need scripting etc

i actually prefer puma which is analogous to passenger standalone

same passenger + mri 2.3.0 is 3 times faster than puma + jruby on same rack app


strcpy	strncpy	41
i.e strncpy is actually better than the simpler strcpy if you are willing to improve the code

strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another

strncpy is more recommended that strcpy because protect your code against buffer overflow

has nicer behavior than either strcpy or strncpy

i was exploring around with c regarding strncpy since most people says that it is safer than strcpy additional parameter length to avoid buffer overflows

using strncpy instead of strcpy is normally safer but here you alloc eachtime the right amount of memory needed to store inpoint into mpoint so i cant see what s the point

strcpy could be better replaced by strncpy which does some bound checking

my personal opinion is that it is vastly more useful than strncpy and strcpy

replaced strcpy with strncpy which is much safer apparently and that removed the segmentation fault

strcpy is notoriously unsafe as are it s cousins strcpy_s and strncpy although they are mildly safer than strcpy

of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does

strncpy is safer than strcpy

2 prefer strncpy to strcpy -- with strcpy you can exceed the size of the array

furthermore all this strlen +1 -1 stuff is unnecessary and confusing prefer strncpy over memcpy and strcpy for strings and you don t need to deal with that

concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows

usually when people use strncpy they forget to do this which is why i recommend strcpy

memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster

also you will find that using strcpy strncpy is much faster than a simple loop to copy each char

to copy a string in c use carefully strcpy 3 often strncpy is better

it was never intended to be some safe version of strcpy - that s complete nonsense since strncpy is far more unsafe because of the null termination issue

strncpy is not safer method to use as strcpy

using strncpy is considered safier than strcpy because the second one can easily cause buffer overrun

but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively

you should use strcpy or strncpy safer than strcpy to copy the string stored in the array between arrays

memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object

the best solution is to write a custom version of strncpy that is less weird or if you know the length of the input just use strcpy

read the man pages to compare strcpy and strncpy

switch from using strcpy to strncpy or strncat which i think is better than strncpy

in general strncpy is a safer alternative to strcpy

so that the strncpy is more secure than strcpy

strcpy is not a safe function prefer using strncpy

for comparison of strcpy and strncpy which is the safer alternative see their manual page

prefer strncpy over strcpy to prevent unexpected buffer overflows or look into the string class

not related to the leak but if you know the length prefer strncpy over strcpy

it is in fact considered to be much more dangerous than strcpy since the null termination mechanism of strncpy is not intuitive and therefore often misunderstood

do be careful of boundaries and prefer strncpy to strcpy -- the later is unsafe

using strncpy 3 is better than strcpy 3 but things like strlcpy 3 are better still

by the way please prefer strncpy which takes a length argument to the less safe strcpy as the default to reduce the risk of buffer overflows

regardless to copy the strings prefer strncpy to the unsafe strcpy

for instance strncpy is mostly useless it gives you nothing more than strcpy

myth 3 strncpy is a safer version of strcpy


typhoeus	eventmachine	1
if you re using faraday and start out with net http you can later decide to use excon typhoeus patron or eventmachine without changing more than a line or two of configuration


prefuse	jung	1
somehow the layout algorithms in prefuse seem to display a better layout than in jung rendering is also better i think though most of the layout algorithms in prefuse are based on jung implementation


splash	interstitial	1
i am showing interstitial ads inside my app and admob wants me to show a splash screen before showing interstitial to make it more user friendly


fgets	strncmp	1
i d recommend strncmp to do the trick since fgets includes the newline character


theano	lasagne	3
maybe someone more skilled with theano lasagne will see a solution

and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn

it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features


addition	modulo	19
division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition

because the string formatting operator shares precedence with the remainder or modulo which binds more tightly than the + addition operator

the modulo has a higher precedence than addition

i extra searched for the order of operation of both modulo and addition and it says that modulo has higher priority

the modulo has a higher operator precedence than the addition operator therefore it will happen before the addition

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition

modulo can also cause a divide-by-zero and it has a higher precedence than addition

performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

is the modulo really weaker than the addition

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access

it might seem unintuitive but it has a lower precedence than multiplication addition and modulo operations

the result of the addition was better than the modulo the by 0.0070000 milliseconds over the course of 2 million or 200 000 iterations

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction


bash	shellcheck	3
shellcheck tends to be more explicit than bash

i cannot recommend shellcheck enough for people working with bash scripts

remember it will be helpful for you to use a site like shellcheck to learn more about potential pitfalls or the uniquenesses of bash syntax


interrupt	wakeup	2
wait with a timeout value can wakeup upon timeout value elapsed or notify whichever is earlier or interrupt as well whereas a sleep wakes up on timeout value elapsed or interrupt whichever is earlier

or is there any other better method than using wakeup interrupt to count seconds since power on


highcharts	highstock	5
since most of the functionality of highcharts is found in highstock you re probably better off to just use highstock for whatever application needs the range selector

in other cases i ve gotten an error that says highcharts was loaded more than once but i m not using highstock which is apparently the source of this error

i have a chart in highcharts to be more specific it s a highstock chart candlesticks type and now i want to add some svg shapes to it

i cannot use highstock seems i need other highcharts features and did not buy highstock license anyway

i did this in highstock but if you prefer using highcharts then it should work using the same code though it will look a bit different


mapbox	cartodb	1
to create instead geographic kind of visualization i would recommend mapbox and cartodb which provide nice tools to create maps


ejml	jama	1
ejml looks really good it works almost 2x faster than jama on my data.


watij	webdriver	1
i can see the usage of watin and watij reducing as more developers move to selenium 2.0 webdriver which will offer the same functionality as watir using a different api and multiple programming languages


free	realloc	27
if you don t mind the libc allocation functions realloc is even more efficient it wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as free and if you grow the memory and there is memory free after it will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either

if you ever need to resize the matrix you will have to either use realloc or ask for more space on the heap copy your values over and free the older memory

you could have some initial guess for maxsize 8 and grow when needed your data perhaps by using realloc or just by malloc -ing a bigger new chunk copying the older chunk inside then free -ing that older chunk

malloc free is harder because thereâ s also calloc and realloc

a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory

in c you would use malloc to get memory realloc to get more memory and free to release memory

dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does

if nfa- numstates is greater than arraysize free previous memory and realloc arrays of size nfa- numstates

i ve already tried using realloc to reallocate more memory to my array after using free but when i try to do it my results are either a unexpected shut of the execution or a lot of crazy plots..

a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free

it is important to note that realloc may extend the older block to size bytes may keep the same block and free the extra bytes or may allocate an entirely new block of memory copy the content from the older block to the newer block and then free the older block

generally new delete and malloc realloc free arrange for more memory from the os using sbrk or os-specific-equivalent and divide the pages up however they like to satisfy the program s allocation requests

as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free

i know that memory blocks and reallocation are implementation so specific but when there are contiguous free blocks of memory realloc works better than a new buffer allocation and memory copy

i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free

if old is greater than new free the extra old pointers on the end before doing the first realloc so you don t leak memory

that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair

in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram

in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy

the only reason to prefer malloc free is if you want to optimize reallocations with realloc which isn t supported by operator new delete realloc is not a simple free+malloc

if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent

the tool recommends replacing realloc with malloc memcpy and free

fiddly stuff and this is one case where i d recommend using malloc free realloc rather than c++ memory management

actually i usually don t recommend using realloc for that reason just do the malloc memcpy free yourself

in implementing the function copynorepeat i can not use realloc to allocate more 4 bytes of space to store a number in v2 this results in double free or corruption fasttop . i wonder why

if i try to use realloc to allocate less memory for a pointer than it initially had allocated will the redundant memory be free or will the reallocation result in a memory leak

the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free


atoi	strtod	1
also strtod is a better alternative to atoi


readr	tidyverse	1
we can use tidyverse extract from tidyr to split group into group and decision then replace the group value to 1 if the percentage extracted the number with parse_number from readr is greater than or equal to 90


completionhandler	nsurlsession	1
using completionhandler -based methods of nsurlsession is much easier


imperative	declarative	29
while it is possible to explore non-imperative computer concepts it doesn t seem to be worth the effort at the current time - building a declarative machine as an interpreter on top of an imperative machine is much cheaper and faster than a true declarative machine

declarative programming is not always simpler than imperative programming

imperative is the traditional step by step recipe approach while declarative is more this is what i want now you work out how to do it

or if you are like me and prefer imperative validation logic rather than declarative simply use fluentvalidation.net which makes this validation scenario pretty trivial

also one benefit of declarative programming is that purpose is usually more easily understood from reading the code whereas imperative gives you finer control over execution

declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code

it sounds from this that it would be much easier to use declarative styles all the time but there s usually a steep learning curve for declarative languages and most people prefer imperative

using declarative effects is better than thunks for testability but the saga pattern can be implemented on top of imperative or declarative code

are there any studies on whether functional declarative or imperative programming is easier to learn as a first language

there is a big discussing between object-oriented and procedural approaches and more generally between declarative and imperative ones and each approach has its upsides and downsides

angular is built around the belief that declarative code is better than imperative when it comes to building uis and wiring software components together.

i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

if xml json and xaml have teached us anything it s that declarative languages are much better suited to create object graphs than imperative ones

angular tends to favor declarative manipulation of the dom rather than a imperative one at least that s the way i ve been playing with it

i choose declarative query approach over imperative cursors and counters

while neither the declarative nor imperative approach is really better than the other both have their merits

declarative sql is usually simpler and faster than imperative pl sql so it s usually best to do most of the work in sql and just glue it together with pl sql

i ve been teaching myself a bit about declarative vs imperative programming and i ve come to the possibly false understanding that declarative programming is more or less just abstraction

imperative run-time code trumps declarative settings

we can state that hive is declarative and sit on higher level of abstraction then imperative pig

further i d recommend to prefer declarative bindings to imperative assignments in handlers

this is just a matter of style but i prefer declarative style for fully declarative code and imperative style when there are side-effects involved

what i have understood is that declarative let you do whatever you want as long as the result passes and imperative is more verbose

now my question is if there s any circumstances that if we use declarative too much it will confuse the developer who read the code and switching back to imperative is a better solution

traditionally there was a huge difference in speed imperative has fewer overheads because it s more directly like the computer works but some more modern compilers of declarative code seem to be in the top few of the speed tables a lot of the time - compiled verses interpreted makes a much bigger difference than imperative vs declarative which is why python etc are often slower even though they re imperative

you should prefer declarative programming over the imperative programming

as a coder sql is my weakest link since i am far more comfortable with imperative languages than declarative ones - but i want to change that

what s bad about this is that when microsoft were designing asp.net mvc they opted for declarative validation logic using data annotations instead of imperative which is much better suited to validation scenarios and can handle just anything

i know that declarative way is cleaner but sometimes imperative programming makes your business safer


glfw	lwjgl	1
so glfw is just a library for creating windows in a better way than lwjgl did before


srp	ocp	1
if they are internal then it s debatable whether it violates ocp or not but the violation of srp is even worse anyway


i2c	spi	12
first bit banging i2c is way more complicated than bit banging spi

on top of that the i2c bus is slower than spi because there are control data exchanged

i know i2c is more complex slow than spi uart etc. but it s a constrain

might be better off with i2c or spi like people have suggested here

post explaining why spi is faster than i2c

i have done some research about them and it seems to be that spi is faster than i2c but the last one ensures more control and error detection over the first one

so which protocal should i pick i2c spi rs232 rs485 which one sould i choose

how is spi better than i2c at these temperatures

i wanted to know that what makes spi faster than i2c

communication via i2c is more complex that with uart or spi solution

spi or i2c might have better error correction than your customer serial protocol

spi is not less limited than i2c in this case


documentfilter	jtextcomponent	1
for listening changes into jtextcomponent is there documentlistener if you have to need control over inputed char sings whitespace chars or word s you have to implements documentfilter


quaqua	substance	1
comparative to other themes of swing sysnthetica substance etc. quaqua theme takes more memory


subtraction	add	7
since addition can be faster then subtraction we add the offset instead of subtract it from 31

my issue is it only displays addition if i select add but if i selects minus it doesn t display subtraction

addition subtraction assignment has lower procedure than simply add operation

if i select add from the combo box my jtext field should display the word addition and if i select minus from the combo box the jtext field should display the word subtraction

the next problem is a compare is a subtract subtract and add go through the same alu and take the same time as addition so for most platforms old and new trading compares subtraction for addition wont save you anything you end up looking at the branch cost pipeline flush etc

addition and subtraction is worse as these have to be done in sequence of two operations and the second operation requires the first to have completed - this is not the case if the compiler is just producing two add operations on independent data

and my question is this if the book says that the addition and subtraction have lower priority compared to other operators what if i add the value of a typical expression multiplied


matplotlib	scipy	3
the scipy numpy matplotlib clan is much better at dealing with huge amounts of volume data than matlab or at least gnu octave in my experience

another even simpler option than canopy and anaconda is just to download spyder s dmg which comes with the latest versions of numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sympy and the sci-kits

matplotlib and scipy have many more tools available


associativity	logical-or	1
i looked it up and the logical-or operator has a higher precedence than the conditional operator and the conditional operator has right-to-left associativity


factories	presenter	3
more specifically - use an objectcontainerdatasource from the web client software factories to make it easier to bridge between the current ui and a set of new presenter classes

a presenter is better to accept some kind of a view factories or a supplier in general as we can already hold an existing view especially in a gwt case and let the presenter decide when instantiate or accept the view

which is basically the same thing as the factories then depend on sub-factories but at least they are lighter than presenter views services and they don t need to load the sub-factories until they are needed


ilist	iqueryable	2
if you return collections or instance and if you choose ienumerable iqueryable ilist list or whatever depends on your needs

generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course


crossfilter	reductio	1
i think reductio will make this easier but with raw crossfilter this would look something like


icmp	tcp	2
ping is just low level icmp protocol defined in internet layer whereas tcp is more complex protocol defined in transport layer

while you can t compare icmp request latency to tcp yes the added overhead is simply horrible and can be worked around with so fear not


comm	grep	3
i find grep to be more admin-friendly than comm so if you just want the set of matching lines useful for comparing csvs for instance simply use

if this is an issue you could try sd stream diff which doesn t require sorting like comm does nor process substitution like the above examples is orders or magnitude faster than grep -f and supports infinite streams

i rather prefer grep since it s much faster than comm and also does not require the input to be sorted


roboguice	robolectric	1
you cannot use mocks in conjunction with roboguice it s better to let robolectric provide the context you need here


pivot-table	crosstab	2
use crosstab for the pivot-table to make that faster yet

although such reports are better manageable as crosstab pivot-table


fuzzy	stemming	1
stemming gives better performance than fuzzy search because it is done when indexing and the actual search can be performed as exact match


fancybox	colorbox	2
plugins such as fancybox and colorbox jquery offers much more flexibility

i ve had to replace lyebox with colorbox which is much faster and seemingly has less problems conflicting with other scripts lightbox fancybox and others wouldn t work for me


qstring	qmap	1
more than a qmap of qstring to


google-api-python-client	oauth2client	2
based on the output in this example one conflict is that datalab currently has oauth2client version 1.4.12 installed and the google-api-python-client library requires a version of oauth2client that is greater than or equal to 2.0.0

there s a known bug that when you install the googleads library using pip it will install a newer version of the oauth2client library which will break my google analytics api scripts because the google-api-python-client uses an older version of oauth2client


octal	binary	7
hex and octal are just shorter ways to write binary

because hexadecimal and rarely octal literals are more compact and people using them usually can convert between hexadecimal and binary faster than deciphering a binary number

the conversion between binary and either octal or hex is even easier than decimal

that number cannot be larger than binary 111 which is equal to 7 in both decimal and octal

when converting from binary to octal it s more easy each 3 bits give you 1 digit in octal

with a little practice hex or octal are easier for a human than binary

you ll need to convert binary to another base here i use decimal when writing this code because c doesn t have binary constants which would be ten times more useful than octal constants


stopwatch	dispatchertimer	1
i am trying to move away from dispatchertimer to stopwatch to get a more constant speed of the game as dispatchertimer skips turns if there are too many objects in the game


pylons	cherrypy	1
however i think that pylons and cherrypy may be a better answer to your question


jdom	xerces	2
it compares jdom dom4j exml xpp crimson and xerces

other alternatives such as xerces xmlserializer or jdom xmloutputter are more direct methods less code but they are framework-specific


watson	alchemyapi	1
4 you can use other service from ibm watson for it but i recommend alchemyapi or discovery depends on what you are really going to do


gedit	sublimetext	1
i have tried with sublimetext 2 and it work very very good better than gedit p


toolbar	docking	1
however dockpaneleftof does not seem to work in this case so you lose docking toolbar next to each other


email-ext	jenkins	1
you could also use a jenkins plugin email-ext to perform more advanced tasks


qlabel	qtextbrowser	1
i m trying to force the qlabel qpushbutton and qtableview marked by trailing underscores in their names be two times higher than qtextbrowser having below


division	logarithm	1
the reason to go with logarithm instead of repeated division is performance while log is slower than division it is slower by a small fixed multiple


implements	modifiers	1
why the access modifiers for the getter setter is more restrictive has in my opinion something to do with easier implements interfaces which always have implicitly public properties


qdockwidget	qwidget	1
the center widget is a qdockwidget containing a qwidget with a qvboxlayout containing more stuff


qstring	qbytearray	1
i have to convert the qstring of the file s contents to qbytearray in order to compare them or vice versa and comparing bytes seems like the cleanest method however when converted from qstring to qbytearray the size of the new qbytearray is smaller than what it should be


lsp	principles	2
you didn t misunderstand lsp allowing a bigger type in a subclassed method doesn t violate the principles

the ol principles open closed and lsp are more oriented towards languages based upon inheritance as a core software engineering concept


tftp	tcp	1
you are right that using tcp is probably better to use for something like this or even an existing protocol like tftp


popupwindow	dialog	2
every time i want to show popupwindow in front of dialog fragment the dialog is in front of the popup.i assume that dialog have higher priority in view tree.is there any option to bring my popupwindow to the front or send dialog to back.bringtofront is not working when it s called on view detailslayout

i give up using popupwindow and use dialog instead after some tests i found dialog is far better than popupwindow there are quite a few problems with popupwindow


microchip	avr	2
as far as easy goes they are both equivalent in terms of difficulty both provide assembly and c except that the gnu toolchain for avr is more complex than microchip because it requires use of unix command line etc

microchip is more successful in industry and has better tools than avr


persian	farsi	2
in persian it s better to say farsi a decimal number like 32.98 is written 32 98 slash is used instead of point

or how i can compare persian farsi or arabic string in java eclips


hide	show	241
select project - target - select hide or show utilities- identity and type- name and put your name here.press enter

would it make more sense to style both header and display the main header by default and then use javascript to hide the main header and show the hidden smaller header when the user scrolls

when you select fields under show in view in settings you can check hide empty fields option

since we are dealing with images and changing them on change of select i would prefer changing the src of image rather than using show hide method.it is more simpler

while widget logic can help you do much more than hide or show a widget to logged in logged out users

not show from start is better than show and then hide

but i would prefer show hide or maybe just toggle

now what i want to achieve is like if the expandablelistview or the gridview items are more than what fits in the screen then on scrolling up on the listview or gridview the toolbar should hide and show if scrolled down the toolbar should visible

select show or hide based on expression and give the expression as

it doesn t show at all if hide is called less than 0.5s after show and it show for at least 0.5s this prevents very fast flickering stuff that you might see with naive implementations

purpose of having individual svg for each bullet chart is to make their management show hide remove easier

i was wondering if creating the icons prior to the click and using show hide would be faster

my thought is javascript show hide option is better for usability and the customers journey especially on mobiles

if i delete the #tabber hide line win show a sensible number for the height of the iframe

here tab-1 has two fields.the second tab of this must be enable only after the completion of the validation of first tab.we can select show hide using the checkbox but will not activated.how can i do this

simply call .slideup to hide element and .sidedown to show element read more on the jquery effect

this allows me to show or hide or do more complex operation with what s on each tab simply by calling the array of shapes

so if it s greater than 0 show the button otherwise hide it

i have 4 radio that if you select show hide the div containing 4 registration forms

more importantly i think show and hide will be simpler and the fight against complexity is paramount

my approach is to loop over each item and then apply filters to the item if the item is a match show item else hide

but i don t know how to align the imageview and the textview to be easier to hide show just the imageview when needed

using show and hide should prove more robust and simpler too

i think having each permutation in their own container that you hide show is the better solution

it displays things normally on the screen of course but when you go to print preview in ie7 the only thing that show is longer description. so in other words it hide that first column and it also hide the second column

but you can just select hide when stopped and your activity will be hidden if not animating and show up otherwise

right click on a year and choose show hide fields

show less will be hide and load more button will be show .thanks

set show read more to hide

if you want to show hide i would recommend using fadein .fadeout

as described the old event pageinit is still well fired but not the new events init destroy show and hide

this code does more than just show or hide fabs on scroll it actually handles a pretty perfect action bar disappears on scrolling effect

what is the best way so that only the item that i select hide short title and show the long title

electron should be a drop in replacement for nwjs node-webkit and offers more flexibility over when to show and hide windows

also as mentioned elsewhere show is a better option to css visibility as hide sets display none and not visibility

product variations must be hide and show on clicking the button just like this site please width and height to get that more option button

hide the custom select show the native one

term hide is more appropriate for run-time dynamic show hide

select show or hide based on an expression

since it is possible to show hide asp html elements without using javascript in asp.net is it possible to extend that capability so that the show hide will look cooler with scroll or shrinking animation

or more ideally you might want to change show hide to jquery fadein fadeout which is more appropriate for back to top indicators

in linux it is a hide folder and you have to choose show hide files

select your main.storyboard - click hide document outline - choose your uiviewcontroller - select navigation item - select show the attributes inspector - back button textfield with one space

just right-click at table - select show hide elements - select elements that must be hidden and click ok

if so then open group properties for last14days_ct go to visibility and for when the report is initially run select show or hide based on an expression. use the expression

ironically enough its object model show more details than it hide - good for learning but bad for abstraction

click on the visibility pane and select show or hide based on an expression radio button

3- from opened window select show or hide based on an expression radio button

select show or hide based on an expression and click the fx button

i m using the function window .resize to detect if the total width of all open windows plus some margin is greater than the window s width then hide the first chat window or show the last one if there s space for more windows

bonus choose show hide iterm2 with a system-wide hotkey and bind the key with bettertouchtool

making rows hide show can be trickier than divs or spans because of their quirky display properties tied to table structure

obviously for something like show hide functionality a checkbox makes more sense than a button

in the row visibility of the table select show or hide based on expression

go to tablix properties row visibility and select show or hide based on an expression

please ensure you select show or hide based on an expression

show hide gives the better results but the selected thumbnail remains the previous displayed panel.

by the way the code with show hide is also more readable

to hide show line numbers press ctrl + f10 and select show line numbers

any suggestions on how to manage the android actionbar in phonegap - i ve seen some other similar questions but generally asking how to show it seems like getting it to hide is less popular

and another note - if your data and as a consequence inner html changes frequently then it will be better to re-render it each time user request it but if it is almost static then hide show should be more effective

i want to implement a functionality on gmap api that if the zoom is more than 17 show all the markers otherwise just hide them

but for the record using detach and attach instead of hide and show would be slightly better memory-wise because those two methods allow for the view hierarchy of unused fragments to be destroyed

i prefer going by show and hide as it is easy and informative

on a side note if you re going to show hide stuff i d advise using .show and hide which are less expensive on the browser as it doesn t alter the dom nodes

for a simple image toggle you might have an easier time with a hide show style instead

as a note and for a shorter code using the css display none and jquery show milliseconds and hide milliseconds is quicker you can even animate it by using time like this

also keep in mind that calling show and hide directly is more expensive than callind .css display and .css display none

just using jquery show and hide will provide a more solid reliable result

or you can make some of the show and hide have a longer duration show 2000 for instance

i would recommend show hide option example

in my opinion using jquery show hide is a better solution at this point in time

select show or hide based on an epxression

i have done it with a show hide technique showing larger then hide showing smaller with fades

so in order to have certain .annual rows show instead of hide make a more specific css class to actually show it

if i choose the option show from dropdown list i need to display the tab s data if user selects hide from dropdown list the content inside the tab should not be displayed.please advice

also the show and hide functions are easier than animating the opacity

it means that i can click on the diagram background and select hide dependencies and then select show associations etc...i can also click on a class and see all related classes having dependencies associations etc...with this class

or it could use destroy rather than hide if testing show that it works better for your use-case

so you can easily select show hide any combination of tags like this

maybe that s only a matter of opinion but i would prefer hide and show function

since you want more of a show hide button i think a better experience is to have a checkbox that indicates what state you re going to set it to instead of relying on the first item

however i think i know where the problem is you shouldn t use a render attribute for the dialog it s javascript function show and hide are more than enough

select the column and on the column visibility option select show or hide based on an expression and select fx formula-expression button

since you want to allow the user to hide show the grid i recommend using hide

i am doing a news reader app and i want that user can choose show hide news categories such as top news business technology sports etc and reorder them like bbc news app in android

i have searched for a solution but most expand collapse scripts completley hide the layer whilst others show an expand show more link but do not toggle to show a collapse show less link

i want when i select the show option a text field should be appear in the form and if i select hide option the text field should be disappear hided

use hide and show will be better for you

on the other hand show hide is more reliable

calls to sizethatfits abound and attempts at drawer-like hide show animation look even more broken as the 44 pt ghost size wins out dorking everything up

note the show hide effect is much softer because of the commented fadein fadeout declarations that were triggering console errors probably because jsfiddle uses jquery slim now

i want to make the options of select show or hide by program js is it possible

better than hide and show

if you intend to do more than show hide


uiviewcontroller	uiwindow	1
if more than one uiviewcontroller hangs off the applicationâ s uiwindow only one of these will get the messages for changes in orientation


fgets	strtok	3
however to make it more generalized i ll recommend using fgets to take the input then using strtok to tokenize the input and use

prefer fgets to read the input and parse the lines in your program using for example sscanf or strtok

rather than read a text file using fscanf strongly recommend using fgets and then parsing via sscanf strtok strtol etc


googletest	cunit	1
nowadays i d recommend using googletest instead of cunit


focuslistener	documentlistener	1
create the text field and register the documentlistener to it...although i d be wary about using a documentlistener personally maybe a actionlistener and or focuslistener might be more suitable but hay


memcpy	calloc	1
can be that the memory operations calloc memcpy is slower in one system


gdi	direct2d	9
i ve read that direct2d is much faster than gdi so i figured i would give it a shot for dealing with constantly updated variables

disable antialiasing and the performance of direct2d will be on par or faster than gdi

i suspect that they re bypassing gdi and using something more direct like the new directwrite and or direct2d apis

but my direct2d code is much slower than my gdi code

i recommend direct2d and directwrite as you get high-quality rendering that s also ridiculously fast compared to either gdi or anything done in the .net space

threads in direct2d is more granular than in gdi and gdi+ so that the

a i tried gdi-compatible direct2d using id2d1dcrendertarget+binddc but it is much slower than pure gdi

a direct2d is slower than gdi

the thing is that gdi is still faster than direct2d if i draw to a bitmap and after it s done i bitblt the result back to the form it paints at 35ms and with the same graphics quality


skip-lists	queue	2
the most simple would be an array but a double-ended queue or an indexed skip-lists b tree could be better depending on the data size we are talking about

your use cases are actually much easier than the skip-lists algorithmically because you avoid most needs for varlength paths by keeping the tail to queue cards to the end directly


curb	libcurl	2
that s much easier with a libcurl wrapper like curb like the tin man suggested than dropping to the shell and using libcurl there

instead of using wget and then trying to parse the headers after the fact i d recommend using curb which relies on libcurl


getchar	getline	1
getline is probably better than getchar in most cases


tabcontrol	tabitem	5
for example if i click the smaller tabitem the tabcontrol becomes smaller and if i select the bigger one it becomes bigger

edit i can only reproduce this error when i have a tabcontrol with more than one tabitem

hi there i have define more than one tabitem in my tabcontrol

i ran into the same visual issue with closable tabs and resolved it by extending both the tabcontrol to be used later in xaml and tabitem classes

it s almost like the tabcontrol doesnt know to treat the different views as tabitem its behaving more like a stack panel stacking the views


fastcgi	scgi	2
nginx - does not start applications at all however for fastcgi currently not the best for comet streaming because of buffering so scgi would be better with nginx assuming you are using latest nginx version

you can also use scgi it is a lot simpler than fastcgi


bmp	pgm	1
i used ppm pgm files as they are simpler to write and more portable than bmp


cefsharp	cefglue	1
however integrating cefglue into your winforms or wpf app may be more difficult than cefsharp


shim	polyfills	1
you have have to shim polyfills function#bind on older browsers like ie8 search for es5 shim for options


ubuntu	centos	18
in this respect ubuntu is less desirable on a server than rhel or centos which stick to more mature versions

on centos dnf install zint ubuntu takes more work

i don t know if it s activated by default on centos but it might be considering it is on ubuntu which is less entreprise oriented

usually i prefer using linux centos ubuntu for production server

is there anything obvious in ubuntu that would otherwise be making sfphpview- render run slower than centos

centos by its nature is quite a conservative distro - so if you are after the latest codecs media support then fedora or ubuntu may be better options

newer rhel centos have newer compilers but i d actually recommend ubuntu s lts versions

if you don t have a favorite distro i would recommend trying ubuntu centos as they tend to be quite friendly to the beginner and have extremely robust community support

debian ubuntu and centos these are less of the lightweight base images each coming in around 50m give or take

you just need very basic functions mostly the standard toolchain. you could pick centos ubuntu fedora debian whatever

also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long

i would however argue that ubuntu or centos is a better option when it comes to server installations

centos is more consistent and reliable because it is enterprise while ubuntu is geared towards desktops and personal computers

one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it

people tell me i should choose between centos ubuntu or debian

this is because your ubuntu system has newer system libraries than your centos one

i believe that ubuntu is better than centos when it comes to mono as it is much easier to setup and seems to be better supported

you can use alpine linux docker image it is very light and is better than both ubuntu and centos image to be used as the docker


division	modulo	44
the division and modulo should run in shorter and more consistent time than the loop on any machine that has hardware division which many do

additionally with the base being a power of 2 the modulo and division operations are much faster than with your base-10 approach

the bitwise operators are generally faster than modulo and division operators

performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

implementing multiplication and division might be more costly than you would like but at least addition is easy modulo protecting against over underflow and you claim to not need any operations so even better

i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations

python respects this definition whereas in most other programming language the modulo is really more like a reaminder after division operator

bitwise and will beat modulo division every day of the week

a modulo is effectively an integer division instruction which typically has a latency which is an order of magnitude greater than that of compare subtract

you can use division and modulo to do it easier

multiplication division and modulo have the same precedence and they all have higher precedence than addition and subtraction

modulo gives you a remainder which is why it s better than straight division in situations where you re number of elements can change

then you can process any length number using very few division remainder modulo operations which is important because they are much slower than addition

note parentheses are redundant as division and multiplication have the same priority and modulo has higher precedence over addition

in those cases the modulo will be negative and the result of integer division will be one more than you want

it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition

if you compute modulo a power of two using bitwise and is simpler and generally faster than performing division

so in simple terms this should give you a feel for why division and hence modulo is slower computers still have to do long division in the same stepwise fashion tha you did in grade school

note that the modulo division may be much more expensive than the branching anyhow but this depends on your architecture

division and a table lookup versus a square root on your machine using this modulo might be faster

if anyone wants to explain how the division and modulo have been converted feel free.

a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo

if so this should work and it should also be a lot quicker than using modulo and division

using an extra variable to avoid the costly division and the resulting time was 18.9s so significantly better than the modulo with a statically known constant

in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower

integer multiplication division and modulo are much slower than integer addition and subtraction

bit operations are usually faster than division or modulo calculations

programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because it s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a modulo is much harder it s about as hard as doing a division

inverse modulo for 300 time take 1.422 seconde more than executing division sub and multiplication 10k time even the core of inverse modulo is build with same division and sub and multiplication functions and for this number it just do 150 time inside while help plz why

edit if you want to be clever about it you can even use loops division and modulo to separate higher numbers into their places values

it appears that you consider modulo to have lower precedence than multiplication and division when in fact it does not

division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition

since bit wise operations can be done very fast and division operations are relatively slow this type of modulo is much faster than doing a division

taking the remainder of the division by 256 through the modulo effectively extracts the lower byte since the result will be 256 by definition

modulo is a bit weird for floating point - it returns negative for negative so you still have to have a branch and it involves a division which is slower on some machines as in i ve not found a machine where is significantly less expensive than going round a loop with a couple of subtractions two or three times

for example on most 32 bit systems 64-bit addition is faster than 32-bit division modulo

is a leftover after the division which corresponds to result of the modulo

is the same as because division has higher priority than modulo

the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access

the first condition is if the modulo of the number and division is larger than 2 then return false

for instance if the high word is less than the modulo then it is safe to perform the division like this

if however you do need something quicker than division and modulo then bitwise operations come to help

i believe doing this division modulo would be faster but i cannot implement it in linked list

modulo is more mathematical if you like while the remainder in the c-family is consistent with the common integer division satisfying and this is adopted from old fortran


nuxeo	documentum	1
nuxeo is based on open source but you have to pay the license and is pretty expensive at this point documentum is better anyway


qobject	qscopedpointer	1
mind that qscopedpointer or std unique_ptr will always work deterministic but qobject destroyed signal doing deferred release via qobject deletelater is more prone to surprises starting from when exactly the object gets released


telerik	obout	1
this is the first time i was working with obout controls.previously i was working with telerik controls and so i had a good chance of comparing these two set of controls.i would prefer obout for its light weight and functionality


tokudb	myisam	4
tokudb blows innodb and myisam out of the waters in specific situations but is not a general replacement db engine for everything under the sky

at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam

myisam beats innodb and tokudb on full table scans since it is basically just sequentially scanning a file

from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb


junit	testng	45
groups are supported by testng and junit i would prefer testng because its more flexible

i have read some comparisons of junit and testng and it looks like testng has more configuration options

firstly i am not sure how to properly use multi-thread with junit last time i tried i had no success anyway i have had better results with testng

or asked the other way around are there any good reasons to prefer junit over testng

it compares junit 4 and testng

isn t testng supposed to a better than junit

junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex

testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example

powermockito might integrate a little easier with testng but i have never used it with junit

we are trying to choose between junit and testng for our test framework with selenium 2 webdriver

twip for parameterized testing the junit stuff isn t the greatest in fact testng does this better as well -

if you are familiar of using junit it is easier to switch into testng

you can run them in parallel using testng or junit i need more information about how are you running them

i actually picked junit over testng for android testing i thought it was more lightweight than testng for on-device testing

if you re doing non-unit testing testng might be a better option than junit

if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit

i would recommend testng instead of junit as it will easily allow you to run tests in parallel in any number of threads

for example i use java hence i could make use of either junit or testng i prefer testng now testng lets me create suite decide what is a test what should not be executed during test run test reporting and much more

in case if you have flexibility to choose another testing framework you can try with testng which has bigger feature set than junit

i prefer testng over junit

if you want only simple unit testing imo go with junit if you require a more robust test framework to meet your unit integration performance automation testing then i would very much recommend testng

also for integartion testing i have found testng to be much easier to use that junit because it has features that make writing integration tests easier

testng offers you more options and possibilites how to run your tests and in which order especially something junit can t

you may want to use junit in the part of unit testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework

with respect to which unit testing framework to use junit or testng both are good frameworks to perform the basis in my case i prefer junit but other collegues prefer testng

simply choose junit or testng framework and use a whole list of tools that these frameworks provide for you

my suggestion would be to try to use a testing framework testng or junit which gives many more features than just parametrization

personally i would recommend testng although if you re just starting junit is slightly less of a learning curve

but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take

testng has more capabilities and can be helpful with integration tests junit is more focused on unit tests

testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though

in our approach our test framework extends the standard test case class junit in our case but testng seems more capable that sets up and tears down the various database dependecies with each test using the following steps

i know this can be achieved with junit but in my experience it is easier with testng

not sure if it ll work any better than junit but there is testng

go with junit params or testng which offer much more convenient solution

here is what it would look like with testng it s a little more contrived with junit since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions

edit it seems junit has more printed books as references compared to testng on amazon

will testng run my older tests written in junit

i ve used both and found that for unit testing only junit works very well but in terms of system testing i would recommend testng

to be perfectly honest i junit is way more popular than testng at least here where i work and live

yes with testng you have way more power over those local variables that you did with junit and the dataprovider handles your threading per test-class-instance

testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

if there is a junit extension or similar framework that provides a better solution than testng then please let me know

testing with scalatest+scalacheck is much much better than junit testng

third i d recommend using junit 4.4 or better yet the testng idiom - annotations

since you tagged this with python you might find rdflib more useful than jena but the real question here should be about how to do the conversion not the library request since library requests are off topic for stack overflow

goto	break	21
the bad we use a break that is little more than a tamed goto something like goto the end of the loop

nevertheless in my opinion break is not much better than goto its both not a good programming style

branching around whether it is with goto or break just makes it harder

but break is no better or worse than goto

the idea of saying break out of the nth nested loop is worse than a goto from a structural perspective

in the previous example break is better than goto

continue and break are nothing more than a pleasant syntax for a goto

basically continue and break are better but often just disguised goto statements.

in particular note the mention of break and continue which aren t as flexible as goto but are more flexible in bash than in some languages and may help you achieve what you want

there are pundits who don t like break continue and the like but at some point there is a tradeoff to make between rules of thumb and readability and a well-chosen break continue or even goto may become more readable than politically correct code

a much simpler way of inspecting the code in msvc is to simply set a break point and inspect the disassembly right click on the line and select goto disassembly from the pop-up menu

there s not really a graceful way to break out of for l although it is much faster than a goto loop

those break statements are being used in the same way that goto is used in older languages

but actually break has more resemblance to return both instructions jump out of a block of code which is pretty much structured in comparison to goto

if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks

labeled break like in java would be better than goto for this purpose

in the cleanup even in normal case scenario i would regard the use of goto as being clearer than the do while 0 constructs among other things because the target labels themselves practically cry out look at me far moreso than the break and do while 0 constructs

but goto is better than break when you have nested loops like that

it is the equivalent of a goto but is more restrictive in that labels may be used only in break or continue statements

using break and goto can make it more difficult to reason about the correctness of a program

to any seasoned developer of a c-like language break will both read better as well as provide a cleaner solution than goto


redmine	chiliproject	1

textarea	autogrow	1
i am trying to stop a textarea with autogrow.js from growing after 300px height and then destroying autogrow textarea so that it has scrollbar although the code i have used to do this is working fine i can stop the textarea from growing after 300px but when that happens the textarea becomes smaller than 300px suddenly


mouseup	mousedown	31
more over it is better to track buttons on event itself see this question for more details as mouseup mousedown event might be triggered outside of the page effectively getting you cached state out of sync

edit rereading that page it d been a while it looks like mousedown and mouseup are even more reliable than contextmenu although all major browsers trigger contextmenu

as you ve already done you can set a date on mousedown and do stuff until mouseup then do something more based on how long the button was held down for hopefully the following is self explanatory

i recommend using mousedown event instead of mouseup event

mousedown mouseup is indeed the only way you can get notified of middle button interaction so detecting a down-then-up event without intervening mouseout event is more or less the best you can do

actually i want to move it to the top while dragging and move it back afterwards but this problem can be illustrated in a simpler way with just mouseup and mousedown

you should also handle mousedown and mouseup and create 1 more image to show the depressed or down state

if distance of x movement and y movement is less than 10 and difference between mousedown and mouseup is greater that 300 user is about to initiate click event or continue with drag-drop event

value for right mouse button is 2 although also note that it recommends using mousedown or mouseup events rather than click

if you to bind events and use the benefits of a normalized event system you ll use the first version for regular blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error or your custom events

if you want to cover most events pass in blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error as the first argument

the available events are blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

logic to handle enter + mouse click is placed on keydown and mousedown it could be moved to keyup and mouseup if makes more sense

this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout

bind works with almost every event you need possible event values blur focus load resize scroll unload beforeunload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

based on this answer here s how you can simulate a double click using mousedown mouseup mouseup is probably better since click is fired after the user lifts their mouse and not when they first press it

the jquery documentation says the library has built-in support for the following events blur focus load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup and error

i don t think that this kind of javascript library exist you could easily build one with jquery just listen to all the event blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

when testing both cases it seems that mouseup events are slower and less reliable sometimes the button press is missed or the screen hangs slightly before responding than mousedown

first off consider whether you really want to override mousedown or whether overriding mouseup might be a better option

how can i change the handler so it only fires when the distance of mousemove between mousedown and mouseup is less than a fixed value

something like if mousedown position is more than 10px away from mouseup position

is there any reason mousedown should be inherently faster better than mouseup

i tried changing the event but sagepay overrides all these events blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error contextmenu

note for maximum accessibility content authors are encouraged to use the click event type when defining activation behavior for custom controls rather than other pointing-device event types such as mousedown or mouseup which are more device-specific

from the new modal dialog box select mousedown or mouseup as message type and click add and edit

you ll probably want to add an addition check that the time between the mousedown and mouseup is less than 500 milliseconds say and that the mouse hasn t moved more than a pixel or two between the events

by splitting mousedown and mouseup there is less runtime parsing no checking events less code per run of each etc

val css html text data width height offset blur focus focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave change select submit keydown keypress keyup error

the mousedown i prefer mouseup for showing a context menu event has a mouseeventargs parameter a property of which is the location where the mouse was clicked


debian	centos	7
i am more acquainted with debian than centos and i know the libraries i need are

he says he uses debian and is less familiar with centos and so i am posting here

debian ubuntu and centos these are less of the lightweight base images each coming in around 50m give or take

you just need very basic functions mostly the standard toolchain. you could pick centos ubuntu fedora debian whatever

people tell me i should choose between centos ubuntu or debian

we recently have migrated redmine from a server which was running under centos 5.5 with the same ror environment the same load the performance was a way better than on debian 7

note that centos software versions are older than debian s but versions of opensuse software are newer than debian s versions


valgrind	gprof	2
so i can use neither gprof which isn t available on android valgrind which requires an older version of the ndk than what i m using nor the android-ndk-profiler which is for dynamic libraries loaded by android activities either java or native not plain executables

another important difference is that valgrind can report a lot more information than gprof does but that s not specifically related to using it


gridview	repeater	20
i prefer gridview nested in repeater

the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list

the repeater will allow more control over what is rendered instead of rendering a tabular output as in the case of gridview

not necessarily better than the repeater suggestion but another option is to use a gridview control and a datatable data structure

that makes all just more difficult without a benefit in this case even if a nested repeater or gridview would be easier

edit using a gridview might be easier then a table since you only need to bind in the itemdatabound the dataset to the gridview in the repeater

i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control

using repeater contorl over gridview will give you more control over formating your output

for lists i d put hidden fields inside whatever list mechanic you prefer gridview repeater manually building tables yuk

repeater has fewer templates then gridview

in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview

maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it

instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater

alternatively use a gridview though i find that repeater gives you more control over the emitted markup

however there is a grid here that compares listview gridview datalist and the repeater you may find helpful

each button raises the correct event but the events never reach the gridview because they are handled at a lower level by the repeater

in my understanding repeater is most suitable since it faster than gridview

a repeater might be a better decision than a gridview as they are friendlier for using custom layouts

it sounds like a repeater or gridview might be better suited to your needs

the repeater is still faster than the gridview but the difference shouldn t be big if you code it right


google-chrome	safari	210
whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it

because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details

on these devices he has different browsers so we have to distinct os x safari os x google-chrome os x firefox win safari win google-chrome win firefox etc

if i try to do a google search for website loading slower in google-chrome than in safari i get a lot of results about how safari is slower than google-chrome

i ve tested this on mac win google-chrome firefox safari android devices iphone4 5 and ipad ios6

firefox for example has a lot in common with google-chrome and safari and google-chrome and safari are even more so closely related

how can i modify the css to have safari match google-chrome s rendering behaviour

basically the way google-chrome renders text looks ugly and i want it to look like or almost like firefox or safari which looks thinner and better

headers copied from google-chrome only since safari is harder to copy paste from

this works as expected in safari though matches google-chrome

the center align property must be cascading from some other element because it s not only safari google-chrome which also uses webkit but also opera that shows the things center aligned and both safari google-chrome and opera are more standards compliant than ie and even firefox

google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis

the one used by google-chrome and is slower than mobile safari s nitro javascript engine

it s way faster on ie but other major browsers firefox google-chrome safari and opera perform better when using a container and then appending it fragment or div

total width of button in safari web inspector 6px larger than in google-chrome web inspector

now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari

according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome

the console for safari and google-chrome imo is better

it displays ok in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it has more space between the text and the bottom border than between the text and the top border

i read somewhere that safari has more stringent requirements on cross domain scripting - it and google-chrome share the same code base

i tried to use jquery and the scroll event it s working on google-chrome but not on safari and is definitely less smooth than on the example

ie9 win google-chrome win opera win safari win safari mac

if you choose safari or google-chrome you donâ t need to install gears.

in safari and google-chrome it is better but still has visible juddering

safari comes in at just under 41ms performing better than google-chrome but still not great

i did one design which works for opera win firefox win + mac ie9 safari win mac ipad google-chrome win

i have this working fine in google-chrome osx win firefox osx win safari opera osx

i guess google-chrome and safari are more forgiving

okay safari ios is more strict than google-chrome android when it comes to this all fine but it still needs to enable me to allow the connection through

usually you want to avoid solutions from browser-vendor as they ll cater toward that specific browser but opera webkit google-chrome safari firefox devs are usually more knowledgeable in terms of cross-browser solutions and compliance with the standards than m ones

it appears that google-chrome can handle more values at the moment but safari can t

safari will display fonts without a specified size significantly smaller than in google-chrome

also osx safari google-chrome ios and win google-chrome

safari makes child block s height larger than google-chrome

it defaults to safari on my machine but i d like it to use google-chrome as the development tools in google-chrome are better

webkit browsers such as google-chrome or safari are much more up to speed in that regard

the safari controller bar is the quicktime bar which is smaller and dark so the movement is less noticeable than google-chrome which has a big blue progress bar

i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js

in google-chrome 43+ pouchdb stores blobs directly to indexeddb as-is so it s probably the best experience you re going to see performance-wise safari and old google-chrome are slower

fwiw i was able to solve my problem with greensock using tweenmax to animate individual paths inside and this worked in firefox gecko and webkit browsers safari google-chrome it does a better job of calculating the origin not exactly sure how but it worked for me

apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle

it is slower than os-x and safari but tolerable and you may have some issues when google-chrome s developer tools don t quite match safari but it s much better than nothing

from testing this in google-chrome and safari it seems google-chrome is more forgiving in that it parses the style string and puts the right style in place for you but safari does not

the points of data in firefox and safari are much smoother in google-chrome they don t go past the dots

i am using franklin gothic font for website and font looks good on google-chrome and safari but on internet explorer and mozilla firefox it looks darker

firefox google-chrome opera and safari all handle it better

for example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari takes 5+ seconds firefox takes less than 1 second

i m having a problem styling a select box with google-chrome and safari on firefox works fine

compare safari or google-chrome and firefox click the tabs

conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome

let s say you wanted a table border-radius of 50 on google-chrome and safari but firefox is adding more padding by default so you d like to tone it down for that browser alone to 45

works in at least ie7 and later firefox 4.0 and later safari 4.0 and later win google-chrome 14.0 and later

this isn t entirely scientific but if i set .browser.safari false in safari or google-chrome then .scrollto no longer works on any element with any parameters

safari and google-chrome are even worse as they capitalize the s and the first letter of the css generated content 3 day s 5 hour s etc...

as you can see here a friend of mine did some testing and it seems that google-chrome and ie work a lot faster with the dot syntax while firefox and safari are more keen on the key syntax

i found out that with any opacity not text color alpha less than 1.0 google-chrome gave me good results but safari was still bad.

with google-chrome safari it s less so

use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari

images on google-chrome are much larger using the exact size of the image itself while safari respects width 140 height 140 settings

but do keep in mind you re optimizing for a particular js engine when you re doing that v8-optimized code might generate cleaner memory in google-chrome and safari but for all you know ie might make a complete hash of things or some of the tricks you ve used cause firefox to slow down more than a fairly large array would have done in the first place

google-chrome has more of the market than safari not and invitation for flame wars just a personal opinion without any weight -

ios google-chrome is more ios safari than google-chrome itself

i checked many sites and there were people complaining about it with no response or people talking that safari and google-chrome have better fps

latest google-chrome safari are even worse they hide both boxes behind the iframe

firefox google-chrome safari all have prioritized faster javascript execution in recent versions whereas ie may show performance in ie9 i hope they do myself. also realize this slideshow will run slow in mobile devices etc

since both safari and google-chrome run on webkit the browser.safari actually selects google-chrome as well..i definitely do not consider this an optimal solution

it does not work in google-chrome osx win safari osx ie

we have a list in particular that works on every other browser ie 7 8 firefox 3.0.13 linux and 3.5.7 win mac opera win google-chrome 4.0.249.30 linux and 4.0.249.78 win safari win and mac

well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml

also i find that web inspector in safari google-chrome is better

if you use the share button on the xcode documentation window to open the page in a web browser i had much better luck with safari than google-chrome 31 you can click on the mac ios developer library link in the top left corner of the webpage

the queue can contain any number of items but for google-chrome safari it is not more than 20

it is only slow with google-chrome browser safari is much faster

it also gets broken even more in ios google-chrome which is an older version of safari

it seems to work fine in google-chrome but in safari it causes some hover issues on links

after updating joomla to 3.8.1 today most of the admin tabbing and navigation functions stopped working in google-chrome firefox win safari and ie 11

the height of the blue bar in safari and google-chrome matches but in firefox it is smaller

i see this problem across the board on safari ie firefox and google-chrome -- so any of these would be fine to use though i prefer firefox because the problem seems to be most defined there

it worked perfectly with google-chrome but safari 5 and firefox implement a more recent version of the websocket protocol and cramp does not so i couldn t get it to work there

safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off

in fact one could theorize your approach of having it show up after the finger is released is better than what google-chrome and safari is doing

notably google-chrome and safari performed much faster for the javascript test but i don t include those here because those tests were recorded in a different environment

i m using dinnextltpro-medium font on this site and noticed quite a difference on the rendering between safari 6 google-chrome mac and the rest of the world safari 5 mac win google-chrome win firefox win opera win...

i think safari renders the moves better than google-chrome

in safari it renders significantly brighter than in firefox or google-chrome

browsers firefox win osx google-chrome win osx ie win safari osx ios opera osx

android is the same as google-chrome and ios matches safari

safari renders open sans bolder than in google-chrome so you would need to apply a lighter font weight for safari open sans google web fonts rendering in google-chrome

if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do

when i try the demo in google-chrome or safari it is indeed much faster but when i ve tested it in firefox it s consistently slower

pc google-chrome and safari are fine ie shows the links like in the picture firefox shows more revealed urls

in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera

in ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears closer to the bottom than in safari and google-chrome

google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers

on desktop browsers google-chrome win google-chrome osx safari osx the z-index of the logout popover works as expected - it s set to position relative

i have used some css hacks to get the position pixel perfect on firefox ie 7 8 9 and 10 win google-chrome opera and safari however on mac google-chrome and mac safari it is a few pixels out

webkit browsers google-chrome safari android stocked browser google-chrome for android ios safari with -webkit- prefix

fast clicking on ie has slower response than firefox google-chrome and safari

everything works fine for google-chrome 26 ie9 win safari 5.1 and opera 12 all of which detect the 5px setting

i had created the website www.suezre.com and when viewed in google-chrome or firefox figcaption on the pictures looks good but on safari it takes much more space

this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that

ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on

now google-chrome and safari have corrected thier behavior and then they changed spec nice move

safari is more secure than ie or google-chrome

now i recognized that safari make more problems then the other browsers like google-chrome or firefox

my problem is appearing in google-chrome windows not win firefox ubuntu firefox google-chrome mac firefox safari were the text height is being swashed

safari also seems to be more strict than what google-chrome did earlier

safari 5.1.10 6534.59.10 middle handles a smaller viewport but in sort order with a smaller viewport computes new image sizes even smaller than google-chrome

this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work

i already tested it and it doesn t match with opera google-chrome firefox or safari mobile

in ie java-script load slower than firefox safari and google-chrome

browsers devices desktop browsers ie8+ google-chrome firefox safari ipad s browser mobile safari mobile devices browsers android mobile safari

on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time

safari 5.1 still renders smoother than google-chrome but it is now clear that google has done much improvement

we recommend google-chrome however the latest versions of safari firefox and internet explorer work great too

dus anyone knows if there is something wrong with my json or if google-chrome is harder to get than safari

firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie

on mac with safari webpage get more then 600mb ram which is not happening on google-chrome for example but work on canvas feel same laggy on both browsers

it looks like while google-chrome and safari are trying to do the right thing with 0px firefox is sticking closer to the standard

fireofx google-chrome safari and opera has better css selectors support compare to ie

- check blue buttons in google-chrome and then compare with safari you can see exact difference in web inspector

it takes longer than google-chrome or safari to load but it does load successfully

works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller

seems to be mac google-chrome related problem works fine on win google-chrome mac safari mac firefox

in its basic form the three lines are way thinner than within safari or google-chrome

here is the website please compare it with google-chrome and safari

google-chrome is worse than safari

i have had issues with dynamically created nodes that use filters and animatemotion has been a bugged in google-chrome for way too long... we use ff5+ as our interactive interfaces for this reason safari is getting better too

open up the fiddle in both firefox google-chrome to see what i m talking about - in firefox the positioning of the background image is much lower than in google-chrome safari

so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit

in safari 10.0.3 cloneelement is 31 slower for the jsperf test mentioned above in google-chrome createelement is 17 slower for me

why would the mobile google-chrome browser be so less performant than ios safari browser and very similiar hardware

therefore code should be written and tested around firefox google-chrome safari which are much closer to proper standards support than ie8 then conditional tags should be used in ie to work around its bugs

the compatibility table link shows google-chrome firefox edge and safari are more compatible than babel now

i have also tested safari win google-chrome mac and safari win

it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox

i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome

firefox recognizes this attribute but webkit google-chrome safari etc don t more info on caniuse.com

how can i get mobile safari to handle hover events like the android version of google-chrome

my ipad 1 safari js benchmarked 38 times slower than google-chrome on my pc

all the webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome and opera should be closer in their rendering to each other than firefox or ie 9 separately

in general i would highly recommend using safari remote debugging and google-chrome remote debugging tools to debug your app while running on ios and android devices respectively

i am currently testing using various versions of firefox ie opera safari for win google-chrome on winxp and winvista

check the fiddle and make sure to use mac safari google-chrome or win google-chrome

right now i use a webview but i want to let the user choose between google-chrome safari or any other webbrowser currently on the device

for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10

after that ie slows down at exponential rate when firefox google-chrome and safari are doing much better

when the color of text is dark in safari and google-chrome i have better result with the text-stroke css property

safari is more funny than google-chrome i can easily make google-chrome cache my page but safari does not

i ve used this in ff2 ff3 ff3.5 safari 4 win opera 9+ google-chrome 2 google-chrome 3 and they all work

is it possible to adjust rendering of svg content on safari and google-chrome to resemble more firefox rendering

the only thing is that flexbox is not supported by older browser support by ie10+ google-chrome 20+ safari 3.1+ firefox 2+ read more about support so i probably would need to add the flexie polyfill to support this on older browser

it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security

one more thing google-chrome is css prefix free however safari may need -webkit prefix for some cutting edge features

according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7

alternatively you could seek out a user-agent parsing library which turns the string into something more useful such as google-chrome windows or safari iphone in which case you could reasonably use a shorter varchar value

i need to match safari browsers but not google-chrome browsers using one regex

i m noticing huge performance issues in google-chrome firefox and safari when adding more nested lists programmatically too many reflows maybe

the browser does not matter though safari gets way more consistently working results than google-chrome

fwiw every other browser i ve tried matches google-chrome s so safari 6 is the outlier here

all the applications are grayed out so i could not select safari or google-chrome to launch pdf

in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari

it s not even a webkit issue unless google-chrome s got a newer version than safari

in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox

its weird when i use source sans pro it looks bolder on google-chrome but when i switch to safari it looks thinner

1 - what is correct syntax for webkit primary for safari on ipad good if it works on win google-chrome to .addeventlistener to hashchange event

this jsfiddle demonstrates the problem compare safari google-chrome to firefox

usually it eventually just crashes and i have to kill safari or google-chrome from memory

so far i got it working in updated versions of safari mac google-chrome win firefox win and ie11

in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari

lastly a native app can in fact be a web browser like safari for example however i doubt you re building a web browser unless you re trying to compete with firefox google-chrome safari etc

i ve managed to duplicate these symptoms on only google-chrome win safari win and safari mac

secondly the browsers above ie7 and other browsers like firefox google-chrome and safari have a better rendering engine and intuitively handle buggy markup

in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has

all major desktop browsers win ie mac win safari mac win google-chrome win opera mac win firefox

what i saw was that ios and safari both got worse per-record write times the more records i tried to write while google-chrome kept pretty much the same per-record write time regardless of the number of records i tried to write

that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it

solved the problem came from css specificity.bootstrap s css was judged more specific by google-chrome regarding my menu s selector but not by firefox and safari

what i see is that google-chrome safari are more flexible when dealing with the specification allowing the local iri to reference an external document if it not exist in the current document

this happens in firefox and also in google-chrome cells shrink less in google-chrome but not in safari

with firefox google-chrome and safari it s less of an issue because those started auto-updating years ago and more than two years ago they stopped blocking methods other than get and post

i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3

google-chrome also is susceptible to this same issue although it does a significantly better job than safari at getting the realtime api re-connected

font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox

all my other browsers safari google-chrome and opera have newer javascript versions

this seems to me like a bandwidth error or something like that originally i ve got the error when i played with the html 5 audio api and if i loaded the audio file 10-15 times sequentially then i ve got the error but now i ve discovered that i get the error without the audio api too just by reloading the site a lots of times also safari gives me the error much faster than google-chrome wtf

if i add font-weight bold they get a little bit thicker but still thinner than within safari google-chrome

i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better

as others have encountered it looks great in mac win firefox mac win google-chrome safari and even win ie 8 9

android google-chrome and iphone mobile safari are usually more similar to each other than desktop safari is to mobile safari the screen format will be similar the layout similar and you ll be able to try real touch events etc

the html tables on my site look nice and the way i intend them to in safari firefox google-chrome but look far wider than the set pixel size in ie

there happen to be 2 mac users that use safari as their default browser and prefer it over google-chrome for mac

since the fixed position in general is not all that stable on touch some more than others google-chrome works great it is still acting up in safari ios 8 in situations that used to work in ios 7 therefore i generally just use js to detect touch devices including windows mobile

a lot of people use iphones ipads and safari is literally the only option even google-chrome is more like safari in disguise... so it s quite a portion of users who are suffering from this issue

in fact given that google rejected pointer event on the ground of speed which ie solved by gpu acceleration it can be said that google-chrome and webkit in general - safari is even slower is lagging behind on this front and the only way to help is contributing code to chromium webkit

edit what particularly interrests me is if desktop safari is closer to ios safari than google-chrome is

i have the problem in firefox 3.6.13 and have tested against current versions of safari win google-chrome opera and ie where the code all works perfectly

while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903

i test on win google-chrome and don t know how it works on safari firefox ie opera

here ajax form breaks after adding html5 attributes in google-chrome safari is a better description and workaround

in this benchmark safari 3.1 2 actually beats google-chrome despite having a js engine that is clearly much much slower this is basically due to more efficient bindings between jsc webcore the dom rendering etc of webkit and v8 webcore

please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome

i think it s simply because google-chrome firefox safari etc. are faster browsers

in my opinion you re already testing far over the top - ie firefox google-chrome safari already corner more than 99 of the market in pc mac form

found an easy way which works with all browsers i have google-chrome 49 edge 25 firefox 44 ie11 safari 5 win safari 8 macos

safari still uses the older version while google-chrome uses a more current one

firefox safari google-chrome and opera make up more than 30 of the market and they support many html5 standards

i think it doesn t work entirely correctly in ie6 but it is fine in ie7-8 firefox safari win opera google-chrome

tested in win firefox ipad safari android 4.1 google-chrome environments

this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome


yacc	bison	5
imho lots are put off because they are also told to use yacc bison which are much more powerful subtle and complex tools

however it is not easier than yacc bison

a parser built from technology other than yacc bison might make it easier

this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive

trust me unless you want to get deeply involved in the internals of lexical and semantic analysis or you want a brain haemorrhage you don t want to go through the code generated by yacc bison may generate nicer code i don t know but nor do i really care since i write the higher level code


h.264	webm	1
- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4


uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	6
there is only a read-only property of the uitabbarcontroller called morenavigationcontroller that points to a uinavigationcontroller

so i went with the alternative approach of using subclasses for uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller which feels much cleaner and only slightly more verbose

i am writing an app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontroller

add one more uinavigationcontroller between uitabbarcontroller and uiviewcontroller

basically if the user is on a view under the more tab the actual current uinavigationcontroller you want to use to push a uiviewcontroller onto is the uitabbarcontroller s morenavigationcontroller property

basically you are implementing a view container much simpler than uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller


profiling	debugging	34
then select profiling item on the sidebar then make sure build configuration is set to debugging

there s lots of profiling and also win debugging that will let you see details of memory allocation and deallocation as well as fragmentation

i think you would need parameters at runtime to decide which profiling you wanted an to choose debugging options

solution is to choose debugging mode instead of release for profiling option

with the header search path correctly set up for sqlcipher the path to sqlite3.h should be different so you can check that and again compare running debugging and profiling release output

the biggest problem that i m having is that in the targets properties i go to build select debugging or distribution and when i want to select the profiling for code signing for the target xcode doesn t show me anything

edit i guess release is much faster than debugging but why is this profiling so time consuming

the reason is that maybe like in my case the xcode bot was attempting to archive with the development profiling and development profiling is much easier to debugging than 4f96f173-7ebe-4892-b283-52489de2f409

another thing to try is the excellent entity framework profiling - has saved us many headaches in debugging performance issues like these - gives you a lot more than sql profiling and you can see what queries objects are created per objectcontext and method source line etc -

i would recommend debugging this with dependency walker in profiling mode

xcode is initially set to use the debugging build configuration when you choose run in xcode and set to use the release build configuration when you choose profiling

corecompile input file c buildagent temp buildtmp.netframework version v4.0 profiling client.assemblyattributes.cs is newer than output file bin debugging dllname.xml

now you just need to go to the project s preferences select debugging and choose iis express from the profiling dropdown

this performance difference issue when doing profiling is better than debugging also has troubled me for a few hours i even tried to move code from web api to console application to test and console application has similar performance as good as when profiling web api

for exemple when you select debugging you can run your application on your phone with the provisioning profiling for developer

it stuns me because usually it s the other way around debugging and profiling versions are much slower than release ones

i did choose debugging configuration and set development provisioning profiling in the options

profiling do not necessarily help debugging profiling may use more memory

you need to add it to your launch profiling click on the little arrow next to the bug icon and select debugging configurations or select the project properties run debugging settings

note that this usually happens under the release profiling which is more strict by default about errors than say debugging

profiling and debugging would tell you more about what is actually going on

if you do that just go back to your project select debugging under configurations and select the appropriate developer profiling to compile with

time spent learning a profiling is probably better spent than time writing and debugging micro-benchmarks

nevertheless various profiling callgrind tool in valgrind cpu profiling google-perfutils and perf doesn t find those debugging symbols resulting in more or less useless output

go to the scheme for your target product - scheme - edit scheme then select profiling from the left menu and set the build configuration to debugging

or select debugging - profiling - performance explorer - new performance session

this is help to route to defined controller but i lose debugging profiling in dev environment still i can not detect a cause

of course you can only debugging the code to see the generated sql but it s easier with a profiling tool and you ll see how long time the query takes

to get elapsed time you can use performance wizard invoke debugging start diagnostic tools without debugging performance wizard start and choose instrumentation as a profiling method

now the provisional profiling need to be tagged to even device for debugging which was earlier sufficient to just list the device uuid in store certificates and profiling section

select profiling and switch to debugging should be release by default

if using eclipse right click on server and select debugging to start server in debugging profiling

go to edit scheme window - select profiling app - change build configuration to debugging

even though i select debugging i get this a valid provisioning profiling for this executable was not found


pbkdf2	hash	14
key derivation algorithms such as bcrypt and pbkdf2 aka rfc2898derivebytes are much slower than standard hash algorithms

use a larger hash pbkdf2 can generate more than the output of the hash as bytes but only at the cost of security

use a secure hashing algorithm like pbkdf2 a good one out of others and compare hash later on

pbkdf2 is more secure than a simple hash or even a salt hash

although because pbkdf2 applies your hash function a large number of times a long salt is less important than in traditional straight hashing applications. for my application i use a 32 byte random salt unique for each users account where i m hashing their password with pbkdf2

just use pbkdf2 to make your hash directly make a 64 bit 8 byte random salt use a higher iteration count 4000-10000

as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people

then pick scrypt bcrypt or pbkdf2 determine the iteration count work factor that takes the amount of time you expect to have available during peak load use a cryptographically random salt of 8 to 16 bytes or so and store the salt plaintext the iteration count work factor plaintext so it can be increased trivially and the resulting hash in the database storage medium

key strengthening techniques such as bcrypt or pbkdf2 are generally considered better than plain hash since cracking them requires more resources

an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function

a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

the advantage here is this membership provider uses pbkdf2 to derive the hash which is more resistant to brute force attacks given the number of rounds

i recommend against using pbkdf2 to derive more than the natural output size size of the underlying hash

in django for example passwords are hash with pbkdf2 or bcrypt but session hash use a less complex hmac and no random salt


runtimeexception	unchecked-exception	5
unchecked-exception which extend runtimeexception are more common and don t have the necessary verbose syntax

also throws an unchecked-exception but it assertions can be turned off so i would recommend runtimeexception

using throw new runtimeexception e is simpler to comprehend than throwables.propagate in the scenario where you want to throw an unchecked-exception wrapping a checked exception

unchecked-exception that are expected more or less same as above some people like to throw subclasses of runtimeexception instead of exception

note better than just runtimeexception would be to use a more specific unchecked-exception if one is available


reactjs	mobx	1
well rather than angularjs i recommend reactjs + mobx + pouchdb


spaces	delimiter	81
more than one spaces should be compressed to a delimiter pipe better

in order to avoid matching empty strings by including spaces as delimiter it makes more sense to me to allow them and use a call to trim to get rid of them

real life often involves more than merely spaces delimiter words

choose delimiter and indicate spaces as the delimiter

that is it looks for 2 or more spaces as a delimiter

the -match operation removes those lines that don t start with an sha1 hash and the -replace operation collapses adjacent spaces into a single delimiter so that convertfrom-csv won t create empty fields when there is more than 1 spaces in a row

so i repeat and clarify my question from the heading how would i split the byear column into three or more columns with or spaces as delimiter

choose delimiter next choose spaces here in other type a colon finish

besides the spaces there are more characters that are considered as delimiter by command prompt which are tab

your actual delimiter looks more like comma followed by a spaces to me

my data is in tabular format spaces delimiter and looks more or less like

select the cell that has the sentence and then under the data tab click text to columns select delimiter and then use spaces as the delimiter

if you want to allow for more delimiter than just spaces tab you can add additional separators when using split

however it s not worth it at all and as eric has advised it would be much more compliant and reliable to simply use a class attribute which can be spaces delimiter to allow more than one or if you are still feeling feisty use the data- attribute like

one cannot assume that more than one spaces is delimiter

the problem is if i upload a image thats bigger than the spaces delimiter it gets resized

choose delimiter and then check the comma box on the next screen as well as the spaces option to get rid of the spaces and hit finish

by wrapping the - in spaces the delimiter is less likely to be tripped up and there s no need to trim the result

the pattern in scanner is supposed to be a regular expression that describes all the characters you don t want included in a token repeated one or more times this last part is because the words may be delimiter by more than one spaces punctuation etc.

choose delimiter and then spaces as your delimiter

if you want to allow the integers to be delimiter by more than one spaces for indentation purposes or so and depending on the way you want to handle tabs and other non-newline whitespace you can use a more complex delimiter

to split the string with regular expression saying spaces one or more spaces one or more as delimiter

i prefer spaces delimiter since it works nice with unix text tools and with excel

the following should do the necessary but it s inefficient doing two full table selects and it also relies on your exact match being delimiter by spaces

as luiggi mendoza commented splitting by s+ instead of would resolve any issue with the number being delimiter by more than one spaces

put the info in a1 then go to data -- text to columns choose delimiter click next and choose spaces

if i choose delimiter - my script reads the values that have spaces between them as one value

i admit i only skimmed the rfc link but it looks like more than one spaces can be used as a delimiter so you might want to change those to +

5 choose delimiter as spaces check checkbox and click next

so by using s 3 i am telling the csv processor that the columns in a row are delimiter by more than 3 spaces

the code makes some reasonable assumptions but it may fail to detect an escaped field if its doublequote is followed or preceded by more than 3 spaces before after field delimiter

basically you split the string into an array using a spaces character as a delimiter so we can get an array of each word then reverse that array and join them back into a string with the spaces we removed earlier

click on data|text to columns|delimited and select spaces as delimiter

in the window that appears you can select delimiter spaces

i know by giving spaces delimiter will not work as there will be split the wrong information and there will be some road name with more than spaces so in this info will be split up in wrong column

if you want to print a list delimiter by spaces here is a more flexible solution that can support any number of elements

as you see i too mistrust whether the tab chars are real tabs and also use two or more spaces as delimiter

choose a delimiter click next then choose spaces

you could split with spaces as delimiter and you split one more time with as delimiter

in the following dialogue select spaces as delimiter then hit ok

choose delimiter with spaces treat consecutive delimiter as one

by something fancier i m referring to more delimiter than spaces grammar punctuation etc

for that column select spaces as the delimiter and at step 3 ymd for the format

however i need the delimiter to be any amount of spaces that are greater than one

it checks for one or more spaces as field delimiter and also tabs

there you can choose delimiter and choose a spaces as a delimiter which will split your data into multiple cells split by where the spaces is

this is happening because i am trying to separate out the search terms based on spaces since spaces comes more natural to users then comma separation or pipes or any other delimiter

splits strings with two or more spaces as delimiter

excel shows a perfect fit for my data if i open it as a text file and simply choose spaces and tabulation at the same time as its delimiter

in this case i used one or more spaces as a delimiter s+

highlight column a choose text to columns then choose delimiter and hit next then choose spaces

select delimiter and then next change the options on this page to spaces instead of tab then finish

create new string which will collect edited versions of each word you can use stringbuilder or better stringjoiner with delimiter set as one spaces

note that rf takes more than two spaces as delimiter see but one spaces is not enough

write right pattern with more than one spaces delimiter and parse your line

instead of explode use preg_split and then use s+ s spaces + 1 or more times as delimiter

this method can handle more delimiter than spaces by the regex being used

you are using the wrong delimiter since your text file may contain more than one spaces character between tokens

go to data - text to columns - choose delimiter - then choose your separator tab semicolon comma spaces or other and you will see changes immediately in the data preview then click finish

if you know that no value contains consecutive spaces and all values are separated by at least 2 spaces then you can get by with a single repl that replaces 2 or more spaces with a delimiter

then in the dialog box select delimiter then tell excel to use spaces to separate the text to columns

a file with space-separated values is just a dialect of the classic comma-separated values csv file where the delimiter is a spaces followed by more spaces which can be ignored

the alternative is to write slightly more complex c code which can split on either spaces or tabs note that you can pass strtok more than one delimiter

when you call pandas.read_csv you can use a regular expression that matches zero or more spaces followed by a comma followed by zero or more spaces as the delimiter

since the file which has to read in have more than one spaces as the delimiter between some of the column the above method does not work

i m using either | or one or more spaces as the delimiter

but i think importing the text file into excel delimiter by spaces is quicker if this can be done

match using two or more spaces as a delimiter

to accept only a single spaces as a delimiter would require more finesse

if the values are delimiter by several spaces an or in unconsistent way you can match delimiter with regular expression

it replaces all tags with spaces and str.split splits resulted text by one or more spaces as delimiter

awk uses a comma surrounded by 0 or more spaces as field delimiter

moreover i cannot use more than 2 spaces as a delimiter when using sed since sometimes there would be only one spaces between the item name and the second column like in the last line in the example between c and 5

i think spaces delimiter tags feel more like typing and you aren t syntactically bound to commas or pipes etc.

choose delimiter and choose spaces as your delimiter

there i choose delimiter choose delimiter untick the spaces box tab box is still ticked column data as general finish

choose delimiter then next then select spaces

select spaces as delimiter and click on finish and you are done

i have a string from input that i would like to only split into two parts with the delimiter as a spaces even though a spaces may occur more than twice

b acts as a word boundary it matches spaces and other delimiter or the begin and end of a string

choose delimiter by spaces


nonetype	iterable	1
since the definition of filter is to return a list of elements in which the function returns true wouldn t filter not none iterable make more sense for filtering to a list that only includes items that aren t nonetype


parsley	robotlegs	2
parsley is more robust and adds a lot more features than robotlegs which is why its been used in the world s largest flex applications

but be prepared that learning curve for robotlegs and parsley could be steeper for some


x86	mips	14
you can compare mips and x86 compiles and look at the assembly language differences at

do any of the other common architectures like arm mips sparc etc have an easier than x86 instruction set

i have studied the x86 assembly and architecture and it appears to be a lot more complicated than mips

a better bet might be to install spim and to learn mips assembly which is more straightforward than x86 anyways

the wording in your question seems to suggest you don t care as much that the output is mips but rather you want the output to be less complex than x86

yes it is very true that an x86 can have a lower clock and run faster than some other x86 historically the newer ones can do less stuff per clock than older ones for the same binaries you have to then tune the compile to the newer chip and then you might get back some of your mips to mhz

if you pick up something like mips and get the hang of it x86 is less of a monster to learn

x86 have more exceptions for register usage than mips that you have to keep in mind but nothing worth whining about constantly

x86 have more complex instructions than mips

however in most computer architectures there are at least 2 registers to return values that are twice or more as wide as the word size edx eax in x86 rdx rax in x86_64 v0 and v1 in mips why mips assembler has more that one register for return value

mips is much more orthogonal than x86 could ever dream of being

this could include a emulator for a 68000 or mips which are arguably nicer assembly instruction sets than the venerable cisc instruction set of the intel x86 16 32-bit

so you could objdump -mintel -bbinary -d -mi386 tmp shellcode for 32-bit -mi386 selects x86 as the architecture rather than arm or mips or whatever and implies -mi386 32-bit mode as well

if you have not programmed assembly before i suggest you choose mips since it is easier than x86 and then b looking at how to transfer data with the serial port to begin with since this illustrates memory-mapped i o that is used


junit	unitils	1
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take


graphframes	rdd	1
connected component algorithm on graphframes either run a more efficient algorithm and reduce number of iteration or convert the graph to an rdd and then run graphx version


ubuntu-server	debian	1
i d recommend debian stable 1 lenny or ubuntu-server 2 for server-purposes


observer-pattern	mediator	1
in my example that probably makes less sense then directly referencing the mediator but in many cases using observer-pattern to implement mediator would make sense and the difference between observer and mediator would be more one of intent than a difference in the code itself


mergesort	timsort	3
this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so

timsort is used by python and java for their sort methods and is rather supernaturally fast but it s a more complex algorithm than mergesort which matters if you re working in something like c - so if you just need something that works pretty well and is simple go with mergesort

however if the data is well scattered causing timsort to behave more like mergesort then binning first will possibly make for a slight win


jsr168	jsr286	2
as the previous poster points out this would be easier with jsr286 portlets wef and non-wef as the eventing is standard but it s not impossible with jsr168 if you re limited to that version in the short term

the posts you see seem to be logical as jsr286 is a newer spec and there are some features that make jsr268 portlet not a jsr168 portlet


merb	ruby-on-rails	5
i personally prefer merb over ruby-on-rails as it adopts more ruby conventions

ok ruby-on-rails is actually pretty good but there is just a little bit too much magic going on in there from the ruby world i would much prefer merb to ruby-on-rails

i ve been having a look at several mvc frameworks like ruby-on-rails merb cakephp codeignitier and similars...

this will be made less onerous by ruby-on-rails 3 which is intended to be orm agnostic after the merge with merb

matz himself prefers merb over ruby-on-rails 2 because ruby-on-rails create a dsl on top of ruby which is really against the ruby philosophy


xlsx	xlsm	1
they also tend to be smaller than their xlsx or xlsm counterparts


box2d	scene2d	1
so basically when box2d is more about how objects will behave themselves during application running the scene2d is more about how you write your code before application running


fgetc	ftell	1
instead of reading the complete file content with fgetc to get the character count i recommend using fseek ftell see answer from this thread


swt	styledtext	1
but adding a class to swt package seems harder first because there is different jars depending on the operating system used org.eclipse.swt.cocoa org.eclipse.swt.gtk .... and also because copy pasting the code of styledtext is not that easy since there is call to external methods waiting for a strict styledtext


solaris	bsd	5
bsd find and gnu find but not solaris find support better units than just c for characters bytes

personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability

my case in particular is with solaris servers but generic unix bsd tools are more than welcome

2 that code appears to be less secure than the bsd solaris versions since it doesn t take into account the saved setid bits

and platform-specific solutions as kqueue bsd macosx epoll linux dev poll solaris are better if relatively small subset of all descriptors is ready on each cycle


pthreads	fork	6
multithreading is faster takes up less resources there is no separate namespace for it and you can run them 4 times more than the fork but multithreading requires build php with non-zts some extensions do not work with non-zts and requires something you would understand pthreads model

but when is fork and clone better than pthreads

i have looked into select pthreads and fork however all the examples i find rely on accept to create a new socket

third since the question is tagged multithreading if the old process is running more than one pthreads then the new process inherits all the mutexes conditions etc of the old process in the state they were in when fork was called

the features stemming from those discussions permit less extreme fork than processes which is symmetrically like the provision of more extensive independence between pthreads

there is a nice comparison of threads and processes here when is clone and fork better than pthreads


qtableview	qpushbutton	1
i m trying to force the qlabel qpushbutton and qtableview marked by trailing underscores in their names be two times higher than qtextbrowser having below


agda	idris	3
in general at this time i recommend agda over idris for writing proofs like this

agda examples would be welcome as well though i d prefer idris ones

i d recommend agda as the better vehicle for getting to grips with the ideas behind dependently typed programming but idris is the more practical option


many-to-many	many-to-one	2
where instead of expected many-to-one is much more complex and partially expressed many-to-many

setting it on a many-to-one or many-to-many relationship is more awkward


terminate	timeout	12
but it seems barring any bugs in the code of the two that if your java connection client has a timeout set lower than the default heartbeat for couchdb continuous changes then the connection could get terminate by the java client

if this works it will terminate requests taking longer than the timeout by raising a timeout error and such requests should generate transaction traces in new relic

maybe its your grasp of english which is the problem but its the lifetime of the connection time between connection opening and closing you need to worry about more than the timeout length of time with no activity after which the connection will be terminate

for tcp the timeout can be much larger since tcp connections are usually terminate by an explicit fin fin-ack exchange

would be adding a kill timeout to the popen processes so if they haven t received a keep alive in 5 minutes or whatever you think is right they would save state if appropriate and terminate

say we have a simple async call we want to kill terminate eliminate on timeout

the process spawns another processes and threads but all are terminate and joined much sooner than timeout

but the problem is that i need to terminate a process if it lasts more than a timeout 3 seconds

i start the calculation in a new thread join it to the main thread with a timeout set to say 1 second but the main thread still keeps on waiting for the calculation to terminate which takes significantly longer than 1 second

you can also supply a timeout for these requests meaning any requests that run longer than the timeout window will be terminate after all

if the file is huge and computation takes longer than the timeout the worker thread is terminate an error message is shown and no intraline difference is displayed for the file pair

i distinguish between long runtimes method terminate and hard timeout - the hard timeout are longer and meant to catch the case when code does not terminate at all as opposed to being slow


3des	aes	15
3des is more expensive than aes for example

how ever if you insist to use some api in java i have to say that des is really old way to encrypted text 3des desede or aes will be better and safer both of them have already been supported since java6

according to this analysis aes rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as des 3des with a bigger key size more secure

des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes

i would recommend aes encryption over 3des any day of the week

if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications

if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations

furthermore 3des is much slower than aes

aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni

aes beats 3des in every respect

you re using des in your example which is a flawed and obsolete algorithm alternatively use 3des so i suggest moving to aes which provides better encryption

edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times

should be as fast as 3des aes turned out to be much faster than 3des in software typically 5 to 10 times faster

symmetric encryption systems aes or 3des are much more efficient and they come with chaining modes which allow them to process input messages of arbitrary length

none of the three reasons above is generally enough to choose 3des or blowfish over aes of course


many-to-one	one-to-many	2
inverse is for bidirectional associations and most often it s on the same side with cascade but that s because the many-to-one side is much more efficient to control the association than the one-to-many one

fifth many-to-one is much easier to use correctly in nhibernate and i assume hibernate than one-to-many collection mapping


lzf	lzo	1
it usually performs better than lzf or lzo


tiff	bmp	4
if you check the description of imwrite you will see that if you want to save your image as binary you are supposed to choose bmp png or tiff

for my senior project i am trying to find the best way to create a grid of up to 1000+ x 1000+ images and save as a png tiff psd bmp etc i prefer png with the ability for the alpha transparency

you can get all files that match bmp jpeg or tiff extensions just use the following code directory.enumeratefiles

in principle non-compressed file formats as bmp or tiff will give you more freedom at reading specific regions


elf	coff	2
your program won t run on another os also because there are different file formats for executables for example win has coff pe linux has the elf file format just like any other file format this also contains meta data the html or sgml file format

it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others
