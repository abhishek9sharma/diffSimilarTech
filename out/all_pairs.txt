int	double	1
personally i prefer int string double etc


hex	binary	1
wxp right-click the value choose modify binary data click at the end of the hex string enter 0000 four zeros ok


mouse	keyboard	1
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts


wmv	flv	1
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv


junit	testng	2
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well

but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take

subtraction	addition	1
additionally while reads and writes are atomic there is a race condition with addition subtraction and incrementing and decrementing primitive types since they must be read operated on and rewritten
