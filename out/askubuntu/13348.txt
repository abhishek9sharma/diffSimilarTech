i ve upgraded from ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 and i ve found that there s no mediawiki package because debian dropped it in december 2015 for being out-of-date and nobody wanted to maintain it

761236
ubuntu	debian
previously that will have been an alias and the real installation path will have been under var lib mediawiki but as it s now up to you to maintain it instead of the debian ubuntu maintainers it s simplest to put it under its real path

761694
x86	64bit
the reason it s named amd64 is because intel created a 64bit processor line called itanium that wasn t based on x86 and it didn t do very well

761694
x86	64bit
amd decided instead to base their 64bit chips on x86 so the name amd64 was initially used in certain areas like linux processor type names and it stuck

if you don t have a backup of the old os an image of the complete partition is best there s no way i know to revert from a non-working upgrade install to an older versioning

762457

the old file versioning are overwritten or deleted during the upgrade process

762803

this quite simply means that when you would run a program on your c-64 that was a graphical program it would reconfigure your computers hardware to be in graphics mode and then your running program would handle all of the graphical output and user input from the mouse and keyboard itself

762807

this will create a file named mybinary.out in the folder myfolder within your current working directory

this appears to be a filesystems independent issue as it occurred on my system with both a btrfs and ext4 root partition

762904

but this is displayed in ubuntu networking as an ethernet connection and critically for me does not show wireless networks that are indeed available

762923

if you look in the xfce wiki for mouse trackpad settings it will mention how device properties can be set

762933

beecrypt has been removed from debian and thus from ubuntu as well due to it being unmaintained by its developers and not used by any other package in debian

763200
versioning	upgrade
in addition to the other answers an upgrade should leave your applications in place although they themselves may need to be upgrade to work properly on the newer versioning for example the os upgrade may bump the versioning of mysql which could have implications for an installed application

763289

there is setting of update-manager whether it should offer versioning upgrade and perhaps you have lts versioning only there or never - it may result in no new release found imho since direct 14.04 to 16.04 is not supported yet

i am using ubuntu 14.04 with mate and my problem is that when i use a local ethernet cable to access local network via a router which is not connected to internet and at the same time wireless or mobile broadband to access the internet - i cannot access the internet because apparently ubuntu tries to first do internet communication via the wired ethernet cable and it locks in there as the wired ethernet is as i mentioned not connected to internet

763641
ethernet	wireless
so let me repeat the question how can i have two network connections active at the same time in network manager such that the wired ethernet connection is used to communicate only to the local network of the router it is connected to - and the wireless broadband connection is used to access the internet

after the upgrade i can not get the windows boot loader to come up no matter what hard drive i try to boot from and the ubuntu boot loader only shows ubuntu where as the previous versioning would also give windows as an option

763907
installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04 did a fresh new installation but i am having problems when shutting down

763912
ubuntu	linux
however it is supported by the linux kernel from 4.4.+ so i installed ubuntu 16.04 to get a 4.4.+ kernel

763916
versioning	upgrade
fortunately the radeon open source drivers are pretty good since amd do release the specs for their cards but if you are absolutely set on using the amd proprietary drivers then you should probably wait and see if they upgrade them to support newer versioning of x

763923
ubuntu	linux
however this phenomenon is restricted to the usage of firefox in linux ubuntu 14.04.4 lts

763937
versioning	upgrade
what are the most convenient ways in order to upgrade the container from ubuntu versioning 14.04 to 16.04

763957
put	get
however when i put the address into the browser chrome of another machine i get the following error

763983
chown	sudo
it should be something like sudo chown -r user group eclipse_folder

764000
disk	ram
but i notice that both my storage and disk are both zero while cpu and ram info looks normal to me

764032
ubuntu	linux
i accidentally installed tensorflow for ubuntu linux 64-bit gpu enabled

trying to get it work with bluetooth keyboard and mouse

764051

keyboard and mouse both detcted by my nexus 5 and 7

764051

m10 detects the 5 and 7 just not keyboard or mouse

764075
ubuntu	mint
i reformatted the usb drive and tried again with ubuntu then again with mint and still nothing

764080
pulseaudio	mixer
this is a graphical mixer for pulseaudio and displays which devices sound is playing on among other things

764096
sudo	passwd
when i did that strings the first time i found lots of root passwd as i was using su - root in the place of sudo su -

764109
xfs	btrfs
i installed ubuntu primary partitions and using mbr with legacy bios with a separate home partition in another hdd formatted in xfs and root in in btrfs

764114
qtwebengine	qtwebkit
the script needs qtwebengine not qtwebkit

764114
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately that s not packaged for debian ubuntu so the only way you would get that running is to compile qt and pyqt on your own which can be a bit of a pain

764126
stdout	stderr
redirection for stdin stdout and stderr are set up

764209
daemons	systemd
so another question will be why systemd couldn t stop mysql daemons

764228
versioning	upgrade
i need versioning 11 as clients have upgrade

764239
ubuntu	debian
so i followed these steps here installing wxpython and wxwidgets on ubuntu and debian

764241
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my kernel to versioning 4.4.8 in an attempt to enable suspend hybernate but in turn it decreased the battery life

764249
versioning	upgrade
if i m not wrong ubuntu supports upgrade between 2 lts versioning

764272
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome have both used the same upload download dialog for gmail or stackexchange image uploads

764272
google-chrome	firefox
firefox has started to use a different dialog which does not offer me access to my network drives nicely mounted accessible with google-chrome dialog etc.

764272
google-chrome	firefox
obviously i want firefox to use the same uploader that google-chrome is still using

764286
apache	nginx
stop nginx then apache will work or configure one of the servers to use a different port

764301
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is now gtk3 based google-chrome is still gtk2 based. so that s not that easy

764307
cos	sin
a plot looks of for instance sin x and cos x looks now like this

764316
versioning	upgrade
however i would recommend installing php-cgi meta package that depends on php7.0-cli for ubuntu 16.04 to ensure you will always get latest php versioning on upgrade

764340
versioning	upgrade
you can wait for that or you can do it now because after upgrading to 16.04 developemant versioning you can easily upgrade to 16.04.1 by just running in terminal

764375
mouse	keyboard
the problem was to connect both devices i had to try several times first connect the mouse then the keyboard was not detected so i removed the mouse then the m10 detected the k480 but not the mouse .

764395
ubuntu	linux
i admit i dont know a lot about linux or ubuntu and i suspect that is why im having so much trouble with this

in my case it was because some packages were being held back from an upgrade preventing the installation of the snap packages

764534
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i recently upgraded from linux mint 17.3 mate ubuntu 14.04 to ubuntu 16.04

764561
ubuntu	linux
i wonder what is the difference between an ubuntu mainline kernel and a linux kernel

764577
ubuntu	linux
then if you start ubuntu you get the typical linux running command signs

764583
dpkg	apt
dpkg var cache apt archives libc6_2.23-0ubuntu3_i386.deb aråÿivi iåÿlenirken sorun yaåÿandä --unpack

764583
installation	upgrade
final edit after a fresh installation of ubuntu 16.04 and installing proper upgrade before any app my problem solved

764697
disk	ram
it is an argued question but my opinion is that with 8 or more gb of ram you don t need swap unless you use suspend to disk

764717
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu with linux 4.4.0-21-generic or

764717
ubuntu	linux

ethernet	wireless
this is what i have it s a gigabit wireless ethernet usb stick -

764774
postfix	dovecot
i ve made an email server on ubuntu 12.04 using postfix dovecot and roundcube as an web interface

764783
daemons	systemd
in the case of korganizer you have to uncheck the option of reminding events from its icon in the systemd tray i think it appears as events reminder daemons or something similar

764814
ubuntu	linux
i went into the official website of linux and it recommends me to use ubuntu

764829
vmware	virtualbox
keep in mind for testing ubuntu or any other operating system it might make sense to check out a virtual machine like virtualbox vmware or similar

764869
google-chrome	firefox
it is a browser extension i created for google-chrome and firefox that will let you add subtitles on online streaming movies

764888
mouse	keyboard
usb wireless mouse and keyboard freezing only when external screen is connected

764952
cpu	processors
the processors is intel r pentium r dual cpu t2330 1.60ghz

764977
dpkg	apt
you need atool sudo apt install dpkg-dev devscripts atool and gdebi dpkg will do too but i prefer gdebi

765046
mouse	keyboard
followed the steps by 1nfiniti on ubuntu 16.04 amd64 and it worked great with logitech mx5000 keyboard and mouse combo

765074

i m new to linux and trying to set up a dual boot ubuntu windows 10 system on a new dell xps x8900

765110
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 14.04.4 lvm install just put guids for linux filesystem and linux lvm

765113
ubuntu	linux
newb question if i patch it this way and a few weeks later there is official ubuntu update to linux 4.5.2 will it be installed by default update manager

765117
hide	show
there s only option to show and hide the name

765173
installation	upgrade
b recommended do a clean install by booting and erase disk and install ubuntu 16.04 lts throught the installation disk usb which makes things less likely to go wrong kernel upgrade other applications support since it s officially not validated for upgrade

765178
daemons	systemd
this will run it as a daemons at systemd startup

765205
gmail	hotmail
everything seems to be working ok i was able to send and receive mails from several accounts using the squirrel webmail and with outlook client including yahoo and hotmail accounts but i cant send emails to gmail accounts i m able to send but no error is displayed in fact i see the email as sent but in the google account the mail is never received also note the same for other mails domains server

765226
vlc	mkv
my problem -that i ve been stuck with last two days- is i downloaded an mkv video with hevc stream which is unknown to vlc but by applying some tools and trying others i resolved the problem with video code but for the audio it s still undf to vlc

765246
ubuntu	debian
all my debian servers still work so i know the problem is with ubuntu and not my router

765253
ubuntu	linux
however if you are comfortable on the linux command line and do not need a graphical user interface gui take a look at ubuntu server -- it will allow you to install a command-line-only system not necessarily a server without a gui

765256
rar	zip
i am trying to fix an encoding issue with any zip files or rar files that i unzip

765314
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu on windows does not support the x11 window system which is needed for graphical applications in linux

765324
disk	ram
the_simple_computer s guide to full disk encryption with ubuntu updated june 28 2015 says that s about how the default installer s encryption works and mentions that dual-booting wouldn t work at least not out-of-the-box the drive must use mbr so if your computer has uefi the distro will be installed in legacy bios mode so you can t use secure boot and also gives you a swap size equal to that of your system ram often unnecessary and you have no choice over what kind of encryption is used

765364
switching	screens
by switching to a text console with ctrl+alt+f1 and back to x with ctrl+alt+f7 i can get into the logged in session so it seems the screens is just not being updated during login where normally the progress bar is shown

765365
folder	directory
i m assuming of course that the folder s containing the home directory don t have write permissions to anybody except root

765370
folder	directory
but i m unable to setup virtual directory directory that refer to different physical folder

765374
installation	upgrade
the only problem was that rpd connections weren t available in my headless installation because i didn t upgrade the virtualbox extension pack

765391
ethernet	wireless
specifically i have a laptop with an internal wireless nic as well as an ethernet connection

765394
ubuntu	linux
i have solved my problem installing linux kernel 4.6.0 ubuntu 16.04 has linux kernel 4.4.0

765405
installation	upgrade
even when following the instructions at wine installation isue after upgrade 12.04 - 14.04 using the ubuntu-wine ppa ppa i still get the following

765426
kde	kubuntu
i m running kubuntu so these steps are for kde and i m not sure what the equivalent unity steps are but i d imagine they re similar

765438
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux instructions

765438
ubuntu	linux
this installation requires ubuntu linux version 10.4 or later

765468
ubuntu	linux
the linux can only be accessed by doing shift+restart from windows side-bar and then choosing ubuntu as the boot device

765470
daemons	launchd
as you can see having the gui launchd causes two connections to become established unlike with just the daemons

765513
sudo	passwd
my question here is how can i enter into sudo domain without manually entering passwd

765525
ubuntu	linux
the device is designed to also support linux ubuntu

765556
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu 14.04 lts and am a very new user to this which is my first experience of linux at all

765558
sudo	passwd
passwd being your sudo passwd

765573
vpn	lan
when i am trying to connect from within my lan everything works fine but when trying to reach it from my vpn nothing happens the box gets the tcp packets but not the services listening the ports

765574
mouse	keyboard
firefox with mouse and keyboard will not do that so it is not a memory issue

765579
daemons	systemd
this tells snappy that you want this command to be run as a daemons a systemd service which means this should be running as soon as you install it

765581
folder	directory
the above directory contains the themes folder

765597
kate	nano	kate	gedit	gedit	nano
use nano or kate or leafpad if you don t have the text editor gedit

765601
ubuntu	linux
through ubuntu 15.10 ubuntu s handling of secure boot stopped at grub -- that is ubuntu s version of shim would launch ubuntu s version of grub which would launch any linux kernel whether or not it was signed

765601
ubuntu	linux
if a third-party driver is not signed with a cryptographic key that the ubuntu version of the linux kernel recognizes as valid it won t be loaded

765601
ati	nvidia
this mostly impacts the closed-source nvidia and amd ati video drivers but there are other drivers that can be affected too

765601
ubuntu	linux
don t use third-party kernel modules -- if you restrict yourself to open source drivers included in ubuntu s standard linux kernel you should be fine since canonical signs all such drivers afaik

765622
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
despite of possible hard drive problems i have tried to install linux mint to my laptop via usb linux mint because i m not aware of if it is possible to install also ubuntu from such a compatibility mode like linux mint

765630
ubuntu	linux
please bear with me i m very new to linux and ubuntu

765633
google-chrome	firefox
the unicode look of disapproval no longer displays correctly within google-chrome and firefox in ubuntu 16.04

765677
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
another great way to understand ubuntu specifically is to understand that ubuntu is a distribution of linux built on debian linux

765680
ubuntu	centos
i m pretty sure the hardware works since i was able to hear sound when i had centos on the same computer earlier and also in an earlier edition of ubuntu before that again on the same hardware

765692
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse pointer stop responding

765692
mouse	keyboard
how can i make keyboard mouse and interactive-shells more responsive when the backup is running

765697
sudo	passwd
it s not the same as my login sudo passwd

765698
switching	screens
open another screens prompt run killall systemctl switching back and see that dpkg did indeed move on

765705
ubuntu	linux
now when i try to start it up it tries to boot straight to ubuntu instead of linux and just freezes on the start up screen

765751
ubuntu	linux
if you are a fan of linux ubuntu and you plan to stay on it for life - that means that you will not need to install other os operating system you will play games only in ubuntu wine - then use whole space for it

765751
ubuntu	linux
you can always mount this ntfs space into linux to have it visible in ubuntu too

765767
folder	directory
answer to question one is usually the downloads folder under the users home directory

765785
ubuntu	linux
differential os as first and or hobbyist linux user i do recommend ubuntu because you can get sufficient support here

765833
ubuntu	linux
many programs that exist for creating a bootable linux installer on a usb stick don t work very well with ubuntu

765841
vmware	virtualbox
if you run them in virtualbox or vmware you can get reasonable performance but you still can t skip the adverts

765859
switching	screens
on the 4k screens variety of this laptop the font size is nearly unreadable when switching to a tty for example when pressing ctrl+alt+f1 from unity

765862
ethernet	wireless
on ubuntu 15.10 i could ssh to remote server via ethernet but not wireless interface

765880
folder	directory
navigate to the sys os glnxa64 directory within this installation folder

765885
h.264	webm
i d say you ubuntu touch device doesn t have support for hardware decoding of webm where as most phones and tablets the m10 will have hardware which decodes h.264 so it doesn t take up time on the main cpu while playing h.264 videos

765908
versioning	upgrade
your software stack will be upgrade to the latest versioning which is 14.04.4 now

765927
folder	directory
so i created a directory shared in my home folder and did mount the host file system manually

765993
ubuntu	debian
as of february 18 2016 there are official ubuntu debian packages

766008
ubuntu	linux
i mean i only want to deal with the bios boot order so i would have windows boot loader and ubuntu i d set windows to be 1st choice so when i need linux i would turn on the computer holding f12 to get the boot order and from there select ubuntu to run

766009
ethernet	wireless
there should be one with ethernet interface for normal lan and other should be wireless interface

766016
dpkg	apt
file by dpkg -i or by apt

766051
ubuntu	linux
once set this way typing cd downloads in ubuntu linux it is case sensitive will bring you into your downloads directory

766054
folder	directory
i understand that it is a bad practice to keep files owned by oneself in one s home area which are executable so i am in need of a script tool which checks recursively through a given directory in this case my home directory and all of its sub-directories etc should check hidden files and folder obviously too and outputs the name and location of any files which are executable it should also indicate the owner of the file

766064
switching	screens
when i switching to full screens mode the bottom quarter of the screens becomes black

766088
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos
the following is a very basic grub menu configuration file designed to boot either ubuntu linux or else centos legacy grub

766097
ubuntu	debian
in the debian ubuntu s repositories the pacakage to install is task-spooler and the binary to call is tsp

766100
ethernet	wireless
i did check to see if the wireless adapters were on in the command line but it didn t mention the wireless one just the ethernet adapter

766117
versioning	upgrade
above solution worked on eclipse versioning mars.2 release 4.5.2 on a machine upgrade from 15.10 to 16.04

766120
kde	kubuntu
how do i turn off or disable the guest account in kubuntu using the kde gui

766139
ssl	https	banking	payment
our goal is to allow our users to browse some important web pages like banking or payment systems without ssl interception it s called splice in squid s terminology but the rest of https traffic should be intercepted bumped in order to verify the content.

766150
screens	tablet
i had a similar problem with my pavilion x360 so here is what i did for a work around to disable the keyboard and pad and to rotate my screens so i can use it as a tablet

766163
versioning	upgrade
upgrade from versioning 15 to 16.04

766168
ubuntu	mint
for virtualbox version 5.0.2-102096 ubuntu trusty i have it installed on mint rosa 64 cinnamon 17.3

766192
ubuntu	debian
when i go to the steam website download and run the debian .deb installer gnome ubuntu software displays the blue installing bar then this disappears and i m left with an icon on the launcher that says waiting to install when you hover over it

766221
ubuntu	linux
i already have windows 10 and ubuntu linux desktop 14.04 lts working fine

766221
ubuntu	linux
hd0 gpt7 contains my root and other partitions for ubuntu linux...but sudo mount etc...doesn t work...can t even wipe ubuntu and get it to windows 10 was planning to install ubuntu linux desktop 16.04

766237
ethernet	wireless
while running ubuntu 14.04 my laptop has both its wifi turned on with a saved wireless network in range and an ethernet cable plugged in which leads to a devolo homeplug from the same network

766258
move	drag
thus when you click and drag on the whiteboard it should move the cursor

766261
installation	upgrade
please don t upgrade to 16.04 right now as there is a bug issue regarding installation of third party softwares.wait until they debug the said issue.till then keep enjoying 14.04

766274
ubuntu	linux
you just need to select manual while installing ubuntu and make sure that mount point is set for your linux partition and windows partition is set to not used

766334
sudo	passwd
when i login using sudo mysql mysql doesn t even ask me passwd

766366
ethernet	wireless
and replace eth0 with eth1 or wlan0 etc for a secondary ethernet or a wireless card

766367
filesystems	fat
in theory this should be ok but in practice it might not be particularly with an older early 2010s computer -- some early efis have somewhat flaky fat drivers that don t cope well with sub-512 mib fat filesystems

766392
vmware	virtualbox
a workaround i found was setting up a virtual machine both virtualbox and vmware should be ok with any linux distro you want i configured it to be compatible with usb 2.0 protocol

766394
subnet	packets
now you have told him to send all packets for that subnet over a different router that probably knows where to send the packets

766401
jobs	cron
i ve learned that cron jobs setting and information are stored at etc crontab and i come across this command crontab -e when i execute it i was prompted to choose an editor

766401
jobs	cron
and which one is the right way to set cron jobs

766417
versioning	upgrade
upgrade bios to latest versioning p1.80 for me now

766418
ubuntu	debian
for those i would suggest a debian installation which uses less ram memory than ubuntu

766465
folder	directory
a .profile file is stored in the etc skel directory that you can copy to your home folder

766483
ethernet	wireless
wlan stands for wireless local area network as opposed to eth0 which stands for ethernet which is a physical network cable

766500
vim	gedit
vim offers the neat scrolloff feature but i haven t found anything for gedit see here

766503
kate	gedit	kate	kde
i don t know if this works in gedit but it does in kate the kde equivalent

766504
mouse	keyboard
fun fact is when i reboot my logitech g105 bricks my logitech mouse and keyboard stops working until i take out the power from the computer and hold the power button for some seconds then reboot and the keyboard mouse work again the wallpaper is not there default one

766512
sudo	passwd
in terminal when i tried to execute a sudo command the passwd i know for a fact is right turned out wrong

766515
mouse	keyboard
the computer does not respond to any keyboard or mouse inputs but the they do seem to be on

766538
folder	directory
documents is the path to the documents folder in the home directory of the current user

766544
hex	binary
you could also use a hex editor to find the text you re looking for in the compiled binary and change it but that is also complex

766561
hard-drive	hdd
i think the only difference between the two is the hard-drive hdd over an ssd and the processor i3 over an i5

766562
ubuntu	freebsd
i am trying to dual boot freebsd and ubuntu

766564
folder	directory
he did something with make i don t know and now i have a racket folder in my home directory

766593
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade to ubuntu 16.04 from 15.10 x64 versioning and now i am unable to run filezilla

766613
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu enforce sha256 or higher entries in the release and or packages files since march

766643
folder	directory
i cannot see any files or folder in my home directory

766649
folder	directory
delete ibus folder under .config directory

766659
google-chrome	firefox
a few things that i have done that might be responsible are installing and subsequently uninstalling google-chrome this coincided with several other weird errors such as odd font rendering in firefox and unplugging my computer from my tv without safely disconnecting it

766659
xfce	gnome
i also have gnome 3 installed and switch back and forth between xfce and gnome very frequently in case that helps

766668
ubuntu	debian
this driver explicitly needs lsb-core and in 14.04 it would install fine via usc sadly lsb-core has been removed by debian and ubuntu

766725
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
at 4.5.2 it s even more frequent and mainly in google-chrome haven t tried firefox or opera just yet

766730
apache	nginx
you can t listen to same port with two servers but if you want you can configure nginx as a reverse proxy for apache

766734
ubuntu	linux
by now you can simply go to download opera browser then click the button above opera for windows mac or linux and the website will detect your operating system and processor architecture 32 or 64 bits using device fingerprinting and prompt you a .deb package to download and install by a simple click using the ubuntu software center

766773
sudo	passwd
another method would be to run this from the terminal sudo update-manager -d enter passwd when asked and hit return

766790
vmware	virtualbox
i don t think it is possible to run starcraft2 decently without installing it on a virtual machine based on virtualbox or vmware

766809
stdout	stderr
might want to tee the output to a log file - that output is to stderr not just stdout so do any redirection desired

766829
xfce	kubuntu
i recently swapped from mint to kubuntu with xfce

766856
skype	webex
there are still not found files in the webex directory and audio calls still does not work but i don t need it we use skype

766866
gedit	nano
you can use the nano command line editor as well but when you want to use a gui editor open gedit with the gksudo command

766873
folder	directory
the reason your downloads folder is empty is because gksu sets the home directory to root s home directory

766900
installation	upgrade
this installation of mysql is already upgrade to 5.7.12 use --force if you still need to run mysql_upgrade

766906

766922
ubuntu	linux
please take care there is still no intel linux graphic installer for ubuntu 16.04 but i m pretty sure this will work also on your pc

766967
mouse	keyboard
i personally use hp x4000b - mouse logitech bluetooth multi-device keyboard k480 i ve found both to be extremely reliable

766969
mouse	keyboard
i use without problems the logitech k380 keyboard and the sony vgp-bms15 bluetooth mouse

766985
mouse	keyboard
adding an apple mighty mouse a logitech mx1000 keyboard mouse set special keys not all supported yet and a logitech dinovo mini to the mix of known-to-work devices

767000
dpkg	aptitude
i tried aptitude synaptic dpkg --configure -a apt-get -f install and probably many others which i don t remember and still cant solve the broken package issue

767013
sudo	passwd
also a lot of backup programs need root to function properly so you will usually have to use sudo in a command prompt or gksu on a launcher icon at the beginning of the command to have it go through right and it will ask you for a passwd

physically changing the sata port on the motherboard to which the dvd drive was connected solved this issue namely an ubuntu release upgrade causing a previously working dvd drive to fail to be recognized in the new installation

i picked up a usb bluetooth adapter that supported some more feature sets that have been incorporated into bluetooth since my laptop was produced and it works quite well

the bluetooth communication is between the adapter and the speaker and ubuntu sees it as a usb device

my answer to you is not as sophisticated as some of the replies here i suspect that is because i am not as savvy as some of the people who have attempted to help you herein... when the microsoft xp os was abandoned by microsoft i chose to make a leap-of-faith by porting my old xp machine to debian linux

after installing ubuntu 16.04 alongside debian i get no boot option for ubuntu

767337
ubuntu	debian
now the hyper intelligent ubuntu installer contrary to the debian installer doesn t allow me to set the mirror country to use for the package downloads which makes the installations quite slow other than setting up a mirror myself and point every installation to that one but that would be cumbersome for various reasons

after upgrading from ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 on a dell e6330 laptop with core i7 cpu when running in the default unity desktop with external usb keyboard and mouse if i don t touch the keyboard or mouse for roughly 5 seconds the mouse apparently snoozes and it takes about 0.5 seconds of mouse motion before it resumes functioning

767468

the keyboard doesn t lose keystrokes and pressing a key before using the mouse prevents the mouse hesitation

cool thing about ubuntu and linux in general is that it is easy to swap hard drives from one computer into the other since linux kernel contains a lot of modules drivers out of the box already and it will work

only change your desktop from unity to cinnamon kde and you re done tested on 16.04 lts

767534
folder	directory
give your user owner over the files and folder and give yourself read write on all of the files and folder as well as the ability to traverse the directory

767534
folder	directory
optional but recommended set it up such that any files or folder created from hereon in the entirety of the directory structure has the group set to be www-data

767534
folder	directory
there may be some cases where you have to give the web server write permission to a file or to a directory - this can be achieved by doing sudo chmod g+w var www html path where path is the path to the file or folder in the directory structure where you need to apply the write permissions for the web server

767534
folder	directory
notice there are a lot of cases where this may expose secure information about a site configuration such as database access credentials etc. and you should remove other access permissions to that data on those individual files or directory with the following sudo chmod o-rwx var www html filepath replacing filepath with the path relative to the var www html folder for the file

767534
folder	directory
2 give your owner read write privileges to the folder and the files and permit folder access to traverse the directory structure

767534
folder	directory
next we set read and write permissions on the folder and permit you to access the folder to go into them the +x item on the directory items

767534
folder	directory
files and folder created inside these directory will always have www-data as the group permitting the web server access

767534
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r www-data www-data var www html

767534
folder	directory
recursively give yourself read write traverse on the directory remove access to the folder for other users excluding www-data and root and set this as the default acl for new files in the directory

767534
chown	sudo
that s a simple sudo chown www-data www-data filename and the access control lists should still let you have effective owner rights to the file

767550

if you your keyboard still functions properly then do this and it may restore your mouse

if you want to boot your system with this kernel by default write down the translation of ubuntu gnu linux with xen hypervisor

767579

in my case dutch that s ubuntu gnu linux met xen-hypervisor and open etc default grub.d xen.cfg when booted

767579

replace grub_default ubuntu gnu linux with xen hypervisor with grub_default translation at the bottom of that file and undo the changes you made in etc default grub

if you want to be able to use sudo without having to type the passwd every time you can use this line instead

768111

this will not add or change the passwd of the user though so if you deleted the passwd for the user then this will not work because sudo will not accept a blank passwd

the problem of the integrated keyboard and touchpad randomly freeze even with the above configurations still persist on my latitude 3450 if i use with the official ubuntu 16.04 linux kernel v4.4.x series i test with kernel4.4.0-21-generic and 4.4.0-22-generic

768266
jobs	cron
since i suppose the system normally has a bunch of other cron and anacron jobs set up i figure i should better not mess with this standard configuration

768266
daemon	cron
first of all i understand that cron is a daemon that runs its tasks exactly as scheduled in the crontab if the computer is running at the specified time

768266
jobs	cron
this seems to fit with this standard setup of the crontab and anacrontab above after a clean install of ubuntu 16.04 where only the daily hourly and monthly jobs are relayed to anacron and etc cron.hourly is handled directly by cron and as i have read that the first two tabs in each anacrontab entry specify the period of the scheduled task in days 1 day for etc cron.daily in this case for example and 7 days for etc cron.weekly - seems to fit well and the waiting period in minutes after the first system startup of the day or i guess rather after anacron startup

768274
daemon	cron
anacron is not a daemon and is ran by cron

768312
gedit	nano
if after reboot your xserver crashes doesn t initialize the graphics you can become superuser sudo su and then use nano instead of gedit in order to edit the 10fglrx file directly in the shell

for the question notify me of a new ubuntu versioning if you choose for long term supports versioning the new ubuntu upgrade may not be prompted as the new versioning of ubuntu may not be the long term supports one

768322
versioning	upgrade
if you choose for any new versioning the new ubuntu upgrade prompt will most likely appear

768322
versioning	upgrade
when the new ubuntu versioning released usually the upgrade prompt would not be appeared immediately

for when the new ubuntu upgrade prompt will be available for your current ubuntu versioning you can check the release notes of the new versioning in

that should change the permissions for the folder and all its files and sub directory to read write execute

768807

anybody know of something similar for ubuntu linux

gedit	nano
if you are stuck with a tty terminal or some non-gui based terminal try sudo nano to edit files instead of sudo gedit

768839

at the end of the etc fstab file you will need to add a line for each share with the format of shared directory path name the location of the folder it will be mapped to on your system cifs a line to your credentials file with some other stuff

versioning	upgrade
now however i wish to downgrade all the packaged upgrade to their xenial-proposed versioning to their versioning in the stable normal channels but how can this be achieved

768849
versioning	upgrade
if i just disable the xenial-proposed channel via the same means that i enabled it will the packaged installed and upgrade to their xenial-proposed versioning start to receive updates again from the stable normal channels once the versioning numbers there are higher than the installed or will i receive no updates at all then until i enable the xenial-proposed channel again

768867
dpkg	apt
run sudo dpkg -l | grep apt

dpkg	apt
run sudo dpkg -l | grep apt again to check version has changed

768881
mp4	webm	mp4	h.264	h.264	webm
since opus doesn t conform to the mp4 container standard and h.264 is similarly out of place in webm a restricted mkv containers you have to use mkv and hope that the players support opus audio tracks

768889
sudo	passwd
my problem is as follows i am aware that there is a timeout for how often the system asks for my passwd when running commands with sudo

768889
sudo	passwd	chown	sudo	chown	passwd
the problem is that even though i am well within the timeout the script always asks for the passwd on the second sudo chown command

768921

so is it possible to install ubuntu and kali linux on logical partitions under extended partitions or will it not work without primary partition

768922
sudo	passwd
it s probably not working from the run dialogue because the sudo command prompts for a passwd -- but there s no terminal to enter it in

768922

that way your entire script will run with superuser privileges and it won t require the sudo passwd again

this means that for each virtual machine i install i have to go to the server connect the keyboard mouse and monitor and do it there to setup the ssh connection and then i can use the virtual machine

you ll notice the folder are different on linux systems compared to windows -- there s no c drive just a root directory called with lots of subdirectories.

however many users who upgrade their installation to 16.04 from an older versioning rather than doing a fresh install now have both software centers since the upgrader program tends not to like removing packages unless they re not being used anymore

i just discovered that vlc does not use whatever connection the desktop supplies whether it s gnome or kde

my tablet offers me the option to share internet via bluetooth which is interesting because the laptop has no ethernet cable socket and wireless stopped working after an upgrade and sharing with usb is not possible

769459

is this a fresh installation or an upgrade without repartitioning

769478
folder	directory
look in the .wine folder in your home directory

769491

of these i would recommend the network installer as it is a relatively small download and will allow you to install a full gnome kde mate xfce lxde unity desktop from the text interface

some of them were upgrade from a previous versioning

you might also look into the uid gid and umask options of the mount command for fine control

based on the question i suspect no boot option for ubuntu refers to grub 2 boot loader that has been installed earlier by debian and not the one belongs to ubuntu

following this i d say no boot option for ubuntu occurs because grub 2 boot loader in debian somehow doesn t detect other operating systems that have been installed afterwards

looking at the gitlab.conf.bac file in your grep output and i would guess that you installed gitlab using apache first and then maybe did a reinstall using nginx

versioning	upgrade
a ppa provided for an earlier versioning might be more compatible than a ppa provided for a later os versioning because newer os often comes with upgrade components libraries and functions that might not be totally compatible with a previous versioning of ubuntu

775925

trying to update each library with to make your installation compatible to a later os might take more work that you would anticipate than just upgrading to the later os which you have already specified that you are not ready to do

ubuntu is a linux based operating system and it may be helpful to know that there are also many other freely available linux distributions out there which each differ in their user interface and in some other nuances

776246

how did you created the linux partitions how did you install install ubuntu

776568
ubuntu	linux
one last thing although it is sometimes possible to install ubuntu to ntfs or fat partitions that is only advisable to advanced and expert linux users

776568
ubuntu	linux
any typical linux ubuntu included needs at least 2 partitions a swap partition and an ext2 3 4 partition.the swap partition is always inaccessible it acts as virtual ram memory the ext partition is where your ubuntu will be installed

versioning	upgrade
make sure your versioning is the latest ubuntu 14.04 versioning before the upgrade

777203

if you have absolutely no idea where to look for moodle installation you have to check it in your apache nginx or other http server configuration

777232

lxd mounts the individual paths in the same place as it would if using dir - var lib lxd containers images and setting a mount point at the root of the zfs pool you set up won t give you visibility of these folder as you might expect on a traditional fs

777298
ubuntu	centos
once i have installed centos on my new primary partition how do i switch between ubuntu and centos

777319
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu with linux 4.4.0-21-generic recovery mode kernel version is important

777321
ubuntu	centos
you can simply shrink your ubuntu partition and the installer for centos should let you use that space

777321
ubuntu	centos
i don t know the centos installer well so in reality the answer is that you should shrink your ubuntu partition using gparted or similar then follow the installation instructions for centos to install it onto the free space you ve created

777321
ubuntu	centos
if you don t select one within 10 seconds or so it will automatically select your primary os which in my experience is the last one you installed but you can change this within ubuntu or centos

777328
ubuntu	centos
grub will install automatically with ubuntu and centos

777331
filesystems	ntfs
to resize a partition with data the software should do a complex and in case of ntfs never published trick to move parts of filesystems away from the end of partition

boot from the cd or usb and select the option upgrade ubuntu 14.04 to 14.10 during the installation

777397

one possible cause of the problem is that you have dsa keys but now ssh apparently defaults to requiring rsa keys

i had the same issue in my hp pavilion g6-2248ca notebook.the overheating is basically due to the linux kernal in ubuntu 15.04 is not able to adopt the hybrid graphics in hp pcs properly i think this is probably a bug .furthermore i resolved the issue by switching to ubuntu 14.04.you should try to switch ubuntu 14.04.if switching does not help just go back to windows where hp coolsensors would take care this problem

777693
switching	screens
i am locking the screens using dm-tool lock and it looks good but i noticed you can circumvent the lock screens by switching a tty ctrl+alt+f1 and then switching back to the graphical tty ctrl+alt+f7

777693
hide	show
doing so will hide the lock screen and show the desktop even if no password was given

777727
versioning	upgrade
problem here is that you have upgrade os versioning and also php versioning among other stuff

777730
installation	upgrade
problem never occurred immediately after an update or upgrade it is not fresh installation

777736

this is useful to read about how do i mount directories from other linux unix bsd servers

it looks like it is installed i see the folder in html directory but when i check domain.com phpmyadmin it gives nothing

777805

switching to tty also shows just a black screens but the system seems to be running as i can blindly type shutdown and the system goes off

777875
mouse	keyboard
that s all good but i m irritated by a few keyboard and mouse shortcuts that are slightly different in lxde vs unity

777879
folder	directory
create a bin directory in your home folder if not already created

777883
ubuntu	opensuse
i have been able to boot opensuse and windows 10 installation media on the computer so it appears to be an ubuntu problem

777895

so you need to figure out which target to use and then get systemd to put you into that target

777901

now weâ ll create a directory to mount the remote folder in

777949
google-chrome	firefox
disabling the enable touch events flag in google-chrome chromium doesn t seem to make any difference which suggests that maybe it s not just a browser issue although strangely the mouse works normally in firefox

777954
opera	google-chrome
opera lets you sync passwords as well presumably it stores them in opera servers like google-chrome does no two-factor authentication and not zero-knowledge afaict

777962

if i click the network icon on the top right it says ethernet network broadcom bcm4350 802.11ac wireless network adapter

777964
google-chrome	firefox
i was always very happy with firefox and never felt the need to change to google-chrome

777964
google-chrome	firefox
though google only supports its flash for google-chrome and not for firefox

777964
google-chrome	firefox
is it now necessary to change from firefox to google-chrome to enjoy safety and functionality regarding flash

777969
google-chrome	firefox
i think firefox is more better then google-chrome

777969
google-chrome	firefox
so if you needed flash you can try google-chrome but both for ethical and for features primarily the security firefox has the first position for me

778050
ubuntu	linux
if the f drive is in linux 83 format which i agree that it is you can boot ubuntu from usb or cd and run gparted to read it

778065
google-chrome	firefox
in my experience i ve found that firefox errs more on the side of security than does google-chrome

778065
google-chrome	firefox
for example in the case of early-stage implementations for cross-origin resource sharing firefox operated more strictly than the standard and google-chrome operated more loosely than the standard

778068
mouse	keyboard
i have had 2 separate situations where the inputs from the k b mouse were freezing the nuc and had to reboot via power button - admittedly running w10 though..to test my theory i used a wired keyboard and mouse..the problem disappeared for me

personally firefox is my normal daily driver but i fire up google-chrome when i need to run flash

778089

after you have fully booted into your vm open a terminal and type sudo su to become root you will be prompted for your passwd then type the following

778091
sudo	passwd
press ctrl + x then y for yes to save and press enter then type sudo update-grub enter passwd if needed and press enter

778175
kde	gnome
well you could just install kdeconnect on ubuntu gnome it would probably also install lots of kde dependencies but if you re fine with that then just install it and you ll get the functionality you want

778222
ethernet	wireless
ever since i plugged in an ethernet cable into my laptop at home i cannot connect to the wireless network anymore

778262

i have been a linux user for three weeks now and i really don t know what to do anymore - i tried to install telegram on my linux ubuntu 16.04 lts through various ways but with no success

if you re just playing around with a system and or ubuntu is running in a vm virtualbox vmware qemu etc then the side effects are negligible and you probably won t care

778347
mouse	keyboard
this goes specifically for mouse keyboard and screen xrandr related commands

778349
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
toolkit differences kde is qt while unity gnome and xfce share the gtk+ toolkit

778349

778363
sudo	passwd
sudo will ask for your passwd

778370
sudo	passwd
now sudo su and type passwd in if asked

778381
stdout	stderr
as you wrote it it first redirects stdout to the file and afterwards redirects stderr to stdout

778381
stdout	stderr
you don t necessarily need to redirect stderr into stdout to get both written into a file there s also an operator that directly redirects both stdout and stderr to a file

778381
stdout	stderr
redirects stdout and stderr to filename

778381

redirects stdout and stderr to the second command s stdin

778671

i would also prefer not to save my sudo passwd in plaintext

778680

that way you could use plain text like echo passwd | sudo -s script.sh in your script

i suppose someone could decompile but we re pretty far out there and then if that s the concern don t store your sudo passwd

the following command will pin the package to the older versioning so that it doesn t get updated when you do apt-get upgrade

i should point out the script doesn t actually do any installing - all it does is determine the debian ubuntu version you re on and configure the repository for it to get data from

so with upgrade i don t mean upgrading the same installation but setting up a new one

786339

next i d set ipv6 to ignore in network manager this example is for ethernet but you want wireless

786450
filesystems	ntfs
at least for fat12 fat16 fat32 exfat ntfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 and maybe for much more filesystems folders are a small file that identifies what folders and files are under it just like a phonebook list it only describes what is inside it beware only directly on it nothing about what is inside any sub folder

simple test would be redirect stdout and then stderr of the command to dev null and see what happens

786483
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr have meaning only when bound to processes

786542
sudo	passwd
after that in a terminal run sudo smbpasswd -a username where username is existing unix username and set your passwd and reboot

sysv	systemd
it was the case with sysv init and with upstart but it s not the case with systemd any more

787332
sysv	systemd
one of the issues that people have with systemd is that it doesn t run sysv init scripts

787332
sysv	systemd
it will be only a problem for people who happen to use any third-party or custom software that have their init scripts written for either sysv init or for upstart and those will need the init scripts rewritten before upgrading to a systemd with systemd or get the upstart installed which is also an option or migrate to a systemd that doesn t use systemd

787332
sysv	systemd
there is systemd-sysv-generator that is supposed to automatically translate sysv init scripts to systemd scripts but there are some bugs and a long list of explicit incompatibilities

if you replace the standard available repositories in etc apt sources.list with the current ones then your question makes no sense because this will upgrade the system anyway since it installs the latest versioning of software available in the repositories

this grants your user to use the sudo command on exactly that script without passwd

perhaps the most ubuntu way of seeing the source code for rsync as well as seeing the debian packaging and patching material is to activate the sources by following under xenial

792749
sudo	passwd
for security reasons commands like sudo that request a user s passwd set the terminal to no echo so people surfing your shoulder cannot grab your passwd

versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
if it can be useful i have upgrade the ubuntu versioning following a new installation from scratch therefore i doubt conflict with existing versioning and previous paths may be the cause

793114
uninstall	upgrade
however i can t uninstall them because then i get the same error as when i try to upgrade my system

793135
overwrite	preserve
however it doesn t preserve the folder structure and so any files or folders with the same name get overwrite

793156

i went to this link selected debian ubuntu and executed all those commands and i get the following output

793226

ubuntu	linux
some may argue this is bad practice a waste of hard disk space - but i use ubuntu because it s quick and usually works not because it saves me a few hundred megabytes of disk space over other linux distros.

793248
folder	directory
basically what happens is that all the files and folder in media data are drwxrwxrwx or -rwxrwxrwx depending on weather or not they are directory rather than drwxrwxr-x or -rwxrwxr-x as the ones i ve created in the home folder are

793248
folder	directory
giving any file or folder in the home directory as reference

793271
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
using sudo chmod sudo chown and sudo chattr all fail which i don t quite understand but i think is related to the file system being fat32

ubuntu	linux
to securely erase the contents of the disk leaving your computer without any trace of ubuntu or your files boot from a linux ubuntu live dvd usb and run

793351
switching	screens
as i understand it seems that the computer doesn t identify the edid of the second screens and to further confirm this hypothesis i can say that if i switching the cables connected to the splitter the resolution adapts to the best settings for the screens connected on port 1

793375
stdout	stderr
when i ran ls it gave me console full fuse kcore null ptmx random stderr stdin stdout tty urandom zero as the different files

2 on remote host you must use a complimentary public rsa dsa key placed in .ssh folder

793545
dpkg	apt
and the command that has failed before sudo apt upgrade run it again finished successfully and dpkg removed the error status for this package

793545
versioning	upgrade
after the next minor versioning upgrade of the mysqld debian package this problem with the var lib dpkg info mysql-server-5.7.postinst script can show up again

793566
dpkg	apt
it isn t possible using apt or apt-get because you don t have this version offline anymore but you can do this by downloading older version in .deb package and installing it by dpkg -i filename.deb

793584
sudo	passwd
as a side note if you are doing passwordless ssh you should not need to set root s login passwd although not doing so initially means you will need to manually copy the public key to root s authorized_keys file using sudo since you won t be able to use ssh-copy-id and you should use permitrootlogin without-password rather than permitrootlogin yes in the remote system s etc ssh sshd_config file

793630
ubuntu	debian
but the debian ubuntu service command is a shell script that tries to auto-detect whether upstart or systemd is the running system service manager and run the actual native service management commands for upstart and systemd

793645
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
if you are doing a fresh install and don t have any data on that machine that you want to keep then i would look into installing kubuntu which is a distribution of ubuntu but with the kde desktop already installed with all of it s dependencies instead of the gnome desktop that comes native with the standard ubuntu distributions

793650
sudo	passwd
if you don t want to have to enter your sudo passwd every time yr backup job runs or if you want it to run unattended then go to etc sudoers.d and sudo-edit the file 10_user or whatever name you choose with

ubuntu 16.04 had a lot of problem with external gpu nvidia or ati and with intel power states of 6th generation intel processors

794327
disk	ram
actually the filesystem is still mounted and some writes are buffered meaning they are still in ram waiting to be written to the disk

794336
mouse	keyboard
also the keyboard and mouse were not responsive.â ubuntu live is being loaded but you do not see it on the screen

794351
prng	random
some may suggest that you use dev random which is the device for pure random data - no pseudo-random - but for this purpose the chance of somebody managing to crack the prng seed and successfully mask out the data is essentially negligible

794366

with maptooutput you can specify a specific screens vga or screens size that can let you map the tablet area to two monitors

my setup is that i have an ssd for the os s and a hdd 1tb ntfs filesystems for all my files

794475
put	get
if you get a grub prompt but the computer is not booting to linux there is a good chance that when upgrading the computer someone reinstalled another version of linux and put the bootloader in a partition rather than the mbr but left the old grub in the mbr

ubuntu	linux	cpu	hyperthreading
this particular cpu features hyperthreading meaning that even though it only has two physical cores each of these is presented to the operating system as two separate cores for a total of 4 cores and as a result the os linux ubuntu can run four threads in total simultaneously thus improving performance

795279
cpu	processors
to check out a cpu i would recommend wikipedia s lists of intel processors

795279

ask passwd for sudo

796966

with that said you can use pkexec instead of sudo to get a prompt for a passwd before executing the script like so

then he asked passwd for the keyring he usually does and passwd for the device sudo passwd worked

hey all i m trying to convert a mac to a ubuntu linux system and am having trouble erasing all the software off the mac

797107
ubuntu	linux
this is a file for the booting of windows os so even though the linux server system has been installed to the hard drive the bios will still ignore the ubuntu s booting file which is located at efi ubuntu grubx64.efi causing the problem no boot device found

797116

note you ll get quicker response to bugs if you post directly on github

no you want amd64 which is for 64bit x86 cpus from amd or intel which is what you have

797334
ubuntu	linux
linux packs a almost all drivers into it s kernel but ubuntu uses mostly older kernels so new peripherals can also be tricky but this should be a matter of time before any missing drivers get implemented into the kernel

797334
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu en linux however should install perfectly alongside the existing windows os

797337
ubuntu	linux
the reason i jumped to linux on my home comp was because i was frustrated with win 10 s tendency to download and install the drivers but it seems ubuntu is doing the same as well

797353
put	get
secondly i would suggest creating a dedicated directory within var www such as cgi-bin where your cgi scripts get put and use that in the apache configuration

797385
free	malloc
bad memory will usually fail on malloc free but this might get complicated

797399
cpu	processors
in my experience triple faulting the cpu reboot triple will always reboot an intel processors and reboot pci should generally always work too

797401
folder	directory
or make a temporary folder called usb or something in your home directory and try mounting it there

797405

now we should create a filesystems for the partition that we just create to create a ntfs filesystems

i m sure you could find another 2 in 1 laptop quad-core 4gb and 128gb ssd for roughly the same price that is a bit more compatible out of the box with ubuntu linux in general being its a kernel issue

these toshiba series l15w have hard freezes in linux at seemingly random times all distro s i have installed have the same issue either debian based or rpm based so it most likely is a kernel issue with how it deals with the toshiba-wmi and toshiba_acpi kernel modules in linux

g++ is a front-end to gcc gnu compiler collection with some predefined c++ macros and different default options flags

g++	gcc
compiling c++ code with gcc is handy when g++ is not available for any number of reasons in fact it s just a matter of linking to the c++ library -lstdc++ and informing gcc to treat the input as c++ code either by using a .c extension or forcing the language with -x

stdout	stderr
merges stderr with stdout which can be useful if for example you want to pipe stderr text

799559
stdout	stderr
so for example if you want to see if a program prints a certain stderr message but don t want your screen filled with presumably unimportant garbage you could do something like which will search the stdout and stderr from a program called program for the word crashed

799559
stdout	stderr
on the other hand if you don t want a program to print anything at all you could simply run which will redirect both stderr and stdout to dev null a special file which magically makes things disappear

799559
stdout	stderr
or if you want to save the output of a program perhaps to report a bug or something you could redirect both stderr and stdout to a file will redirect all data to a file called log.txt

799559
stdout	stderr
if you wanted to you could redirect the stdout and stderr via or both of which would have the same effect as using

799559
stdout	stderr
if you do something like only stdout will be redirected but stderr can still be piped to another program such as cat which could be redirected as shown above

it s not an ideal solution because it involves manually editing files which are normally modified only by dpkg itself but running dpkg-reconfigure and apt --reinstall install didn t work for me

you ll likely need an already existing linux running will download ubuntu sources prepare the system with anything you want kernel in your case and then create an image out of it

803615
ubuntu	debian
if the fan is coming on under ubuntu but not for example debian i would suggest installing lm-sensors and p-sensors or xsensors and monitoring the utilisation and temperatures of the cpu and gpu to see what is getting hot

803616
debian	linux
that package s description copied from debian experimental in primary archive for debian gnu linux gives us a clue about how to handle this ourselves though

803616
dpkg	apt
notice there is no need to re-run dpkg after letting apt resolve dependencies

803616
ubuntu	debian
create a pinning file that tells apt to only consider packages that interest us we certainly don t want our entire ubuntu distribution upgraded with debian experimental packages

803616
vim	gedit	gedit	nano
you ll need superuser privileges so use one of sudo vim sudo nano gksudo gedit etc

803621
ubuntu	linux
although this question looks little weird because ubuntu is meant to be good on gui based linux

803641

create a folder in your johnny s home dir mkdir univerity_space

803654
sudo	gnome-terminal
running sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal gives me the following result

803655
ubuntu	linux
you should try easy-bcd software for windows in which you can add the grub 2.0 which is favourable for ubuntu as well as linux and after adding the grub 2.0 in that software by selecting the linux partition obviously you will have options for booting in edit boot menu settings

803661
opera	google-chrome
i m developing a webinterface so i installed opera and google-chrome on my kubuntu 16.04

it seems that after installing google-chrome some services use google-chrome es default browser though firefox is my default browser

before installing google-chrome everything just opened in firefox

google-chrome	firefox
only i had to remove google-chrome and firefox before because update-alternative got an error it said something like there are no browser installed

803698
ubuntu	debian
rinzwind is correct you can just download a server or minimal net install iso of debian or ubuntu and install it very quickly as a vm

803722
folder	directory
then you can delete all the folder inside that user directory .then mount it there mount dev sdxy media user sdcard

803724
versioning	upgrade
the problem is solved in versioning 230 - my existing containers were automatically moved into a non-privileged versioning after the upgrade

803769
ubuntu	linux
then choose the option ubuntu with linux 4.xx-xx-generic upstart

so keep in mind folks amazon instant video worked on google-chrome after i tried installing hal + ubuntu-restricted-extras + flash player to get it to work on firefox

803827
ubuntu	debian
so after these three i just used the graphical interface and downloaded directly from google s desktop site this version 64 bit .deb for debian ubuntu

803877
put	get
if nothing happens and you get no output from which it s possible that you put those files there yourself as root and they are being found by whereis even though they are not executable files

803947
ubuntu	mint
i still have the issue with ubuntu 14.04 as i had on mint 17.3

803975

this will work as long as the first digit of the debian ubuntu version number of the intel-microcode package is the same

apache	nginx
i m running nginx as a reverse proxy to apache

804001
ubuntu	linux
although ubuntu linux grub can detect any kind of os windows boot loader can t unless windows

804002

nginx mixing and matching ubuntu repositories and nginx team ppas on launchpad or debian repositories with upstream repositories will result in problems

804002

ubuntu debian or the ubuntu ppas and assuming you can â upgradeâ

804002
ubuntu	debian
neither debian nor ubuntu nor the ppas have naxsi in the

804002

problem 1 debian ubuntu nginx ppas maintained by yours truly have flavors

ubuntu debian ppas without issues and conflict between configuration

804002

now i know what youâ re thinking â œwhy would debian ubuntu include

in debian and ubuntu as of package version revision 1.6.2-2

804056
ubuntu	linux
as you can see from a picture taken from 16.04.x ubuntu kernel support of the kernel timeline for ubuntu 16.04 below the next version of the kernel will be a fork of version 4.8 of the mainline linux kernel

804060
ubuntu	linux
i never used linux or ubuntu before

804060
google-chrome	firefox
when i am using browsers such as firefox or google-chrome the pc freezes and can do nothing

804081
ubuntu	linux
so i manually created a 1tb partition on my hdd and installed ubuntu there but now i cannot boot into linux

804094
installation	upgrade
how can upgrade my previous ubuntu installation to ubuntu 16 without losing the dual-boot or windows

804127
ubuntu	linux
at that point instead of choosing ubuntu with linux x.y.z-nm-generic recovery mode press the e key

804127
sudo	passwd
change the passwd of your sudo administrative user

804139
mouse	keyboard
mouse keyboard touchscreen are not reacting - i have to power cycle the machine

804139
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade the kernel to versioning 4.6.4 the problem still exists

804144
ubuntu	linux
notably missing from this list is any flavour of linux client which leaves out ubuntu

804177
ubuntu	linux
install your favorite linux distribution ubuntu on the old partition as described by rob goss below

804210
h.265	hevc	h.264	h.265	h.264	hevc
according to wikipedia skylake igpus support hardware accelerated decoding of h.265 hevc h.264 mpeg-4 avc mpeg-2 vc-1 wmv9 jpeg mjpeg and vp9

804210
google-chrome	firefox
what packages do i need to install to enable hardware accelerated decoding of these formats in totem and google-chrome looks like firefox doesn t support hardware accelerated decoding at all

804211
google-chrome	firefox
move window east right side of screen and move window west left side of screen for some reason don t work on all applications notably firefox but google-chrome and others work

804220
folder	directory
i already deleted the folder from the cache and the config directory

804222
titlebar	window
this is normally used for dragging the window so while you re holding alt all windows will be draggable from anywhere not just the titlebar

804231
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux ubuntu 16.x version

804272
post	get
as suggested in another post i get

804289
jobs	cron
this happens because your cron jobs are producing output

804289
daemon	cron
and then the cron daemon tries to email that output to you.â

804289
stdout	stderr
if you want to ignore stdout and capture only stderr

ubuntu	linux
linux n00b here hoping to attempt my first dual boot ubuntu setup alongside windows been reading up on the partitioning scheme for 3 days solid now and just wanted to get some second opinions on what i ve come up with before taking the plunge

804308
ubuntu	linux
i use a lot of windows specific plugins so i m hoping to leave windows plenty of room to breathe but i also want to give linux a decent wedge have a reasonable shared ntfs volume for moving music files back and forth between windows linux and i d also like to ideally put a chunk aside for experimenting with alternative distros in future without having to wipe out my ubuntu installation

804313
folder	directory
just do a ls to see what folder are there in the directory and then replace that android-sdk-linux tools with something like android-sdk_r24.4.1-linux tools change that android-sdk_r24.4.1-linux according to the folder you find upon doing a ls whose name probably will begining with android

804313
folder	directory
here cd means change directory just like you normally do by double clicking on the folder icon thats just the command line way

804331
sudo	passwd
it asks for passwd for sudo bash then i have to type it no problem

804351
redhat	fedora
here re some good distros you could be interested in fedora very stable developed by redhat who re contributing into the ecosystem very very much

804354
cpu	processors
processors intel atom cpu d2500 1.86ghz 1.86ghz

804358
sudo	passwd
to allow the command to run without sudo asking for a passwd do the following

804371
sudo	passwd
the most common example is probably the sudo passwd prompt

804388
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i tried installing ubuntu 16.04 and linux mint 18 on separate partitions of a hard drive with two other partitions to be mounted as boot one for each

804388
ubuntu	mint
the first thing that seems to be out of order is that the installers of both ubuntu and mint asked me where to install the boot loaders despite that ubuntu s community documentation says

804388
ubuntu	mint
afterwards i installed mint and what happened was that ubuntu item in uefi boot menu started launching mint s grub instead of ubuntu s grub and i found no way to start ubuntu anymore

804388
ubuntu	mint
it turned out that mint had overwritten the efi ubuntu directory on esp with its own files

804409
switching	screens
i wonder because if i connect the device via a slimportad adapter to my external screens it does not switching into convergence mode

804409
mouse	keyboard
the screen of the nexus 4 can be used as keyboard and mouse touch pad

804411
versioning	upgrade
it seems that even doing an upgrade to current versioning doesn t work anymore

804414
google-chrome	firefox
browsers like firefox and google-chrome have dropped support for 32-bit at least they don t provide 32-bit windows installers anymore and more packages may follow

804429
put	get
i ve used different usb bootable programs like unetbootin to put an iso image into my usb and went into the boot menu to change the boot device but i get the message missing operating system before it starts my current os kubuntu again

804435
express	node.js
i have already installed node.js and node express

804446
versioning	upgrade
if you start with an older versioning and then upgrade i believe you can then later select a kernel on boot so if one panics you can select another

804468
ubuntu	linux
we should be here to install linux and kick s of non-standard hw and that should be all the talk about ubuntu and hw

804475
pop-up	dialog
if you want a pop-up dialog window use zenity like this

804503
ubuntu	debian
i do have a similar setup debian 8 file server several ubuntu kubuntu clients

804550
ubuntu	debian
note- you will need to upload the tar.gz you get after the debian packaging if you upload it to ubuntu software center

804551
sudo	gnome-terminal
45 minutes later sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal works and so does gnome-terminal

804619
kate	nano	kate	gedit	gedit	nano
use nano or kate or leafpad if you don t have the text editor gedit

804619
ethernet	wireless
next i d set ipv6 to ignore in network manager this example is for ethernet but you want wireless

804627
kde	kubuntu
i scrapped mate ubuntu and did a fresh install of kubuntu 16.04.1 apparently kde plays nicer with amdgpu-pro

804633
ubuntu	linux
by default ubuntu and in fact most linux distributions that i have seen disable ip forwarding for security which is in fact a sane default since this is only actually needed if your box is a router in this case that is exactly what you are setting up so you must enable ip forwarding

804647
folder	directory
i copied my sbin directory to my home so i can restore it later deleted my ubuntu s sbin and copied my bootable pendriver s sbin to my ubuntu root folder

804661
versioning	upgrade
i also upgrade apt to the latest versioning

804667
children	parent
what s the command to remove all children directories of a parent directory except one directory and its children

804683
folder	directory
in the hidden cache folder in your home directory there will be a file called something like event-sound-cache.tdb.641c9db826a44f28bb9596d6df3020c2.x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

804686
ubuntu	linux
i was wondering if there was a way to have ubuntu as just an application i can run whenever i want to use linux or if there was an easy way to transfer all of my files to ubuntu

804690
vmware	virtualbox
you install a virtualization tool like vmware or virtualbox in your host system windows then you can emulate a virtual computer running as application on your windows system

804765
ubuntu	linux
what interested me was the two-man rule or more specifically how to apply it to a linux in this case ubuntu system

804765
sudo	passwd
so to prevent it lets say i want each non-root user to require not only a passwd to run sudo but the confirmation of another user on the system who also has the same restriction

804789
virtualenv	conda
conda is a package manager that also allows you to create virtual environments so it is somewhat like pip + virtualenv

804789
virtualenv	conda
i personally don t use anaconda conda on my ubuntu machine since pip and virtualenv are good enough for my needs but you should definitely check out conda

804792
versioning	upgrade
so that i ve upgrade versioning of duply with 1.9.1-1 but still facing same error

804814
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu is a debian based linux operating system

804819
kde	cinnamon	opensuse	linux	opensuse	mint	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	mint	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde
but as i moved on linux and tested latest version of every distribution like ubuntu mint cinnamon mate kde xfce fedora workstation xubuntu and even opensuse i feel something wrong cause after a while and working on and doing nothing special web browsing with firefox or editing google docs when cpu temps goes high everything stops working and desktop freezes turning off and on is not effective either and it freezes in a less time duration because cpu is still hot

804829
versioning	upgrade
so i need to upgrade 15.04 seems to be the next step although possibly not the last to get to a supported versioning

804846
versioning	upgrade
previously package versioning to upgrade

804872
gedit	nano
it could be gedit or nano

805006
centos	linux
in our centos linux systems i noticed they dropped the denyhosts package and only offer fail2ban

805072
hex	binary
yep you may find a configuration file tacked to the end of the binary and some certificates if the binary is singed when you view the file in a hex editor. so just modify this code to your needs that it loads the grub.cfg you want and place it on your esp next to your bootx64.efi and bootia32.efi files

805076

set to your desired width and height

805108

it will upgrade all software installed from ubuntu repositories to new versioning

it seems that it is not able to cool the processors when cpu usage is high

805313
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu

805385
starttls	smtps
go to the settings of your selected account go to the page where the smtps server is specified change the port to the number your provider uses 465 instead of 587 which in my case was automatically assigned by evolution and select the correct method of authentification starttls

805403
nautilus	fstab
a workaround for this is to make permanent mounts for these partitions in fstab and make bookmarks for the mount points in nautilus or make symlinks to the home folder

805429
mouse	keyboard
as shown in select multiple non-consecutive files in nautilus using only the keyboard it is possible to make non-consecutive selection via holding ctrl press space once and use mouse to select multiple files

diffetent ways to uninstall those packages dpkg apt-get and apt remove apt purge etc.

i was running into a similar problem in kali linux which is based on ubuntu and what i found to work was

opera	google-chrome
so you in theory you should able to watch it but only on google-chrome or even on chromium vivaldi or opera if you correct load widevine and flash plugin

805809
installation	upgrade
due to some packaging issues the apt upgrade ends in limbo because the post installation script of mysql-server-5.7 fails to complete

you need to know a bit more about your system linux ubuntu than i consider average

810282
versioning	upgrade
when in doubt a fresh install is always cleaner and will make less problems than an upgrade system even if the old versioning was working well

810282
versioning	upgrade
as you say the old versioning is already messed up if the upgrade will run successfully which sounds rather unlikely given your explanations it will pretty surely not fix any problems but generate even more things that don t work

versioning	upgrade
so unless they upgrade to some newer versioning of itext you can expect most of the files to work but also bugs and errors with a tendency to grow over time

810623
versioning	upgrade
of course the best approach would be that your server is upgrade to the latest versioning 16.04 lts and have newer kernel versioning

810623

filesystems	ntfs
any changes that could be made to the ntfs filesystems from ubuntu would probably be lost when rebooting windows as it ll want to restore the last known condition of the filesystems from the hiberfil.sys

810760
versioning	upgrade
to solve this and prevent future headaches either consider upgrading to ubuntu s latest 16.04 which allows you to apt-get update apt-get upgrade to the latest python3 3.5 or use virtual environments to handle different python versioning

810778
versioning	upgrade
it simply updates your computer with the source information so that when you you will upgrade or install the latest versioning assuming you do sudo apt-get install right after doing sudo apt-get update

810950
sudo	passwd
i used sudo passwd in the terminal and it returned successful

810950

but the passwd has not changed - the is still needed to log in and do sudo commands

810958

to change your passwd do not use the sudo with the command

810969
for-loop	loops
your c-style for-loop syntax is almost correct except that in bash loops needs double parentheses

810994
sudo	passwd
the desktop where printer is attached needs to have samba server enabled as well as passwd for samba set via sudo smbpasswd -a user

810998
versioning	upgrade
then when you do an upgrade at a later stage it will see that it actually needed 10.1 so it will remove the 10.0 versioning

811019

811070
symlink	dotfiles
should i just put home on the spinning disk and be done with it or should i put it on the ssd so that it can have fast access to my dotfiles and then symlink documents music etc onto the spinning disk

so i installed ubuntu linux 16.04 lts a month ago and now i want to revert to windows

dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
also installing things from source and compiling yourself without them being in a debian package makes dpkg and higher level tools like apt and aptitude not aware of removing libraries that the tools depend on like libpcap and openssl via libssl -variants

811255
ubuntu	debian
asking in debian or ubuntu for a package like this is a very good way to have it included not only in your ubuntu release but with high probability in future ones so that you can keep using the program

for what it s worth at least for me netflix currently plays better in google-chrome than in firefox

make a system-wide edit that every command issued by your user with sudo is ran as superuser without prompting for passwd

sudo	passwd
the first command sudo simply caches your credentials so that you don t have to type your passwd when running sudo apt-mark several times

818907
versioning	upgrade
but if you re not really careful you can prevent a package from upgrading even without putting a hold on it directly because if the newer versioning of your package depends on a newer versioning of another package which has a hold neither can be upgrade without first removing the hold

mouse	keyboard	bluetooth	usb
your list needs to be expanded to include drivers for usb wifi ethernet bluetooth mouse keyboard touchpad laptop acpi s like my dell and toshiba you probably don t have cpu s gpu s etc

i am not a computer professional but using ubuntu from 10 onwards.my current versioning was 14.04 and i crashed it trying to upgrade it to 16.04 via terminal

819925
stdout	stderr
as far as i know it is also used to redirect file descriptors for example stdout stderr stdin of a bash-script

819925
stdout	stderr
so for example you could read from a file instead from the keyboard by using stdin redirection and write to a file instead of the terminal by stdout or could be stderr depending on program redirection

819950
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout stderr can be redirected to files using exec

819960
stdout	stderr
that permits performing redirection of stdin stderr stdout and other file descriptors to various files inside the shell script instead of command invocation string

820042
dpkg	apt
on the desktop python-minimal failed to install during the upgrade dpkg error processing python-minimal --configure breaking normal behaviour of apt dpkg which took some trouble too fix inability to shutdown on reboot an internal error about sbin cron also a lot of trouble

sudo passwd which changes the passwd of the root user

820100
udp	tcp
the proxies will handle exclusively tcp packets and udp packets if you have a socks proxy

820107
stdout	stderr
that s presumably because the outputs you are still getting are being sent on the stderr file descriptor 2 stream not on the stdout file descriptor 1 stream

820107
stdout	stderr
normally warning and error messages are sent on the stderr and regular output on stdout stream

820107
bash	zsh
or in bash or zsh ksh

udp	tcp
upon any network activity like using a browser or playing games your browser sends tcp or udp packets to a gateway and this traffic is publicily seen and could be sniffed

pop-up	dialog	sudo	passwd
install the gksu package if not done already and use gksudo to get a gui passwd entry dialog pop-up instead of being asked on the terminal console like sudo does which is not present when you run it as keyboard shortcut and therefore does not work

821923
sudo	passwd
write a short script to change the brightness and then configure sudo s nopasswd option so that you can run it as root without getting asked for a passwd

821923

relevant question how do i run specific sudo commands without a passwd

821923
sudo	passwd
now you can configure sudo to allow running this script as root without passwd

821923

verify it is working by first running sudo -k to revoke your cached passwd just in case you entered it within the last 15 minutes in the current shell session

824397
ubuntu	linux
i am working on linux ubuntu 16.04 and i have installed r 3.2

824408
ubuntu	debian
for me it seems like you added apt sources from debian etch which is a really old debian version to your ubuntu 16.04 sources.list

824408
ubuntu	linux
if it comes to ubuntu or other linux distributions - if a command needs sudo permissions - please read and try to understand what the command is supposed to do - before you even consider executing it

824432
sudo	passwd
hopefully you got no errors you can then install the package with sudo make install you need admin rights to write to usr local - therefore you need sudo with your user passwd

824435
ethernet	wireless
the nmcli on ubuntu 14.04 lts can connect to a wireless network see the last example in its document but i want to create an ethernet connection

824442
dpkg	apt
to resolve this i eventually copied the .deb file which sudo apt -f install dumped the name of and path to should contain libpcre3 in this case to cwd user root and ran sudo dpkg --force-all -i libpcre .deb which fixed all the other problems

824460
post	get
update i have found this post that helped me disable apport but this still doesnt explain why i get an error messages and what is really happening to my os

824605
versioning	upgrade
either upgrade vnc server to a more recent versioning from realvnc or select a weaker level of encryption

824607
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu touch by default shaves a lot of drivers so much for being same linux as desktop as it needs every mb to run unity

824608
versioning	upgrade
from there you want to actually upgrade to ubuntu 16.04 because your current versioning is no longer supported

824609
ubuntu	debian
i tried ubuntu debian and nothing works and also with wierd issues for example in arch kernel panic reboot when loads some files device didnt show before 30 sec in ubuntu when i reached de shows me error and couldn t continue in debian is where i went further i could make the partitions but when debian had to install the system errors like x file is corrupted shows up

824611
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint 18 - which is essentially ubuntu 16.04

824612
ubuntu	debian
hackish way would be to get the exact style from ctan and add it to the project folder however casually ubuntu debian have the texlive-latex-extra package 500mb vailable to install which installs most of known common styles and latex packages

824743
rar	zip
in total commander on windows i can open supported archive zip tar rar etc. as if it was an ordinary directory and browse the contents

if you try to specify a number outside this range it will be taken modulo 256 add or subtract 255 from your number until it fits the range 0-255

824933

use a language such as bash php to grab the contents of specific https sites like twitter that the user has requested not breaking ssl

824936

you can juju ssh into landscape-server 0 without the long sudo line that will get you into that node as ubuntu which can sudo to any other user without a passwd including landscape

versioning	upgrade
ubuntu 16.04 ships with kernel versioning 4.4 but some have had to upgrade to 4.7.3 like yours truly

825036

you should edit your question and put in the versioning you upgrade from ie 14.04 or 15.04 etc

for a strange and unknown reason since yesterday my virtualbox vmware 12 running well win10 trying for few weeks has started to totally get my pc planted

some of these pages are geared toward helping you install ubuntu or linux which of course you ve already done

825424

my current need is to look for photos in portrait mode as against landscape mode

825424
width	height
i have managed to get the right commands to get width and height of images

825424
width	height
how could i combine this with the find command so that i can find images where height is larger than width

825439
ubuntu	debian
got the same error while installing debian so i think this could also work with ubuntu because it is based on debian

825452
traceroute	packets
you might also try traceroute -n nas-server to see the way that your ip packets take

825497
ubuntu	debian
they can work all that is needed in most modern ubuntu debian distros is

825517
mouse	keyboard
you can use any type of bluetooth mouse or keyboard which supports the normal bluetooth standard of your device

825520
ubuntu	mint
the ubuntu version of add-apt-repository does not look for that script but...the mint version does

825537
google-chrome	firefox
in contrast to google-chrome or chromium firefox uses bookmark tags

825543
dpkg	apt
dpkg apt locks var lib dpkg to ensure that it can install software in peace without causing any conflicts to the database of installed packages present at var lib dpkg status

825543
dpkg	apt
only do this if you re 100 sure that apt or dpkg isn t running

825543
dpkg	apt
you can check this by running ps -aux | grep dpkg or ps -aux | grep apt

825543
dpkg	apt
if you do forcefully kill apt and break the lock it s a very good idea to run dpkg --configure -a to let dpkg fix what was potentially broken

825555
google-chrome	firefox
for example google-chrome currently does not but firefox does

825570
udp	tcp
something like this docklight scripting â simulating and testing tcp udp applications

825583
bluetooth	usb
if you want your usb or bluetooth audio device to be recognized automatically on connection you need to right-click on kde sound indicator and select audio setup in the menu

825586
division	multiplication
precedence of division and multiplication are same and same precedent operators are always executed left to right as they are placed in the expression

825586
division	multiplication
one work around will be to do the multiplication first and then the division so bash never has to handle non-integer value

825602
mouse	keyboard
if xserver launch i get none input mouse keyboard

825654
bash	zsh
now as you got zsh as the default shell instead of bash to get a fuzzy completion add this to .zshrc file

825654
bash	zsh
nb usefulness of zsh is that it is very extensible and in many ways compatible to bash

825654
fish	bash	fish	zsh	bash	zsh
on the opposite fish another alternative to bash which is pretty much like a configured zsh in my experience causes many incompatibility problems

825675
kde	gnome
how i can install gnome and kde on my old machine

825725
versioning	upgrade
i was using ubuntu 14.04 until yesterday and thought maybe it s time to upgrade to the new versioning

825768
ubuntu	linux
i am quite new to linux and i ve setup a ubuntu 14 box with sendmail

825773
bluetooth	usb
i just got a dualshock 3 controller and since my pc ubuntu 16.04.1 has no bluetooth i m connecting it by usb

825782
ubuntu	linux
and to boot ubuntu or any linux distribution from the windows boot loader it launches grub2

825782
ubuntu	linux
a final twist on this is that the linux kernel can function as its own efi boot loader so if you use a pure boot manager you can omit grub2 entirely when booting ubuntu

825782
ubuntu	linux
this is easier with refind than with systemd-boot because the latter can only launch programs from the partition on which it resides and linux kernels don t ordinarily reside on that partition under ubuntu

825782
ubuntu	linux
refind includes efi filesystem drivers and can launch boot loaders from any partition the efi can read so refind can live on the efi system partition esp and launch a linux kernel that s stored on a separate ubuntu partition

825787
ubuntu	linux
the reason is that this order will cause the refind-install script to set up a filesystem driver that will enable refind to launch the linux kernel directly and in efi mode rather than relying on either bios-mode or efi-mode grub to get ubuntu to boot

825792
folder	directory
you can add your own item by modify the user-dirs.dirs file just create a folder in home directory then add your location to the file like following

825802
dpkg	apt
run apt install snapd if it argues about canceled dpkg processes use dpkg --configure -a

in this post i attached the kernel panic that i get

825853
chown	sudo
i then had to follow the advice on this page and used sudo chown username username .xauthority

825872
sudo	passwd
ubuntu does not ask for the root passwd during setup only a user account passwd of a user that will have sudo access leaving the root account disabled in ubuntu

825873
sudo	passwd
passwd for the account and instead uses sudo to grant superuser

825873
sudo	passwd
normally though you should use sudo and your own passwd to authenticate or to start a root shell use sudo -i

825876
sudo	passwd
if you want to use su then you can run sudo passwd root and set the passwd you want to use to log in with su

825979
ubuntu	debian
be advised there are instructions on nvidia site about disadvantages of upgrading debian which ubuntu is based on versus clean install

dpkg	apt
find the package that owns the files with dpkg -s usr include c++ 4.9 then reinstall it with sudo apt install --reinstall package-name-you-got

826071
kde	gnome
the problem is that kde is only partially installed so it is conflicting with gnome and the package manager

826082
folder	directory
i copied three folder from three different directory

826083
apache	nginx
i was using nginx on ubuntu 14.04 i hope this works for apache too

826109
cat	tee
although it would be possible to script something using find and md5sum it will almost certainly be easier to use the --checksum option of rsync in dry run mode using the --dry-run or -n flag as described here verify backup integrity with rsync sed cat and tee

826114
folder	directory
i installed open openjre using terminal sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre because i wanted to run a script file in terminal which requires jre after installation some new folder came up in home directory i want to know from where does these folder came from and how can i remove them

826116
dpkg	apt
what i didn t realize is that i also had fusion directory installed as well and now i cannot reinstall either apache or fusion directory as i get an error any time i attempt an operation with apt dpkg

826120
folder	directory
some new folder came up in home directory

826142
kde	gnome
if you need to use graphics cards then using gnome or kde is not possible

826152
versioning	upgrade
the package will remain functional unless the new versioning 16.04 upgrade some dependencies like libraries that now causes the package to break or have weird behavior

826156
ubuntu	linux
this morning i installed playon linux wine in order to have some microsoft windows software installed on my ubuntu pc

826160

logically i enter the passwd ricardo is the user who has permissions to use sudo

this misbehaviour does not appear in lubuntu 16.04 so you should upgrade to that versioning

826225
debian-based	ubuntu
in ubuntu 16.04 xenial xerus should work also on debian-based

826247
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
on ubuntu 15.10 16.04 and linux mint 18 you can still use the qtsixa ppa but specifying vivid as the ubuntu version 15.04 since that was the last officially supported version

826286
ubuntu	linux
if the remote os is ubuntu or another gnu linux based distribution a very simple way to figure out what shell you are running is to run this command

826286
ubuntu	linux
if the remote os is not ubuntu or at least a similar gnu linux distribution you asked in the wrong site

826329
filesystems	ntfs
because every os uses a different filesystems namely ext4 for ubuntu and ntfs for windows i suggest partitioning using gparted from a ubuntu live usb stick install windows then install ubuntu

826405
kate	gedit	kate	jedit
another is to use select all then copy and paste to put the contents elsewhere like in libreoffice writer or gedit leafpad kate jedit cream are reasonable alternatives

hmac	pbkdf2
the default method that works for all odf 1.0 1.1 1.2 documents in packages odt odp and ods files is by password based key derivation pbkdf2 using hmac and sha1 starting with an sha1 digest of the utf-8 user-chosen password

827196
pbkdf2	salt
this digest is used to produce a derived key by undergoing key stretching with pbkdf2 using hmac-sha-1 with a salt of arbitrary length in odf 1.2 â it s 16 bytes in odf 1.1 and below generated by the random number generator for an arbitrary iteration count 1024 by default in odf 1.2

827196
des	aes
odf 1.0 and 1.1 use blowfish in 8-bit cipher feedback mode while odf 1.2 considers it a legacy algorithm and allows triple des and aes with 128 196 or 256 bits both in cipher block chaining mode to be used instead

however if i select linux there is a small annoyance where it goes to grub and asks me again if i want to boot to ubuntu or windows 10

830801
ubuntu	linux
but is there a way to completely remove grub just for organization space considerations and rely entirely on the windows booter to boot linux ubuntu

830803
ubuntu	linuxmint
having ubuntu 14.04 lts also try with linuxmint 17 3 with jdk 8 same result

those don t need to be on ram the reading table all the time they might be stored on your disk the bookshelf

831109
disk	ram
if the ram is full and the cpu needs to read write on those pages stored on disk one of the pages on ram will be stored on disk and the page requested will be loaded on ram

831109

the sshfs folder mounts and the directory permissions look the same as they are on the remote machine but when i try to modify add a file on the file system that belongs to the owning user i get a permission denied error

the second use of sudo in a term session doesn t require a passwd so it knows i have access to root so why can t i just type mkdir directory without sudo

your sudo remembering your passwd is a convenience feature more than anything

if you re talking about bypassing the need for a sudo passwd that is still doable but less of a good idea

that and if you disable sudo passwd enforcement you open a rather broad attack vector to malware and the like

i am new to linux and i just converted a machine to ubuntu

834646

the install path for debian is more complicated than ubuntu though

834666
folder	directory
for instance i could put stuff after it such as files and folder in the directory and it would still show the same as well as actually go to the right places i would be able to actually go to which is seemingly acting the same as and this appears to be the only difference

hash	md5
generally two files can have the same md5 hash only if their contents are exactly the same

834821
hash	md5
since the number of different possible file contents is infinite and the number of different possible md5 sums is finite there is a possibility though small probability in most cases of collision of hash

834821
hash	md5
in other words two different files can produce the same sum when hash with md5

834826
ubuntu	opensuse
the solution for the problem is the option -w ubuntu or -t opensuse

it is probably helpful to think of ubuntu as a family of linux distributions

835047
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linux	debian	mint
fedora mint arch and debian are examples of other families of linux distributions ubuntu is a family within the debian family

835047
ubuntu	debian
often a particular program will be available as a binary executable using the package manager apt for ubuntu and other members of the debian family

835047

to my knowledge i have followed the disk partitioning to the letter - my system runs on 1.6ghz and has 4gb ram and 256gb hard drive....so now i m opting for xubuntu because the latest version of ubuntu requires at least 2ghz processor

sudo	passwd
if we fire a command with sudo in terminal it asks for passwd for the first time and if we fire another command with sudo immediately in same terminal it won t ask for passwd again

sudo	passwd
you wouldn t use sudo if you had to type your passwd every 2 seconds

839557
sudo	passwd
sudo does not remember your passwd

sudo	passwd
if a sudo command in the same terminal is executed by the same user in a short period of time 15 minutes by default sudo just doesn t ask for the passwd again

839557
sudo	passwd
sudo needs your passwd to make sure you are really you and not someone else while you re away drinking coffee

839852
folder	directory
but in my usr src directory is no lib folder

839852
ubuntu	linux
now i guess because ubuntu has slightly different structures than other linux distros this libary is somewhere else

839857
versioning	upgrade
i have a ubuntu root since years and sometimes upgrade the ubuntu versioning whenever my hosting provider offered an update or if i was brave enough to update it

839872
google-chrome	firefox

you seem to be confusing two different methods of invoking cron jobs

840063

840669
versioning	upgrade
one reason that i would encourage this approach has to do with the upgrade of php from versioning 5 to versioning 7 which is now the default versioning

g++	gcc
i have rm-r all the files starting with gcc and g++ from my usr bin

the problem i m having is actually getting onto the media itself i can get onto the ubuntu loading dots then after that there s usually a message that says can t find usb interrupt point which is normal for my corsair keyboard and mouse but then after that is where i have the problem

on ubuntu linux you can switch java version using

841046
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	debian	centos	debian	linux
in general anything that would be called kernel in rh centos land will be called linux in ubuntu since ubuntu is based on debian which has versions with other kernels like gnu hurd and bsd

841049
x86	64bit
you have an x86 i386 processor which means that you cannot use the 64bit versions of steam and or wine

841063
filesystems	btrfs
then create one large partition on the new drive format it with your chosen filesystems ext4 btrfs etc. and then copy the entire contents of the older drive s filesystems

...taskset is used to set or retrieve the cpu affinity of a running process given its pid or to launch a new command with a given cpu affinity

841237
cpu	affinity
cpu affinity is a scheduler property that bonds a process to a given set of cpus on the system

841237

chown	sudo
sudo chown subhadip instead of sudo chown myapp

841295
chown	sudo
by sudo chown -r root stopped operation as its wrong

841318
cpu	processors
however there is a current and unfortunately persistent c-state bug regarding current skylake cpus- skylake processors are unable to achieve a sleep state farther than c3 resulting in increase power drain and reducing the life of the cpu aka worse battery life when sleeping idle

841326
ubuntu	linux
generally ubuntu and linux in general has no problem with hardware there are some issues with specific graphic and wireless cards tho

841358
mouse	keyboard
if i move my mouse outside of the atril window to write the contents of the pdf by keyboard into an other field or copy paste something my view on the pdf changes

opera	google-chrome
that help page is seriously outdated â œthis document was last updated for opera 11.00â while the current version is 41 and opera completely switched the rendering engine to blink the same as in chromium google-chrome in the mean time

841597
opera	google-chrome
this package will install the ppapi flash player plug-in included with google-chrome which will work with opera too otherwise they wouldn t suggest it

841599
kate	nano	kate	gedit	gedit	nano
use nano or kate or leafpad if you don t have the text editor gedit

this is a fair assumption for a phone because they typically use compressed audio whereas wav files are large uncompressed pcm data that is more common in music production

841729
tunnel	vpn
my main issue is the first point because i want to use ssh to connect to my vps because i can t do it normally on a network that i use a lot and i really don t want to use a mobile hotspot. i included the second point because i m not sure which environment i should let handle the network settings with vpn tunnel or if they even conflict at all

move	drag
drag the right edge of the partition leftward to resize move it as far as it would go

842062
ubuntu	linux
first of all i am completely newbie to linux and i started using ubuntu because windows10 had so many backround processes which made my experience very poor

842089
filesystems	fat
then modify the grub boot command to eliminate the preseed business because the fat filesystems cannot have the ubuntu link

842089
filesystems	fat
just copying all the files from the iso to a fat filesystems would result in a working uefi boot but the missing link capability results in kernel arguments like file cdrom preseed ... which do not name existing files

842103
ubuntu	linux
first of all i want to let you know that i am a complete ubuntu and linux in general beginner basically what you can call a newbie

one might suspect that this implies that my versioning of git is out of date but when i go to upgrade it i m told it s already the newest versioning

842196
ubuntu	linux
indeed with perhaps 3 of the population wild guess using linux ubuntu at home it s a good idea for system administrators to protect against the e function on production systems at work

switching	screens
i ve been using an external monitor for a month without any problems windows 10 and elementary os today i decided to switching to ubuntu 14.04.5 32bit when i boot using a usb key the monitor only display half of the screens as you can see in the picture and the mouse cursor can slip to the left side

cpu	hyperthreading
when you are looking at the cpu or load factor you have to divide by the number of cpu cores x hyperthreading

842214
cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
so if you have a quad core processors with hyperthreading it s in interpreted as 8 cpu s

the compatibility flag on the bluetooth daemons is needed you have to edit etc systemd systemd dbus-org.bluez.service with the editor of your choice by adding the -c flag to the end of the line

mouse	keyboard
essentially the virtual core pointer keyboard can be delegated by software and hardware to perform certain tasks like capturing your mouse or enabling multiple mouse cursors

842692
ubuntu	opensuse
for example if you are targeting ubuntu fedora and opensuse then you need to gather all libraries and other dependencies that your app requires to run that are not part of ubuntu fedora and opensuse in the default installation

if you installed those daemons from the ubuntu package systemd with apt on the command line a gui like the software center etc. there will be updates for them as well as long as the respective ubuntu version gets updates

842829
ubuntu	linux
the boot process on a bios-based computer that uses grub to boot ubuntu or any other linux goes something like this

grub reads the kernel and initial ram disk initrd file then executes the kernel

mouse	keyboard
however when i load the os once i get to the gui my mouse and keyboard stop working

842839

i recommend you to shrink the windows 10 partition on the 1tb hdd and create another partition of ntfs filesystems so that you can use it for data stuff which can be accessed by both windows 10 and ubuntu

however it s safer to have a sudo passwd which is different from your login passwordâ in which you are right in that it s safer to use asymmetric encryption for log-in ie

i can use sudo gnome-terminal to launch a new terminal window with root privileges but i want a solution that i can use from the same non-root terminal window

851696
mouse	keyboard
a potential cause for the freezing of the keyboard and mouse on ubuntu 16.0.1 is that the ubuntu system is under excessive load for instance runs very low on ram when the input freezes

851696
mouse	keyboard
while freezing may be an issue with your mouse or keyboard driver in my experience occasional or hickup freezing of the mouse or the keyboard is often a symptom of other issues with your system

851696

i figured it out finally by installing the ubuntu with the video card on my motherboard in other word connect your screens to any video card that could at least allow you to install the system first then switching back after you ve set up

851784
ethernet	wireless
reboot and your ethernet should work what happens when the sta driver is installed it blacklists the b43 driver for which i suspect your wireless device needs and the b44 ssb driver for the ethernet device and the above command removes the sta driver and the blacklist of the b43 b44 ssb drivers all at once

852494
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu tends to change very little under the hood unless a major change is made in debian unstable which ubuntu is based on

852494
filesystems	btrfs
chances are unless debian adopts btrfs as it s default filesystems which most likely isn t going to happen anytime soon ext4 will remain the default filesystems for a long time

852528
sudo	passwd
the passwd is required because it s using sudo to run the actual installation as root

you may be able to address this by modifying etc sudoers to allow it to run apt-get and dpkg without a passwd see or this post run apt-get without sudo

when i try to use sudo it asks for the root passwd rather than my passwd

versioning	upgrade
is it possible to upgrade nautilus on 14.04 lts to the versioning that ships with 16.04 lts

852832
ubuntu	linux
complicating this is the fact that ubuntu s grub configuration requires that grub be able to read both its configuration file grub.cfg and the linux kernel both of which go in boot on ubuntu

852837
ubuntu	linux
without either grub 2 or some other boot loader the linux kernel can t load so ubuntu won t run

852850
xfce	kde
ubuntu uses to come pre-installed with unity which is a resources demanding desktop environment but you may experience a better performance by using let s say xfce lxde or even kde

852869

you can get ppa for atom-editor and sublimetext also from here

versioning	upgrade
i think possible to upgrade while skipping a versioning but i wouldn t recommend doing so as it could result in various problems after the upgrade

853130
opera	google-chrome
also you can use opera browser which is based on google-chrome mostly

853142
versioning	upgrade
you probably have set in software and upgrade that you should be notified only about new lts long term support versioning

854538
disk	ram
if there is enough ram in your computer it should be possible to detach the dvd disk if you add the boot option toram because it means that the system will write the content of the dvd disk into ram and use that image instead of reading files from the disk

854812
ubuntu	debian
the debian ubuntu folks break up the different pieces in a way that makes setting this up more difficult for me

854813
filesystems	ntfs
another alternative would be to create a partition with the ntfs filesystems in the memory stick and to run the following command in windows in order to mark the bad clusters so that the filesystems can avoid using them

854840

after installing ssmtp sudo apt install ssmtp is all it takes go to passwd security settings and create an app passwd

versioning	upgrade
and that script was written by the maker of the computer for just that model. i would think that a majority of experienced ubuntu users don t bother with the automatic upgrade but rather copy their personal files off or use a separate partition for home wipe the ubuntu partitions and do a fresh install of the newer versioning

856258
sysv	systemd
the service is instead loaded by a shim that allows systemd to manage services that use the older sysv init scripts

there is no umbrella samba.target to do the original job of the old debian ubuntu samba van smoorenburg rc script

860147
stdout	stderr
this apparently redirects stderr to stdout first and then the resulting stdout is redirected to file.txt

860147

one would naturally read this as assuming execution from left to right the command being executed first the stderr being redirected to stdout and then the resulting stdout being written to file.txt

860168
stdout	stderr
but actually we can redirect stdout to stderr after redirecting stderr to a file with the same effect

860168
stdout	stderr
so in the shell sends stdout to a file then sends stderr to stdout which is being sent to a file

860168
stdout	stderr
whereas in the shell first redirects stderr to stdout ie displays it in the terminal where stdout normally goes and then afterwards redirects stdout to the file

860168
stdout	stderr
tlcl is misleading in saying that we must redirect stdout first since we can redirect stderr to a file first and then send stdout to it

860168
stdout	stderr
what we cannot do is redirect stdout to stderr or vice versa before redirection to a file

860168
stdout	stderr
we might think this would dispose of stdout to the same place as stderr but it doesn t it redirects stdout to stderr the screen first and then only redirects stderr as when we tried it the other way round.

860169
stdout	stderr
when you run stderr is redirected by to where stdout currently goes your terminal

860169
stdout	stderr
after that stdout is redirected to the file by but stderr is not redirected with it so stays as terminal output

860169
stdout	stderr
with stdout is first redirected to the file by then redirects stderr to where stdout is going which is the file

860302

ubuntu linux is built off of unix

both use entirely different rendering apis - microsoft uses directx can use opengl while linux relies on opengl note this is likely to change with the introduction of vulkan which is the cross-platform equivalent of directx 12

chown	sudo	chown	chmod

note the remote ubuntu version is 16.04.1 lts gnu linux 4.4.0-47-generic x86_64

860380
stdout	stderr
by convention stdin 0 stdout 1 stderr 2 note that the terms stdin etc

860380
stdout	stderr
this apparently redirects stderr to stdout first and then the resulting stdout is redirected to file.txt

860380
stdout	stderr
file descriptors are not pointing to each other recursively it makes no sense to think redirect stderr to stdout

860380
stdout	stderr
the correct thought is point stderr to wherever stdout points

860380
stdout	stderr
if you change stdout later stderr stays where it is it does not magically go along with further changes to stdout

in ubuntu and other linux distros you can run mkusb maybe you want to try the next mkusb now with the name dus according the following links

860560
filesystems	fat
as a general rule any storage device you ll want need to take to multiple systems needs to have an ms-dos type partition table and fat16 or fat32 filesystems since fat is the most universally supported format

860573
stdout	stderr
this is confusing to me since i thought that redirects only the stderr while or redirects the stdout

860628
vim	gedit	gedit	nano
you can edit it with any editor for example gedit or in text mode with nano or vim

860635

chown	chmod
p s currently i have to do chown and chmod manually for the file described above to be able to edit it from ubuntu16.04 - but it s just so inconvenient

860731
ubuntu	debian
it is important to note that ubuntu and debian do not verify gpg signatures of packages -- it is disabled by default and terribly terribly difficult to get working

860746
ubuntu	linux
the message you are getting is not from ubuntu or linux but from windows which i presume is already installed on your computer

860766
sudo	passwd
however when you type sudo and are prompted for a passwd nothing appears as you type

860766
sudo	passwd
how can you make stars appear when you type sudo passwd

860767
sudo	passwd
after entering sudo at the terminal if you want stars asterisks to appear with each passwd character you type you need to configure it using

860767
sudo	passwd
also on this example the timeout value has been set to 120 minutes 2 hours so that you aren t constantly prompted for sudo passwd every 15 minutes

861169
sudoers	visudo
you need to add the following line to sudoers command environment section with sudo visudo

861169
ubuntu	debian
there is a difference between debian and ubuntu in a way sudo command handles by default the home variable specifically this variable not the whole environment

861174

but after that i m unable to proceed with other installation and upgrade

861205
folder	directory
navigate to the sys os glnxa64 directory within this folder

861233
stdout	stderr
also it will write all the output written to stdout by default because the gtk and other warnings are sent to stderr so it parses stderr not stdout by default

861506
versioning	upgrade
the popularity of this approach with experienced users shows that many people have come to distrust the upgrade script. if you re taking my advice and installing the new versioning of ubuntu from scratch you might choose to give home its own partition while you re installing ubuntu just to make the process easier next time

861522

if you are more adventurous you can try the kubuntu backports ppa which very recently 6 days ago at the time of writing added kde plasma 5.8.4 packages

you can also let mkusb do the whole job and create a partition table plus an ntfs filesystems which you want

861587

since you are dealing with an older mobile broadband modem probably a qualcomm gobi 1000 or 2000 in combination with a newer linux kernel you will need to blacklist the qmi_wwan and cdc_wdm kernel modules when upgrading from x ubuntu lts 14.04 to x ubuntu lts 16.04

then simply type into the terminal encfs encrypted visible to create folder in the current directory named encrypted and visible and set up a password

download and burn a live dvd of the same versioning of ubuntu you were using before the attempted upgrade

863692
dpkg	apt
use dpkg to reconfigure your installed packages and apt to complete the upgrade

this will have dpkg try and fix whatever is currently broken in your packages then gets apt to update your repositories and then finish the upgrade

because of that i read about the linux and realize ubuntu linux is better than windows

864551
google-chrome	firefox
if you go to the windows 10 iso download page from your ubuntu computer either firefox or google-chrome will do - and likely many other browsers but it must be from ubuntu or else microsoft will just redirect to to the exe file you d be able to select and download an iso image for windows 10 after which you can use the ubuntu dvd creator to burn the iso image to a blank dvd assuming you have a dvd drive available

disk	ram
the hard disk is running 1 million times slower than ram

864645
disk	ram
we sacrifice a very tiny amount of cpu load and a very tiny small amount of ram to get more gb of ram but ram is 1 million times faster than the hard disk so trust me it s worth it this is the easiest explanation for everyone to understand

864669
gedit	nano
else edit your sources.list manual and comment out or delete any repo you think might be causing problems.use gedit or nano any test editor like sudo gedit etc apt sources.list

864759
ubuntu	linux
you are basically asking how to create an own linux distro based on ubuntu server.

864806
disk	ram
whether the storage medium you use is a cf card a cfast card a hdd an ssd a random thumb drive you picked up or something virtual like a ram disk or a raid doesn t matter

864876
cinnamon	gnome
in ubuntu gnome cinnamon there isn t an option for it in the keyboard layouts options

sudo	passwd
sudo will ask for a passwd so enter that in and the program will be deleted in a short amount of time

mouse	keyboard
i have a logitech g9x mouse which implements both a keyboard and mouse interface

864932

the xinput mouse is using the device node for the keyboard dev input event16 instead of the device node for the mouse dev input event15

daemon	cron
the cron daemon is disabled unlikely but still

864965
daemon	cron
if none of these work post the logs of the cron daemon

865026
folder	directory
of course if that s not an option then your only really safe option is to configure multiple user accounts one for each user with different home folder and do not allow them access to your own home directory or access to any other user s home directory

865026
sudo	passwd
and then keep everything you don t want them touching in your home directory and don t give them sudo access the root passwd or share your passwd with them

865027
chmod	rmdir
as with chmod using setfacl -m to prevent specific users from running rm and rmdir applies to those system-provided commands only

filesystems	btrfs
my problem is that samba seems to never call my dfree command and just shows the btrfs filesystems s available free space

i have tried to install various linux distributions to my sisters laptop ubuntu lubuntu lite mate debian... the only one that worked without hassle was lubuntu 12.04 but i was not impressed with lxde and i was also little concerned about the security of an old release

865106
sudo	passwd
we then follow the sudo command with a which exits the following command -- in this case rm only if the previous command exits with status 0 -- ie they got the passwd right

865139
sudo	passwd
usr bin sudo and usr bin passwd can do that because they have the setuid bit set as shown by the s that appears in the leftmost column when you run ls -l

865139
sudo	passwd
this makes it so that no matter who runs passwd or sudo it actually runs as the root user since root is the owner of the executable

865139
sudo	passwd
except for any security vulnerabilities that haven t been discovered yet or that have been discovered but haven t yet been patched sudo and passwd are safe because those utilities are very carefully written so they can only do things that the caller ought to be allowed to do

865139
sudo	passwd
utilities like sudo and passwd check who s really running them and check that something is permitted before doing it

os linux ubuntu 16.10 64-bit

865172
restrict	shared
this can be set globally in the networking section of smb.conf or you can set it individually on each shared you want to restrict

865181
filesystems	xfs
this is quite interesting but it is that xfs keeps metadata about the files in the xfs filesystems internally but this does not seem to be picked up by du that much but is by df

865186
xfs	btrfs
well this is a bit of a wierd way to do this if you want to automatically create the swap efi boot partitions and bootloader install with ext4 boot back into the installer then you can do something more simple of deleting the ext4 partition create an xfs or btrfs partition format it click next and then the install will just go on

versioning	upgrade
i figured it out myself the problem was i had upgrade my gnome terminal by using the gnome3-staging ppa and had neither disabled nor purged it so when i added the ppas for the theme i got the wrong versioning and the wrong libraries which did not seem to play well with my unity

i m relatively new to ubuntu and linux in general so i apologize if i sound a bit green.

865338

i have tried fedora kubuntu and ubuntu studio but they are all similar in the sense that you have to know what s going on in the linux matrix in order to do the simplest things

filesystems	ntfs
sda6 does not indicate ntfs filesystems reasonable to conclude windows is not using it

865499
mouse	keyboard
the mouse doesn t have drives in the install iso so i m stuck managing through the install menu using a keyboard

865505
stdout	stderr
however since the command is running its output both stdout and stderr are still connected to your current terminal and that s why you still see them

dpkg	apt
beware that localepurge will be automagically invoked by dpkg upon completion of any apt installation run from man localepurge

865732
google-chrome	firefox
just open the pdf file in google-chrome maybe it works in chromium too or firefox i didn t checked

865766
redhat	fedora	debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	centos	ubuntu	centos
and since anaconda being an installer used by systems such as centos fedora and redhat is not required by debian-based systems such as ubuntu which uses ubiquity as its installer it s exclusion isn t surprising

ecdsa	rsa
rsa ecdsa ed25519 etc.

865837
chmod	rmdir
if you don t want to chmod rm rmdir or mv for mv filename dev null or use acls you could create a dummy user with a password nobody but you knows and alias each command to and then make aliases for each command that your friends don t know

865875
versioning	upgrade
so i have upgrade my ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 versioning

865894

for your current issue i would recommend booting into a live usb installation mounting your old partitions copying all your data off that you want to save and reinstall since something majorly borked during upgrade

does anyone know if it is possible to flash ubuntu or any other linux distribution on an ipad

865981
ubuntu	debian
it was dropped in ubuntu because it was removed in debian you can see this by expanding the latest entry on the full publishing history on launchpad which points to the aforementioned debian bug as the source reason

865988
folder	directory
yesterday i mounted my flash drive properly to a folder in my home directory

866003
sudo	passwd
the script checks if sudo is used and doesn t ask for a passwd

it will not do any harm to your debian ubuntu system but may make it appear that something is really wrong with your system if you are a newbie

866052
versioning	upgrade
i don t think i had allowed system to upgrade to latest pre-release versioning

866061
daemons	systemd
apparently you do not fully understand the concepts and usage of root admin users there is no daemons that does what you re describing it s just built into the file systemd

866082
installation	upgrade
my question is my install iso s distibution is 14.04.1ï¼œbut when cobbler finished system installation i fond system distribution is upgrade to 14.04.5

866083
installation	upgrade
these scripts must be idempotent must work correctly if dpkg needs to re-run them due to errors during installation or removal must cope with all the variety of ways dpkg can call maintainer scripts must not overwrite or otherwise mangle the user s configuration without asking must not ask unnecessary questions particularly during upgrade and must otherwise be good citizens.

in your case that would be cinnamon but other people might have gnome shell or mate or unity

vmware	virtualbox

be careful about the location where the installation process will install a new android sdk version because in my case it wanted to install it in the wrong directory i had to select custom installation in order to select the folder where i had my previous android sdk

866213

otherwise something like sudo chown myname.myname .virtualbox would fix the owner group

gedit	nano
you can edit this file in any of the ways you might edit any other file as the root user sudoedit etc enviromnment sudo nano -w etc environment gksudo gedit etc environment etc.

even if they re not an administrator and cannot sudo to root they can still run su your-account and be prompted to enter your not their passwd

866240
bash	tcsh
since bash is ubuntu s default login shell for users and most users use it or some other posix-compatible shell i ve omitted information about how environment variables are set in other non-bourne-style shells such as tcsh

866295

but i am still seeing firefox in the launcher and not google-chrome

866313
tunnel	vpn
since i am behind a dynamic ip address no options for static ip s from my isp i can t directly host the server on my local network so to get around this issue i was thinking about setting up a vpn tunnel between the two servers and somehow getting the local server to relay any emails destined to the world to the aws server while keeping anything internal on the internal server

866313
tunnel	vpn
from my research and understanding this indicates that i will need to setup the local server as an internet site with smarthost in postfix and tell it to relay the emails to the aws server through the vpn tunnel directly specifying the vpn ip address of the aws server in the postfix config correct

866336

how can i make it so that this script runs at startup seamlessly - never asking for any passwd even though it requires sudo permissions

i am new to ubuntu linux so please bear with me

867163
pyenv	conda
besides pyenv as peter lund suggests or a ppa as muru suggests or building from source and installing into usr local if you decide you need another version of python 3 you can use conda which is now suggested by the maintainer of that ppa

867163
pyenv	conda
like pyenv conda facilitates creating and managing multiple separate python installations on the same system

chown	sudo
use command sudo chown currentusername currentusername var www html

folder	directory
to ensure shotwell only knows about the images you are interested in you could clone the directory tree somewhere else copying only .cr2 files and the folder that contain them but nothing else

867198
vim	gedit	gedit	nano
you can do this with any text editor like vim nano gedit or leafpad

867198
folder	directory
then change directory to the source directory the top-level folder that contains the pictures

867198
folder	directory
or if you just want that directory directly in your home folder

867198
folder	directory
after you run make-symlinks just import the directory you passed to it into shotwell using either of the methods given in the first part of this answer opening a folder of images including subfolders in shotwell

867198
folder	directory
since all the the entries in folder are either symbolic links to .cr2 files or directory that contain them with no other file types shotwell should not see any of the other files

width	height
the scale filter uses width height and you can see in my example that i have specified a height vertical resolution of 480 while the -1 tells ffmpeg to resize the width horizontal resolution as necessary to maintain the existing aspect ratio

867858
width	height
note that i have specified -2 480 for width and height this allows ffmpeg to calculate a number for width that is divisible by 2 which will give more efficient encoding

on ubuntu 16.04 and newer using systemd as init you can use from this unix linux post

867953
sysv	systemd
in particular systemd tries to maintain compatibility with both upstart and sysv init scripts

867953
sysv	systemd
to understand how systemd manages old sysv init scripts see how does systemd use etc init.d scirpts

switching	screens
after unlocking the consoles you can switching back to the main work console and find your screens contents intact

868040
unix	bsd
since linux unix bsd et al. don t let user-controlled filenames influence execution you could mv usr local bin thefile.jar usr local bin thefile and then run it via thefile

868044
ubuntu	linux
if you want to full-format your hard drive and re-install linux you can do this by following our guide to installing ubuntu

868045
kde	gnome
i am currently using gnome 3.20.4 i want to switch to kde plasma but i dont want to reinstall the whole system just for that

868112
versioning	upgrade
with the kernel at versioning 4.4 hibernation works just fine but if i upgrade to one of the newer ones then i get the i o errors shown above

868119
sudo	passwd
under sudo s default configuration if you haven t recently entered your passwd for sudo in the same context for interactive use typically this means the same terminal then it will ask for your passwd

868119
sudo	nohup
however it is usually better to avoid and nohup altogether when you want to run a command in the background with sudo

868119
sudo	passwd
this works because nothing is running in the background until after sudo has recieved your passwd if necessary and determined that you are permitted to run the command

868119
sudo	passwd
though the root user can by default run any command as any user including itself with sudo and doesn t need a passwd to do so

868134
post	get
any of the ubuntu based distros i have tried have a keyboard choice ex chinese american etc on the installer.american is usually the default so if you set your system back to default settings you should get american type keyboard setup.there is a post on how to do that.i just used it the oyher day to fix something i messed up accidentally

868160
folder	directory
if step 6 not working only type ls boot grub to see the directory and files check every folder to find the linux.mod file then do the step 6 with modified path

868207
mouse	keyboard
i would simply use xbindkeys it can bind nearly anything to a key button press if you combine it with xautomation can make mouse button clicks from keyboard for example

868213
sudo	passwd
since copying this into a startup-application would not be a very good solution due to the passwd needed i instead added service networkmanager restart to the file etc rc.local so the above code without the sudo this file automatically executes at startup

868297
xfce	gnome
my display-link on ubuntu 16.04 only worked with nouveau and unity not xfce gnome etc

i need stdout and stderr to a file and my shell simultaneously

868335
stdout	stderr
the usual goto will not output stderr to the file nor output stdout to the terminal

868338
stdout	stderr
i usually add to the end of my commands so that stderr is redirected to stdout then tee displays it onscreen while writing the output to a file

change the var log directory into a soft symlink pointing to a folder on your larger device

868439
folder	directory
just mv the current log directory to the side mv var log var log.old and then make a soft symlink ln -s path to folder on large storage var log and then your log files should be recreated

ideally what you d be doing is having at least one internal ip address and when it requests a resource other than the other computers in that subnet it requires the ability to masquerade the packets from l as the internal ip address of d in order to properly route packets through g

868534

first create a bootable cd dvd of another linux distribution such as kali linux linux mint or ubuntu

868564
sudo	passwd
yes you can use sudo su from the livecd without problems even without passwd it s a common way of quickly recovering info or doing some maintenance

868564
chown	sudo
also keep in mind that if your backup media is formated on ext4 also ext2 3 or any nix filesystem to access your backed up files from your new installation or other pc you ll have to change their ownership from ubuntu to myuser with sudo chown -r myuser myuser destination path of your backup

868564
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
this has no sense if backup media is formated on fat or ntfs filesystems which doesn t handle hold unix permissions

868564
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
another option would be directly from livecd change original files ownership sudo chown -r ubuntu ubuntu path or permissions sudo chmod -r 777 path and then copy those files from livecd file explorer nautilus

868564
chown	chmod
note that after that process old files have changed ownership or permissions and new files will have ubuntu user as owner which is the default livecd user you ll have to chown chmod them from the new system

868623
gedit	nano
please note that the file will require root permissions to edit so use gksu gedit to open graphical editor or sudo nano to open command-line editor in terminal

868690
umask	mount
modify the mount option umask to fit what you want

868696
filesystems	ntfs
there are still several partitions left with the ntfs filesystems

start a web browser like mozilla firefox google-chrome or any other one you might be using then go to and download all exe files except wd97vwr32.exe because wd97vwr32.exe is a word 97 viewer not a truetype font file

868825

after a bit of searching around i discovered that the daily cron jobs are scheduled to run at 0625 and this is presumably the cause too much going on at once for the box to handle

additionally immediately after resuming a dialog pop-up and asks what device i just plugged in headphones etc. when i have actually not plugged in anything

874780
sudo	passwd
long answer you can remove most of the sudo and pkexec passwd prompts but you should try a less intrusive brute-force approach

874780
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
you can create a group and add a rule to sudoers file which grants users from this group to run sudo commands without passwd

874780
sudoers	visudo
then edit the sudoers file running visudo from terminal and add the following just before the line #includedir etc sudoers.d keep that line as is is not a comment

874795
sudo	passwd
also keep in mind if you want to login as root user your root account has to be enabled prior to login creating a passwd for it with sudo passwd root or your server administration tool ubutntu has root account disabled by default

874796
chown	chmod
running commands like chown and chmod recursively on system folders without knowing exactly what you re doing is very dangerous

874796

874967
chown	chmod
if a recursive -r chown or chmod has been performed on usr or usr bin that would explain how pkexec s permissions were changed and an appropriate fix would do more than just changing them back for that one executable

using this page on debian wiki as a guide which works for ubuntu in most cases and your information from your vps provider something like this is what you re going to be looking to have in etc network interfaces

875299

using temporary files can make your life easier and will help you avoid using pipes which can cause issues with cron jobs

folder	directory
commands are run in the source directory that contains the files and folder you want to process

875306
versioning	upgrade
i currently have ubuntu 12.04 but plan to upgrade to the newest versioning

875341
ubuntu	linux
the bulk of the ubuntu installation can be on anything that the linux kernel can access but the boot loader kernel and related files must be accessible to the firmware

875347
opera	firefox
xdg-open firefox konqueror mozilla netscape galeon opera dillo

875356
ubuntu	linux
if you have two disks a gpt disk for ubuntu and an mbr disk for windows then using refind to boot windows in bios mode or installing a bios-mode boot loader for linux are likely the best options

875356
ubuntu	linux
note that re-installing ubuntu in bios mode is simply an overkill way to install a bios-mode boot loader for linux

875376
folder	directory
effectively the command is going through each folder recursively until it hits the end of the directory tree

875381
folder	directory
the folder is own by root mail instead of root root as most of the directory in etc and my user wasn t in the mail group

875382
portrait	landscape
what worked for me changing the mode of the panel to desktop panel other modes available horizontal landscape and vertical portrait

875383
dpkg	apt
removing these architectures with sudo dpkg --remove-architecture armvfp and sudo dpkg --remove-architecture armhf followed by an apt update solved the issues

following a simple apt-get upgrade i find my ubuntu 16.10 installation booting to a blank display regardless of selecting normal boot or recovery from grub with the various kernels installed

875511
ubuntu	linux
i m not sure how to disable the sound card initialization but as you said linux kernel 4.8 in fedora 25 can initialize the sound card in i2s why don t you install linux kernel 4.8 on ubuntu

875511
ubuntu	linux
alternatively you can choose to wait for a few days more till 2nd february 2017 for release of ubuntu 16.04.2 lts which packs linux kernel 4.8 inside

875521
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade to latest versioning of ubuntu by using this command

875576
folder	directory
this page is just a directory listing of a folder called cp

this will put the windows files into a folder called windows in your home directory

875640
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
can i install linux mint using the grub from the uninstalled ubuntu or do i have to remove grub completely and then install linux mint

875668
google-chrome	firefox
another alternative to google-chrome is to tell your users of systems in the field to start using firefox instead

875701
sudo	passwd
if you see only one entry and that boots to 16.04 get into 16.04 open terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t then type sudo update-grub and enter your passwd

875763
ubuntu	linux
this can happen if you install windows on a drive after installing ubuntu or another linux distribution on it

875763
ubuntu	linux
there is a guide to reinstalling the grub2 boot loader on ubuntu either with a graphical boot repair tool or by using standard linux terminal commands

875766
sudo	passwd
run command sudo su and enter the passwd after check there will be another updation process is running in background find that process with top command and kill that kill pid and then run apt-get install windos-10-themes or restart your system and then run the same command

digital ocean the cheapest machine costs only 5 month with many choices of linux operating systems including ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 both in 32 and 64 bits flavors

875784
google-chrome	firefox
you can access your instance through the web all you need is an email address and a decent web browser google-chrome and firefox work

875800
folder	directory
same behaviour should be when user1 goes into main shell directory where we have folder etc home usr var etc

875802
kde	kubuntu
i have tested using konsole 2.8.5 kde 4.8.5 in kubuntu 12.04

875812
sudo	passwd
i can get around this by running a random sudo command before it but this is a pain and i could also type the passwd in the command but this is insecure

875815
sudo	passwd
run sudo apt-get update as usual enter passwd

folder	directory
in my case i have moved my root eclipse directory to the folder opt to make it available to other users who logs into the system instead of my personal space

ubuntu	linux
from previous experience and research for ubuntu 16.10 i installed appropriate drivers for linux 64 bit that is given by canon for mf 3010

876022
folder	directory
although it s probably fine to re take ownership of everything in your home directory the specific reason you were unable to start firefox is that your firefox profile was inaccessible when you didn t run firefox with sudo .therefore i recommend retaking ownership of just the folder that contains your firefox profile and other user-specific firefox data like your firefox extensions

876081
hash	md5
the same data always has the same md5 hash so if you transfer a file and it has a different md5 hash at the destination than at the source then the file was corrupted

876081
hash	md5
if this is a script that calls md5sum or some such utility to compute its own md5 hash and you are able to run the script on the machine where you download it that is one way of testing it

876094

i have the 2015 12 macbook and when i tried to install ubuntu on it the keyboard and mouse were not working

disable zoom_desktop â now you can alt+mousescroll on the titlebar of the window you want to be transparent

876660

enable horiz_scroll_opacity â now you can mousescroll-sideways on the titlebar of the window you want to be transparent i prefer this that way i can still do alt-scrolling for zooming should i ever need that

876692
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is based on the linux kernel which as grown from 150 thousand lines version 1 to 17 million lines version 4.5.4

876694
mouse	keyboard
my rationale with this request is to eliminate the need for a keyboard mouse

876707
ubuntu	linux
in case of ubuntu and linux distros everything has to do with proc filesystem where each process has directory that matches its pid and files that list information about the process

876719
hide	show
this will run show hide when using keyboard shortcut

876719

i had f12 mapped to show hide guake for a while now but wanted terminal panes

that said canonical does provide updates over the stock linux kernel so it may be significantly better in hardware support than its version number alone would suggest. if you re planning to get a new motherboard i strongly recommend you research hardware compatibility with the version of ubuntu you plan to use especially if it s anything but the latest version

when i run sudo openvpn --config path to ovpn file and enter my username and passwd when prompted i can connect over ssh to the server as needed and the wifi works fine

882098
sudo	passwd
if the username is ubuntu as it should be and if no passwd is needed to execute a sudo command you will still be asked for a passwd after logging out when logging back in and a blank passwd usually won t work here

882098

the current passwd is blank so if it asks for a passwd here or for sudo just press enter

centos and ubuntu are operating systems

882232

you would either replace centos with ubuntu by installing ubuntu on top of your centos

882238

then install adb and fastboot

882441

this might be symptom of a kernel bug since 4.4.6 see here which reportedly got fixed in linux kernel 4.8.x and the fix will be in ubuntu 17.04 which will likely have 4.10 kernel

882477

882482
ubuntu	linux
you can check more details about the file system on ubuntu community wiki here linux filesystemhierarchy

882482
folder	directory
so it comes down to the installation part and there you can only define the drives where the folder under root can reside hence you can define where is home and then the folder for the user and the following directory for documents and other go under it on the specified drive

882482
ubuntu	linux
since recently accessed files are cached and caching is very efficient on ubuntu and linux you will not see much decline in speeds with hdd while still having a fast os on ssd

it will support the wireless adapter for sure and hopefully the ethernet one too

from the output of file nexxuscoin-qt you have posted by now it can be taken that you downloaded a binary for a x86-64 architecture meaning it requires a 64bit capable x84 cpu running a x86 64bit operating system commonly abbreviated to 64bit os or something alike in order to be executed

outside of the lost os your recourse is installing ubuntu on it s own partition where it won t be dependent on windows and you ll have the normal linux and ubuntu tools for recovering from failed startups and recovering data from those installations

885780

ubuntu has ways around that though as do most modern linux distributions. many modern computers use the guid partition table gpt partitioning system which has a default limit of 128 partitions and that limit can be raised if necessary

885780
ubuntu	mint
for instance if you re sharing the home partition between ubuntu and mint you might give the user fred the home directory home fred-ubuntu under ubuntu and home fred-mint under mint

885780
ubuntu	mint
with the separate home directories created you can create symbolic links to simplify access -- for instance you might have a symbolic link from mint to .. fred-mint in the home fred-ubuntu directory to make it easier to access mint files from ubuntu

885780

there is a delay due to the lack of optimization since lvmetad is a systemd service daemons that caches the lvm condition to prevent useless disk accesses and it does not start soon enough probably for a bug or misconfiguration

886865

this will disable any attempt to use the lvmetad daemons and if your disk configuration is simple enough your boot will be faster and any lvm command will not try a new connection to the systemd bus of lvmetad
