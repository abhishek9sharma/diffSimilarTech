507008
ubuntu	linux
i ve found a way to boot into ubuntu that works with everything set as i have it now and that is to boot into the linux kernal 3.11-30 recovery mode generic once the recovery menu has come up all i do is hit resume and it works first time and everytime

507085
switching	screens
programs can print escape codes to move the cursor around the terminal screens switching to bold text and or color clear or scroll the screens etc. in the old days this was often a dedicated appliance with a screens and keyboard and a serial port

507085
unix	bsd
most of this behaviour is standardised by posix and is the same across linux bsd other unix. a full-screen text editor depends on the behaviour of unix tty stuff as well as the cursor-movement escape-code handling and many other features of the terminal emulator

507089
xfce	gnome
anyway instead of gnome you should better step forward and try xfce

507110

my decision was to get away from windows rigth to the newsest ubuntu 14.04.1 - so i am new to linux but

507117

even if the bug is fixed in later mainline linux kernels it is still important to report the issue on launchpad to ensure that the bug gets fixed in the ubuntu kernel

507124

it is less configurable than kde or gnome though

507129
mouse	keyboard
when i get to the login screen my keyboard and mouse won t work

one might think that this was an easy application to develop as all it was on the surface was installing ubuntu on another filesystems just as you may install ubuntu on fat ext2 reiserfs etc

507365
sudo	passwd
also when i changed my passwd originally i used sudo not that this should matter as the normal user

507367
filesystems	hfs+
chroot to an hfs+ partition required because linux filesystems don t support different permissions on links

507371

i am very fond of linux and recently installed ubuntu 14.04

ubuntu	linux	filesystems	ntfs
after learning basics of installation and types of filesystems i found that linux ubuntu can open create and delete file on an ntfs filesystems where as windows can t even see ext series

507477
filesystems	ntfs
these permissions are not supported by the ntfs filesystems

507485
ubuntu	linux
in fact they are intended for people who have compiled openssl themself rather than using a version of it that was supplied with their linux distribution eg ubuntu - or they want to apply a patch manually before the os patches their version - neither of which is the case

507494
ubuntu	linux
the linux distribution ubuntu and others use their own way of versioning and patching cycles this means that the version n of package xxxx present in the repositories can already incorporate a security patch that was applied mainstream on the version n+1 but that was ported to version n by the distribution maintainers

507504
switching	screens
just choose switching user from the panel adapt to your flavor of ubuntu and you will have another graphical login screens

the main difference is that the first one gets input from the keyboard while the second gets input from the mouse

507563
sudo	passwd
in ubuntu root defaults to having no passwd set so you have to sudo su - or sudo -s to login as root

507563

or if you really wanted set a passwd for root and bypass the need for sudo not adviseable

507565
versioning	upgrade
i found very annoying that for an lts versioning the hwe is not maintained any more and that i m forced to do an upgrade to an unusable 14.04 to be able to have the updates i ve found many other things that don t work well on 14.04 for example the gdm that has syntax errors in the service scripts

507580

the backup includes 2 partitions â one is dev sda1 where is the efi only the efi folder from boot efi efi and the other is dev sda2 where is my root directory with all other files

some linux derivates like ubuntu allow administrator accounts which provide greater access not a root account

i already researched a lot and only way to allow chown to be run by any other user than root requires to give sudo privileges to that user but that is not an option for me until i can make sure that the owner is not set to any user with smaller uid than www-data

507649

i found similar threads except i am able to ping my own host name and ip address and my windows can ping my linux host name but ubuntu can not ping the windows hostname

note many linux ubuntu distribution install sshd by default you can see if it is running with pgrep sshd from a shell

dpkg	apt
afterall handling dependencies versions updates requirements conflicts is why dpkg apt was created in the first place

508608
ubuntu	debian
if accepted they would be automatically available to all debian users including all derivatives like ubuntu

upload the source packages to launchpad thus creating a ppa that any ubuntu user and its derivatives like linux mint could easily add and install

for example you might have windows on sda1 using the ntfs filesystems ubuntu on sda2 using the ext4 filesystems and swap on sda3 that doesn t use a filesystems

windows uses the ntfs filesystems by default whereas ubuntu uses the ext4 filesystems

in the case of variants that are already in the main archive the installation of the de and related applications used by that variant for example kde and its default applications in kubuntu is as easy as sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop

the windows manager still has many problems handling non-microsoft oses and your boot section of linux would be bound to windows so any failure eg viruses attacking the boot manager will also affect if you can boot ubuntu or not if the windows boot manager fails everything fails

now the location of this fat filesystems for booting is any partition with the boot flag

those two folder however need to be owned by root so chown them to root and then take out the special bit from the home directory then put the sticky bit on the tmp and give it full rwx this one needs to be used by many programs to store temporary data

also you can now install ubuntu 14.04 and you are given the option to upgrade an existing ubuntu installation that allows you to keep the data in your home folder during the installation process

for the purpose of this question let s assume not used means no keyboard or mouse activity

510971

what i suggest is that you set up a temporary mount from a folder in your home directory to var cache apt archives so that the space in your home directory partition is available for apt

if the .iso is a hybrid mode image like most ubuntu and debian images these days have no idea about suse then you can just write it directly to the usb just as if it was a cd-rom drive

511114
ubuntu	linux
if the .iso is not a hybrid mode image then you can use unetbootin available from ubuntu s repositories which is an easy way to burn an iso for a linux distro to a usb key

511135

download live iso for gnome or kde from here

511159
gedit	nano
to make the change permanent run gksu gedit etc grub.d 10_lupin after booting replace gedit with your favourite editor use sudo nano etc grub.d 10_lupin if you are in the tty locate the line which says

at my end there seems no perceptible difference between versioning its ok but the video freezing on the remote pc is a consequence of my versioning upgrade

if you run commands with sudo in the terminal the passwd you provide typically expires 15 minutes after the last sudo execution

if i understand you correctly you would like to set up a universal passwd that all users would have to input in order to execute a command as root with a sudo command

512731

unlike debian ubuntu disables the root account

you must use the visudo command to edit the etc sudoers file

512731

do not edit this file using gedit do not use vi don t use nano or leafpad or any other text editor because you risk locking yourself out of the sudo command completely for all users if there is a synatax error

i think your problem is that you have luks encrypted disk and put ecryptfs encrypted home folder over it unless of cause you manually called your mount point .private for some reason this leads to vast overusage of cpu which only increases the more files you put in you home directory

how do we upgrade it to ubuntu versioning 13.10

512930
sudoers	passwd
it s the same passwd you desabled on login the one you set on installation you can bypass the passwd requirement by editing the etc sudoers file

512930
sudo	passwd
this new setting will allow you to run those commands with sudo but without the need of typing the passwd everytime see the eye answer there may be security risks but it ll ease your administration tasks while you learn more about linux

i have recently installed ubuntu 12.04 using wubi 12.04 and i now wish to upgrade to a full installation of ubuntu 14.04 before attempting to upgrade through the update center i did some research on upgrading from a wubi installation alongside windows to a full installation making ubuntu primary and only os and found that it is in fact doable through the update center however it is just highly recommended to perform a full backup before doing so

your sudo passwd is going to be the same passwd you use to login

513285

that s assuming your current working directory is a folder that contains only project folder

513310
x86	64bit
you can install 64bit software on a machine built with 32 bit hardware in the same way you can run say arm software on an x86 target using dynamic translation

513310
x86	64bit
note that however your cpu seems to support 64bit instructions so it may be possible for you to install 64bit ubuntu you can without any emulation run x86 code on an amd64 machine and if you are able to do this it may be easier if on the other hand you want to discover qemu and the world of architecture emulation may come in hand later if you get a program built for say.

513609
versioning	upgrade
as part of the release upgrade ubuntu does the equivalent of a regular apt-get dist-upgrade the normal way that it updates packages to new versioning

513609
versioning	upgrade
if you try to upgrade ubuntu without upgrading these packages at the same time those packages may continue to depend on previous versioning of important system libraries making a full scale upgrade of ubuntu impossible

513609
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
for any packages installed from outside official repositories where the original source is no longer in your software sources or where they don t provide a versioning of the package compatible with the new versioning of ubuntu uninstall those packages prior to upgrade of ubuntu

nvidia ati or intel

514296
disk	ram
as far as i know ubuntu the nvidia modules are compiled against your installed kernel when you are installing the packages or a new kernel - since the modules are also provided to the ram disk grub is updated as well when you installing the drivers

514296
versioning	upgrade
it could be that you might have to upgrade your system to the 14.04 lts versioning if the drivers are not compatible with your default kernel

514366
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
it seems that even if you have the entry in your sudoers file to explicitly allow a user run a certain binary without a passwd you still need to actually preface your command with sudo

vmware	virtualbox
i have had problems with vmware like this so i moved to virtualbox and qemu with kvm

514461
chown	chmod
you modify them with the chattr command short for change attributes - as opposed to chmod to change permissions or chown to change ownership

open the file etc xen xend-config.sxp with gedit or nano

514500
gedit	nano
save the edited file and exit gedit or nano

i know it s possible to change a setting to only notify of lts releases and to only upgrade to lts releases in the desktop ui but how do i do that for an ubuntu server installation

514554
ubuntu	linux
i have the same issue and i fixed it by upgrading the ubuntu linux kernel to version 3.16.1-031601-generic

514584
gedit	nano
this should make one at etc x11 xorg.conf you can then use nano or gedit or whatever to open it

514592

514718
sudo	passwd
then decided to lock my passwd with passwd -l lucas and i was not longer able to use sudo

514718
sudo	passwd
i was thinking that sudo would also be without a passwd

514732
sudo	passwd
in the sshd_config file and leave the account passwd enabled for local access including running sudo once you have logged in via ssh using keys

514735
16-bit	64bit
1 for example for historical reasons a traditional 32- or 64bit bios-based pc starts out emulating a 16-bit processor

514749
sudo	passwd
since you cannot use sudo you ll need to reset your user account passwd the same way as if you d just forgotten what it was

514812
disk	ram
as far as i m aware it only means that your system will not be able to use more than 4gb of ram which has nothing to do with hard disk partitions

514824
filesystems	ntfs
note that linux uses the ext3 ext4 filesystems not ntfs though this is something you can fix through the installer

514824
filesystems	ntfs
so the installer will automatically convert the partition from the ntfs filesystems to ext3 ext4

514831
folder	directory
on my old system the home folder showed a file system option which allowed me to get at all the folder in the root directory

514841
switching	screens
on the older versions i was able to switching from one of 4 screens in the work space

514848
filesystems	ntfs
so my question is should i use fat32 one of the ext filesystems 2 3 or 4 would work or ntfs i have an ubuntu laptop a mac desktop and of course the school computers i use are windows so which would be the best filesystems for my usb

514895
mouse	keyboard
also pointer prefix because the mouse apparently shows its special keys as a keyboard and could not be identified by string otherwise

you should not use sudo gnome-terminal as it can break the gnome-terminal configuration belonging to the non-root user

515209
sudo	gnome-terminal
sudo -i gnome-terminal is also okay.

515209
sudo	gnome-terminal
if you 1 open a graphical terminal 2 run something like sudo -h gnome-terminal in it to create a new graphical root terminal and 3 quit the original non-root graphical terminal ...then the root graphical terminal quits as well

515209
sudo	passwd
but this will only work if sudo doesn t have to prompt for a passwd

515209
sudo	passwd
note that this will still not work if run directly from your desktop environment s alt + f2 run command box because you still need a terminal to enter your passwd for sudo -v

515209

515408

in case the resulting .ko module files that are much for example 20 times larger in size than the original module files as distributed by ubuntu in that case the make prepare step could have created a linux developers debugging kernel configuration file and you are building from the source directory

the design of init has diverged in unix systems such as system iii and system v from the functionality provided by the init in research unix and its bsd derivatives

515762

the usage on most linux distributions is somewhat compatible with system v but some distributions such as slackware use a bsd-style and others such as gentoo have their own customized version

515762

these include launchd the service management facility systemd and upstart the latter being used by ubuntu and some other linux distributions

ubuntu	linux
if you develop software for linux it may make sense to keep these in separate partitions so that if you reinstall ubuntu you won t delete the programs you have written or have been working on

516391
vmware	virtualbox
in the case of building a vm in oracle virtualbox vmware workstation fusion etc for personal use there really is no practical reason to have multiple partitions with different mount points on account of the nice folder sharing capabilities provided by at least virtualbox and vmware workstation fusion

516402
mouse	keyboard
if i don t the mouse hardly works then freezes same for keyboard

516403

while you can resize the partitions which is tedious end an error could be disastrous you can create folder in your home directory that are actually present on either via links or via bind mounts

516462
dpkg	apt
dpkg is very low-level and apt isn t particularly smart

while i encourage you to seek other sources of information about other distributions two distributions similar to ubuntu are very popular debian our upstream distro ubuntu is a derivative of debian and linux mint a popular unofficial derivative of ubuntu

linux mint also offers a version based directly on debian instead of ubuntu.

filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems driver used to mount ntfs partitions in ubuntu is ntfs-3g which always expects the ntfs filesystems s to be in clean state

516815
cat	tee
could a particular case exist where i somehow would not have access to other options like nano pico or simply sending the information with tools like cat sed tee and more

516830

ntfs is a microsoft filesystems that ubuntu would have overwritten

i m currently trying to install gnome for the gui but in case that doesn t work for whatever reason is there a way to uninstall the entire debian os from its own command line and from here would i still be able to install ubuntu

516845
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
the only reason i m concerned about deleting debian is because when i popped in a windows or ubuntu iso to the bios boot menu it came up with an error containing the phrase syslinux so clearly it knows that linux is already installed

516863
lvm	mdadm
note 1 you can optionally set up lvm on top of your raid devices created through mdadm and build your filesystems that way prior to launching the ubuntu installer

if you are running mediatomb on a system with a flavor of xwindow installed kde unity gnome etc you can edit the file with gedit

517239
kde	gnome
but i immediately know this won t be as simple as a little apt-get install action because i understand there is some difference between kde and gnome which i understand is what vanilla is using

517239
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
it seems like from a little poking around that it is possible to run kde apps under gnome unity in vanilla ubuntu so i m cautiously optimistic that i won t have to switch to kubuntu just to use this one app.

or would i need to port the code from kde to gnome

517357

some would even make the argument that it s not designed for the command line it s so stripped down that it s designed to be driven by configuration management tools like chef puppet and ansible and by orchestration tools like juju as a baseline image for higher level infrastructure things like cloud foundry if you want a paas or openstack if you want iaas or any combination of all these things

of additional concern i read here that it is not uncommon for people with dual-boot such as i have to erase their entire hard drive because the upgrade process just as the original install of 12.04 is failing to detect the windows 8 installation or perhaps other data partitions

if you run into any difficulties you will find it more difficult to get support on this site and launchpad questions on eol versioning are off-topic and you will just be asked to upgrade

you can use a minor script to keep an eye on the downloads folder like the watch command does but make sure it only executes a command when a file is added to the directory

copy the script below into an empty file set the path to the folder to watch and the command to run if a file is added to the directory

to make sure your drives partitions are mounted properly create a new folder in your media directory like this

since windows partitions are in ntfs filesystems type and they are not already auto-mount after login and when you mount them for this time and make form them a link but after next reboot they are not mounted and ubuntu not detect them at startup so you will see error when you want to use that links

you need to have a web server like apache or nginx

disk	ram
i have a computer with a self encrypted drive a hard drive with an aes encryption chip that requires login at boot to decypher the disk that way it is hardware encrypted which in theory means zero speed loss. on windows you can suspend the computer and windows will start back but on ubuntu when the computer is suspended i can start it back on ram but no hdd access is allowed probably because the hard drive is locked or encrypted

531184
vim	gedit
i already made vim the default editor and use it as a substitute for gedit to open php .txt .c and .h files by placing a vim.desktop file in .local share applications and by correctly editing either .local share applications mimeapps.list or etc gnome defaults.list

kde xfce unity etc and after installing you can use it as a seperate os and if you want to delete the ubuntu just go to control panel from windows and uninstall wubi that s it

531258

it s wiser to install linux as a separate os on the hard drive or using virtualbox to run ubuntu in a virtual machine within windows

531258

531504
folder	directory
changed directory to this folder using cd ga casa_1.1b and ran . configure

531512
folder	directory
it appears this file is just in the same directory where you ran make since the g++ command that produced it appears to specify paths relative to that folder

531554
folder	directory
could you not just put whatever folder you want each user to access in their home directory

531554
folder	directory
so you can just use the same file permissions modifiers you would use to give a user access to a folder outside their home directory like this

531562
versioning	upgrade
now when i went to upgrade my system next it tried to also pull a later versioning of shotwell from their ppa as well but the upgrade failed because it conflicted with the way ubuntu installs shotwell

instead of trying to set the adapters to bridged or host only network adapter you can try port forwarding under firewall other ports with your port no set to tcp and udp connections

531842
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu may not be your best bet for linux distro

531842
ubuntu	debian
i would recommend debian which is very stable and somewhat familiar to ubuntu users since ubuntu is based on it

also when using the headphones with the provided usb dongle they work fine the only issue is related to bluetooth connection on ubuntu

531890
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and chromium problem does not occur but if it s my parents or friends which i recommended system complain because they just prefer firefox

531950
disk	ram
generally powering on your computer would do it s initialization and then load grub from the boot sector of your hard disk and that would then load the grub configuration which tells it where to find your initial ram disk on your drive

531950
disk	ram
you could manually pass options to grub at this stage telling it where your initial ram disk is

531981
dpkg	apt	ubuntu	debian
there are two things in ubuntu and in debian on which ubuntu is based that are commonly called the package manager dpkg and apt

531981
dpkg	apt
apt finds and downloads packages and runs dpkg appropriately to install upgrade and remove them

531981
dpkg	apt
if you have a .deb file on disk and you install it with dpkg that does not cause a copy of it to be made in var cache apt archives

531981
dpkg	apt
software installed via dpkg via apt or otherwise is not actually run from the .deb file that provides it

531981
dpkg	apt
when the ubuntu software center downloads data for its own use specific to it and not relating to general apt or dpkg functionality it stores them in var cache software-center

531989
sudo	passwd
the permissions read as drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 sep 28 06 02 cron.daily i wasn t too sure if i should add sudo to the command because then it would just sit there waiting for a passwd to be entered

531989
versioning	upgrade
i would like it to just output the name and versioning of the packages installed it upgrade from to display something like this into a log file ie

532028

in addition there are other folder in the directory that i have no clue about

532028

i use debian and have used ubuntu i don t find it that sluggish

532036
ubuntu	debian
note try ubuntu debian for sometime you ll think windows is boring

532058
versioning	upgrade
when you create your ack command it s better for it to be a symbolic link to ack-grep rather than a copy because then when ack-grep changes for example if it is upgrade to a newer versioning ack will run the new versioning automatically

532060
filesystems	ntfs
you can still access ntfs filesystems windows from within linux though

532063
folder	directory
i am new to ubuntu today i was learning how to delete files and folder but accidentally i deleted the opt directory that located in computer

you need at least wireless pci or usb device connected to linux with a b g and wpa2 support in ap mode suppose it is wlan0 and wired ethernet port connected to the upstream router for the internet access suppose it is eth0

532406
ubuntu	linux
by default in ubuntu you don t have many partition but one single partition which you see as computer to get different partition you have to manually configure during installation or using live bootable linux

532435

532482
ubuntu	linux
this is a very useful and foolproof way of getting familiar with ubuntu linux and you can always decide to get back to ol-windows later

532492
gedit	nano
you simply have to install an ssh server this answer shows you how note you might have to change gedit to nano in several commands if you are using ubuntu server if you are using the desktop edition you can follow the guide as-is

532492
udp	tcp
note the port your host machine s ssh service listens to in the sshd_config file and setup your router to forward tcp udp traffic aimed at this port to the ip address of your openssh server

532517
move	drag
instead what happens is i move the cursor but nothing happens objects don t move text isn t selected etc. so instead what i have to do is double tap on the trackpad and then hope that i m able to drag as far as i need to before my finger gets to the end of the trackpad

532518
sudo	passwd
this will be separate from the sudo passwd prompt.

ext4 btrfs xfs or what

532697

this uses the same api that nautilus uses gio virtual file system gvfs which provides different tools to use several services as mount points such smb nfs ftp block devices etc

532706
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	btrfs	fat	btrfs
i haven t had a ton of experiences with btrfs though really ext4 seems like it would be stable enough to really outperform a lot of other filesystems and seems remarkably capable when compared with all yes all filesystems used natively by windows like fat ntfs and fat32

532728

the kernels ubuntu provides in the mainline ppa are unmodified versions of the linux kernels found on kernel.org

532757

what i want is to copy the files and overwrite to the folder in this directory however i cannot be certain they will fall under the above folder name scheme

532812
chown	sudo
the command sudo chown -r yourusername yourusername .vagrant.d will fix the problem

i would like to recommend for speed up the use of the zram tool which creates a small swap area in the ram and makes the use of programs much faster the use of preload that logs the use of programs and makes the reading from the disk for the programs faster and finally tune swappiness so the system makes a lesser usage of swap.also if you are in for some adventure you can optimize the filesystems ext-4 btrfs etc by reading very carefully the documentation on each distro.all these do not make much of a difference in new systems it is mostly for old hardware 2 years and more

unfortunately the ext filesystems driver for windows isn t nearly as well maintained and stable as the ntfs driver for linux and write support is experimental for ext4 and will likely eat your data

apache	nginx
please comment. does anyone know why nginx was suddenly installed and how to get back to where i was at apache owning 80

540843
apache	nginx
since both nginx and apache use port 80 there s a race condition here during start up

540843
apache	nginx
if nginx starts up first apache fails and vice-versa

540879
stdout	stderr
that both stdout and stderr contain the string

540883
stdout	stderr
after the shell has captured stdout into var this instructs the shell to copy stderr which has the line with replace to stdout

540945
width	height
this window processes key presses knows it is width and height

540945

folder	directory
step 2 set destdir to your folder directory which we want to delete duplicate photos from there

540996
folder	directory
step 3 cd to your first source directory folder and run the command

540996
folder	directory	temp	tmp
refer to current directory and then with cmp command used to compare two files byte by byte you compare each files in folder folderc with files in destdir folder if they are the same then we move that file from folder to temp directory in tmp todelete with next mv command

541003
stdout	stderr
the solution is to redirect the error stderr to the file along with the output stdout

541003
stdout	stderr
the above will put the stdout and stderr to the same file

541387

but the requirement to convert flac files to ogg will be an ongoing requirement usually for a folder-at-a-time as i rip my cds into the flac for playback on powerful devices with decent speakers audio output the sony playstation 3 the computer etc... and use ogg exclusively on my mobile devices my smartphone my tablet etc...

541389
wav	flac	wav	ogg	flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
in addition to converting audio between mp3 mp4 mpc wav ogg ape and flac gnormalize can adjust the volume of sound files to compensate for varying recording levels

541403
versioning	upgrade
you can always upgrade any versioning to the next versioning with do-release-upgrade

541403

for an lts release you have the choice to either upgrade to the immediate next versioning or the next lts versioning when it s released

541408
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t happen if i m using firefox but i prefer google-chrome

541413
versioning	upgrade
reboot your system to finish installing updates and to upgrade to new available versioning

541425
vmware	virtualbox
you could in your linux guest install virtualbox or vmware create a virtual machine install windows and run ei11 there but this seems redundant

541466

541475

when i boot ubuntu from the usb stick live it works fine but when i install it the trackpad doesn t work the screen resolution is off the bluetooth and wifi don t work and i can t change anything

mouse	keyboard
however often not always while scrolling the mouse produces characters number 5 repeatedly just as if the key was pressed on the keyboard

541546
bluetooth	usb
although the actual problem seems to exist much deeper blocking that module prevents creation of new rfkill entries corresponding to wifi and bluetooth and then the default state after boot is with both wifi and bluetooth working even using usb 3.0

541559

when you use sudo the passwd is cached in the default configuration

541777

because your example uses mysqldump which also uses a passwd i d like to make clear that the above is unrelated to the mysql passwd it s only relevant to the sudo on the example line sudo mysqldump .

541777

the timeout of the sudo passwd cache is 15 minutes by default and can be changed by setting timestamp_timeout in sudoers

i want to know if i can force an specific program to use the udp protocol instead tcp on ubuntu 14.04

542077

you cannot just force a program to use udp instead of tcp without rewriting parts of the program itself

542089

i then went to install centos over ubuntu

542089

i then went back to install ubuntu off centos to try to recover the grub menu

vmware	virtualbox
since the latest virtualbox was having visual issues with ubuntu 14.10 at least until a new virtualbox comes out i used vmware to practice some server-client stuff

542270
google-chrome	firefox
this is the same mouse button which closes browser tabs or opens google-chrome firefox links in another tab

542270
vmware	virtualbox
as a comparison i did between virtualbox and vmware in ubuntu discourse the more vmware players you have the more blood sucking cpu memory draining vms you will have as shown in the image below

542270
vmware	virtualbox
so if you are running one vm you can easily choose between virtualbox or vmware but if you are looking into creating a virtual network on guest vms vmware would not be recommended over virtualbox

542270
vmware	virtualbox
in my particular case i would rather wait until virtualbox has correct support for ubuntu 14.10 than having to stay with vmware

ubuntu 14.04 is an lts l ong- t erm s upported versioning so it will by default not ask you to upgrade to non-lts versioning like 14.10

note unlike with upstart and sysv init systemd transmission-daemon saves all configuration and settings in home some_user .config transmission-daemon instead of etc transmission-daemon settings.json and var lib transmission-daemon

544185
sysv	systemd
etc default transmission-daemon is used only by the upstart scripts etc init.d transmission-daemon and sysv scripts etc init transmission-daemon.conf and so if you are using systemd init systemd then you can ignore all these files

i think the problem may be that you perhaps did not remove the old wine packages dependencies before attempting to install the new versioning or did not run the wine update as an upgrade perhaps

since your addition is only one line and since the unselected versioning will also be saved alongside irrespective of which option you choose replace the customized versioning with the new one and add yours over after the upgrade finishes

just anyway be sure also that you don t use as a mountpoint a folder with some stuff in it - after you mount another partition disk to it whatever was in the mountpoint directory will be inaccessible - until you unmount the disk again

if that does not fix the problem i recommend doing a fresh clean install of ubuntu 14.04 after fresh install do not install the intel graphics installer that installer was only to be used in a couple of previous versions of linux and not to be used in ubuntu 14.04 it can cause you alot of problems also do not install mesautils which can also cause you problems with resolution

550724
playstation	wii
includes your kidsâ xbox playstation wii ds ipad and even their

550764
disk	ram
it is normal this to happen because when the ram usage gets higher than the ram itself the system starts to swap to disk which makes the system very slow and in your case unusable

550766
mouse	keyboard
no hardware changes to machine - even using same mouse and keyboard

550766
mouse	keyboard
i tried restarting lightdm service keyboard mouse and monitors started working again but it created new session with my eclipse and other tools in limbo

550795

i can recommend you installing linux from windows os with yumi for ubuntu linux

550798

it is also entirely possible that apt-get and update manager will attempt to upgrade the versioning as well and you will need to check to make sure firefox is not upgrade

touch screens is nice for art you can get her a touch pen for greater accuracy later and you wouldn t need the tablet to go with it until she really finds the need for it

550867
antivirus	norton
no offers to norton antivirus or for girth enlargement pills none of that garbage

550868
mouse	keyboard
if they did come bundled with drivers the drivers will not usually be essential but will only add extra features such as a little configuration console that runs all the time in the tray consuming resources or activate extra features on the device usually unrelated to the plain keyboard mouse functionality

550912
ubuntu	linux
and then can i make each of these two partitions becoming one an installer for ubuntu and the other one the installer for puppy linux

sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
it doesn t matter if your user is explicitly listed in the etc sudoers file or not as to this behaviour -- it looks for members of the sudo group and requests a passwd for one of those users

550968
ubuntu	linux
but most tutorials direct me to applications that create linux installation usbs in windows while i want to do it in ubuntu

550970
ubuntu	debian
this is true of all ubuntu and debian official live cd images over the last few years and may be true of other distros

551020
sudo	passwd
but when i entered sudo add-apt-repository ppa webupd8team java and asks for my passwd i give the passwd and press enter and it is blank nothing happens afterwards

and now flash is disabled chrome does not work nothing works i cannot even access folder directory outside of the terminal

551132
dpkg	apt
because apt-get apt and dpkg are not as smart as users assume it will be removing the nginx package does not remove the actual nginx binaries and common files

551132
apache	nginx
note ubuntu server does not come with nginx automatically installed - when you install a web server on ubuntu server via tasksel or as a lamp install you get apache and not nginx

551353

i had installed dovecot and it was working fine then i changed my configurations purge dovecot and postfix and after that installed them again

551354
ubuntu	linux
the short answer to your question changing to 32-bit version of ubuntu should not make any difference in performance because ubuntu overall 32 or 64 bit is perhaps one of the most resource-demanding linux distros

551354
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
as you may know linux mint is derived from ubuntu and under the hood they re not that different

551478
ubuntu	linux
anyways i recently upgraded an ubuntu linux server from 12.04 to 14.04

551483
disk	ram
my thoughts is that since i will not be doing any heavy reading writing to the disk once the os and xbmc is loaded into ram i cannot see why differences in read write speed as pointed to here would play a role

551494
sudo	passwd
the passwd took it works when i use sudo for instance but it is not required to log in even though i have checked that option in user settings

551507

i try things like mount -l dev xvdb1 var www but always nothing happen and i get just response with help or i get response to write filesystems if i use ext4 or ntfs i just get auto respnse with help

551921
installation	upgrade
the first command goes out and looks for the dependencies and installs upgrade them and the second one continues the installation of your package this is usually done by the first command anyways

551922
mouse	keyboard
so i tried rebooting figured not a bad idea and it came back up without all my auto-start programs on the screen and my mouse and keyboard not working - won t even light up the led on mouse or when i press caps lock on the pc

using advice from this tutorial using a lamp on ubuntu 10.04 i have edited the etc apache2 sites-available default file and originally changed both the document root and directory lines from var www to home me sites in my home folder with no sudo or root privileges

552041

the temporary fix - overriding the initial mounting of the root.disk to rw read write instead of readonly readonly is good

552140
ssd	sata
except that now i can choose between sata or ssd disk

552140
ssd	sata
currently i have sata but i m thinking it could be a good thing to opt for ssd especially since i don t need that much storage

552145
xfce	gnome
if you want to revert back to gnome then you should first remove xfce desktop then reinstall gnome desktop

versioning	upgrade
after i upgrade the linux kernel versioning to 3.18.3-031803-generic genius mousepen i608x works well

552236
dpkg	apt
ubuntu is using deb packages so you have to use proper tools to handle them like dpkg apt and some other more or less convenient tools to handle repos in text console or graphics mode

552238
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a debian based system and uses dpkg as the package management system

552238

there is a low but relevant risk that upgrading to another release will damage the data in your home directory or anywhere outside of system folder

552579
filesystems	ntfs
the -iname test will match case-insensitively .mp3 as well as .mp3 - i m not sure if that s important on ntfs filesystems

also if you choose to use ntfs you should be able to simply not format the drive and keep your files but you can also just install ubuntu to a different partition and keep the ntfs partition from windows as storage until you transfer everything over to the linux partition

most desktops have some accessibility settings that will control the mouse with the keyboard already built-in like xfce has them in it s all settings - accessibility - mouse - mouse emulation that uses the keyboard number pad so the 5 key does exactly what you re trying to do

553511
cinnamon	gnome
if i recall gnome cinnamon and mate have similar features under something like accessibility or assistive technology etc

553511

i really like ubuntu but one minor annoyance i ve always had with it is that when using a web browser that places its tabs at the top of the application google-chrome in my case though firefox does this too the unity panel bar at the top of the screen prevents the browser tabs from being placed at the very top of the screen

freebsd	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	freebsd
you will need to either use xterm with meta key configured correctly or a bsd with wscons 4 text console not freebsd which has a different one or a custom keyboard layout i made one for windows nt 4 and up one for the linux text console and three for x11 xfree86â mirbsd old x.org ubuntu hardy new x.org what you probably have

553743
ubuntu	centos
i manage to get the debugging working in centos and i could list the file main.c but i want to get it to work on ubuntu as it s my main distro

553758
ssl	https
google probably works because you have it set to use ssl https instead of which means it is using port 443 and the packets are encrypted so they cannot use packet examinations on select ports to determine if you are tethering

553787
ubuntu	linux
i am kinda new to ubuntu and the whole linux field and have some concerns

553787
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
first i currently have linux mint 17 dual booting with win8.1 via grub 2 my question is how to remove linux mint and install ubuntu instead while keeping the windows untouched

553787
installation	upgrade
when making a separated home partition and happens that i want to reinstall upgrade change dist will the new system recognize that home partition from previous installation or will i have to recreate or point to it manually

553806
ubuntu	mint
i would do a new partitioning removing mint partition and creating your new ubuntu partitions

553815
cpu	processors
processors intel core 2 duo cpu t9400 2.53 ghz x 2

553817
ubuntu	mint
i m german but prefer us keyboards with the english us english international altgr dead keys key layout -- at least that s what mint an ubuntu derivative calls it

553848
nautilus	fstab
note that the name on the nautilus sidebar as well as in the unity sidebar is the name given in fstab

553848
folder	directory
i have no problem double-clicking the mydocs folder from nautilus in my home directory nor navigating through media part either through command line or by clicking folder in nautilus

553853
nautilus	fstab
partitions mounted with fstab not opening from nautilus nor unity sidebars in the process i wanted to include a removable device so it would be present for all users when it was present

553853
nautilus	fstab
this works fine when the hdd is attached to the computer at startup except for the detail in my other question partitions mounted with fstab not opening from nautilus nor unity sidebars but when the hdd is not attached i have two problems

553891
stdout	stderr
to catch that stream you have to redirect stderr to stdout before piping to grep

553892
ubuntu	linux
if you have existing applications like this it should eventually be possible to create linux targets if that s even required and run them natively on ubuntu

553926
vim	gedit
make a new file use vim pico gedit --

553929
filesystems	ntfs
luks works at the block level so theoretically you can put any filesystems you want inside it including ntfs

553937
apache	nginx
as i understand it nginx doesn t support runtime enabling of modules like apache does so would installing nginx-extras impact performance

553986
portrait	landscape
if the orientation of some images is wrong landscape format displaying as portrait or vice versa i rotate the image to correct the orientation and save the file when i close it

553987
mouse	keyboard
i have just installed ubuntu and now my usb keyboard and mouse are not working

553987
mouse	keyboard
the usb keyboard and mouse were working fine while installing from the live cd

553988
vmware	virtualbox
vmware and virtualbox will run at the same time

553988
vmware	virtualbox
if vmware is achieving this then there must be a way that kvm and virtualbox can also

553999
post	get
it is simply too much to explain everything in a post but this will give you some info tho get started

554015
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
so i was tired of ubuntu and tried installing linux mint xubuntu etc

554023
django	web.py
framework web.py can still be used for auxiliary tasks but the bulk of frontend job will be managed by django and a cms mezzanine based on it

554050
sudo	passwd
me mydev etc apache2 sudo iptables -l sudo passwd for me

554081
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and linux has a few

554116
chown	sudo
i ve already tried sudo chown and the error i get is what happens when i try and add the library folder on my second drive

554116
chown	sudo
this happened before and after sudo chown

554151
mouse	keyboard
the multiseat scripts start xephyr with parameters describing the mouse and keyboard to use for that seat

554155
hdd	floppy
try to change your bios setup to boot from the peripheral sources floppy usb cd etc. before hdd

554166
xfce	kde
if this does not works you can try light desktop environments like kde and xfce

554184
pop-up	dialog
.nemo_action files can be used to create menu entries in the pop-up dialog that comes up since these files are read by nemo whenever you right click

554202
dpkg	apt
sudo apt-get install --reinstall dpkg apt update-manager python same error

554231
folder	directory
it s supposed to be able to take a target directory and mount that like you tried and if you don t specify a directory it s supposed to search for encrypted private directory and interactively ask you if it s the folder you d like to recover from dustin kirkland s blog post about it he s the author so try running it without specifying the external directory see if it finds it

554269
sudo	passwd
what are the sequence of commands to modify another user s passwd entry with sudo power in ubuntu

554271
sudo	passwd
just type sudo passwd username to change username s passwd

554277
folder	directory
as i usually do i copied the .gnupg folder into the home directory and installed seahorse-nautilus

554282
kde	gnome
kde and gnome desktops were looking awesome on my ubuntu 14.04 lts today everything seemed ugly

554320
filesystems	xfs
is xfs a distributed filesystems or a journaling filesystems

554320
filesystems	xfs
in wikipedia it says that xfs is a journaling filesystems but in the berkely website they mentioned that it is a serverless filesystems distributed filesystems

554323
filesystems	xfs
it appears you may be confusing xfs a journaling filesystems with xfs which appears to be something entirely different

554327
filesystems	fat
t then c to change partition type to one suitable for a fat filesystems

554374
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
i don t understand linux and debian very well i m not much of a geek but i support open source so i wanted to use ubuntu

554386
switching	screens
webupd8 described how to switching between unity and lightdm lock screens

554396
versioning	upgrade
the first option is going to be better long term as it will enable you to keep all your files and config intact between upgrade and with your current setup you will be able to test o the new versioning to ensure that no essential stuff is broken before you do a full migration

554422
ubuntu	mint
this worked for both ubuntu and mint although some versions of mint needed

554436
versioning	upgrade
you should remove the etc apt sources.list.d utopic.list and etc apt preferences.d utopic files before attempting any upgrade to a new versioning of ubuntu from trusty

554516
mp3	ogg
this will only play mp3 files at the moment but i plan on adding ogg playback as well

554525
filesystems	btrfs
how do i mount the old btrfs partition so that the live btrfs filesystems doesn t treat the old partition as part of the filesystems but lets the mount live in isolation in its own separate mount point

554530
dpkg	apt
whether it was installed by the software center synaptic or the terminal is immaterial here since it most probably uses dpkg or apt for the same

554553
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r murala murala android-sdk-linux

554590
ubuntu	linux
i think same problem have many users of linux ubuntu like me

554600
google-chrome	firefox
this works on google-chrome and firefox and file manager.

554600
cinnamon	gnome
it works in unity gnome and cinnamon as you wanted

554628
ubuntu	linux
my modem huawei e5251 works fine on ubuntu 12.04.1 only after installing huawei data cards linux or mobile partner and it s ok

554654
ubuntu	yosemite
then you can install popular themes from the ubuntu software center like mbuntu which resembles mac os x yosemite numix and several other themes

554667
acpi	vga
i put the iso file with universal-usb-installer-1.9.5.8 into my pendrive all goes well but when i reboot the computer and boots into ubuntu install menu from pendrive where i have options to try install check memory etc and when i try to install ubuntu it only shows a gray screen and then i have a message in my lcd that says frecuencies out of range so i decided to try some commands like vga 771 nomodeset acpi off and others that i found here but with all these commands i see ubuntu and the points un red and white but nothing happens after that i got the same message out of range anyone can tell me how to install it

554681
ubuntu	linux
i have ubuntu 13.10 and i have installed ros but now i reboot linux and the screen is in black

554774
ubuntu	linux
they all use a release of the linux kernel which does all the hardware interaction so it shouldn t matter whether you use ubuntu or let s say suse linux which was preinstalled on my notebook when i bought it

554819
kde	gnome
the gnome or kde keyrings are used to safely keep decrypted keys hence the name and no passwords

554819
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
for example you could install firefox and seamonkey because seamonkey is very similar to firefox. you can also install opera google-chrome konqueror.

554820
kde	cinnamon	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde
in the meantime you could try a different desktop environment and see if it still happens like xfce or lxde or kde or cinnamon or mate or just a different window manager like fluxbox.

554820
slackware	suse	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linux	debian	mint
you could try a different distro one based off of ubuntu like linux mint should be very very similar to ubuntu or one not even based on debian like fedora suse slackware could be very different

554851
sudo	passwd
as long as your sudo passwd is safe problems tend to be local ie

554852
ubuntu	linux
it s hard to read but it looks like there s a tmp partition that sounds like a good candidate to delete if you didn t have an extended partition and still needed to delete one and then recreate the tmp partition though it might require a little recofiguring of linux ubuntu to find tmp again

554853
xfce	kubuntu
i d try a different desktop environment or window manager try a live usb cd of xubuntu or lubuntu or kubuntu or just install xubuntu xubuntu-desktop or xfce4 or lubuntu lxde and boot with xfce or lxde and see if those help

554890
antivirus	rootkit
this virus was proven to be impossible to be detected removed by 50+ most popular antivirus programs rootkit

554890
antivirus	rootkit
i run 50+ yes really different antivirus malware spybots scanners rootkit on windows 8.1 -- both in safe mode and otherwise was a total waste of time

554894
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd username

554901
ubuntu	linux
in my linux system i have gcc version 4.8.2 ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1

554909
google-chrome	firefox
the reason to use firefox is that google-chrome has multiple pids by definition making the process more complicated

554917
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i just tried adding the ppa ppa rob-caelers workrave to linux mint 17 based on ubuntu trusty uses ubuntu repos and synaptic tells me there s 2 versions avaialble 1.10.1-4 trusty and 1.10.5.0-ppa1 trusty1 trusty and it installs 1.10.5 so does apt-get

554936
filesystems	hfs+
it turned out my ipod was formatted with hfs+ filesystems with journalling and was mounted read only on my ubuntu computer

554941
ubuntu	linux
either of them seem unlikely to me however i am a novice in all matters linux ubuntu so an answer from an experienced user may give more insight

554947
ubuntu	linux
and there are lots and lots of programs written for ubuntu or any linux that are not in the repo s it s kind of an uncountable number

554974
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd root

554985
folder	directory
therefore after i found the folder i removed the obsolete directory one at a time for example with

555048
postfix	dovecot
mail was in var mail but in postfix and dovecot config files are in var vmail

555062
ubuntu	linux
i downloaded a linux driver from the canon site and it seems to be the same one as already included in ubuntu the above-mentioned ip2000 series driver

555075
ubuntu	linux
i m completely new to linux i have installed in my computer running on windows 7 a virtual machine with ubuntu desktop 14.04

555077
ubuntu	linux
i am new to ubuntu but i am totally in love with linux and want to keep it as the only os on my laptop

555079
ubuntu	linux
i am newbie in ubuntu linux system

555095
disk	ram
files read from disk are stored in the disk cache of linux ram

555095
disk	ram
if you would like have a filesystem backed by ram rather than a disk then you are looking for a ram disk not to be confused with the linux ramdisk filesystem

555106
versioning	upgrade
if you wish to create 64 bit guests then we recommend that you upgrade to the latest versioning

555110
ubuntu	debian
also i checked this with debian jessie and i don t actually have ubuntu

555143
ubuntu	linux
i am completely new to linux and ubuntu and i was wondering if grub2 which comes with ubuntu is likely to experience problems every time i update windows 7

555164
trojan	virus
you can still download install any available programs you want from any random website but it could be untested may not work may break stuff may be a virus trojan etc just like windows

555171
ubuntu	debian
boot the live cd chose try ubuntu debian etc. open a terminal and then run these commands

555180
folder	directory
create a folder in your home directory called .openvpn with the dot in front of it so it is hidden then open that folder and create one called frootvpn no dot needed

555189
vmware	virtualbox
without seeing the exact error it s hard to tell but a guess is could be filesystem errors though ubuntu is usually good about running fsck on bootup when it needs to running it manually might help maybe from a live iso cd easy to boot from an iso in virtualbox vmware maybe too

555192
ubuntu	linux	filesystems	ntfs
furthermore if your ubuntu partition contains an filesystems which is not fat32 or ntfs and this is most likely the case then windows will not recognize it anyway because windows can t read the linux type filesystems

555192
filesystems	ntfs
linux can read fat32 and ntfs and ofcourse the typical linux filesystems so always perform filesystems operations from within linux

555212
hash	md5
first do a md5 hash check of the iso to verify it

555261
sudo	passwd
make sure you put your sudo user passwd and packages are installed correctly

555265
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade bios to last lenovo versioning and brightness control will work

555285
ubuntu	linux
i m new in ubuntu aka linux world

555286
cinnamon	gnome
similarly you can install other desktop environments like lxde mate gnome cinnamon openbox etc

555300
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
after reading the apachefriends faq i thought that in order to upgrade all i need to do is install xampp in it s newest versioning right over the old xampp installation

555319
folder	directory
for example if there is a directory called temp in your home folder

555327
ubuntu	linux
i ve recently gone about setting up and configuring a linux box with ubuntu 14 for the purposes of providing a proxy server to a school curriculum network

555360

the other is versioning 7.something upgrade from the versioning 6 ubuntu repository originally installed

555377

which should prompt you for your sudo passwd then your windows one

555419
ubuntu	linux
am i able to run ubuntu linux on this processor

555438

in the recent days i had some random freezes suddenly no more reaction to mouse keyboard and hdd led is glowing constantly

555455
ubuntu	linux
i was trying to install driver for my graphics card i m using ubuntu 14.10 and when i install driver from support.amd.com log file says that i don t have kernel headers version.h file in lib modules 3.16.0-25-generic build include linux version.h -but i have kernel headers installed

i have downloaded the linux drivers from the samsung web site and which are in my downloads folder but i cant seem to get to that directory from a command line

555558
sudo	passwd
the sudo passwd is the passwd for your account

555564
installation	upgrade
could not mark all packages for installation or upgrade

555568
uninstall	downgrade
the issue is that i enabled apt-get autoremove a while ago and removing a package to later replace it downgrade threaten to uninstall perfectly working apps from my system

555595
ubuntu	linux
i m a relatively inexperienced linux user having a problem with ubuntu lts 14.04.1 lts installed from the mythbuntu dvd

555631
daemons	systemd
the last systemd i ran linux mint 15 32-bit on a dell inspiron laptop could go on for months before some strange thing happened forcing me to reboot like the sound daemons crashing and refusing to start back up properly or getting logged out and having the systemd unable to accept my password or the then-rare not syncing kernel panic which is all-too-common for me now

555631
ubuntu	linux
for one i haven t known ubuntu or any flavor of linux for that matter to automatically reboot even in the event of a crash

555680
folder	directory
i tried putting the tarred directory before the excluded files folder that still didn t work and i also tried putting . before the allowed directory and also putting quotes around the excluded paths eg

555696
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu as any modern linux uses xkb extension to define the keyboard

555710
vmware	virtualbox
depending on your requirements you may try installing something like virtualbox or vmware

555717
kate	nano	kate	gedit	gedit	nano
use nano or kate or leafpad if you don t have the text editor gedit

the notable service daemons in unix-like systemd

555965
post	get
then i tried rebooting and now i don t get anything on screen post partition select

555969
filesystems	ntfs
windows uses the fat32 or ntfs which are completely different filesystems that don t understand inodes

555969
umask	mount	filesystems	ntfs
when you mount an ntfs filesystems in ubuntu it sets permissions on everything in the partition using the umask command or options fmask and dmask in fstab

555971
filesystems	ntfs
note i have not experienced any out of the blue crashes even after rebooting the problem persists also i moved folders from home me to my external drive and since that drive is mounted in exhd i bind mounted the folders i moved as if they were still on my hard disk the external drive seems to have no problem and uses the ntfs filesystems while my internal drive has my install partition as the problem and uses the ext4 partition

555972
versioning	upgrade
i searched for ubuntu partial upgrade via update manager and i found this it sounds relevant though it s mainly for those of us that run a development versioning of ubuntu and it s probably not an answer you re looking for

555972
versioning	upgrade
short versioning or hmm so i shouldn t blindly do partial upgrade s and dist-upgrade

556014
ubuntu	linux	put	get
i am very new to ubuntu 14.04 and any linux based operating system so if you tell me to put in some kind of command in the terminal please if you can go into detail because i am almost clueless as to how i even get to things on here

556015
xfce	gnome
there is a gnome-applets i m not running unity or gnome on xfce but if i were to install gnome-applets it would also install these

556037
vmware	virtualbox
if your requirement is to run virtual machine with windows inside besides virtualbox or vmware you can try kvm

556044
ubuntu	linux	filesystems	ntfs
i don t know what messing you did with your drive so i couldn t guess if it s bad or not but if you do a fresh install of ubuntu you ll probably want to format it s partition to a ubuntu-friendly filesystems fat32 or ntfs aren t optimal for linux it should be as stable as completely wiping your drive the rest of the drive is just data as long as there s nothing running before ubuntu

it is already configured in network settings but i also have to specify 10.2.0.4 6588 as proxy in firefox google-chrome and anything that wants internet

556331
folder	directory
when you are in the directory test basic_unix and invoke your script your command creates that folder in test basic_unix because that s the current directory that s where you ran the script from

556331
folder	directory
however when you run that script from cron the directory you start with is your home directory so your mkdir command creates the folder there

556340
ubuntu	debian
i suggest using tasksel which is an ncurses based tool that allows you to install groups of packages used in the debian and ubuntu minimal installers

556353
google-chrome	firefox
symptom using a web browser firefox or google-chrome

556359
mouse	keyboard
after login in from lock-screen ubuntu 14.04 lts remains unresponsive or very slow to mouse or keyboard input for about 15 seconds

556382
ubuntu	debian
the exact reason a feature was chosen over another is not known to me however in supplementary discussion with one of the debian maintainers on irc a statement was made affirming my initial assessment that each variant was intended on being a different set of features for a different use case - light for a lightweight set of features that meets bare minimum of site hosting full for a more full set of features without including any much-heavier extras and extras for pretty much everything that is in the package that can be included in ubuntu

556382
ubuntu	debian
nginx-core is the only flavor in the main section of the ubuntu repositories as of 14.04 and exists only in the ubuntu repositories and is not in the ppas or debian and is not going to be included in debian ever

it too is in universe however this flavor is no longer supported by debian maintainers and will be completely dropped from ubuntu with the 15.04 release

556382
apache	nginx
however unlike apache which can be something of a memory whore with the more modules enabled nginx still does not eat as much memory compared to apache when modules are enabled

556420
put	get
so what did i put in my 10-monitor.conf file to get my resolutions

556440
ubuntu	mint
i ve got a machine running ubuntu in the office.i ve got a machine running mint at home

556587
filesystems	ntfs
partition type hpfs ntfs or extended or linux swap or unallocated space or linux filesystems

556587
filesystems	ntfs
the files which you were using under windows which you are looking for can be only in ntfs or fat32 types as this type is windows nt filesystems

556589
installation	upgrade
before doing this i upgrade my ubuntu from 12.04 to 14.04 it asked me during the upgrade which setting did i want for permitrootlogin and when i looked at etc ssh sshd_config after the installation and after adding my ssh key it was set on permitrootlogin yes

556608
ubuntu	linux
not knowing what i was doing i installed ubuntu 14.04 lts over my windows 8.1 technically erasing everything off the hard drive and replacing it with linux

556610
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd

556632
ubuntu	debian
the community edition is relatively easy to set up on ubuntu compared to say gitorious since it is a monolithic debian package

556632
apache	nginx
this should not be seen as an official endorsement since the lts guide also ignores nginx in favour of apache when it comes to web servers

556651

i think this is because of masquerading is set in a way we route everything from lan behing the router via eth3 - which is a wan interface eht3 without a public ip

557122
sudo	passwd
to do this in terminal when executing commands as administrator just use sudo in front of the regular commands and type in your passwd

557128
nautilus	fstab
there are a few ways to do it but if you don t explicitly mount it using either the mount command or an entry in the file etc fstab then it will still show up in nautilus and get mounted automatically the first time you click on it

557128
chown	sudo
make sure you are the owner of this new folder and if not use the sudo chown your_name your_name

557128
folder	directory
next i cut and paste that link into my home directory where the normal documents folder resides

557128

557363
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade to a newer versioning of xubuntu and i am at a loss what to do

557382
icmp	tcp
notice that a ping is an icmp package and dns is an application protocol so they live on a different layer of tcp ip stack of protocols

557382
udp	tcp
a server host could respond to a ping without having any service listening on a tcp or udp port

557384
switching	screens
virtually the same software combination ubuntu + ubuntu-desktop + my application worked fine with 12.04 and tightvnc but since i get a grey screens in tightvnc after switching from ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04 i decided to try x11

557418
chown	sudo
cd sudo chown username -r .matlab

557496
mouse	keyboard
this is my only computer and right now i m using a live cd of kali both the mouse and keyboard work fine in kali

557537
urdu	arabic
for firefox this problem can be solved by setting the urdu nakash noori nastaleeq etc. fonts as default fonts for arabic

557537

now select arabic instead of western and select serif nakash sans-serif nakash or instead of nakash any urdu font

557567
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux temporary swap partition

557568

the upgrade manager has notified me that a new versioning of ubuntu is available 14.04

557740
dpkg	apt
if you back that up and re-install ubuntu you can copy them back to var cache apt archive and can use the dpkg command to restore them

557740
folder	directory
backup your home directory with rsync and skip useless folder

557753
versioning	upgrade
an lts to lts upgrade will focus on upgrading ubuntu to a more current versioning and try and make use of old configuration files your home partition should be left alone as it is personal data

557753
installation	upgrade
that way if your upgrade fails you have a installation cd to use in order to try again and your data can be loaded onto your computer from the external hard drive

557813
ubuntu	mint
what fixed the issue here mint 17 compatible with ubuntu 14.04 was

557889
dpkg	apt

check connect to wireless and ethernet networks and then logout and log back in again

558059

the problem is the gateway cannot reach the internet it cannot initiate traffic requests because it s wan interface em2 has a private ip and it s sourcing internet requests from the private ip 192.168.1.2 i want the linux gateway to source it s traffic out of em2 using it s ip address 1.1.1.1 from em1 it s lan interface

mouse	keyboard
if the dongle is plugged in when i boot linux all of my other usb devices keyboard and mouse fail to start for a few minutes while the system log is generating error messages like the above

558207

it happens because ubuntu takes all the data from the disk that is to be written to the usb and save it in the ram buffer depends on the capacity of ram

558233
vbscript	jscript
you can use jscript or vbscript for example to create scripts that perform a variety of tasks

558233
ubuntu	linux
does linux ubuntu have an alternative to the windows script host

558255
bash	tcsh
basicly bash scripts provides all you would need with full fledged loops and conditions variables and system calls so that you can affect all the aspects of the system and automate tasks and i think gnu linux in general is the master in this kind of stuff so vbs or js you have it in the form of shell scripts like i mentioned bash is the famous amongs almost all the distributions but it is not the only one out there csh sh bourne shell ksh tcsh and many many more

558271

you should be safe keeping 12.04 and just updating it no need to upgrade to 12.10 or a newer versioning

you would get the same kind of behaviour if you would try to install norton antivirus from 15 years ago it just wouldn t work.

ubuntu or any linux based os does not recognize unused space in the disk so to install windows insert any bootable pen devices and will installing it will show you the different partition on your disk .from there you can make a new partition and install windows in it.as per as your second question few things that i can tell is first may be your iso image file is corrupt check its size.second if can try to boot from a pen drive and use software develop for this by microsoft

best of all since dsl is debian based like ubuntu your installation can grow if you choose to move the old hard drive into a newer computer and much of what you learn from the experience will directly apply to a more modern linux installation when you eventually upgrade

since the shell wildcard matches all files and folder except dot files bash ends up sending the names of all files and folder in the current directory as arguments to grep

while some programs have linux ports sadly the opposite holds true for a good part of the availible software.for your decision wether to install ubuntu or not it would be good to see if the software that isn t native for linux but is required by you runs with the wine compatibility layer which casts function-calls from windows-software to the corresponding functions in linux.this means that wine is not an emulator.the developers have a database in which they collect information on software that is known to work with wine and it would propably be smart to look up the software you want to run there

i have never called openssl directly before as may be obvious i am quite ignorant in this area so i cannot speak to whether or not this issue correlates with the gnutls business

make a directory in your home folder

567667
ubuntu	debian
anitx is based on debian as is ubuntu and during install gives the choice to use stable testing or unstable repositories

567667
ubuntu	debian
stable is currently early 2015 the same base as ubuntu 14 while testing is the generation that will become the next stable ubuntu 15 after canonical makes their own changes to the debian core

567667
installation	upgrade
my own antix installation are both on testing they get a hundred or so updates a week but i ll never have to reinstall or upgrade so long as debian continues development with its current process

567667
debian	linux
once the live session is running there s a menu option to install antix and installing works very much like any other linux installer at least from the debian clan

567672

your .config and .pki folder in home directory might be assigned with root permission

width	height
if _net_wm_state_fullscreen is not supported then it uses xgetwindowrect and then compres the width and hegiht rect 2 and rect 3 to screen width and height obtained via widthofscreen and heightofscreen macros

567831
width	height
but we find that window_rect width and heiht are equal to screen width and height

567836
vmware	virtualbox
for the installation what the virtual software does for example virtualbox or vmware is it creates a file with an extension of .vmdk or .vdi for example depending on what software option you use

567836
filesystems	ntfs
if you want to think about it another way inside the file itself is an ntfs filesystems that s what the virtual machine uses but you don t have to worry about that at all

567841

this option is also available with tweak tool under keyboard and mouse â œshow all input sourcesâ

in theory this scanner does work under linux and ubuntu

versioning	upgrade
ideally you should do-release-upgrade from the current versioning to the latest versioning as each step will in theory do upgrade steps needed

sudo ubuntu-studio uses an empty passwd

567877
folder	directory
i do this in a folder called src for source in my home directory but you can do it anywhere you like

although i have not received an update for 3 days you should be sure to run both sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade together as one gets new package versioning and one actually installs the updates

filesystems	btrfs
alternatively you could install ubuntu on a btrfs partition rather than use the default ext4 filesystems

568275
filesystems	ntfs
unlike windows which is only installable on ntfs ubuntu can be installed on many different filesystems types

568284

it should be simply removed from debian and ubuntu repos

on the other hand this will put more wear and tear on the disk possibly causing it to get worse so instead you should just get another disk and make a real backup to it then you can restore it when you get a replacement drive

568953
disk	ram
var run is tied to the specific running instance of a machine at a time due to storing pids of the running processes i would only avoid placing that on a ram disk if you are using a virtual machine and suspend the vm often

568953
disk	ram
there are estimates running applications on a ram disk may result in performance increases of in the 10x range

568970
apache	nginx
another approach if you didn t want to give additional privileges to transmission and you happened to already have apache or nginx installed would be to use apache or nginx to proxy forward connections from port 80 to port 8080

you can run filesystems integrity checks on the host partition ntfs as well as on the root.disk ext3 4

569213

i am very convinced of this having worked with many people who ve lost their wubi installs and it seems that running fsck first usually via boot-repair on a corrupted ntfs filesystems can damage the root.disk beyond repair

when the stable versioning is released do i have to upgrade or is it already stable from the installed updates

571327
versioning	upgrade
the normal sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade will get new repo lists and packages as they are released and ultimately you will have the same packages installed as the final release including the various bugfixes as the versioning transitions from -

x86	64bit
in 2003 amd introduced the perfect 64bit version for the x86 instruction set

571804
mtu	icmp	icmp	telnet
the protocol encapsulation overhead can mean that the default mtu of 1500 bytes will allow small responses such as icmp packets or simple telnet requests to come back to your machine but larger responses will be silently dropped because the size of the response + the size of encapsulation protocol headers of multiple layers will exceed your mtu

571811

this removes the amd driver along with catalyst control center and forces ubuntu to use the linux radeon driver instead

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
if you look at the root system and want to lower the amounts of writes ubuntu debian linux is heading towards a system where all files that are written to often are moved towards a run directory aka ramdisk s

by moving this cache in ram you can speed up firefox and reduce disk writes

about the filesystems better go with ext3 ext4 xfs another one

seeing as how it s just recently become stable i wouldn t be surprised if it were years before it reached debian stable but ubuntu s based on debian unstable...

573118
filesystems	btrfs
pragmatic answer 2012-12-19 many of the developers and testers run btrfs as their primary filesystems for day-to-day usage or with various forms of real data

573118
filesystems	btrfs
the fedora project wiki about btrfs in it s btrfs filesystems draft says as of fedora 16 it is slated to be the default filesystems but that was released back in 2011 so i think that page is useless.

573143
gedit	nano
2 you need to open etc chromium-browser default as root for root open in any editor - nano or gedit

573148
filesystems	btrfs
i was using btrfs and ubuntu had automatically created root and home subvolumes on the filesystems that i wasn t aware of

if you picked windows fedora or centos you wont be using ubuntu

573239

the keyboard operates correctly now and i still have two monitors but this driver produces considerable lag in the mouse

i can notice these keys go through an event sink that is shared with mouse events unlike those of ordinary keys on my keyboard

screens	tablet
the rest should be the same on tiny 7 x86 tablet as on any standard desktop - with touch screens which is just a kind of mouse

573575
x86	64bit
so the partial answer is not ubuntu-touch - do not search for images for arm cpus when yours is intel x86 and 64bit

573589
post	get
in the post you linked in a comment the person answering even mentions how you can get the du command in linux to display using the same metric as windows is using which is actually a kibibyte mebibyte or gibibyte depending on what you are looking at

when you add into the equation that you will quite possibly and frequently have a changing subnet all the time there is no way to accept them all dynamically without accepting all ipv6 inbound connections - at least on a consumer-grade network setup with a much-more-complicated and much-more-expensive firewall appliance you can explicitly do vlan separation to prevent things from communicating with the outside and accept only internal v6 but you can t do this on consumer-grade router technologies

as you probably know the latest adobe flash player is available on linux only via google-chrome it s bundled with it while other browsers such as firefox are stuck with an old 11.2 version

because of this rinat ibragimov has developed fresh player plugin a wrapper that allows linux users to use pepper flash from google-chrome in firefox and other npapi-compatible browsers

in column 3-5 the geometry information tells us the x y coordinates and the width height

576622
folder	directory
what does work differently is that by default user creation on the server additions does not include populating the new user s home directory with folder such as desktop because there isn t one pictures and so on

576654

this data partition makes it where you can access items from linux just in case you need them from use in windows since windows cannot see the z drive ubuntu calls home

i am using ubuntu 14.10 when i installed it i decided to use the recommended option automatically use entire disk for ubuntu this was ok for me cause i just use gnu linux after some months without any problem today i got a message from an application that i ran out of ram i thought it was a mistake so i decided to check my hdd with gparted and i got these surprises

576722

either rename the tar file or place in a separate directory under the download folder

however i recommend resize the 1tb hdd to 50 and create a linux partition from ubuntu on the empty part

that will match it to the bitmask of the folder being copied into so if you are logged in as user-a and copy into a dir with drwxr-xr-x perms 0755 the files will be owned by user-a and have -rw-r--r-- perms 0644

578746
hash	md5
first md5 is a hash function that reads the whole file string input data and generates a defaultly 128-bit long hex-formatted hash

578746
hash	salt
with the utillity md5pass you do exactly the same but the hash gets salt

578746
hash	salt
in cryptography a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hash a password or passphrase to raise entropy

578746
hash	salt
if the hash gets salt randomly every password has a different hash value

578746
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
another advantage is that in case of md5 or sha rainbow tables are less effective as without a salt because without a salt the hash value must be calculated just once for every password

578752

in the finally segment we are using sshpass program you need to install it manually by sudo apt-get install sshpass if not installed to provide the passwd directly in the command you can also use the paramiko module of python here

579207
set	bag
if you still have the router plug that bag in and it should be assigned an ip address otherwise you will need to set your pc network card to the same subnet 192.168.0.x the nas box will have given itself 192.168.0.32 so dont use that one

in other words sometime in the future when you want to upgrade your system to the next permissible versioning of ubuntu the upgrade process will want to refer to the ubuntu-desktop metapackage

gnome on ubuntu is similar in almost all respects to gnome on other linux distributions generally

579311

red hat enterprise linux 6 ships with the gnome 2 desktop environment which is no longer provided in the repositories of the current versions of ubuntu desktop

579322
ubuntu	centos
if you re targeting rhel centos 6 they re using gnome2 that is the gnome used on ubuntu 10.04

you can put sudo in front of the command if it says permission denied and then follow up with a sudo chown yourusername mnt data newdirname so your user account can create new files and folders inside the newdirname folder in the future without using sudo

584337
chown	sudo	chown	mount

mdadm	btrfs

584493
stdout	stderr
i don t think this is a perl problem it is why won t scp run when stdin stdout and stderr are clipped off and also not run from a shell but as a service

584525
versioning	upgrade
if you install a newer versioning of an application when you upgrade your ubuntu versioning remaining outdated settings files can act up

584543

unhook all usb except your keyboard mouse and phone and then see if you get better speeds

584863
sudo	passwd
an admin of course could choose to alter the passwd with sudo passwd but generally it should not be necessary unless you know what you re doing and why you re doing it

584863
sudo	passwd
timestamp_timeout will tell sudo to ask for passwd after 30 seconds again so that you aren t logged in with root privileges all the time

584863
sudoers	passwd
i strongly recommend you read through man sudoers man passwd man shadow

584879

in this way if you re doing something where you definitely need root access you can save some time by logging into root rather than your user account and then using sudo and having to put your passwd in again

versioning	upgrade
it is highly advisable that you upgrade from 14.10 to 15.04 after it eols and after 15.04 is released or that you use the lts release 14.04 if you plan on not upgrading your ubuntu versioning every interim release

584978

585721

when i use ntfs in linux i found that performance is worse than ext4 particularly when opening with the file manager a directory containing several hundred or more files folder it takes way more time to load or when copying large amounts of data like 1 gb or more that s my personal experience after comparing copying the same set of data using the same media and changing the filesystems

585946

if the filesystems is not cleanly unmounted power shortage it refuses to mount unless it s checked with an ntfs filesystems check utility or is forced to mount which most of the times you need to do manually that is using terminal

this may be going against traditional linux wisdom but having one big partition for all files follows current ubuntu thinking - they haven t made this the default in their installer by accident or neglect but because they specifically chose it as a suitable default for most people

mouse	keyboard	bluetooth	usb
it would seem that the positioning of the bluetooth receiver in particular usb ports had an impact with the reception between the keyboard mouse probably something to do with the fact that it s a mini-pc and the processor and other radio affecting devices are situated so closely together and so close to the usb ports

to expand on this answer further the root partition on my current linux machine is at 7.62gbs which is lower than the ssd cache so it would be a fair conclusion that most of the data on the root partition would be copied to the ssd side of the drive as root data is essential for ubuntu to operate and would be used most if not all the time

furthermore the way ubuntu provides read write access to ntfs is through a driver that s slow compared to the standard linux filesystems drivers

594628

it s in the nature of sudo to require typing in the passwd at login and after the passwd cache expired

595735

if you keep your sudo passwd in an unencrypted text file and even in an encrypted it s a bad idea and want to manage it with kdewallet you don t have to worry about sudo -i because it s a much more secure alternative for your use case

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint is a derivative of ubuntu - it is based on the same packages some of which have been replaced with new one to make a customized version

597098
xfce	cinnamon
looking at it seems to be mainly cinnamon xfce mate desktop mods along with some themes - though it probably influences some more system related things such as graphics drivers as mint is supposed to have a more open approach to proprietary software

using ssh and scp instead of telnet and ftp will keep all your traffic to and from the web server secure

597792
ubuntu	mint
is relatively easy add this feature to ubuntu if you want to use this with synaptic thats will be copy the mint implementation to the right place on ubuntu but if you don t want to use synaptic then you need use the feature with the ubuntu software center and this will be more difficult.

when i do a uefi boot from my yumi multiboot stick it gives me no option to choose between ubuntu and windows hardly surprising i guess and instead simply uefi boots windows which i find kind of surprising to be honest but maybe this is due to the fact that i added the windows image after the ubuntu image and this simply replaced ubuntu s efi boot files

there s a delay in the script to give me time to get my hands away from the keyboard before it turns the screen off - because touching any key or the touchpad mouse turns the screen back on - just like it does with a screensaver

one of the things that interested me in installing unity-enabled ubuntu as opposed to kubuntu or mint was the promise that the unity interface could shift if say you plugged in a mouse and keyboard to a tablet

600066
mouse	keyboard
is there any way to reach the tablet interface in ubuntu 14.10 on a 2-in-1 slider model or yogalike pc as opposed to the advertised plug in a mouse and keyboard and get the desktop interface deal as the keyboard on these models merely deactivates or is covered up as opposed to being physically detached

in the mean time you can follow progress on the bug which you linked to or if you re feeling brave try compiling the wip encoding-presets branch once the ui is done that will require gtk 3.12 which means ubuntu 14.10 or later i think or you can try using jhbuild to build the necessary dependencies

furthermore you can t use an ntfs volume as your linux root filesystems

if i use the mint backup tool to backup all my files will i be able to restore it back to ubuntu

603309

the mint backup tool is easy enough to install on ubuntu and it might be a good idea it s a useful tool but it s not needed

instead you should always use the visudo command for this which checks to ensure your syntax is correct preventing the creation of an invalid sudoers file which locks down sudo until fixed

since the correct ubuntu package has a newer versioning that the debian one you have installed simply running an apt-get upgrade should take care of switching this package to the ubuntu versioning

when using gcc as with the g++ command i recommend passing at least -wall to the compiler

many compilers like gcc g++ can combine compilation and assembly in a single step and don t produce assembly code unless asked to do so

i suggest a desktop computer that is a couple of years old and has at least 256 megabytes of ram and 6 gigabytes of free hard disk space

610970
dpkg	apt
well i m thinking that what you have there is actually an apt hook documented in the how apt calls dpkg section of the apt.conf 5 manpage

the app for that is cmd on windows and terminal on ubuntu or any other linux distro and macs

i m beginner with linux and i want to make dual boot ubuntu 14.04 alongside windows 8.1 so i ve process like on this video

611017

this uses no temporary disk space just the space for the output tar file and very little ram just a few mb for perl but it works with the files a block at a time so it s not a problem if your files are bigger than your ram

611791
ubuntu	debian
it will never appear in the ubuntu software center as that is for traditional debian packaged applications

611791

if you wish to ship your application in ubuntu software center you will need to create a traditional debian package following the guidelines on the developer site

611798
folder	directory
as you can see above i have created a folder extra in the root partition under which i install steam games that won t fit in my home directory this folder also means i have somewhere to put stuff if i run out of space on another partition

611838
filesystems	ntfs
mount is telling you that it can t figure out what kind of filesystems it is which does not bode well for being able to access your filesystems at all and so it wants to you tell it with -t ntfs but since it couldn t figure this out on its own this likely won t work either because your filesystems is so damaged

611881
ubuntu	linux
windows makes a copy of some common and some proprietary linux ubuntu uefi nvram variables to bcd and in system registry not belonging to windows boot chain so you can really chain load linux from windows but using uefi firmware boot manager - see bootnext utility

folder	directory
the reason is unallowed is because it s used for directory and ext4 would probably get confused between a folder name and a totally different directory if was allowed in folder names

611942
ubuntu	linux
if ubuntu can t do this any other linux distros with this ability to run vm s without installing any additional software

611963
ubuntu	linux
note that in ubuntu and -in general- under linux file path are described using and not

611968
stdout	stderr
runs the process within the terminal s current bash instance in the foreground the process is listed as a bash foreground job and stdin stdout and stderr are still bound to the terminal

611968
stdout	stderr
runs the process within the terminal s current bash instance in the background the process is listed as a bash background job and stdin stdout and stderr are still bound to the terminal

611968
stdout	stderr
runs the process within the terminal s current bash instance in the background but the process is detached from the bash s jobs list the process is not listed as a bash foreground background job and stdin stdout and stderr are still bound to the terminal

611968
stdout	stderr
runs the process within the terminal s current bash instance in the background but the process is detached from the bash s jobs list the process is not listed as a bash foreground background job and stdin stdout and stderr are not still bound to the terminal

611968
stdout	stderr
so aside from blocking stdin and redirecting stdout and stderr to nohup.out by default it seems to me like it can be considered totally equivalent to

611981
stdout	stderr
your first to third points seem alright although stdin stdout and stderr are still bound to the terminal is not a right notion

611981
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr are still bound to the terminal is alright

611981
stdout	stderr
your have stdin stdout and stderr are not still bound to the terminal in the fourth point which is not right as mentioned in my earlier paragraph

supposing that you want to keep ubuntu os you can install kali linux within ubuntu with a virtual machine virtualbox etc or you can create another partition and install kali linux in that partition so you can dual boot either to ubuntu or kali linux when you start the machine

tcsh	dash	zsh	tcsh	bash	tcsh	bash	zsh

612120
filesystems	ntfs
modern filesystems like ext4 the default in ubuntu ntfs default in windows and hpfs+ default in os x can almost fully mitigate the risk of filesystems corruption by writing a journal onto the disk that lets them revert or complete the partial changes leading to inconsistencies

612130
filesystems	fat

i am having a bit of trouble with my ubuntu installation i am a linux noob so please excuse me

612238
google-chrome	firefox
note that i am assuming that the default download directory of your browser is download which is default for google-chrome and firefox

612244
disk	ram
if i had to put money on it i d say bad ram but there are other possibilities too such as a bad cpu a bad hard disk a damaged trace on your motherboard or a bad power supply

612261
sudoers	visudo
first edit the etc sudoers only with visudo

612262
pop-up	dialog
the downside with inkscape is that the dxf import filter pop-up a dialog to confirm the default scaling and encoding making it not truly non-interactive as far as i know there is not currently a way to prevent that although there is an outstanding feature request for it adding the -z or --without-gui switch doesn t seem to help

612279
width	height
the command to position and scale the window would be wmctrl -r window_title -e 0 xoffset yoffset width height

612282
ubuntu	linux
the installation is done through bash script so most likely the script will determine your linux distro and install .deb package which is appropriate for ubuntu

612290
ubuntu	linux
in my case i found very helpful ubuntu linux toolbox and unix shells by example

612293

apparently virtuoso-nepomuk is tripping up something in the upgrade process and causing an unable to migrate to dependancy based boot sequencing error or something like that

612685
hide	show
my problem is that whenever i press super + d keys or even ctrl + super + d to hide everything and go to desktop my system crashes if an instance of nautilus is open ie i can run multiple programs and still do show desktop but as soon as i open nautilus and do show desktop my system crashes

612706
sudoers	passwd
instead you can edit your sudoers file to allow you to run the apt-get command without the need for a passwd

612773

if i add that as fallback on my site s font-family then i get same results as in firefox opera etc

612826

the lastest version does not work with ubuntu lts 14.04 trusty 64 bit version it worked with the previous 64 bit lts version due to the 32 bit nature of the compiled version of vmg for linux

prior to complete boot when i go to the gnu grub version 2.02 beta2-9ubuntu1 under advanced options for ubuntu â ubuntu with linux 3.16.0-34-generic recovery mode under the recovery menu when i choose fsck to check all system files it gives me the following messages

613092
switching	screens
however if i suspend from the graphical screens ctrl + alt + f7 and then switching to the virtual console it will still automatically suspend

613138
cpu	processors
this appears to be a new feature to be able to enable this processors firmware from the additional drivers menu but looks like a bug in the displayed name of the cpu as a device

613159
vmware	esx
the linux operating system and vmware esx products have a mechanism to update the microcode after booting

613165
switching	screens
if you still install it you can switching between your desktops on the login screens clicking on the â ubuntuâ icon that is in the login field next to your name

613175
ubuntu	linux
the server run on a ubuntu server and i was able to connect from both windows and linux

613188
ubuntu	linux
this is because ubuntu 15.04 uses linux kernel 3.19 which brings changes to the networking api which vmware player has not accounted for yet

613189

as of 2012 many including red hat enterprise linux centos ubuntu have stopped distributing non-pae kernels thus making pae hardware mandatory

613218
ubuntu	debian
wikipedia does not list debian and ubuntu as one of them as their package system is different

613220
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu has its own page and even a page referring to the deb file format

bash	zsh
perform the following steps in the current shell tested with zsh and bash not in dash

i recently upgrade from the 14.xx versioning to the latest 15.04 and when i tried to wake up my computer after entering the sleep mode during install it was not accepting my password

613539
kde	kubuntu
the kubuntu 15.04 is using kde system settings that can show kde control modules kcm for the kf5 plasma5

613541
sudo	passwd
to revert this setting you have to do the following which needs sudo and therefore requires your account passwd

613569
control-structure	break
posix has a different but overlapping list of special built-in utilities -- i m not sure why things like break and continue count as commands rather than control-structure keywords or why posix doesn t consider things like umask must-build-in when they can t be implemented any other way

613573
efi	vga
the crucial information to successfully boot ubuntu in uefi mode even with nvidia drivers was that upon start of efi boot while handing over to grub apple s firmware does not actually activate the vga card as pci-e bus master

613573
ubuntu	linux
however it should be easy to run on or adapt this to any linux distribution providing an efi version of grub ubuntu 14.04.2 lts

613809
debian-based	ubuntu
a quick overview of my system i have ubuntu windows 8.1 and a debian-based os specifically steamos all installed

613814
ubuntu	linux
it s not really relevant when coming from upstart as ubuntu users have had a manual page telling them this for some years now but i mention it for the non-ubuntu users who might read this other linux operating systems users coming from system 5 init + rc are bitten by the fact that systemd is only backwards compatible with system 5 rc

613848
filesystems	ntfs
as for parted --list it s a little more detailed and it will actually tell you if a partition belongs to windows type of filesystems or not it will say ntfs

613859
ubuntu	debian
it may not be possible in a fully general sense but if your deb came from debian or ubuntu directly not a third-party deb then it is required to be reproducible by autobuilders which do something like the following

613865
ubuntu	debian
the tutorial is for debian systems and of limited use for ubuntu

613869
versioning	upgrade
if you need to upgrade then you should upgrade your distribution caixa mã gica 22lts to its last stable versioning

613869
versioning	upgrade
but under no circumstances don t make the mistake to upgrade your older versioning of caixa mã gica to the newer versioning of ubuntu

613869
ubuntu	linux
still coming here in the very hart of ubuntu community is the best thing that any user of ubuntu-derived distros can do as long as he she keeps in mind the way linux distributions relate what they have in common what makes them different what are the characteristics of a specific distribution etc

613882
post	get
if this step doesn t work save the url it presents and if you can t get your system booting post the url here

613909
ubuntu	linux
i also noticed i can access the linux partition at the begin before starting on installing ubuntu from the live desktop

613913

614051
disk	ram
the swap total given by free reflects the swap space configured on your system which is the amount of space that the system can use on disk if the amount of ram is insufficient

614051
disk	ram
in the output you posted we can see that none of the swap is actually used which means that the system has enough available ram and doesn t need to page out any data to the swap space on the disk

614070
versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade my gnome versioning using the gnome3-staging ppa

614080

i made my self a little script to switching screens i ve two identical lcd in splitscreen vs one beamer so i changed the script to match your case

this means you will need to upgrade to a new os versioning very frequently

614111

so the original btrfs subvolume structure was still there in the ext4 filesystems

614130

i ve upgrade my bios to the newest versioning which seemed to help a lot

614233

on some forum thread i found a similarly sounding problem relating to pci related stuff which got me to upgrade the bios versioning

even the boot screens of kubuntu disappeared after switching to nvidia

614318

then if you boot from this usb and select install it will ask you whether to upgrade to 14.04 if indeed you are running versioning 14.04

if they only browse the net use gmail or hotmail or other online stuff maybe thunderbird then you might get lucky

614750
disk	ram
my opinion is that it is unnecessary to configure ram disk for temporary folders in fstab

some linux partitioning tools such as gparted and perhaps the ubuntu installer s partitioning tool ask you to identify gpt partitions as primary vs

while you may have 4gb of ram and may not be using a lot of ram for what you are running linux uses up the remaining ram as cached ram to actually reduce disk activity by caching used applications to ram rather than having to page them from disk next time you open the application

616508

because of swappiness your system is able to better utilize your available ram reduce overall disk activity and dramatically increase system responsiveness when under a heavy load all while preventing system crashes from maxed out ram

616747
sudo	passwd
to use a sudo with no passwd which is not advised at all and make you in risk to hurt your system

616760

the passwd to run commands with sudo is your passwd not a separate passwd

616760
sudo	passwd
to enter your passwd for the sudo command type it in and press enter

616760
sudo	passwd
if you enter your passwd correctly and you are an administrator--which on ubuntu means a user who is allowed to perform actions as the root user through sudo and polkit --then the command will run

if you enter your passwd correctly but you are not an administrator and aren t allowed to run the command as root with sudo you ll get an error

616853
disk	ram
this is not right you need to look at the cached and buffers columns too cached will show the a mount of disk data cached by ram for faster access to the commonly used files and buffered shows the amount of data to be written to the disk

616853
disk	ram
as you know disk access is much slower that ram so to improve performance its a good thing to store some of disk data into ram

this is my guess on why that daemons isn t starting ubuntu 15.04 from what i ve heard has switched for different systemd for starting processes at boot - there used to be upstart and 14.04 which is what i use has that

folder	directory
if you want to manually view the logs then open your file browser to the home directory then press ctrl+h to show hidden folder

617127
stdout	stderr
this will have the commands in the alias ud to run in a subshell and the stdout and stderr of all the commands will be directed to the parent shell so that we can redirect the stdout and stderr of all commands to the same file from our parent shell at once

617127
stdout	stderr
or as steeldriver suggested you could also set the alias as following so that all the commands are grouped together and their stdout and stderr will be redirected at once

617127
stdout	stderr
only the last successful or failed command s stdout and or stderr gets redirected to file.txt all previous commands run and depending on that command s exit code success the next command will run

it would still be worth running do-release-upgrade at this point as that will not only find out what versioning you can upgrade to but it will handle the updating of sources.list for you if you choose to proceed

620353
versioning	upgrade
you don t want it to try and upgrade direct from 13.10 to 14.10 and skip the versioning in between because attempting to do that is likely to cause serious problems

620353
versioning	upgrade
it would upgrade some packages to the versioning in trusty

620353
ubuntu	debian
in theory this is how upgrades to new releases work in debian which is where this system comes from but ubuntu has its own upgrade procedure housed in do-release-upgrade which takes some additional steps and is a little more fool-proof and is therefore the recommended way to upgrade to a new ubuntu release

you don t need to manually download software you need to install silly this is debian ubuntu not windows why do you think we don t have so many viruses and malware like windows does

620652

it s because of certified package management and debian ubuntu by far has the largest repo of any other unix like distro

you ll have to reboot after this conversion but your linux installation will no longer be bootable so be prepared with an ubuntu live image

as pointed out by ejno it s fine nvidia drivers depend on make because make is needed to build the modules against the current kernel on installation kernel upgrade removing make without removing the nvidia drivers would have left the nvidia drivers package broken so they were removed by apt-get

versioning	upgrade
as it appears in this picture the versioning of 14.04.x will have different versioning of the kernel so 14.0.4.1 will continue with the kernel of v3.13 till april 2019 while 14.04.2 will have 3.16 for 18 months then to be upgrade to 14.04.5 with the versioning of kernel o be applied then

621422
versioning	upgrade
ubuntu 14.04 is the versioning i am using which was directly installed meaning not upgrade from lower versioning of ubuntu

621436
ffmpeg	libav
it seems that the original ffmpeg has been dropped by debian for the moment in favour of the fork libav but will be back in 15

621436

some people seem to think ffmpeg is deprecated or stale it s not it s just that in 2011 a group of devs decided to fork it as avcodec libav

for-loop	loops
the second time however i m in an inner for-loop which is itself nested inside the outer while loops

621612
for-loop	loops
if i used continue with no argument this would be equivalent to continue 1 and would continue the inner for-loop instead of the outer while loops

621652
ubuntu	linux
a solution i ve considered is a generic linux boot from cd usb which in turn kicks off the ubuntu boot from the installed hard drive

621675
titlebar	window
if i understand your request you must use the action shade instead of lower to hide the window but still see the titlebar

621683
stdout	stderr
normally pipe | will take the stdout of the left sided command and pass it as stdin to the command on the right side of | in your case the previous command prints its output on stderr as an error message

621683
stdout	stderr
so doing | would not help we need to pass both the stdout and stderr or only stderr to the right sided command

621683
stdout	stderr
will pass the stdout and stderr both as the stdin to the right sided command

621693
stdout	stderr
this leaves the approach of rerunning the last command and piping both stdout and stderr into a command substitution

621700
versioning	upgrade
i don t know about the earlier network path can t find error maybe googling it could have found a solution or maybe the upgrade just didn t work doing a fresh install of the versioning you want should be more reliable than trying an upgrade from an old versioning

to manually check if a string is really some user s password you must hash it with the same hash algorithm as in the user s shadow entry with the same salt as in the user s shadow entry

622045
ubuntu	linux
by default users on ubuntu and most other gnu linux systems can view information about processes run by other users including root including their command-line arguments

622045
hash	salt
an attacker with your salt is not as bad as an attacker with your salt and hash but it s not ideal

622045

they also have a leading which is why the hash type and salt are and rather than and respectively

folder	directory
if you re planning to do multiple dumps in the same directory a pretty clean way to do it would be to set the ownership of the folder to mysql and to set the sgid permission on the folder thanks to muru for this suggestion this way mysqldump will be able to write to the folder but new files will inherit the the group from the parent directory

on a traditional hdd it is plausible that later filesystems implementations like ext4 may be only slightly better at tracking free space and coping with mostly-full drives than earlier implementations of ntfs but remember that ntfs itself is improving and later oses like windows 7 8 etc have improved algorithms for allocating space even though the on-disk ntfs format they use is essentially the same

other packages in multiverse but not part of ubuntu-restricted-extras include a small range of linux based software included either because ubuntu thinks you re very likely to want to install it on ubuntu or because it is very much open source software in spirit but misses out on qualifying with ubuntu s definition of free software for some reason such as by including some binary code without source or some license terms that make its license incompatible eg a non-commercial clause or any other custom clauses added to otherwise compatible open source licenses

629226

as i say post a comment if yo get problems

i tried to put the vm on host-only but then it does not get any ip adress

629299
installation	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
while a apt-get dist-upgrade will take care of the bulk of the upgrade that is to say download and installation of newer packages it will not detect the existence of a new release of ubuntu or debian which the ubuntu gui utility will do

ubuntu	centos
figure out where applications on centos store data which you can reuse on ubuntu if you use the same desktop environment a lot of settings will be preserved in your folder but in order to make sure you have to research this information for each application that you want the settings to be preserved

629360
ubuntu	centos
install ubuntu and include the data from the shared partition like you did on centos

629360
ubuntu	centos
this setup allows you to share data between multiple os as long as applications don t get confused with different versions using firefox 36.x on centos and 38.x on ubuntu will cause the settings to be updated at every start and might mess up files at some point - this is a per application research task as well

629376

629466
ubuntu	yosemite
i had the same problem with yosemite not now being detected in the ubuntu alongside mac option and also was confused at howtogeek on how to partition manually and here s what i did i created three fat partitions in mac disk utility 80gb for the main 8 gb for the swap and 1gb for the bios boot and then went to ubuntu s install something else option highlighted and pressed change for these three partitions as mount ext4 for the 80gb main partition 8gb for the mount swap and 1 gb as mount for for whatever they now call the boot loader instructions and lastly click install now

629473
ubuntu	debian
i have read some guides on how to create debian packages like this one for ubuntu users and this one on debian wiki but correct me if i m wrong but they only seem to mention packages that are installed via the make utility while mediawiki being a wiki application is installed if you could even call it an installation by creating an apache mysql server database for the wiki and running the setup scripts

629476
mouse	keyboard
i could get the screen back when moving with the mouse or pressing keys randomly on the keyboard

my laptop lenovo w530 has a broadcom bluetooth adapter internally usb is the interface

629495
put	get
if you have a broadcom bluetooth adapter you might have to get a .hex firmware file from a windows driver and put it in lib firmware directory to support all bluetooth features

629495

i was wondering on what sel4 micro-kernel can do for ubuntu such as make a new version selinux better than the original making a linux system mathematically hack proof

629612

however i still use linux ubuntu on all my personal systems because linux is superior to windows in every possible way

629612

there are many tools to install packages in ubuntu some of these tools are gui such as ubuntu software center - synaptic - etc ... while others still cli if you like the command line mode such as apt-get dpkg aptitude ...

629711
stdout	stderr
bash xtrace output is written to the stderr while piping | you are just giving the stdout of bash -x path to a script to more or any other command on the right side of |

629711
stdout	stderr
will pipe both the stdout and stderr to more so you can use them both with more

629712

based on a web tutorial i set up my 5900 shh tunnel with the lan ip adress of the server 192.168.1.110 so it looked like l5900 192.168.1.110 5900 in putty

630001
tunnel	wan
shame on me i used the wan ip in both the target host and the tunnel

630001

the sure way to configure putty is to always use the lan ip for the 5900 tunnel

oddly enough i appear to never loose control of the keyboard and mouse

630045
mouse	keyboard	switching	screens
upon switching the screens off and on i ve found that my futile efforts to move the mouse and type on the keyboard did do something it was just that the screens stopped updating

if on the other hand you re aiming at contibuting to debian ubuntu you re going to use at least debuild which runs lintian and signs the files

ubuntu	linux
this is fixed in linux 4.0 and has arrived as a backport in ubuntu 15.04 as a kernel update through the vivid-updates channel

630363
bash	tcsh
it s likely due to the fact that my bin sh is set to be tcsh and not bash which is technically valid in linux see chsh

630363
bash	tcsh
bash and tcsh set environment variables differently

630404

630522
vpn	lan
and beside that you can start trial and error with your own machine inside your lan or maybe vpn

630522
debian	centos
for that case i would take debian or if you like the enterprise-way centos for compatibility with rhel

630525
filesystems	ntfs
not a good idea to defragment ntfs from ubuntu though not a native filesystems

630538

631288
folder	directory
automatically divide your files into a recursive directory with an arbitrary number of files per sub folder folder per superior folder

631288
folder	directory
the easiest and imho most efficient way is to have a script reorganize the files into folder if necessary even different layers of directory levels

631288
folder	directory
i tested in on a directory of 300.000 files to be reorganized in chunks of max 100 files to be organized into superior directory of max 100 folder etc

631288
folder	directory
in the head section set the path to your directory the desired number of files per subdirectory equal to folder per containing directory

631288

however when i switching user to another account without logging off the screenshots that come back are just shots of the lock screens

you can pick one or the other by using a number 1 for stdout and 2 for stderr though stdout is implicit so you could just do and you would get stdout printed to your file.

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
after restarting i found fedora 22 and other two linux distro ubuntu and linux mint

632313
folder	directory
i know that in windows s command prompt if you change directory you can then autocomplete scan files within that folder by using the tab key thus saving you time typing out the file name

632313
ubuntu	linux
is there anything similar to this in linux ubuntu 14.04 s terminal

632314
dpkg	apt
dpkg error processing archive var cache apt archives php5-mcrypt_5.4.6-0ubuntu5_amd64.deb --unpack

ubuntu	mint
your mint and ubuntu installations were probably also in efi mode but they can switch pretty easily and so would still boot in bios mode after you installed a bios-mode grub. there is one possible flaw in this analysis you didn t specify how many disks your computer has

632315
ubuntu	mint
chances are you ll then be able to boot windows mint and ubuntu but not fedora

632315
ubuntu	mint
you can boot into whatever os controls grub presumably mint or ubuntu and do a sudo update-grub to get it to detect fedora

632315
ubuntu	mint
edit based on your boot info script output you appear to have an efi-mode installation of windows and a bios-mode installation of ubuntu mint and fedora

632315
ubuntu	mint
it should show you options for windows and for both ubuntu and mint although they may be hard to tell apart initially

632315
put	get
also your fedora install seems to put the kernel inside an lvm so you ll need to split off a separate boot partition to get it to work or at least copy your fedora kernels to the esp or some other accessible location

632315
ubuntu	linuxmint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linuxmint	debian	mint
you can tackle that later. if refind works from a removable media install its debian package or ppa from ubuntu or mint then tackle fine-tuning it create a boot partition for fedora and give the ubuntu and mint partitions names of ubuntu and linuxmint respectively so that refind will show the correct icons

632315
vmware	virtualbox
as a side note i d say that it s probably better to use virtualization virtualbox qemu vmware etc. rather than try to boot so many oses on bare metal. multi-boot setups like yours are complex and difficult to maintain whereas virtualization enables you to isolate each os in its own container thus making things much simpler to manage

632321
switching	screens
switching from fglrx to xorg video for my ati graphics card solved my blank ctrl-alt-f1 console screens problem and restoring a home .config plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc file that wasn t missing 60 lines of containments got me a working desktop

632321

632403
ubuntu	linux
this is a bit more tricky and could cause some issues but i have been running the linux 4.0 kernel on ubuntu 14.04 for a while now with no issues

632407
jobs	cron
these are different and usually it s better to use bash in cron jobs

632426
folder	directory
do this by changing directory to the folder you want to revert so you don t revert the wrong thing

632429
ubuntu	debian
if any of the ubuntu options works you can install refind via its ppa or debian package and you should be good to go

632436
folder	directory
i restored my home directory and as expected have problems after i enter startx i have a background and a few desktop folder but nothing else

632991
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade gnome to latest versioning then i downgraded it

632993
ubuntu	mint
50 of answers i find to problems with my ubuntu or mint come from the arch forums so there clearly can be an intersection of answers

632995
google-chrome	firefox
if you are familiar with google-chrome extensions or firefox addons gnome shell extensions are similar to them. you can find and install gnome shell extensions using this website

632995
switching	screens
by a user they can be installed and activated in the browser by setting the switching in the top left of the screens to on and clicking install on the resulting dialog if the extension in question is not installed

633003
ubuntu	linux
as i said on systemd ubuntu linux version 15 you can simply put the symbolic links back directly without fussing about with packages at all

633022
disk	ram
the is where the system transparently uses ram to store things from disk to make their second access faster

633065
sudoers	passwd
to work around that add pm-suspend to etc sudoers file to be executed without passwd more info here

633065

the sudo pm-suspend won t prompt you for passwd then

after upgrading to kde 5.3 using kubuntu backports ppa my system looks ugly with gtk themes overriding the default kde breeze themes despite having all workspace and widget themes set to breeze in system settings

633110

i ve installed both anthy and mozc in order to type japanese characters on my system and it works for the most part both work in skype libreoffice the terminal and everything else i have tried except for google-chrome even firefox

633110
google-chrome	firefox
if necessary i can type in a word-processor and copy and paste the japanese text into google-chrome but this is both annoying and impractical and i don t actually like firefox

on linux systems ubuntu there is only one root user who is the only member of group root

633163
folder	directory
as far as viewing ubuntu s root directory same as windows c folder pilot6 has already gave you the correct solution click on the computer icon in file manager s left panel

633166
filesystems	fat
fat filesystems you should set the fat option to true

633173
put	get
instead grubx64.efi and shimx64.efi the bootloaders typically get put into efi ubuntu just like on the internal hard disk

633181
ubuntu	debian
unless the grub setup goes easier than i d expect refind should be easier to set up -- if refind on usb flash drive or cd-r can boot your existing ubuntu just install the debian package or ppa in ubuntu and it should set itself up automatically to the esp on the internal disk

633205
tar	gunzip
after you download the tar gunzip archive from oracle and i ll post a bash script that will automate the installation of the jvm jdk

opera	firefox
runescape is a java-based mmorpg that on ubuntu can only be accessed or at least to my knowledge via going to in a java-supporting web browser such as firefox or opera with the required plugins

633235
jobs	cron
or you could schedule a cron jobs for it

633239
sudo	passwd
my sudo passwd doesn t work in this field either

633289
filesystems	ntfs
because ntfs is a windows filesystems and it does not use linux permissions

633339
folder	directory
since the â œ var lib dropboxâ folder is in the root directory it will need superuser permission for dropbox to be able to access it

633343
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome flash is working correctly the flash plugin in google-chrome is newer than the flash plugin in firefox and doesn t contain the bug

633343

sudo	passwd
you can delete the oem s account with sudo userdel accountlogin and change the root passwd with sudo passwd

633433

to consider the possibility that the oem may have enabled the root account perhaps a better alternative is to disable the root account altogether with sudo passwd -ld root more info here

with that back up your data and when you install ubuntu server you can format the drives as a linux raid then restore your data

633601
