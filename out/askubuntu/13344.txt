the problem is that either you need a system that has an iommu that can support re-routing the pci -e bus using hardware virtualization this needs cpu bios and chipset support

255907
pci	iommu
even systems that have an iommu working enough to support things like network card passthrough fail when working with video cards since the video cards are still treated as special by the pci bus for legacy reasons particularly the primary card as marked by the bios

257616
xfce	gnome
switching from gnome to xfce

257616
xfce	gnome
xfce is a lot more light weight than gnome but most of this light weight is in the form of memory and resource usage and with your 2gb of ram that s probably the area where you have the least problems

257641
versioning	upgrade
how to know what to what versioning redmine will be upgrade

257648
portrait	landscape
there is no longer a tab for sheet which gave options for orientation landscape portrait margins etc

please note that the yum is a package manager for redhat fedora etc

257650
ubuntu	debian
equivalent package manager for ubuntu debian is an apt

folder	directory
using a symlink to move the steamapps library folder out of the steam directory causes problems since some games appear for whatever reason not to follow symlinks

257696
vmware	virtualbox
i have xubuntu installed on my home computer and recently installed vmware virtualbox with which i created a virtual machine running windows 7 so i could run postureminder software which accesses my usb webcam

257696
mouse	keyboard
the software works fine when my focus is on the virtualbox the mouse keyboard is inside the virtual machine i joined the vboxuser system group in ubuntu to enable this but when i switch back to xubuntu the postureminder software does not registered me as being at the computer for the period i have worked in xubuntu

257714

but data is still written to the old directory supposedly because the permissions to the new folder are not granted - how can i give mongodb the necessary permissions for that directory

257725
disk	ram
i have given it 30gb or hard disk space and 3 gb of ram yet ubuntu is lagging

257749
ubuntu	debian
it would be nice to have oprofile back in debian and ubuntu but it will probably not happen without a volunteer stepping up to maintain the package not necessarily oprofile itself

257758
mouse	keyboard
the system should work without keyboard and mouse only barcode scanner

257777
put	get
i was able to put the image only on the external monitor but when i unplug it i get no image at all on my laptop

this can be done by right-clicking on the directory icon and choosing sharing options then check share this folder and optionally assign some share name the click create share

257901
sudo	passwd
type sudo . desktop installati and enter your passwd

257907
put	get
so what you are seeing is the posix permissions + the acl mask and when you put them together you get the effective access

257910
switching	screens
one annoyance i noticed in ubuntu however is that switching between using the touch screens vs the mouse causes the cursor to jump

257910
switching	screens
what it actually seems to do is move down and to the right a bit when switching back to the touchpad after touching the screens somewhere

257915

257944
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux i tried ubuntu 12.10

257958
sudo	passwd
the reason is because you don t have a sudo passwd yes sudo not root

257958
sudo	passwd
you can if not you have another problem new question install software trough the software center with a sudo passwd of an administrative user

257978
ubuntu	linux
you can download the bootable usb flash drive or cd-r image of refind use that to boot linux install the debian-package version of refind within ubuntu and then type sudo mvrefind.sh boot efi efi refind boot efi efi microsoft boot

258033
ubuntu	linux
i originally intended to use refit to dual boot linux but that process failed when i downloaded alongside ubuntu

258049
sudo	passwd
how can i give a user one passwd for normal usage when logging in and another passwd for system administration and sudo access

258080
filesystems	ntfs
i guess you don t see the ubuntu partitions in windows because they re in a diferent filesystems ext2 ext3 or ext4 and windows recognizes only fat16 fat32 and ntfs filesystems

258082
stdout	stderr
by default stdout and stderr are both output to the tty your bash prompt where they are displayed but you can redirect the output

258082
stdout	stderr
interestingly the same effect as in the script could be achieved by using which is shorthand for redirect both stdout and stderr

258103
sudo	passwd
put in a username and passwd using the same username that you will be using for sudo - one for each user that will be using it

258114
versioning	upgrade
if you re-install using the 64-bit installer and do not format the discs you will end up with a 64-bit machine where all but maybe not all it will sort of upgrade to newer versioning so if there is no newer versioning .

for command line applications then prefix the command with sudo you will be asked to enter your passwd

258204
geany	gedit
or you can use geany reinteract gedit or whatever

258213
move	drag
when in normal state i move the mouse to the border and the cursor changes to the resize cursor but then nothing happens when trying to drag the border

as soon as i found out that steam is available on linux formatted my win7 and installed ubuntu 12.10

use sudo passwd root command

258252
switching	screens
now on ubuntu the laptop seems to redo the connection to the projector whenever i switching back to it and this way the projector shows its off screens for some seconds and needs to resync to the laptops vga channel.

258259
folder	directory
since i always tend to have a lot of junk in the documents pictures music download folder i was wondering if it would be a good idea to mount home on a separate hdd or to just change the directory for documents pictures music download by editing the file

258264
mouse	trackpad
the nipple mouse works fine as do external mice and my wacom tablet and the trackpad s buttons also still work just not the trackpad for moving the mouse

258283
tablet	galaxy
won t i be able to download and install ubuntu on other tablet like samsung galaxy tab or micromax funbook

258305
filesystems	ntfs
having said that by doing a normal dual boot it will not be using the underlying ntfs filesystems so it might solve the problems you are seeing if not hardware related

258310
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	debian	centos
you can control the computers from ubuntu debian redhat centos fedora suse mac windows and mobile devices

258322
ubuntu	linux
my question can be rephrased as can i grab some linux c code and compile it in ubuntu for tablets

258354
cpu	processors
this package uses the cpu as opposed to the gpu for 3d graphics rendering which may speed up your machine if you have a fast new processors or pc but may also add yet another bottleneck to your system if your cpu is slower than your graphics card

258359
pbm	pgm	ppm	pgm	ppm	pbm
the netpbm pam documentation suggests that i will have a fairly seamless transition if i choose to start using pam instead of ppm pgm pbm as an image format

258359

pgm or ppm image

258359
ppm	pgm
pgm or ppm and does so with a recent version of the netpbm library

258395
ubuntu	linux
this is my first attempt at ubuntu or any linux based os

258404
rar	zip
it is important to note that it will extract a large number of formats 150+ such as iso udf rar etc but will only create a smaller number of formats such as zip bz2 7z xz etc but the most well known ones are available

258428
ubuntu	linux
i am trying linux again after many years and i have installed ubuntu 12.10

258443
ubuntu	mint
i have some experience in the past with ubuntu and mint and it has always been simple to install or make partitions - but i ve been hearing things about the secure boot feature preventing this

258452
x86	64bit
i want to use ubuntu 13.04 but on the daily builds download page there is only pc intel x86 desktop image listed for intel and 64bit pc amd64 desktop image listed for amd cpus

258457
x86	64bit
this is the architecture description because the amd64 instruction set became the prevailing instruction set for 64bit consumer cpus based on the x86 platform

258474
folder	directory
in general programs on linux tend to keep user files in hidden directory in the home folder either under .local share .config or .cache or in a separate .programname directory

258480
ubuntu	linux
my goal is to instal team fortress 2 onto the ubuntu part so i can play tf2 in linux

258497
ubuntu	linux
however that is no excuse for letting the compressed image balloon up so ubuntu along with most other linux distros still uses squashfs for compression

258501
ubuntu	linux
unplugged windows hard drive before installing ubuntu as previous versions of linux always destroyed my windows installation

258537
kde	kubuntu
i m running a fresh install of kubuntu 12.10 with kde 4.10 installed from the backports ppa

my hard disk is quite old and slow but i have excessive ram 16 gb 2133 mhz so i was thinking about using that ram for faster fetching

.htaccess	httpd.conf
in apache webserver i have read that we need to add the following code to httpd.conf file or to an .htaccess in the directory where our video files are

258780

so my question is where is this httpd.conf or .htaccess available do i manually need to create these files or they are stored somewhere

258780

video width 320 height 240 controls

258805
mouse	keyboard
i m using ubuntu 12.10 on intel nuc and have no keyboard only a mouse attached

258806
ubuntu	linux
i don t think that it is possible to help you understand linux ubuntu an the especialy the kernel by typing some lines here

258842
ubuntu	mint
i m looking to erase the mint installation and put ubuntu down in its place without disrupting my windows or data partitions

258846
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
the charm exposes a configuration option wp-content while a little deceiving this option allows you to point to any git bazaar mercurial or svn repository

258846
apache	nginx
from there the charm would configure it with it s own wp-content configuration and apache nginx configuration but it would share the same core base

258859
ubuntu	mint
boot the ubuntu livedvd or liveusb during installation choose the something else option select the mint partition as your mount point and select it for formatting to erase mint

258862
screens	tablet
i did try the latest 64bit ubuntu 12.10 from live usb and noticed that it couldn t detect the tablet screens

258862
screens	tablet
do you guys think the tablet screens would be detected if i make a complete installation on to the notebook

258865
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is not a drop in replacement for windows in general does not run windows programs well and if you want to run ubuntu i suggest you look at linux native alternates to your windows programs

258896
ati	nvidia
you should also make sure you have either ati or nvidia proprietary drivers installed

258930
filesystems	fat
home is simply a name given to a partition - you can format the partition with any filesystems you want ext4 ext3 fat etc

258942
filesystems	xfs
ps its recommended to use xfs filesystems with very large data volumes

258952
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
starting with ubuntu 10.04 i enabled the root accout with sudo passwd root then edited the sudoers file with sudo visudo and rebooted

258952

259058
mouse	keyboard
fully-functional display mouse keyboard everything

259068

259075
ubuntu	linux
hi i am brand new to linux and ubuntu and i recently attempted to install ubuntu 12.10 on a really old laptop i found in my basement a presario 2700t

259103
ubuntu	debian
to extract the information from the apt cache you use apt-cache or other debian ubuntu tools such as aptitude

259106
ubuntu	linux
the android os is based on the linux kernel so theoretically all android phones should be able to run ubuntu for android

259130
dpkg	apt
you can then install this .deb package with sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb and then dpkg and therefore also apt will know that this package is installed

259134
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i tried with a different adsl modem from my friend and it worked perfectly with my linux mint 13 based on ubuntu 12.04

259137
ubuntu	mint
for mint user you ve to modify two files as mentioned in this post then you can use ubuntu software center .

259155
folder	directory
i have created a directory in my www folder using terminal and root user

259155
folder	directory
other files and folder in www directory are accessible via browser i uploaded them via ftp client

259160

the previous debian ubuntu approach relied on renaming binaries and using alternatives

259168
ubuntu	linux
i m fairly new to linux and ubuntu and i recently wanted to install tf2 on ubuntu

259207
sudo	passwd
sudo mount -t cifs server share -o username user passwd passwd uid 1000 gid 1000 iocharset utf8 file_mode 0777 dir_mode 0777

259209
folder	directory
server details the ip of the shared directory type windows share and then you state share folder and user details domain user password

259217
ftp	telnet
i tried with several ways which is given like telnet to test whether my ftp server working properly or not

259238
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade with that very same script too in case a new st2 versioning pop out

259252
ethernet	wireless
i am running ubuntu 12.10 alongside windows 7 i can connect to the internet using ethernet but cannot detect any wireless networks

259261
ubuntu	linux
i m looking for the most efficient method to keep my new conversion to ubuntu and linux current

259269
daemons	systemd
maybe there s not a lot of difference as the dropbox daemons would have started when the systemd was restarted as advised

259309
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
each kernel update adds o 100mb to the installation which will not automatically be freed until upgrade to a new ubuntu versioning but you can manually remove the older kernel packages

259354
ubuntu	linux
i am new to ubuntu 12.04 and linux and need specific instructions

259359
versioning	upgrade
upgrade installed packages to their most recent versioning

259359
versioning	upgrade

259377
ubuntu	linux
regarding your question about programming editors ubuntu and linux in general have a great set of choices

259402
ubuntu	linux
while there should be no problem you might want to double-check whether the tool chain that matters to you has an appealing counterpart on ubuntu linux

259403
mouse	keyboard
so i upgraded to 12.04 and when i booted back up my wireless keyboard worked fine on the grub screen but as soon as i get to the log-in screen neither the keyboard not mouse worked

259414
submit	submission
you mention that you are a student - if you are creating documents to submit for assignments i would not recommend submission .doc or .ppt files created with libreoffice - the teacher might not see what you see

259414
submit	submission
if you can submit pdfs then i d be more comfortable - as long as you review the pdf before submission to make sure it says what you meant it to

259422
xfce	cinnamon
you may choose to install a different desktop environment such as xfce cinnamon mate etc in order to improve the vm s responsiveness

259450
dpkg	apt
you ll need to install them with apt to pull from archives or if you have a .deb of the package you need you ll need to install it first or at the same time as your new package using dpkg

259494
kde	kubuntu
this doesn t appear to work the same in kde kubuntu

259499
ubuntu	linux
when issuing a reboot from ubuntu 12.04 12.10 linux kernel 3.5 the laptop hangs for about 1m30s on the restarting system line of the shutdown output

259516
children	parent
according to answer yes to this super user question do children processes inherit ionice priorities from their parent

259517
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r user user mnt mydata adds owner - replace user with your user name

259517
folder	directory
final step - create symbolic links from home directory folder to your hdd folder with this command

259517
folder	directory
after this delete all folder named as old from your home directory

259517
folder	directory
after this every file that we put to folder in home directory lands on hdd so we don t force sdd to make read write operations

259520
ubuntu	linux
i am not an extremely experienced user of ubuntu linux so i don t where to go from here

259527
ubuntu	debian
when i installed ubuntu 10.10 or any distro derived from debian i had a similar problem

259530
ubuntu	linux
i googled that last line about nss-myhostname and i got a bunch of hits regarding all kinds of other linux distros just not really anything about ubuntu is this relevant at all

259535
cpu	processors
where processors is the number of my cpu core allowed me to shut off turbo boost for that core

259554
versioning	upgrade
you probably need to upgrade to a newer versioning of gnu-efi

259559
post	get
i am trying to get scripts showing on desktop right click if i manage i will post an update

259598
ubuntu-server	linux
but since then i reinstalled xbian on the pi and reinstalled ubuntu-server on the linux box

259656
ubuntu	linux
having said that there are some .exe files that work well in linux ubuntu through a program called wine

259725
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu choose the debian drivers

259726
mp3	m3u
i d like to generate a m3u playlist for a directory containing mp3 files on my server from the terminal

259741
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve installed ubuntu kubuntu and linux mint in asus x401a

259751
folder	directory
note this will move all files which have ubuntu in their name in the current directory and the destination folder name should not have ubuntu in it

259757
versioning	upgrade
if you don t like to upgrade every 6 months you can use the versioning 12.04 lts long term support

259765
versioning	upgrade
but the upgrade versioning is more interesting more easy to use and has enhanced features extended display

259782
google-chrome	firefox
i know vlc may still in some way be using adobe flash - all i know is that get stuttering on full screen on firefox and google-chrome when playing youtube videos in the browser - i do not with vlc

259784
ubuntu	linux
i m using schroot to run chroots for several different linux systems such as ubuntu 10.04 i386

259819
ubuntu	debian
i used to run the exact same file on debian so what should i do to run this file on ubuntu

259838
ubuntu	mint
i m still a little unclear of no longer want to use manjaro and want to install ubuntu mint

259885
versioning	upgrade
assuming you have old versioning of the packages foo and bar you can use apt-get install foo bar which will install the latest versioning of selected packages foo and bar resulting in an upgrade

259899
versioning	upgrade
if there are specific packages that you don t want upgrade you can lock them to the current versioning

259905
ubuntu	linux
operating system ubuntu linux 12.04.1

259923
versioning	upgrade
i was running versioning 16 attempting to upgrade to versioning 18 through synaptic

259969
cpu	processors
but you can install a special software library that â œfakesâ emulates a 32-bit processors using your actual 64-bit cpu and the program should run without issues

259969
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu plus gnu linux in general we need a library called â œia32-libsâ for that

259979
lan	intranet
if you want it to work only in lan intranet then create a static dns entry in your physical firewall or router for that website

259986
mouse	keyboard
is ubuntu touch for phones and tablets meant to be dockable with an external keyboard mouse monitor

259986
mouse	trackpad
if so how will the touch gestures for navigation be handled when using a mouse or trackpad

260006
apache	nginx
i thought nginx would use less ram than apache would

260029
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your current driver to the latest available versioning which in this case is from newly added ppa

260052
installation	upgrade
i have a win7 machine no uefi firmware with a wubi installation of 64-bit ubuntu 12.10 and am looking to simply upgrade from win7 to win8

260113
installation	upgrade
i have ubuntu 12.10 installation cd but when i run the setup using cd the upgrade option is disabled

260128
ubuntu	linux
my suggestion is to use edubuntu ltsp ubuntu + linux terminal server project + teacher tools for this

260132
kde	kubuntu
the kde 4.10 has been backported by the kubuntu developers

260143
kde	gnome
this approaches works for all applications compatible to the gnome or kde environment

260166
fastboot	adb
sudo ln -s android-sdk platform-tools fastboot usr local sbin adb

260171
kde	gnome
so there is no correspondence between running a qml application in the desktop environment in a similar way to how you could run a kde qt app in a gnome environment

260171

it is also probable that this only happens because you are using libreoffice from the document foundation built for any debian system and not for ubuntu specifically and thus having any ubuntu-specific patches

261563

that should create the folder mendeley which is owned by your current user which you can use any subdirectories or files in that directory will be owned by that user but should remain unencrypted

on a final note your specs are more than enough to run ubuntu with unity gnome-shell or kde also kde is on par with unity as far as resource usage so it s not surprising that going to kubuntu didn t change anything but if you want something lighter weight then you might want to try lxde lubuntu or openbox

lvm	btrfs
but you probably expect subvolumes to work like logical volumes with lvm but with btrfs we don t have an alike scenario as we don t have quota extension with this kernel

263629
filesystems	btrfs
otherwise you have to use btrfs filesystems as volumes and not subvolumes

263629

btrfs filesystems can be shrinked on-line and extended on-line and therefore quota is not necessary

in general mixing debian and ubuntu is not a good idea because there are some slight differences

264766
ubuntu	debian
keep in mind the ubuntu releases are not a branch of the current debian stable

264766
ubuntu	debian
normally the packages are synchronized with debian unstable some time before the ubuntu release is finished

264766
ubuntu	debian
mixing debian and ubuntu repositories will likely render your system unmaintainable

264766

with the following command you can fetch a debian source and try to compile it for ubuntu

264766

as above with switching debian with ubuntu and vice versa

264766
pbuilder	launchpad
instead of using a launchpad ppa you have to grab the sources manually from ubuntu and try to compile them with pbuilder yourself

264766

likely it will fail if you using debian squeeze because ubuntu quantal is as written above a fork from debian unstable

firefox safari and google-chrome are some of the applications that stores various data such as url history in an sqlite database

267309
kerberos	ldap
if your point is accessing with the same passwords they use on clients then you either need to set same passwords on clients and server or you need a centralized authentication mechanism based on ldap kerberos etc

ubuntu	debian
example2 compile a simple jogl application using jars provided by the debian ubuntu libjogl2-java package

267336
ubuntu	debian
while the otrs debian package is pretty well maintained the ubuntu package which is derived from the debian package is broken and no-one really seems to care about it

267336
ubuntu	debian
so if you want to install otrs from a package manager choose debian or if you want to install otrs on ubuntu please look at this procedure

267359
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
.rpm files redhat package manager are for redhat based linux versions like fedora and centos

267359
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu is a debian based version of linux so you will want the .deb file

267360
ubuntu	mint
is there a setting or theme or something in mint or ubuntu

267398
sudo	passwd
sudo add-apt-repository ppa rgibert ebook this will ask you for your passwd

267412
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
they work well with kde and xfce but gnome is slow as 3d effects are emulated via llvmpipe

267434
width	height
in x server setting in advanced options i can set up 1440x900 but then top and left bars are not on 100 width top bar and height left bar

267461
ubuntu	linux
or does repair ubuntu and linux distributions only

267509
kde	gnome
it can be used as a nautilus script or as a regular application working under gnome or kde desktop environments.

267531
pulseaudio	mixer
i ve tried installing pulseaudio alsa mixer made sure auto mute was disabled and played around with all of the settings to no avail

267537
google-chrome	firefox
can be used through firefox chromium or google-chrome or any other browser found in ubuntu that supports flash player

267549
ubuntu	linux
so some of the great things that ubuntu has brought to the linux community or enhanced are

267557
readonly	temporary
is there a way to make nautilus temporary mount it as readonly

267570
xfce	gnome
your user session whether it is gnome or xfce will usually auto-load xscreensaver with the options as it does in xfce for example using the file etc xdg xfce4 xinitrc

267570
daemons	launchd
this command launchd the xscreensaver daemons process with the verbose option so that it reports on exactly what it does which is then saved in the specified log

267604
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade an xorg driver without directly upgrading xorg itself there s a chance that reverting to the old driver via apt-get install will not automatically pull in the versioning of xorg that it s compatible with--it should but apt doesn t always do what it should

267604
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
don t bother with uninstalling the upgrade xorg replacement though just enter the command apt-get install xserver-xorg-core to revert back and uninstall the newer versioning automatically

267604
dpkg	apt
it s a pain to be stuck without a mouse at the console when you ve got a lot of copying and pasting to do so prepare yourself with some gpm for mouse support and some other tools links links2 or w3m web browsers vim text editor dpkg apt less vim style keys and searching like man and grep

267604
vim	emacs
you can type things up in emacs vim or pico nano or check your email in mutt or pine but eventually you ll want to come back to the 21st century

ffmpeg	libav
looks to me like libav is thought to become a successor of ffmpeg

267708
disk	ram
temporary hard disk in ram memory

267732
sudoers	visudo
sudo is configure in the sudoers file which you should only edit through the visudo command

267746
versioning	upgrade
i had some issues with imagemagick and i was told ubuntu s default imagemagick package is an ancient versioning and i should upgrade to resolve my issues

267746
versioning	upgrade
it would be probably the best to upgrade to the last stable versioning of im 6.8 but that is probably sci-fi as it is not even in debian

267751
ubuntu	debian
also it needs to be run on latest ubuntu or debian

267763
min	max
rtt min avg max mdev 2.993 3.051 3.109 0.058 ms

267766
jobs	cron
by using cron jobs we can get this

267780
sudo	passwd
note that this will change the default behaviour for all sudo users so if your user administrator needs to use sudo to have root privilege you would better know the root passwd

267807
tunnel	vpn
you ll probably need to poke that around i m not sure what your vpn tunnel device is named refer to ifconfig -a

267815
versioning	upgrade
i ve tried to upgrade to the latest versioning of ubuntu which is 12.10 to see if things may change

whenever the hdmi output is active acer screen configured on in display settings my wireless keyboard and mouse are very unresponsive - characters dropped while typing and mouse super slow

267888
versioning	upgrade
you re trying to upgrade from an lts versioning to a versioning beyond the next lts versioning

267888
versioning	upgrade
you have to upgrade to 12.04 the next lts versioning and then upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10

267904
ubuntu	linux
then boot a linux emergency system in efi mode and use efibootmgr to remove the ubuntu entry

267906
ubuntu	linux
you ll also have an entry with an ubuntu icon that will boot grub and one or more linux penguin icons that will launch ubuntu directly

267908
mouse	keyboard
apparently despite using 2 usb ports the hub wasn t able to provide enough power to the drive while allowing me to operate my mouse and keyboard

sudo passwd for asd

268073
kde	kubuntu
i have some very strange behavior of the kde clock in latest kubuntu with kde 4.10 backports

268079
filesystems	fat
if the harddisk was not empty and fat as a filesystems was used there might be the problem that big files have to get split up amoung different locations this usually slows down

268098
ubuntu	debian
using ubuntu to host apache the vhost definition in case of debian based systems the definiton of websites is done on

268101

i d like to switching between them as i do on a single screens set up but leave my ide visible regardless of what desktop i m looking at

268140
versioning	upgrade
it is better for you to upgrade your ubuntu versioning

268147
ubuntu	linux
there are 2 main sorts of executables in ubuntu and linux unix generally speaking the binary compiled ones real executable programs non human-readable and scripts text files that begin with #

268150
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
on partitions like ntfs and fat there are not so many rights like in linux unix filesystems

268191
cifs	smb
the smb means that you want to connect to the server using the server message block protocol also sometimes called cifs which is the default network protocol on windows hence the easy but on ubuntu you need to actually specify the protocol

268199
filesystems	fat
format using fat filesystems instead

268209
xfce	gnome
there must be something similar setting with other windows managers like unity xfce gnome .

268222
filesystems	ntfs
just using ntfs filesystems

268242
folder	directory
indeed there does seem to be a resources.sh in the magicseteditor folder that can be used to install the data but it does not install the data directory so i should use the commands above which will install everything you need instead.

268272
ubuntu	debian
my laptop is an ubuntu 12.10 and my board is a debian 6

268276
ssd	sata
so my configuration is such that my windows 7 is installed on a msata ssd drive and i am trying to install ubuntu on my regular sata hdd

268283
rsa	dsa
i made new rsa and dsa keys on the board and it went ok

268287
ssd	sata
for safety sake i say tell your bios to boot the sata hdd first you will then need to configure grub to offer the option to boot the ssd

268321
ubuntu	debian
i do not know lubuntu but it is based on ubuntu which is based on debian so a debian solution should work

268333
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
the upgrade will uninstall the previous versioning but apt can be a bit obstinate about doing this

268334
sudo	passwd
you can perform changes as root by prefixing a command with sudo and entering your passwd

268335
ssd	sata
my installation scenario is very similar to yours win7 on ssd and ubuntu 12.10 on an internal sata drive

268336
ubuntu	linux
edit you can also do the partitioning from within windows disk management shrink the windows ntfs partition and make the linux partitions leaving them unformatted and with no assigned letters then in the ubuntu installer just assign them their respective mount points type and format

268374
ethernet	wireless
i am not able to run an ethernet wire from my router to my room at the moment so i have to find out a way to connect to the internet with the wireless adapter

i offered to install ubuntu on my uncles computer because windows is failing the computer has the specs of a intel 2 quad processor 15 gigs of ram and 1 terabyte of hdd i loaded the os through flashdrive and hit install after a few seconds it was installing and then shortly after it said that the installation has a bug and or is corrupted then says the computer might have a faulty hard drive or disk drive then i went to see if i could just install the os through the wubi.exe and i couldnt because linux erased the whole harddrive i dont have windows anymore and it wont install linux is there any possible way around this

268459
screens	tablet
those are just to match the input layer of the tablet to the screens orientation

268493
cinnamon	gnome
i have tried different options like cinnamon gnome unity but changing desktop env doesn t affect

ubuntu	mint
i installed mint 14 and then ubuntu 12.10 and couldn t get it to work

in firefox or google-chrome i simply import the .p12-file containing my certificate in pkcs 12 format in the tab your certificates and this works like it should

268640
ati	nvidia
yes it will boot the only thing you need to be careful about it installing proprietary drivers so if you have the nvidia drivers installed on the usb key and you boot it on a machine with ati graphics that likely won t work

268643
post	get
is there some command i need to execute to get further information and post here

268658

when i use firefox network setting it work well but when i try apply the socks proxy system wide from ubuntu setting and tunnel google-chrome traffic it just don t work

i ve tried adding themes by adding creating a .themes folder in my home directory and moving the extracted theme files there as well as moving the new themes to usr share themes folder as well

269028
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
another example is that the main parts of the linux kernel still stand under gplv2 and thus gnu debian does not use non free vendor drivers as much as ubuntu does

269029
dpkg	apt
if an apt operation such as a release upgrade was cancelled usually sudo dpkg --configure -a will configure the unconfigured packages if there are any

269041
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and ubuntu

269053
folder	directory
the issue can be resolved by deleting the .npm and .node-gyp directory from the home folder and then reinstalling nodejs again

269064
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade my current os to the required versioning

269073
udp	tcp
system services such as cups for printing udp tcp port 631 open a port for listening

269073
udp	tcp
other examples include a http server tcp port 80 a dns server udp port 53 and smtp mail server tcp port 25

269073
udp	tcp
the sudo netstat -tulpn command can be used to show listening tcp udp programs

269073
udp	tcp
these are the dns cache service dnsmasq udp port 53 and the printer service cups tcp 631

269073
udp	tcp
these ports are typically static http runs on tcp port 80 dns on udp port 53

now you can use push and pull easily

269141

i was messing around with cinnamon and gnome and trying new things out and i got carried away

269234

the entire filesystem from the legit partition seems to be intact and the boot directory had only a grub folder in it and a memtest file

269236
ubuntu	linux
i installed amd catalyst drivers for ubuntu 12.04.2 but i didn t see that it didn t support linux 3.5 kernel for ati 4xxx series now i want to remove what i installed and go back to the old default drivers for ubuntu 12.04.2

269254
sudo	passwd
you either have to use sudo or configure a passwd for the root user

269269
ubuntu	linux
in short as compared to the historical method on windows or mac where you go to various websites download the piece of software you want and install it most linux distributions ubuntu included rely on a repository

269332
geany	gedit
gedit seems quite slim without plugins so i have installed geany which seems more powerful but i can t find such a plugin

269366
notepad++	gedit	geany	gedit	geany	notepad++
geany is to gedit on ubuntu as notepad++ is to notepad on windows

269443
google-chrome	firefox
so now it is impossible for me to have firefox expanded in left and google-chrome at right screen or other way around

269473
google-chrome	firefox	ubuntu	linux
canonical founder mark shuttleworth is a big fan of google-chrome and says the browser could replace the standard firefox in future versions of ubuntu linux

269473
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome probably won t replace firefox in 12.04 due out in april 2012 either because that will be the long-term support version making it an unlikely candidate for major changes

269476
google-chrome	firefox
as for why firefox i would say that the ethics of firefox as a open source web browser match more with ubuntu than that of the google sponsored google-chrome or it s open sourced experimental arm with chromium

269482
sudo	passwd
using sudo before command renice elevates user to root level and an admin root passwd will be required

269534
post	get
i will be getting a mac g4 laptop will post the exact specs when i get it and i was wondering if it would be safe to install ubuntu alongside osx probably tiger and would the hardware graphics sound hdd size be enough

269551
versioning	upgrade
this shows that the installed versioning is 1.1.3-1 bpo60+1 and candidate is 1.2.0 rc3-1 bpo60+1 which will get installed on next apt-get upgrade

269551
ubuntu	debian
imagine you want to download debian package for knot dns from it s official ppa for ubuntu precise on amd64 architecture

269551
ubuntu	debian
of course you ll need to verify the key in some other means like the debian ubuntu maintainers key checking it from launchpad etc etc...

269568
ubuntu	linux
i have also tried opening it with the grub menu option ubuntu with linux 3.5.0-25 generic recovery mode and 3.5.0-17 generic recovery mode

269587
switching	screens
this included starting libreoffice in fedora 17 loading the applications screens scrolling down the applications screens and even when switching a wallpaper and it took more than 15 seconds just for mozilla firefox to start up so i eventually switched back to windows xp in frustration with disappointment at the speed of fedora 17

269591
sudo	passwd
in fact i m pretty sure this is the problem as changing the lines in etc fstab to username patrickdickey passwd mypassword works fine with sudo mount -a

any folder outside of ubuntu one within your home directory that you choose to synchronize with the service will be synchronized fully on any of your machines where it is subscribed

269996
filesystems	ntfs
create a filesystems fat32 or ntfs and it should work again

270100
ubuntu	debian
unfortunatelly the official ubuntu packages are not yet up-to-date so last version is 1.4.x because they follow official debian packages and we were not fast enough to get ror 3.2 before debian has been frozen well it s our own free time and limited resources

270964
ubuntu	linux
it s entirely possible that you re running into a hardware problem hardware that lacks a linux driver in which case your only hope for installing linux is to dig up a new driver and patch the installer with it or to wait until such a driver makes it into a future version of ubuntu or some other distribution

270967
x86	64bit
i know that s confusing but it s the naming convention for efi -- ia32 for 32-bit x86 and x64 for 64bit x86-64 amd64.

that being said there are other ways to install ruby 2.0 if you need such as installing from source rvm or ruby-build with or without rbenv or chruby

271138
ubuntu	debian
the usual release process of ubuntu is to wait for packages to appear in debian first and import them from there

271138

the sooner the ruby2.0 appears in debian the sooner it will be in next ubuntu but it won t be backported automatically to already released versions of ubuntu

271146

in ubuntu 12.04 and centos 5 + 6 it s possible to use the signal name like sigterm but on 12.10 one has to use -term instead

sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo
the second passwd can easily be removed by editing the sudoers file with visudo and setting the sudouser as nopasswd

271775
sudo	passwd
setting that to one side in terms of giving you what you asked for allowing the sudo user to run certain commands without being prompted for a passwd is the most sensible route

versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
fast reads of ubuntudesktop upgrading leads to idea that if your current installation has not versioning 10.04 lts then first you should upgrade to versioning 11.10 and next to 12.04 lts

whichever mode it ends up in the mouse cursor still responds to mouse movements but the mouse buttons do nothing and the keyboard does not respond

272095

if you get the error you must put some source uris in your sources.list then make sure that your etc apt sources.list has deb-src entries which match your deb entries

it s hard to believe there is no such software in ubuntu or linux in general

272272
ubuntu	debian
i don t see the shell that upstart uses by default in script stanzas documented anywhere but it s reasonable to assume that it uses bin sh which is not bash on debian ubuntu systems

272292
folder	directory
extract here will create a new folder called archive and put foo its contents and bar.xml within the archive folder whereas running the tar command you posted would put those files in the current directory

272298
filesystems	ntfs
still odd disk utility does show win7 partition and shows that it is ntfs and has a bootable flag but under usage where other partitions say filesystems it shows only a - no label or unknown on the graphical representation of the disk and no possibility to mount

272310

the installer from the minimal cd is simple enough to not explain but i ve had trouble with wireless donogles when installing the installer needs to retrieve packages from the ubuntu servers so i would use an ethernet cable if available during the installation process

i ve got a little less severe display problem using open source drivers for amd radeon 7400m series under ubuntu 12.10 when i recently upgrade kernel from 3.5.0-26 to 3.5.0-27 which i could luckily solve by simply selecting the previous versioning from the grub menu and then removing the latest kernel packages

if you use a previous version of ubuntu or if you have several installations of gnu linux in efi mode it is safer to create a new efi partition efi

272438
bluetooth	usb
there used to be an app called synaptic the mouse app not package manager that was supposed to be able to do that but i couldn t find it in the software center anymore other suggestion is installing cuttlefish it can detect when a bluetooth or usb device is plugged and fire an action in response maybe you can work something out with that

272458
ubuntu	linux
the reason why malware cannot hide when on linux ubuntu because windows and linux are different

272516
bionic	libc
the bionic libc is a derivation of the bsd standard c library code that was originally developed by google for the android embedded operating system

272516
bionic	libc
this is why there are implementations such as the bsd s i ll call it the bsd libc for convenience gnu s which by the way is included by default in ubuntu under the name of libc or in this case bionic

272516
bionic	libc
but as wikipedia said bionic is based off of the bsd libc so it s not an original implementation

272516
bionic	libc
now about the actual implementation i m not sure what s the difference between bionic and the bsd libc but i would think it has something to do with compatability of their devices or something along the likes of that since one of the reasons why the c standard library is just a specification is that how the functions work differ from os to os

next	except
so if you have 12.04 and 12.10 the cache will keep the files for each distro and will not share the .debs except in the rare cases where a .deb goes from one release to the next without being changed

mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick	joystick	keyboard
it may be that the thing you re using works a bit differently as it seems to include devices for keyboard mouse and joystick input and thus may need drivers that aren t written or available for ubuntu

274279
google-chrome	firefox
add google-chrome or firefox with sync and the programs you need ndash

274279
google-chrome	firefox
most deb files work on it vlc google-chrome firefox nero 4 deluge transmission.

274296
redhat	fedora	centos	linux	cinnamon	gnome	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos
not a really bad laptop but the only distro i could install is fedora 18 in troubleshooting mode which is bad because i don t like fedora redhat centos etc since i m not really a linux power user and i hate gnome 3 also although i know i can switch to cinnamon or mate but thats not really a solution for me because i have always been an ubuntu guy since 7.04

274296
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i use linux mint at work and in my desktop running ubuntu on a small netbook never had a problem installing or booting any linux distro once in my life except for this

274296
ubuntu	mint
tried mint 14 cinnamon from a live usb normal booting didn t work troubleshooting mode just kept telling me about a timeout in modprobe like in ubuntu

274296
ubuntu	mint
tried mint 14 mate from a live usb normal booting worked troubleshooting mode just kept telling me about a timeout in modprobe again like in ubuntu

274296
hash	md5
by the way i checked the md5 hash of my iso files and i doubt my usb key is the problem

274297
stdout	stderr
my understanding is that detaches the process from the terminal and redirects input output with the default blank being stdout and 2 being stderr

274325
folder	directory
3 open a file manager like nautilus or whatever and paste the libflashplayer.so into if there is no directory called plugins in your hidden .mozilla folder then just create it with right-klick-new and name it plugins in your home-directory

274344
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r user user home

274366
folder	directory
in case you ran the command recursively as sudo chmod -r o+x home you have allowed every user who is not the owner and not a member of the group the file folder belongs to to open all directory under home

274414
bluetooth	usb
i have tried the usb cable but it didn t show up on the screen and i have tried to connect it via bluetooth but it also didn t work

274437
jobs	cron
to list all cron jobs from all users in your system

274470
bash	subshell
you can read more about subshell here subshell at tldp advanced bash scripting guide

274492
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu packages are automatically stripped

274492
ubuntu	debian
you can check the flags used to compiled ubuntu package by downloading the source apt-get source mysql-5.5 and checking the contents of . debian rules inside unpacked source package

274508
nautilus	fstab
following the instructions and rebooting i get to see the disk in the tree on the left of the nautilus window but it does not mount it although it has its very own line in etc fstab

274521
hash	md5
on mirrors the contents md5 hash of files etc of the repository are signed with the ubuntu key so even if you re pulling the official files from a non-official mirror you can be fairly certain that they are the original files

274549
ubuntu	linux
so i wanted to go back to linux ubuntu after been using windows for a while and went ahead and installed ubuntu

274562
versioning	upgrade
so instead of apt-get upgrade run apt-get dist-upgrade to update the kernel metapackage and install the latest kernel versioning

274563
rhel	suse
lenovo thinkserver rd 330 supports only suse rhel and windows oss and unofficially supports nix distros based on the former like centos 6

274589
ethernet	wireless
wired connections work over a wireless ethernet bridge in my experience

274600
folder	directory
i prefer to use a dev folder located in my home directory

274606
ubuntu	debian
generally if a perl library is named foo bar on cpan the debian ubuntu package will be named libfoo-bar-perl

274628
hash	md5
by unreliable i mean that every time i finish downloading the iso and compare the md5 hash i end up with an error about a mismatch

274653
vmware	virtualbox
i gave up trying to get virtualbox to work so i installed vmware

274653
vmware	virtualbox
so it worked out the fix for virtualbox was to install vmware

274658
folder	dir
once you re in the folder that has the file--running ls or dir should show you everything in there and running or should show you just files that end in .iso which includes ubuntu installation images--then run

275661
folder	directory
when i downloaded the adt bundle from google it came with programs that just ran without needing to be installed i can run eclipse just by clicking on the eclipse file after i extracted the archived folder to the home adt bundle directory

275661
folder	directory
used sudo nautilus to move the folder containing the programs to the usr local directory returned it to the home directory when this didn t work

275661
folder	directory
the dash will not find the folder adt bundle located in the home directory or any file folder contained within

275750
mouse	keyboard
after last system update week ago i noticed that my mouse and keyboard freezes after boot-up in the lightdm login screen for 1-2 minutes so i can t move pointer or type my password

275750
mouse	keyboard
after these 1-2 minutes mouse and keyboard start working until next boot i didn t noticed freeze after logout to lightdm login screen

275750
mouse	keyboard
oh and i ve got wired keyboard and mouse not wireless

275755
ubuntu	linux
this is possible because both ubuntu and android share the same kernel linux

275832
ubuntu	linux
this is a very common problem among new users of ubuntu or linux for that matter

275839
ubuntu	debian
i read about ubuntu for phone and want to know if i can install ubuntu on an n900 because this one has debian i think

275883
folder	directory
one major difference between the two is the search-as-you-type behavior in classic versions of nautilus when you typed an input the file with the closest alphabetical match would become the selected one the eligible files folder being restricted to the current directory

275886
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
for the google-chrome firefox opera and seamonkey browsers the following code maximizes only the browser window proper and not internal windows

275898
ubuntu	linux
if i try to update my 12.04 lts for linux ubuntu i get this message

275920
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i booted up ubuntu 12.10 today and when trying to sudo i entered my passwd as usual but it had said i m not a sudoers

275929
versioning	upgrade
the admin group will too but only if it exists and unless you upgrade from a previous versioning or manually created it it does not

275929
versioning	upgrade
even if you did upgrade starting from a versioning earlier than 12.04 if the event that caused this problem was the inadvertent deletion of the admin group then an attempt to fix this by adding yourself to admin would also fail

275929
sudo	passwd
so try the other way lucid but run usermod -a -g sudo username instead of passwd username as before

275952
g++	gcc
sudo apt-get install python python-dev libatlas3-base-dev gcc gfortran g++

275962
kate	gedit
when you create a new file in kate or gedit they name them like untitled1 or unsaved document 1

275973
kate	gedit	vim	emacs	vim	gedit	vim	kate	emacs	gedit	emacs	kate
most text editors - vim emacs kate gedit - have colorizers so that depending on the language you re programming in it will color the text differently

276010
installation	upgrade
and that is not uncommon because it is a pain to write installation upgrade scripts for every operating system video driver combination and get them tested

276026
sudoers	passwd
after that is installed open it and type in your sudoers passwd

276032
ubuntu	linux
either way you ll want a swap on the hdd on the ssd will kill longevity as well as a dedicated linux data partition - ubuntu can read write ntfs but is generally not a good idea to take that for granted

276034
ethernet	wireless
and make sure if you re using wireless download the wireless driver not the ethernet driver

276072
ubuntu	debian
i tried to use qt5 but i have some problems while making debian packaging process with qt5 so i would like to have qt4 on ubuntu 12.10

276086
filesystems	ntfs
while this is relatively easy to ensure for the typical linux filesystems gparted brings the tools required to check and fix them with it on the live media it is not so easy for third-parts filesystems like ntfs for these filesystems you often need to boot the native operating system for these filesystems and perform some magic there

276086
filesystems	xfs
in addition to this even some of the linux filesystems can not be moved this way since there is no known way to shrink them jfs xfs reiser4 - and to enlarge them they need to be mounted and growing must be done on-line jfs xfs

276099
installation	upgrade
how do i skip this package so that it can proceed with the installation and upgrade of other packages which have been downloaded completely

276106
kde	kubuntu
kde kubuntu uses similar memory to unity and it s faster and much more powerful

276109
cinnamon	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	gnome
i have unity gnome 3 cinnamon xfce lxde kde4 installed and have no problems

276112
ubuntu	linux
can someone help me i m new to linux ubuntu

276117
postgresql	mysql
it works as with mysql so with postgresql sqlite and valentina db

276121
ubuntu	linux
i suspect the issue lies with linux s hacked together support for ntfs since microsoft won t provide the code for proper support but i can t check that until i ve finished recovering my 1tb of data to my numerous small hdds and other storages and then reformat the drive to see of the drive itself is bad or if it really was the fault of ubuntu

276138
versioning	upgrade
my question is whether it is better to install 12.10 for now and upgrade once 13.04 is fully released or install a pre-release versioning of 13.04 and just apply the updates once the full release comes out

276182
sudo	passwd
unless you ve very recently run a command with sudo in the shell you re already in you ll first be prompted to enter your passwd as an administrator who is able to run commands as root with sudo

276182
sudo	passwd
this requires no authentication except for the initial sudo authentication when you enter your passwd not username s passwd

276184
versioning	upgrade
after 13.04 is released an installed beta versioning will become the stable versioning simply by installing updates in the software updater or by running sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade and if any packages are held back sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

276184
versioning	upgrade
the actual operating system should barring corner cases where a bug prevents it simply upgrade seamlessly into the stable versioning once the stable versioning is released

276194
xfce	gnome
you may want to try the xfce desktop environment which is lighter-weight than gnome whether gnome with unity or gnome with gnome shell

276257
versioning	upgrade
i recently decided to reinstall my mythbuntu system as it had been upgrade in phases from versioning 10.x and was throwing up fairly frequent errors

276265
ubuntu	debian
so yes if you want people to be able to install the package either you need to get it included in debian ubuntu or you need to publish it in a repository

276265
ubuntu	debian
but sometimes it s fairly straightforward to produce once deb that will work on all current debian and ubuntu releases

276301
google-chrome	firefox
it obviously requires the flashplugin installed so a browser such as firefox or google-chrome are ideal

276355
ethernet	wireless
i haven t tried the alx ethernet driver because the wireless works good enough that i don t need to

276373
folder	directory
then change directory to the extracted folder

276472
ubuntu	linux
from a quick glance over them none of the programs in the link seem to natively support linux ubuntu

276478
mouse	keyboard
i have created a dvd to run ubuntu from but when i select boot ubuntu from cd on my win xp machine the mouse and keyboard do not work once ubuntu starts

276495
bluetooth	usb
start by dis-connecting the bluetooth usb s

276495
mouse	keyboard	bluetooth	usb
plug in a wired keyboard + mouse and then plug in the bluetooth usb s whatever you plug in to make it work

276496
mouse	keyboard
you should be able to control the acceleration settings of the mouse in the mouse keys tab of the keyboard preferences source

276496
mouse	keyboard
keynav makes your keyboard a fast mouse cursor mover

276496
mouse	keyboard
mouse can do with a keyboard

i m a user of ubuntu-one and i use it without any problem on windows and ubuntu but i cant find any rpm or source code to install or compile it on opensuse

276584

can i use ubuntu-one on other linux distros like opensuse

276590
ubuntu	linux
i have several windows mac and linux computers no servers and want to install ubuntu one on them to share and save information

276593

276646
versioning	upgrade
how to i get gnome 3.8 on ubuntu 12.04.2 lts because i want to try it and i don t want to upgrade to a non-lts versioning of ubuntu

276649
versioning	upgrade
all the fun showed up when i tried to upgrade the older versioning from the repo to the latest versioning - transmission 2.77 - by following the steps as mentioned on ubuntu help community wiki

276652
ubuntu	linux
in the past as in all things linux some people decided they wanted to make a different version of ubuntu

276652
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
you might also look at linux mint which is based off of ubuntu too

276652
cinnamon	kubuntu	cinnamon	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
right now it is based over a combination of cinnamon a fork similar to how kubuntu and lubuntu are forks of ubuntu of gnome 3 and mate which is what gnome 2 has changed to

276701
ubuntu	mint
currently i m using unity in mint 14 but doesn t feel much different from when i was using ubuntu 12.04 which means most of 12.04 feature is unity s feature right

276709
ubuntu	mint
in ubuntu unity is installed by default in mint cinnamon or mate

276720
installation	upgrade
is it possible to upgrade from a 32bit to a 64bit installation

276730
switching	screens
after installation the desktop was completely black and even when switching to a terminal ctrl+alt+f1 the screens was still black

276772
titlebar	window
i m wondering if it s possible to remove the titlebar of every window and instead add a coloured border a few pixels thick around the whole window and stil keep the ability to move the window around

276774
move	drag
even without window decorations you should still be able to move the windows around using alt + button1 mouse drag

276784
integer	unsigned
so a one is encoded like 2 32-1 + 1 would be for an unsigned integer

276784
int	double
now you have encoded the same number of int but the maximum for signed int is consequently only 2 32-1 as opposed to double that 2 32 -1 for unsigned int

276786
ubuntu	linux
you might need more if you re doing linux kernel development or planning on using suspend to disk. but if you are not a very experienced ubuntu linux user as long as you accepted the value suggested by the installer you should be ok

276788
mouse	keyboard
i was able to get the driver on to the machine by swapping out the mouse keyboard and usb stick from the two working usb 2.0 ports

276791
kde	kubuntu
however as a kubuntu application it comes with a long list of kde dependencies

276804
ubuntu	linux
i have a doubt that linux didn t correctly install my graphics card anyways when i go to software source additional driver i can find anything to install or has this happened because i choose a free version of ubuntu

276805
chown	sudo
ubuntu changed ownership of that to root and will not let me change it to me gksudo nautilus or sudo chown -r paul home paul

276812
folder	directory
as the answer from user146001 mentions in your home directory you enable show hidden files or press ctrl + h to see hidden files and find your .virtualbox folder

276815
cpu	irq
but the reason for high cpu usage was that the pci-network card and the video card used the same irq

276830
cpu	processors
i tried connecting my toshiba laptop with intelâ coreâ i3 cpu m 330 2.13ghz ã 4 processors to my tv using a hdmi connector

276858
folder	directory
the folder must be executable for the owner although the superuser would still be able to access the folder as when using sudo any file or directory can be accessed or deleted

276871
post	put
in the end of post i repeat 404 error appears only on indexcontroller actions root path if i put the same code in other controller using same model and implicit create a new folder test in scripts everytihing seems go well

276892
g++	gcc
i use gcc and g++ regularly but haven t yet had reason to use gfortran

276913
sudo	passwd
once you have installed this just launch the program you will need to enter your sudo passwd to use the program find the drive you want to rename unmount it click label followed by renaming your partition

276920
sudo	passwd
if you prepend sudo and enter your passwd at the following prompt you ll get root permission for this single command

i am using zorin an ubuntu-based distro and every time when i have some problem to solve i turn to the ubuntu or linux mint community in order to find the answer

276981
mouse	keyboard
the mouse has various macro keys which i would hazard a guess at being picked up as the keyboard component

276994
temp	tmp
create a large enough temp ext3 partition somewhere like a usb hard drive and copy over everything in home with sudo cp home tmp partition -r

276999
xfce	gnome
and you install lxde xfce gnome gnome3 gnome4 gnome5 unity 2010 elite edition wayland super mario version and any other desktop environment you can get your hands on for the 10.04 lts version

276999
xfce	gnome
if you install ubuntu 12.04 lts remove unity and install lxde gnome 3 xfce or any other you will still get updates for other parts of the system

276999
versioning	upgrade
the only thing you will not get is a versioning upgrade for them

277002
chown	chmod
i can chmod and chown the folders but how to set up so if bob drops a file into joe joe retains ownership of the file

277016
chown	sudo
if this has happened to many system files perhaps you ran a big sudo chown command with the -r flag at some point

277016
chown	mount
then after running that mount command run the above chown command again and see if it works

277023
ubuntu	linux
i was wondering if the any applications developed with livecode www.runrev.com for a desktop linux platform would be able to run natively on ubuntu mobile devices tablets

277024
disk	ram
in conclusion allowing processes to be swapped from ram to disk earlier than necessary often confers a performance benefit and lower latencies when a process allocates memory

277037
folder	directory
let us assume your source folder is in directory home blah and you want to move it to desktop

277061

this behavior is definitely a bug either on gcc or ld.so or whatever is using linux ubuntu to dynamically load libraries these days

i solve it by quitting firefox and google-chrome as well maybe it is causing problems too after all and then restarting pulseaudio

277555
postfix	dovecot
there are many tutorials to make postfix work with dovecot but i m afraid to install dovecot because when i run apt-get install dovecot-imapd it says that many psa- features will be removed

277568
versioning	upgrade
this causes ubuntu s package manager to automatically upgrade google chrome when a new versioning comes out

277568
versioning	upgrade
so no matter what method you used to disable it google chrome will typically be automatically upgrade if you then subsequently manually upgrade it by manually installing the .deb package for a newer versioning

277568
versioning	upgrade
therefore you may wish to reconsider if you really want to prevent google chrome from being automatically upgrade when a new versioning comes out

277572
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu refers to the redhat documentation in their wiki and according to this documentation and centos documentation .

277573

pressing the down key hide it and show a terminal

277590
ubuntu	debian
in debian and in ubuntu though it may sometimes fail and is unsupported changing all the repositories listed in etc apt sources.list to the repositories for the next release and running sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will attempt to upgrade to the next release

277590
versioning	upgrade
the reason you don t get new kernel versioning with sudo apt-get upgrade is because they each are provided by separate differently named packages

277590
versioning	upgrade
when a new kernel comes out for your ubuntu release your kernel metapackage is upgrade and the upgrade versioning fo that metapackage lists the new kernel as a dependency without preventing the old kernel from continuing to be installed

277599
switching	screens
also switching black and white seems like a nice option for e-paper e-ink screens

278047
apache	nginx
it is not possible to do what you want because nginx does not support dso dynamic shared object like apache does

278047
apache	nginx
with apache you can load external modules from .so files but in nginx you need to compiled the sbin nginx binary with all modules in it that s why you can t apt-get the module you need to do some compiling work yourself

278051
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
your ubuntu system uses kde kubuntu but you reported installing regular ubuntu first and then installing kde so you should still have gnome

278081
kde	gnome
appearently kubuntu-desktop has installed a gtk theme so that gnome gtk apps look consistent with kde qt ones

278086

if you start x manually startx or xinit you ll see the text in whatever vt you issued the command in - unless you redirect it to a file or dev null remember there are two streams here stdout and stderr

278180
installation	upgrade
the installer should see the existing ubuntu 12.10 and give you an option to upgrade from installation disk or some such thing do not remember the exact words

278180
installation	upgrade
if for some reason upgrade from installation disk does not work choose something else.

278204
ethernet	wireless
it can either extend wireless at painfully slow speeds or i can plug in an ethernet cable and run at 150mpbs

278230
filesystems	hfs
it s just a regular disk partition that you or somebody created and it looks like it has a corrupted hfs filesystems on it

278240
udp	tcp
the nat agent knows which of your computers to send incoming packets to only when a computer has already established an outgoing tcp connection to that address on that port or has poked through with some outgoing udp packets

278240
udp	tcp
for any incoming traffic that it cannot match to an existing outgoing tcp connection or recent udp communication the nat server normally discards it

278240
dmz	was
however this dmz server will effectively not benefit from any of the security of nat and must be hardened against incoming network attacks it should for example run its own firewall as if it was a server on the internet

hope this works for you too but still when you buy bluetooth hardware for use with your ubuntu or derivative system try and find something with explicit linux support preferably open drivers

281550
ati	nvidia
i mention this because other users also wonder if the xorg.conf is not used then how is the settings for ati or nvidia working

281550
ati	nvidia
now there are some cases like specific nvidia or ati models that need the xorg.conf to work correctly because of some variables they need that x detected incorrectly or are needed for the nvidia ati card to work

since the win7 theme requires you to run gnome you can either change the underlying ubuntu if it is a fresh install and you don t mind re-installing or you go and hunt for a kde based win7 theme

281630

it is not clear why you chose kubuntu when now it turns out you want gnome because for some reason you are keen on the win7 theme

ati	nvidia
if you want to know which one gives less problems comparing nvidia and amd only when installing upgrading changing options resolution refresh rate opengl features and setting it up in general the i would first go with nvidia then ati

281798
ati	nvidia
even though ati is more open to the open source environment nvidia with it s proprietary driver does a great job at lowering the amount of work a user needs to install one

281798
ati	nvidia
same applies for ati but nvidia from my experience has had and proven to offer a better way of handling installations configurations and has even done a great job at bug hunting

281805
vmware	virtualbox
as a last resort you can use qemu-img command to convert disk images from virtualbox vmware to a format more suited to qemu kvm this may not be needed i think qemu kvm can work with other image types like vdi or vmdk

as you said you upgrade from a previous installation

if this is the case editing etc fstab so that it refers to the esp by its correct filesystems uuid really just a serial number for fat should get things working

after making this repair the problem should go away with the caveat that very serious filesystems damage may require more drastic measures such as backing up the esp creating a fresh fat filesystems on the partition restoring the data and adjusting etc fstab to use the new uuid value

linux any variety but why not ubuntu

283144

lamp is not an alternative to ubuntu but a set of programs run together on ubuntu or other linux os

if then this means that there is no debian package or that the ubuntu team has forked a debian package to a newer version than the one found in the debian repositories

if this is present it means that ubuntu has taken the debian package and released it with some additional patches or bug fixes

i suggest to only use sudo form one terminal and not from several since you would have to type in your passwd in all of those terminals

you need to be careful to fix changes to the ownership and permissions of the files when they are edited as the root user.see the man pages for chmod and chown type man chmod or man chown

so it seems this warning simply indicates that the package index files are out of date because the update information includes security information that helps you know that the upgrades you are downloading are in fact upgrades and not horrible trojan horses that will turn your system into a spamming botnet zombie

when the vpn is turned off the tests on both programs shows that the port is open however when i connect the vpn the port appears closed on the tests and here is the catch deluge and transmission connects only trough tcp port and the 1194 port of the vpn is udp only

ubuntu	linux
since a linux os is found there you have a very good chance of having full support on ubuntu

284073
icmp	tcp	icmp	udp	udp	tcp
the only packets going directly through eth0 should be udp packets to the server at port 1149 every other packets tcp or udp or icmp are routed through tun0 where they are encapsulated by openvpn and then send via the 1149 udp packets through eth0 to the server

284073
icmp	tcp	icmp	udp	udp	tcp
at the server the encapsulation is reversed and the tcp udp or icmp packets are reassembled and send from there like they originate from a neighbouring network node incoming on a local interface eth0 tun0 tap0 and are routed accordingly

284073
udp	tcp
so you have to configure transmission or deluge to use any other port than 1149 - because this one is used by vpn - 16000 tcp and udp

284073
udp	tcp
these lines redirects all incoming tcp and udp connections to ports 16000-16010 on the server to the vpn interface with the ip address 10.0.0.5

whenever a new versioning of ubuntu appears you should do first a live session testing without install running from usb-stick to see if everything works and after everything is ok do a clean install.this upgrade thing i also had problems after upgrade from 12.04.1 to 12.10 from one versioning to another doesn t work well for everyone

287085

while this is not a solution to this particular problem i wasn t able to find one myself you can work around it by not using folder with custom icons but rather desktop files that are links to alternate locations a hidden folder in your home directory

ntfs on linux works a little different to most other filesystems drivers and so data to be written to an ntfs filesystems actually goes through the cpu

there will be no problem whatsoever in using the drive in ubuntu or any other linux distribution for that matter as it can easily see and mount ext4 filesystems as used by default in ubuntu

288217
ubuntu	debian
so you should consider packaging your software for debian sid the debian continuous development version and then once this is accepted ask for your package to be copied into ubuntu repositories this is called syncing see the ubuntu for debian developers page

288217

it also makes more sense to include your software in debian as your package will be synced to all other debian-derived distributions besides ubuntu

289832
ubuntu	debian
is there a difference between ubuntu and debian with regard to command line and terminal use

289837
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a debian derivative and i haven t come across situations where a command exists both in debian and ubuntu but their accepted syntax is different

289844
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu vs debian

289844
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
as you can read in the link above ubuntu and debian are both based on linux and both use the apt package management system

289858
ubuntu	linux
i am completely new to ubuntu and linux so am i doing the best i can to learn as quickly i am able but it would really be helpful if i could chat with someone as the machine i have apparently is a bit of a pain in general hp dc7700sf

289876
ubuntu	debian
you will of course find for example aptitude installed in debian but not even ubuntu

289876
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linux	debian	mint
with this in mind most of the stuff related to the terminal you learn in ubuntu kubuntu lubuntu xubuntu linux mint or any other debian derivative distro will be the same

ssd	sata
currently i run 12.10 on a sata drive but want to do a clean install on the ssd and run that as the main os drive+apps

289977
ubuntu	debian
now i am totally devastated because similar thing happened 6months before when i had fedora 17 in my external hd instead of xubuntu after it was used under ubuntu the same happened...i didn t reported it because i already had planned towards debian instead of rpm

289977
ubuntu	linux
the mystery is that as long as i don t attach this external hd under ubuntu the data never corrupts whereas under win xp 7 i can use it as a normal usb storage of coarse linux partitions arenâ t available under win platforms.

289980
disk	ram
i have a msi fx-600 laptop with core-i3 330m 4 gb ram 500 gb hard disk

or more safely open the ubuntu software center then search for linux kernel image

chown	sudo
sudo chown user group newfolder

installation	downgrade
it is possible to install the linux-virtual package after installation but this will involve a downgrade from 3.5.0 to 3.2.0

290136
width	height
to change this to any custom resolution just replace 1600 with the width you want and 900 with the height you want

290147
versioning	upgrade
i had a similar issue upon upgrade as well recently - might not be the exact same as yours i have a hp laptop with a realtek wireless but i found that using an older kernel versioning fixed it for now.

i used to use linux in 2006 but haven t used it since so i am new to ubuntu in its current iteration

290391

to change this to any custom resolution just replace 1600 with the width you want and 900 with the height you want

290392
ubuntu	mint
i am only 14 and beginning on ubuntu after a disastrous trial on mint 13 so i would enjoy some very clear instructions and answers

290423
ubuntu	linux
the same .pdf files open perfectly fine on both libreoffice for windows and libreoffice for mac yes i have three computers with all three oses but on ubuntu 12.10 all pages are blank so i can only conclude this is an issue with ubuntu packaging or something really weird prevents it from working under linux

290427

there are few audio applications which do not make use of more basic audio application inherent to all linux distributions including ubuntu

all the music in my music folder is in alac but i keep the original flac files in a separate directory for the day my ipod dies and i can completely go with flac

290544
ubuntu	linux
you should follow some boot sector aspects like dual boot manager and priority priority will be like this 1.win8 then win 7 after that ubuntu or unix or linux

290549
sudo	passwd
type command sudo update-grub and then type your passwd which will not be shown while typing

290554
kde	kubuntu
or kde kubuntu

290559
ubuntu	linux
probably there s a bug in linux ubuntu setup files and this should be reported if it hasn t been done already

290563

i have a windows 7 op on the pc as well so with that i could erase the linux partition then i restarted the ubuntu installation and it worked

290576

if definitely by chance i get things done and found the solution i ll post it

290582
ubuntu	linux
i tried to create shorcuts in linux ubuntu but my terminal shows this message everytime

290586

the best solution would be use visudo this tool was made for that and will avoid the exposition of root passwd i suggest you to dig what are going wrong with that

290602

script scales to appropriate width height for the terminal you are in

290612

i recently upgraded to the 3.9 linux kernel on ubuntu 13.04 and lost all sound at first and then miraculously brought back sound to the speakers after playing a bit with alsamixer but still no sound when plugging headphones

i need to access the bios so i can use my external dvd drive for the ubuntu or other linux cds dvd but somehow it did not work

290630
ubuntu	linux
i changed my operating system from windows to linux ubuntu 13.04

290661
filesystems	ntfs
in the long term converting the ntfs partition to use a linux filesystems is the best solution but you can t do this until you repair the ntfs volume or at least coax linux into mounting it

290661
filesystems	ntfs
converting the partition to use a linux filesystems will require backing up the files to another medium unmounting the ntfs partition creating a new linux filesystems on the now-ntfs volume re-mounting that partition and copying the files back

290670
ubuntu	linux
my intention all along has been to remove windows 8 completely and install ubuntu but now that my laptop has arrived and i ve started to look in to the process more deeply i see that there are a lot of problems with this range of laptops firmware particularly with respect to linux is it safe to install ubuntu 64 bit 12.10 in efi mode on samsung series 7 windows 8 laptop

290673
ethernet	wireless
what i do when i get a new laptop and install dropbox is plug it into an ethernet cable and let it sync i have about 65gb to sync. so i don t saturate my wireless connection

290698
ubuntu	linux
i have installed ubuntu 13.04 with linux kernel 3.8 which has ntfs-3g package but again asks to install it when tried the terminal does not respond

i would like to use as gateway laptop 2 and his vpn tunnel for device 3

290765
ethernet	wireless
surprisingly my ethernet upload speed is about 4 times slower than the same test done on my windows 7 and wireless on ubuntu

290765
ethernet	wireless
when i take it off the ethernet in ubuntu and use the wireless wireless has a perfect speedtest

290782
folder	directory
if you re not wanting to keep the directory structure and just want to move all the files into one folder you can do something like this

290793
chown	sudo
i ran eclipse with sudo updated and installed everything i needed then ran sudo chown -r username username . workspacedirectory

290794
cpu	processors
you can not run 64 bit os on a 32 bit processors so if you are successfully running it then your cpu must be 64 bit

290797
ati	nvidia
i just installed an ati graphics radeon hd 5850 to my desktop swapping my nvidia gts250

290797

unless the mouse keyboard do anything it will not stay on

290913

i run windows and other linux distros really fast so why does ubuntu lag

290918

i transfered from ubuntu 13.04 to linux mint 14

290918
folder	directory
i keep mine in directory in my home folder and then link to that from var www with a symlinked directory called websites

290918
folder	directory
from the directory where you have stored all the files from the old computer as described above run the following command to move your apache2 directory into your etc folder

290918
folder	directory
however for me running chmod +x on the directory that contains the folder that contains all the html files did the trick

290918
folder	directory
in my case i stored some of my apache log files in a custom folder called apache_logs in my home directory

290922
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
if ubuntu is still slow you might want to change your desktop environment to something like lxde xfce kde or gnome though gnome under ubuntu can be slower than unity partly due to the excessive patching made by canonical

290924
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard doesn t work and i cant use the mouse to click everything then crashes nothing loads

290936
sudo	passwd
i ve been trying to grant www-data to use sudo service apache2 restart without a passwd but no matter what i try nothing works

290936
sudo	passwd
from what i gather anyone in www-data should now be able to run sudo service apache2 restart and not require a passwd

290938
folder	directory
but you can place them wherever you want to keep your directory structure organised and optionally add those folder to path aswell

290967
disk	ram
first step is to create your virtual machine setting up its ram hard disk size etc

290968
ubuntu	linux
the problem is that grub linux bootloader that usually would provide the menu at boot where you can chose which os you want to start is installed on the second hd where ubuntu is and if you boot to grub that is use the hd where ubuntu is as the first boot drive and chose windows then it won t start

290971

there seem to be some hdmi pcie video capture cards around but only some of them are stated to support linux and those are often stated to not support video4linux

290971

synaptic is a graphical interface for aptitude the package manager in ubuntu linux

291026

291072

i think probably the best linux way to create a multi-os live usb memory stick if i understood you correctly including different ubuntu flavors as well as other live operating systems parted magic including clonezilla for backup recovery and other maintenance purposes is

291086
srt	subtitle
subtitle are srt format

291103
folder	directory
there is truly no such file there because i have already removed the module directory from my project folder but it was there before

291109
ubuntu	linux
i have installed dnscrypt on ubuntu linux 10.04.1 x86_64 and it worked

291184
mouse	keyboard
that s the work-around i had to follow with my beagleboard as the pre-installed 12.04 image booted great but then accepted no keyboard or mouse input from me

291193
ubuntu	linux
so i did get back to linux and i did chose ubuntu 13.04

291202
ubuntu	debian
it also has the following features for debian and ubuntu only

291206
ubuntu	linux
i want windows 8 64bit system-builders and ubuntu linux 13.04 on different partitions on the same drive in my new self-built machine

291209
ubuntu	mint
i use a dual boot on one of my machines mint 14.1 and ubuntu 13.04

291255
chown	sudo
sudo chown root root -r etc

291270
ubuntu	linux
also i think it would require the linux kernel you are booting to support usb3 for it to get the extra speed so don t expect ubuntu 10.04 to boot faster with it

291275
disk	ram
dev sda5 swap space as big as your ram maximum 4 g you probably don t need it but it makes suspend to disk possible

291297
disk	ram
most notable liveusb stores the root file system in ram where an installed instance the root partition would be on disk

291301
post	get
if not post another question for better understanding for people who refer later and you will get a guide easily

291306
installation	upgrade
however after last upgrade the installation broke and i cannot even login in the text mode any more

291306
switching	screens
after the restart it would get stuck on the loading screens purple with dots and wouldnâ t go past that to login screens no hdd activity ctrl + alt + function keys that would switching between consoles just show blinking cursor

291358
lan	intranet
in my company we configured intranet local dns server so that when you enter domain1.com it goes directly into defined lan ip adress

291369
switching	screens
somehow the lock command was switching on the screens back

291398
installation	upgrade
boot your system from cd or bootable usb and when you get to the installation screen choose upgrade 13.04 with 13.04 if available if not choose something else

291423
chown	chmod
and run those chown chmod again

291440
switching	screens
my screens is connected via dvi cable and when i use keyboard to switching apps or use search option both screens act strange

291497
put	get
but when you get to the bit where you enter passwd put your user name in front of the command

291500
ubuntu	linux
do i need a usb external hard drive which will be compatible with ubuntu - linux

291503
ubuntu	debian
i would love to know if i can replace win7 with ubuntu or debian and still have the same result

291536
ubuntu	linux
i am new to both linux and ubuntu never used it before

291574
libjpeg	libtiff
the executables only link in standard opengl libtiff libjpeg etc. linux libraries and link openglut statically which may cause failures on some systems

291574
redhat	fedora
they should run on redhat 9 and fedora 3 systems just fine and hopefully other similar distributions as well

291654
vmware	virtualbox
you can use virtualbox which is free or vmware which is also free

291663
redhat	fedora
they are only offering fedora redhat drivers and tar.gx binaries

291678
xfce	gnome
i recently installed xubuntu and there were a lot of differences i noticed between xfce and gnome

291711
ubuntu	linux
my next question is i know i can use ubuntu along side windows os but can i run ubuntu along side fedora linux with ubuntu as a dual operating system instead of windows as a dual os system

291715
kde	gnome
depending on your hardware some people find the kde versions faster then the gnome versions see this weeks review on distrowatch

291741
filesystems	fat
the only caveat is that for it to work it must be at the root of a fat filesystems that is the filesystems has to be loaded with the vfat driver

291790
versioning	upgrade
its time consuming but its the best way to upgrade lot of things change between versioning and overwriting with new sistem files may result in a mess

291813
put	get
it was running on lucid lynx i tried to update from the terminal with some copy and pasted sudo get upgrade i m not sure what exactly i put in the terminal but it looked like it was doing its thing then it got hung up somewhere and i mistakenly tried to resart

291827
sudo	passwd
most unixes use a tool called sudo to give users the ability to do this without having to give them the root passwd

291850
put	get
i backed up my home directory with deja-dup installed ubuntu 13.04 and attempted to restore the files but after chosing the date of the backup to restore and chosing the location where to put the files i get a failed with an unknown error message

291854
vmware	virtualbox
i suppose you could try it in virtualbox or vmware

291856

by default the latest ubuntu install 12.04.2 and few others behind hide messages and show a nice animated image splash in a fancy resolution

292652
ubuntu	linux
generally speaking recent versions of ubuntu and other linux distributions set things up correctly by default so if your partitions aren t properly aligned you may want to consider why that s the case

292657

for example using a x86 machine to create a debian ubuntu installation for an embedded arm or powerpc system

292671

daemons	systemd
upstart is an event-based replacement for the sbin init daemons which handles starting of tasks and services during boot stopping them during shutdown and supervising them while the systemd is running

292694
filesystems	ntfs
you may do this but please first notice that all data on the selected partition will be deleted and the filesystems will be changed from ntfs to ext4

292766

alien can sometimes convert packages but sometimes there can be significant problems and sometimes say fedora libs conflict with debian ubuntu libs

293293
bash	zsh
this is only with zsh not in bash

293302
filesystems	btrfs
by combining containers with other features like the btrfs filesystems it will be possible to quickly set up multiple lightweight isolated linux instances on a single host

293302
solaris	bsd
therefore containers are better compared to solaris zones or bsd jails

293312
kde	gnome
i have searched up and down the web and have found only fixes for kde and gnome

293313
versioning	upgrade
how do i install different upgrade or downgrade php versioning in still supported ubuntu release

293320
ethernet	wireless
the laptop and desktop would be linked with ethernet not wireless so there would definitely be the bandwidth

293320
post	get
using freedom-ben s post i setup everything in those two links to get x11 forwarding with audio working

293346
sudo	passwd
what this means is that by default if you issue a sudo command and enter your passwd then wait 14.9 minutes before issuing a second sudo command you won t have to enter your passwd again

293350
min	max
click it and its properties you can adjust step increment max value min value etc

299286
mouse	keyboard
sometimes when using wine specially with games doing alt + tab will make the system loose either keyboard or mouse focus over the current active window

299286
mouse	keyboard
with this i mean that for example if i do alt + tab from the wine game to nautilus empathy or another app and then try to go back to the game may need to do this several times about 3 to 4 should be enough it will stay in nautilus the active window or any other app but the keyboard and mouse will be on the game

299286
mouse	keyboard
so i will be left with a system that is showing me in foreground the nautilus app but the keyboard and mouse focus are on a minimized background app wine game for example

299286
mouse	keyboard
this can also happen to only one input for example the wine game might have the keyboard focused on it but the mouse is not sometimes even lost and not usable until wine is closed

one network provider i m aware of blocked viber whatsapp and skype until enough business users complained then they were unblocked for bill pay customers but if you were on a pay as you go phone top up as you use it then they still blocked it until eventually they gave up on that too because their competitors started allowing these services and they had to enable it for competition reasons

299321
sudo	passwd
in xubuntu i use sudo pppoeconf to key in username and passwd

299343
folder	directory
this command is valid if your distro has the folder battery in proc acpi if that does not find this the solution is not to create such a folder with mkdir command with root permissions sudo mkdir until same because the system does not allow the creation of folder in this directory when started then the said resolution to the issue is to use a distro live cd logically with its already installed on the hd and finally create the folder battery in proc acpi

299343

299379
filesystems	ntfs
type is the filesystems in use usually ext4 or ntfs and pass from what i can gather is best put as 2 for a secondary ext4 drive or 0 for an ntfs one it has to do with how the filesystems checker fsck behaves with it - this could be false advice for ntfs but for me at least it s trundled along quite nicely

by default administrative tasks are done with sudo command either in command line interface or in the background and that means they are run with root-level privileges but still by your normal user with normal users passwd

so root passwd is not supposed to be the same as the passwd you enter for software center or when you run commands with sudo in the command line

303208
sudo	passwd
try removing the programmes that ask for root passwd and reinstall them as the regular user with sudo

usually when user is prompted for root passwd the problem is that something was install as root not the same as sudo and later those files are being executed or opened by the regular user

personaly i do consider sudoers as security issue as most people use one main profile inside sudoers and as such it is likely to have asier passwd

it is possible to set it up so that apt dpkg track dependencies see this question for more details but if apt sees you re running an older version of php than it has in the repos it may try to update you which will include suhosin

306504

at the very least the debian and arch teams have declared suhosin upstream dead so even if ubuntu still has it you should be able to pull straight from debian or possibly port the arch one

i ve been thinking of making a linux distro just a hobby won t be big and professional like ubuntu for some fun and gaining knowledge

307334
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i ve heard linux mint or ubuntu comes with a live usb maker that converts your customized ubuntu linux mint into a distro or something but i don t know if that s the proper way to make a distro or if it exists is what i think it is

307354
sudo	passwd
and just one more if this is the case how do i make a secure passwd that isn t a pain to type out every time i use sudo

307354
sudo	passwd
preferably i would like to have the sudo passwd be short and the port 22 passwd be something ridiculous and very long

307505
post	get
this blog post looked like the exact problem i have but i am not experienced enough with fstab to get this to work

307512

if this is an mp4 part 2 then with a very meticulous approach you can proceed the file without encoder decoder

307513
ubuntu	linux
twitter clients for linux and ubuntu are in different situations

307523
vagrant	juju
there are several automated provisioning packages out there for openstack ubuntu has one with juju vagrant has a devstack box and many more but for just starting it on one machine to learn more about it devstack is nice imho

307540
vmware	virtualbox
i have vmware and virtualbox installed though neither is running at the time

307559
ubuntu	linux
slackware 14 is working very well for me at the moment but if you are new to linux use the latest ubuntu

307580
777	trash
you could try using a root nautilus and deleting one file so that the .trash-1000 folder is created correctly then using sudo chmod -r 777 .trash-1000 to give yourself permission to access a trash on the filesystem

307587
chown	mount

versioning	upgrade
as man apt-get describes it apt-get update will resynchronize the package index files from their sources while apt-get upgrade will install the newest versioning of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in your package list aforementioned

307652
kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon	cinnamon	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
i have since updated it several times and installed and used a great number of wms unity xfce gnome kde cinnamon

307677
for-loop	loops
after the command i want to put a for-loop to keep checking the status of virtualbox and the script comes out of loops only after the ubuntu is fully started

307709
ubuntu	debian
also consider submitting this to debian as ubuntu and a lot more distributions is based on that you ll reach an even bigger audience

307717
ubuntu	linux
then i realised new to ubuntu old to linux that this is not enough and i had to remove network-manager alltogether in order to start using ifup down etc

307763
ubuntu	linux
later on i burned an ubuntu 13.04 64-bit installation dvd and tried to install it creating only read write errors similar to those i got when trying to install puppy linux

307768
vmware	virtualbox
however if you want to ensure that you can do it in the future you can use a virtual machine system which supports snapshots such as vmware or virtualbox meaning you can revert to previous states

307798
ethernet	wireless
these will turn off your ethernet port and disable the wireless n in the wifi driver

307843
pop-up	dialog
first problem is that a dialog pop-up which i have to click

google-chrome	firefox
if for some reason you want to use google-chrome and not firefox for responsive work we can utilize the google-chrome debugger to achieve this below are the steps -

307854
gedit	nano
open it with a gui text editor by replacing nano with leafpad gedit etc

307898
vmware	virtualbox
for a hypervisor i have tried both vmware and virtualbox in order to rule out any weird bridged networking problem

307926

308048
ubuntu	debian
the local path means it s not managed by the system packages this is an error for debian ubuntu packages

308062
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux has installed successfully

308088
width	height
i ve tried calculating setting width height properties but they didn t do anything

308094
rpm	yum
you want the tar.gz version not the yum or rpm

308096
width	height
at the moment the only way to detect it is by checking the application s width and height

308096
portrait	landscape
for instance assuming that the phone s widthxheight is 40x71 gu default portrait the tablet is 160x100 gu default landscape anything that goes above 160x100 gu can be considered as desktop

308096
mouse	keyboard
there are plans to provide flags to identify for instance whether there is a hw keyboard attached pointing device aso however those flags should not be used alone to identify a desktop form factor as you can attach mouse hw keyboard to phone tablet through bluetooth

308159
dpkg	apt
it was hinted in the dependency error messages from the dpkg apt command

308186
mouse	keyboard
in a multiseat configuration a computer can be used by multiple users at the same time each one with his own monitor keyboard and mouse

you don t need to configure developer access to your device like adb fastboot or something similar through certain udev rules

308381
versioning	upgrade
kernel upgrade for instance will not automatically remove the previous versioning

308386

freeware things are not accepted by debian s nor ubuntu s repositories--everything must be free software

put	get
i was hoping to burn the .iso following the instructions found on the website and install ubuntu but when i put the disk in and start up i just get no bootable device - restart computer

308600
daemons	launchd
however you can install this daemons which will significantly improve launchd apps on start-up

308600
daemons	systemd
note that installing preload will not make your systemd boot faster and that preload is a daemons that runs with root priviledges

308605
sudo	passwd
if you want to run a command with root privileges simply prefix it with sudo it will ask you for the passwd to the account you are logged in with not the root account

308605
sudo	passwd
if you want to elevate that entire command session to root privileges type sudo su you will still need to enter the passwd to your account

for my system debian not ubuntu i have the following in my etc rc.local to do this

308742
x86	64bit
linux kernel headers for version 3.2.0 on 64bit x86 smp

308798

have you tried to do reinstall of gcc together with g++

308801

i am a novice linux ubuntu user who is just discovering the joys of a lightweight free software environment which gives control to the user

308838
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu has its roots in the debian gnu linux distribution

308838
ubuntu	debian
there is a document titled debian and ubuntu in pdf format which can be downloaded from here

308838
ubuntu	linux
what is ubuntu linux

308842
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
so i have change my os from ubuntu to linux mint 15 which is 13.04 based the old solution still doesn t solve my problem with headphone jack

308867
ethernet	wireless
i connected via ethernet and did a full system update restarted and ran additional drivers again but it is still empty and i still have no wireless connection available

308969
mouse	keyboard
3 now you need to install a little program to re-map mouse and keyboard inputs

308969
mouse	keyboard
the idea is using xbindkeys to say when i press 13th mouse button send a ctrl + f10 keyboard press using xte program to generate that

308982
folder	directory
but i dont see a dkms directory within my lib folder to do a cd var lib dkms psmouse

309014
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i deleted the linux mint option and added ubuntu

309014
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
when i restarted my computer my options were linux mint and ubuntu both of which bring me to the ubuntu grub loader

309078
mouse	keyboard	bluetooth	usb
warning you need to have a usb mouse and keyboard apple bluetooth keyboard and mouse will not work once you boot ubuntu and may not work when selecting drives

309119
mouse	keyboard
aptitude has a shell of its own which is keyboard or mouse activated and runs in a terminal window

309121
debian-based	linux
apt-get is a package management system that handles the installation of deb packages on debian-based linux distributions

309121
dpkg	aptitude
the following information doesn t really directly answer what is the difference between dpkg and aptitude apt-get

309121
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
this package format is used on rpm-based linux distributions such as redhat centos and fedora

309121
rpm	yum
they use the command rpm to install a package and yum is the front-end for it it s the clever one

309121
rpm	yum
so their .rpm files are our .deb files their rpm tool is our dpkg tool and their yum is our apt-get

309121
debian-based	ubuntu
so if you ever fall into the situation where you have an .rpm package and you want to install in on your ubuntu or any other debian-based distro you can use the command alien rpm_packagename.rpm to convert it to .deb and then install it using dpkg

309125
pull	push
i understand that that is caused by the mtpfs which is a pull and push file system

309133
ubuntu	linux
i have a mac mini g4 with ubuntu 12.0 with kernel -version- linux 3.5.0-17-powerpc-smp ppc

309151
kde	kubuntu
on kubuntu 12.10 i can see with the kde system monitor plasmoid that the cpu usage is fluctuating between 60 - 90 on both cores

309151
mouse	keyboard
i thought that the issue is that i m doing nothing while looking at top so i closed top just pressed q and still did nothing with the keyboard nor mouse

309171
pygtk	pygobject
pygtk and pygobject are no longer the recommended method for developing apps for ubuntu

309186
google-chrome	firefox
switching to chromium google-chrome is not an option for me as have been for many years since early life of firefox and so i m not only used to it but loves it

309202
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for my_username

309204
uninstall	upgrade
edit it appears that the fixed package is released but if you already installed wine1.6 using any workarounds i ll recommend you to uninstall wine at least once sudo apt-get remove wine1.6 then install it nomally sudo apt-get install wine1.6 otherwise any further attempts to upgrade wine will fail

309206
sudoers	visudo
edit etc sudoers file use sudo visudo command for safety

309210
sudo	passwd
it will ask you for the passwd and after that all commands are run as sudo

309211
sudo	passwd
that is sudo will remember your passwd for 15 minutes by default

309222
ubuntu	mint
i ve tried kubuntu stock ubuntu and even mint

309259
versioning	upgrade
i have 2 or 3 times upgrade ubuntu with newer versioning

309304
mouse	keyboard
i recommend you borrow a mouse and keyboard that are usb and plug them in to get past the install

309331
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been very unhappy with google-chrome off late and i want to move back to firefox

309331
google-chrome	firefox
i remember firefox showing me a dialog to import bookmarks and passwords from google-chrome the first time i started it but i just can t seem to find it anywhere now

309419
fastboot	adb
these are meant for developer access adb and fastboot protocols

309432
sudo	passwd
ec2 does not have an easy way to provide you with a secure passwd for the ubuntu user so the default is to allow passwordless sudo after you connect securely with the ssh private key

309432
sudo	passwd
if you add a passwd to the ubuntu user you can require it for sudo by editing etc sudoers.d 90-cloud-init-users and changing

309432
sudo	passwd
adding a passwd for sudo increases the overall security of your system

309474
filesystems	fat
in fat filesystems including i believe fat32 when a file is deleted the first character of its filename is overwritten and thus can t be recovered but the rest of the filename can

309474
filesystems	fat
when testdisk recovers a deleted file on a fat filesystems it substitutes the missing first letter with an underscore

309521
google-chrome	firefox
comes back as invalid and yes i used the url username in a google-chrome browser even had firefox as default when attempting this same thing occured and all i get is success

309537
lan	intranet
apache is a good choice for hosting websites over the intranet lan as well as over the internet

309541
kde	gnome
if you need to perform some action that requires root privileges you can request those privileges just for that particular command with sudo on the console or kdesudo or gksudo if you re using kde or gnome unity respectively

309542
ubuntu	linux
becoming a user having full root privileges is not considered a good way of working with ubuntu or even linux in general

309553
pull	push
on the other hand that means that if i need to properly preserve permissions and back up everything including stuff that s only readable by root such as ssl certificates i need to enable authkey ssh root logins on either one of the hosts and push or pull backups accordingly

309559
google-chrome	firefox
firefox can import bookmarks from google-chrome but apparently not from chromium

309612
gif	png
these tools are best to recover file with well known formats like jpg png gif pdf etc

309671
post	get
looks like this post is getting updated so i though i d let you guys know what i did to get things working properly

309739
switching	screens
i have asus n56vz and i found the only way to switching is to press f2 on post screens navigate to save and exit select the system you want to boot in boot override section and hit enter

309766
google-chrome	firefox
1 backup my bookmarks from google-chrome and firefox

309786
clang	llvm
trying sudo apt-get install llvm or sudo apt-get install clang installs 2.9 versions

309787
clang	llvm
ok so i successfully compiled halide on ubuntu 13.04 by installing llvm clang and build-essential

309787
clang	llvm
my only guess as to your issue is that the llvm or clang from the ppa you installed might not have worked quite right

309787
ubuntu	debian
you might take a look at for more info on package management in debian most of which should apply to ubuntu as well since ubuntu is based on debian

309787
clang	llvm
use sudo apt-get purge llvm-3.2 clang-3.2 to completely remove llvm and clang from your system

309787
versioning	upgrade
the first part will enable the actual ubuntu versioning of the llvm-3.2 package and the second will keep the system from trying to upgrade everything to the proposed versioning

309787
clang	llvm
use sudo apt-get install llvm-3.2 precise-proposed to install llvm 3.2 and use sudo apt-get install clang precise-proposed to install clang 3.0 i think that s the version you should get

309794
ubuntu	linux
with ubuntu or other versions of linux is it problematic to use different package managers at the same time

309824
versioning	upgrade
no ubuntu is not a new versioning of windows so you can t simply upgrade from an existing versioning of windows to it

309841
ubuntu	linux
new to ubuntu and linux thanks

309873
ubuntu	linux
as a side note i do notice when i enter in the command prompt i see welcome to ubuntu 13.04 gnu linux 3.8.0-19-generic i686 â could that mean i downloaded the 64 bit version even though it was labeled as the 32 bit version

309874
ubuntu	linux
how to install linux kernel 3.9 in ubuntu

309875
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux kernel 3.9.4 install and removel on linux mint and ubuntu

309876
kde	gnome
you could try lubuntu as 32-bit-cd because with xfce-windows-manager it is not demanding too much memory for graphics like gnome or kde do

309917
ubuntu	linux
i realize ubuntu is built atop linux source including the gui perspective using x etc

309917
ubuntu	linux
however when referring to a linux distro such as ubuntu should one refer to ubuntu the kernel software part and the originating source or should one refer to ubuntu the software on top of linux

309917
ubuntu	linux
because it is all confusing saying i have linux on my desktop and i have ubuntu on my desktop which can be essentially the same thing when you really consider it and break away the middleware

309920
ubuntu	linux
you are more or less saying the same controversy as linux and gnu linux but instead of gnu linux you are talking about ubuntu

309927
ubuntu	linux
if you insist on telling everybody you meet you re running ubuntu gnu linux with amd64 architecture people are going to wonder why you re doing it

309927
ubuntu	linux
but if you re just bragging about what you re running linux or ubuntu will do

309937
ubuntu	linux
consider a thought experiment if ubuntu 14.04 included an automated behind the scenes transition to a hurd or mach microkernel instead of linux as soon as you upgraded to it with all the other apps and libraries remaining the same please ignore for the moment how problematic and unlikely this would be would you consider your system to have changed operating systems in that process

309965
filesystems	btrfs
the structure of my kubuntu install pictured above is because i am using the btrfs butter fs filesystems which uses subvolumes

309978

you cannot run them inside directly using ubuntu or any linux distro for that matter as they are designed to run on windows dos os but you can run some exe s using this ubuntu program called wine for linux

310514
disk	ram
cache is where linux uses some of your ram to keep a cache of data recently read from the disk

310547

this is a metapackage installing several actual packages you will need including gcc g++

i just download the latest versioning and install it rather than trying to upgrade

310825
versioning	upgrade
go to system settings - and under the tab updates make sure that at notify me of a new ubuntu versioning is set to for any nev versioning if you want to upgrade from 12.04 to 13.04 you will first need to upgrade to 12.10 and to 13.04 from there

310844
filesystems	ntfs
in that case leave the filesystems on the mounted partition ntfs

you can install the package by opening a terminal and type sudo apt-get install libreoffice-common enter your passwd and see wether that works

310978
mouse	keyboard
each user would have its own pair of screens mouse keyboard etc but each working in its own home directory etc

311015

unfortunately dpkg does not have a package manager within but is just the barebones package installer that applications like apt use to do the install work

311018
ubuntu	debian
1.1.0 is available in debian sid but i heard it s not a good idea to mix sid with ubuntu stable

311019
vim	gedit
you can then remove the bogus entries once in ubuntu through a text editor ie vim gedit or using a graphical frontend like grub-customizer

and on debian ubuntu systems this can be also done restarting the procps service

it is more likely a linux or linux configuration issue - googgle around and you will find thousands of issue reports about slow usb in linux ubuntu

311481

for me it is almost a showstopper for linux - i now have an ubuntu 12.04 lts and still have this issue so i rather use the win7 setup - mainly only because of this

you can partially compensate by restarting the daemons but with a complex systemd like an sql server it s going to be really hard to exactly reproduce any previous state other than freshly installed

ethernet	wireless
i m using an ethernet cable so there s no wireless stuff to deal with - and it had no trouble connecting the whole time it was upgrading

311696
filesystems	ntfs
this message you re seeing is because windows does not recognize these filesystems and offers you to reformat it using a windows-native filesystems ntfs fat32

311703

after the upgrade youtube stopped working both firefox and google-chrome

in general backports on ubuntu is as easy and reliable as backports on debian they tend to have the same maintainers

312200

backports are imo no more or less official or supported on ubuntu then debian

312200

imo the advice on backports is very very similar between debian and ubuntu

understandind how safe it is to make it sure that there is no flaw try this where you will see it asks the passwd 2 times because sudo ls is run as normal user so a script with sudo on it wont work unseen

for example you can use gedit gksu gedit etc modprobe.d blacklist-kvm.conf or nano sudo nano etc modprobe.d blacklist-kvm.conf

gentoo	linux
if you are patient compiling webkit can take a night or so have fun playing with a linux system customizing the kernel config and fine tweaking sytem settings gentoo definitely is the distribution for you - like the gentoo website says gentoo is all about choice

314024
gentoo	debian
in such a case i strongly recommend debian wheezy which i had installed on the netbook before i switched to gentoo

314024
ubuntu	debian
debian is very similar to ubuntu actually ubuntu is based on the unstable debian version but the debian developers care more about stability than about new software-versions

314024
ubuntu	debian
therefore the just released debian wheezy has many software versions that ubuntu had in 12.04 and some even older ones

314024
ubuntu	debian
the great thing about debian is that if one selects a lightweight desktop like xfce when booting the installation cd even before the installer is started directly in the grub menu under advanced options it comes with even more lightweight software than the light ubuntu versions

314024
ubuntu	debian
also i found that some programs are in the debian repositories which are missing under ubuntu

314024
ubuntu	debian
there are drawbacks of course the most important being that debian wheezy uses an older libc than ubuntu 12.04 so ubuntu 12.04 packages will in many cases not install due to missing dependencies

314024
ubuntu	debian
also some convenience tools of ubuntu are missing in debian instead of ppas one has to add the full deb-repository url there s no software center ...

314395
sudo	passwd
the script was designed to be run as a normal user and to prompt for the passwd when a sudo command is first needed

314395
sudo	passwd
what happens when the script is run from the terminal is that the user is prompted for their passwd once and the default sudo timeout allows the script to finish including any additional sudo commands without prompting the user again

314395

i appreciate any ideas for letting a user enter the sudo passwd just once via gui while not running the whole script as root

at the moment the sdk works better for mobile touch-enabled apps than for desktop keyboard and mouse enabled ones but there is work already underway to improve it on the desktop

314401
sudo	passwd
the -a sudo option allows you to specify a helper program in the sudo_askpass variable that will ask for the passwd

314401
sudo	passwd
the above works like a charm if it runs from command line or if you choose run in terminal after double click the script file in the file manager but if you choose run or try to launch it from a .desktop file every sudo will ask for the for passwd again

314401
sudo	passwd
if you don t want a terminal window at all you can store the passwd in a variable and pipe it to sudo -s

the best option you have now imo is to download the .iso of a supported versioning eg ubuntu 12.04 lts create a bootable dvd or usb and upgrade ubuntu through the installer window

315088

uget is the best linux download manager available and works great on ubuntu 12.04

filesystems	ntfs
ubuntu is hosted under windows ntfs filesystems

315184
filesystems	hfs+
permissions in both hfs+ and linux-native filesystems are stored in terms of user ids uids which are numbers associated with usernames

315184
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu as in most modern linux distributions the first user is given a uid of 1000 by default

315184
sudo	passwd
thus you ll need to either give root a passwd and log into root directly or use sudo from a second user account

mouse	keyboard
this way if the app freezes hijacks the keyboard and or mouse focus at least you have a way to eliminate the app instead of having it fullscreen where you have few choices

this is useful if your wine app is frozen took the whole screen and does not let you use ubuntu has the mouse or keyboard focused on it and other wine issues that might appear with some apps

316029

this would do two things it will first set the directory to the metro last light folder and then it would run the metroll.exe mentioned at the end

316029

when dealing with apps that take hold of you mouse and or keyboard you can use wineserver -k to kill the app or simply opening the app in windows mode or setting the windows mode with the wine explorer desktop parameter will save you from having this mouse keyboard problems

none of the solutions shown worked as far as i could tell to get a program i wrote as a linux terminal program to run in my fat32 partition but changing the filename of the program to include .exe extension did work thanks for the tip all i did was rename filename to filename.exe for the terminal program i was trying to execute on a fat32 partition and then un-mount it re-mount it and set the disk permissions to allow execution then go to filename.exe and set its permissions and then the check mark would stick rather than turn back to a minus and when i set the path and entered . filename.exe at the terminal prompt the program ran as it should and shows the command line including filename.exe as entered although the ubuntu file directory shows the file as msdos windows it does run as a linux program

you need to tell apache to proxy nginx so that when a request comes in for your domain it gets routed through

316337
chown	chmod
in general however it is a very bad idea to start using chown and chmod on system files as you are likely to break ubuntu and need to re-install

316337

imo chown and chmod should be uses only of files in your home directory or shared directories but not system directories bin or lib

when you install linux on an sd card or usb you cannot use the actual installer because as far as i know you can t just boot your pc from ubuntu cd with a usb plugged in and expect to see the usb in the installer not sure for the latest versions could actually be possible you will have to use unetbootin or similar which will make a live cd not an actual install and will limit the amount of changes you can do to this by making a live cache and this live cache will limit the changes you do eg

once the new configuration works remove the backup sudo rm etc shadow.old as it may be regarded as bad to have extra unnecessary copies of users passwd hashes lying around once a passwd is changed the hash should go away so old hashes cannot be cracked to gain access to other systems where old passwd may still be set

kubuntu	gnome
i think the reason is that the software repos are the originally provided gnome unity repos and not the kubuntu repos

320655
disk	ram
this safes disk space and ram at runtime but has the drawback that one cannot freely install programs on different partitions or hard disk at least not without editing system configuration files for instance etc ld.so.conf.d to include the different library folders

320655
folder	directory
since in the comments you were referring to games many games that are not bought through ubuntu software center come as an installer executable and those can then of course be installed to any folder usually a subfolder of your home directory

320659
folder	directory
well a more organized solution would be to create a folder called bin under your home directory and add symbolic links shortcuts under that folder

320659

this will create the folder bin under your home directory

320841
folder	directory
alternatively you can choose not to format in which case directory and files that are on the partition will only be over-written if they use the same names as files and folder written by the ubuntu installer though if you do this you must choose to use the filesystem as what-ever it is currently formatted as

320956
put	get
i think the only way to do it would be to get someone with internet to follow these instructions for 13.04 and then you will have to put it into your pc reboot to the bootloader you might need to press esc or f5 or something while booting to get to the startup menu in your pc and then select usb

321001

if you have to create files or directory in a root folder log in as root

321003

there was also no frontend application installed on my systemd so zeitgeist daemons clearly collected that information not for my own consumption

each distro uses a packaging system and naming convention ubuntu and debian use .deb apt

321680
rhel	suse
fedora rhel centos suse use .rpm

321683
ubuntu	centos
it s possible to attempt to install an rpm package on ubuntu but rpm packages are really intended for systems that use rpm as their package manager like fedora centos mandriva and mageia that s a far from complete list

321683
dpkg	apt
the surrounding infrastructure such as apt the software center and the software updater which automatically check for and fetch packages from software sources may also be considered the package manager but dpkg is what installs and uninstalls packages and keeps track of what packages are installed at what versions often being called behind the scenes by other utilities to perform these functions

i recommend vmware because it has the best graphics card emulation out of all the products i ve tried however if you want more features then try virtualbox

it is not recommended to skip immediate releases at upgrade to a higher versioning if you really want this i think you find some help here

i have read a number of comparisons and reviews where nginx is faster than apache serving static content but these don t cover php performance

here is my question how does nginx compare to apache regarding performance of php processing

323383
ubuntu	linux
flash player is not an ubuntu s project is adobe s project and currently adobe dropped flash player support for linux

323433
apache	nginx
here is a comparison between apache and nginx listing some advantages and disadvantages

323433
apache	nginx
it differs from apache in a fundamental wayâ apache is a process- and thread-driven application but nginx is event-driven

323433
apache	nginx
in the end both nginx and apache web servers are solid solutions although each has their fortes in given situations

323449
ubuntu	linux
for linux ubuntu fedora

323471

if it works and if refind also offers options to boot ubuntu that work you might consider installing the refind debian package

uefi	acpi
interestingly when i made recovery disks for the windows system and tried to boot from them under uefi it recognized them and then briefly presents the cd under the following file system name in the uefi menu acpi pnp0a03 0 pci 1fi2 sata 2 0 0 cdrom entry 1

323478
apache	nginx
nginx with php-fpm is generally faster than apache with mod_php but the resulting performance improvement depends on the environment php code complexity users load hardware etc. where you deploy your solution or web application

323478
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
lighttpd a competitor to nginx during the early days used its own spawn_fcgi another fastcgi implementation to improve speed and resulted in being able to serve more users with the same or less amount of resources as apache

323478
nginx	lighttpd
nginx is a bit more different to lighttpd

323478
nginx	lighttpd
as of today nginx supports a lot of functionality and can also be configured to run spawn_fcgi but it was never as closely bundled with it as was lighttpd

323478
apache	nginx
i found it to be very helpful for understanding how apache is configured why nginx does things differently if is evil and how you achieve speed improvements with nginx

323478
apache	nginx
if you replace apache with nginx and try to configure it the same way as apache you won t get much speed improvement at all or your configuration will just not work

323478
apache	nginx
and who said you cannot run an apache behind nginx

so the question basically is how come gcc package does not contain the c++ compiler g++

323540
g++	gcc
maybe linking gcc to g++ or something

323545
kubuntu	gnome
if so then having this to consider and the fact that maybe you have an old integrated video card i would suggest to first try xubuntu or lubuntu before going with ubuntu kubuntu or gnome ubuntu

sudo	passwd
when i reboot my computer lubuntu prompts me for a passwd it s just after the motherboard prefrences and there are no username options just system passwd i input sudo passwd and it s ok but it s kinda annoying i want lubuntu to autologin i have removed the option that lubuntu asks me passwd at login in users and groups preferences if i would have checked that i would have to input my passwd twice.

323898

first aim install ubuntu 12.04.2 and maybe another linux system on the drive 1 and conserve windows 8

moreover i have checked disks and memory and found no faults and the bios has been upgrade to the latest versioning

to make other directory available you can just add it as a bookmark or hold down ctrl shift while dragging extra folder from the shared space to one of your installations home folder

dpkg	apt	debian-based	linux
the package management system apt used in debian-based linux distributions is a clever system where it will automatically detect if currently installed packages have missing dependencies even if you have installed them using dpkg and not apt-get

325674
dpkg	apt
the apt suite as well as dpkg provides a neat way to list the dependencies of a package

325674
dpkg	apt
since apt is actually just a front-end for dpkg both these commands essentially do the same exact thing they go look at the .deb file of the application to find out what dependencies it needs except apt-cache will look in the repositories

325674
dpkg	apt
these dependencies are listed inside the .deb file as metadata that is why even if you have manually downloaded and installed an application which is usually a .deb file so you ll be installing it using dpkg and not apt from a website for example google s chrome browser from google s website apt will still find out that there are missing dependencies by analyzing the installed packages

325745

not all. usually if the only available .deb pakage for a program is for debian rather than ubuntu it s worth trying to install using that

325745
ubuntu	debian
click debian 7.0+ 32bit if you re running the 32-bit version of ubuntu

325745

click debian 7.0+ 64bit if you re running the 64-bit version of ubuntu

325745
ubuntu	debian
some people recommend against cross-installation the installation of software intended for one version of ubuntu on another or intended for another operating system like debian that uses .deb packages on ubuntu

325745
ubuntu	debian
any package that is intended to work on multiple releases of debian is likely to work on ubuntu too

325745
ubuntu	debian
if it works properly on multiple debian releases then it probably doesn t have such narrow requirements regarding the toolchain with which its dependencies were built that it would likely be a problem on ubuntu

325745
ubuntu	debian
lots of widely respected professional-quality software is offered as a single .deb package or a 32-bit package and a 64-bit package for all reasonably current debian and ubuntu systems

325750
installation	upgrade
normally users that start with wubi tend to upgrade to a full installation to a dedicated partition at the next release cycle

325793

googling that problem brings up one person with a similar problem who said it was caused by there being too many processes running that it couldn t write to the file but this is a brand new server with 80 gb disk 2 gb ram and 2 core processor and it has literally nothing else running

boot up into ubuntu or mint and enter the following command into the terminal

325884

i might be going too far but i do believe that if the drivers are the only thing that keeps vista home edition on your hard drive you should format your hard drive after you make sure that you won t have too many troubles with having just linux on your notebook and install ubuntu

the browser will send a multicast udp packets from the local ip and an ephemeral random port to 239.255.255.250 port 1900

326224
packets	multicast
the chromecast device will respond with a unicast udp packets from the chromecast device s ip and another ephemeral port to the source ip port of the multicast packets

326224
ssdp	upnp
in addition the iptables -a input -p udp --sport 1900 -j accept rule typically used for upnp ssdp will not work since the replies from the chromecast device do not come from port 1900

326224
packets	multicast
the ephemeral port range for the initial multicast packets should be 32768-61000 verify with cat proc sys net ipv4 ip_local_port_range so the following rule should work note it inserts at the top of the input rules

virtual magnifying glass 3.5 - that qualifies half as wide the screen as usual but locks the keyboard and mouse actions

for example if your shell were bash instead of zsh and you logged on in a virtual console .profile would be sourced

bash	zsh
when you do that pam specifically pam_env.so sets the variables on login for basically every type of login and does so before the login shell zsh bash for most people or login-shell-like thing a display manager sources its own login configuration files

326592
bash	zsh
if you weren t using zsh but instead used bash or another more traditional bourne-style shell then you could just set your environment variables in .profile or etc profile for systemwide variables

essentially only bash sources that file so it will work neither when zsh is your login shell nor when the display manager acts as your login shell

that said while it s definitely possible to run the game in ubuntu while it s still installed to a mint partition there are much simpler ways to transition over

however the installer runs totally in ram so you d probably have to make some heavy modifications to ubuntu to get it to run the full-fledged os from a remote disk

simply by exceeding ram space you get everything else put in swap partition which is way slower than ram

in linux generally a .efi extension does not indicate a 64-bit kernel -- there are plenty of 64-bit kernels that lack this extension and it may be desirable to name a 32-bit kernel with that extension on a 32-bit uefi-based computer although ubuntu doesn t do so

330615
ia-32	x86	x86	64bit
that filename extension simply identifies an efi application which can be 32-bit x86 ia-32 64bit x86-64 amd64 or some other architecture arm or itanium

333316
ubuntu	linux
thank you very much for your answers and time i d really appreciate ubuntu and its simplicity and i would bother me very much to have to switch to arch linux for just a driver

folder	directory
copy the file to a suitable directory like you home folder and try the command again

333364
versioning	upgrade
when package upgrade are interrupted in midway normally doing will save the situation but when is a full release upgrade jumping from a versioning to another the steps becomes more tricky

333419
versioning	upgrade
sudo apt-get upgrade is used to install the newest versioning of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in etc apt sources.list

333423
ubuntu	linux
my recommendation is you first familiarize with ubuntu as a casual user or power user learn more about the terminal and bash learn more about apt learn more about unix linux tools

sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for alaa

333432
versioning	upgrade
running sudo apt-get upgrade is not necessary for getting the latest available firefox because the install command will automatically fetch and install or upgrade to the latest installable versioning and whatever other packages if any are needed to enable that versioning to install

333432
installation	upgrade
and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will upgrade packages that require the installation of new packages or removal of currently installed packages so you should make sure to look at what it says it plans to do before letting it proceed

333433
folder	directory
i presume by folder you mean folder in your home directory which are not the ubuntu one folder or within it

333434

you can use the -x switching of screens uppercase x lowercase x means something else

333963

you can create a bin folder inside your home directory home m3gn bin ubuntu in theory can add this directory to your path automatically

333965

in the extensions of google-chrome install youtube video downloader or flashgot for firefox or look at the answers for this question how do i download a youtube video

folder	directory
just extract the downloaded image file of ubuntu whatever version no matter and copy the wine.exe and place it in a folder again with the downloaded image file of ubuntu in the same directory

334139
ubuntu	linux
what i did is that after uninstalling ubuntu you can do that the mentioned way or by simply booting into ubuntu live cd or usb stick and formatting linux partitions with gparted i formatted the efi partition as well and then did windows boot recovery from windows installation disk

334248

for example i upgrade ipython to versioning 1.0.0 using pip

334251

to get everything working in ubuntu 13.04 it looks like you need the 3.10 linux kernel for the wireless network which requires the 13.8 beta catalyst driver from amd

334270

background started out with windows 7 formated and installed ubuntu and later installed arch linux with a gpt partition table

334285
dpkg	apt
dpkg apt installs in usr lib python2.7 dist-packages note dist - it comes with the distribution and pip easy_install installs in other python paths

334288
ubuntu	debian
installing the debian package in ubuntu is the easiest way to do this although it s a bit safer to try to use the cd-r or usb flash drive version first and install the debian package only if the cd-r usb flash drive version can boot both your oses

334317
ubuntu	linux
so i have never used linux or ubuntu before so at the moment i am just trying it out from a usb drive

334318
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
initially my only change to the sudoers file etc sudoers was one line a user specification that should have enabled nicholsonjf to run all commands with sudo without having to enter a passwd see the line that starts with nicholsonjf

which is a related question on modifying ubuntu to run a linux kernel that has been modified to add real time features

334506
ati	nvidia
that being said you maybe stuck with either ati or nvidia

334506
ati	nvidia
i haven t visited the website of the others besides intel ati and nvidia and i don t know if they have a better support for linux

334747
udp	tcp
the host won t be able to reach the host behind nat unless port forwarding rules for tcp udp are configured

334793
switching	screens
for ubuntu server there is no such thing as a live cd aside from the fact that if you select install ubuntu server let it boot and then leave it at the first install screens you can switching virtual terminals and get to a login prompt that way

334794

bash	zsh
it is common to use dash for scripts that don t need the extra features and bash for interactive use though zsh has a lot of nicer features

334847
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
this can be achieved using lvm or a newer generation filesystems such as btrfs

334908
disk	ram
because you are running windows me on it it is likely that your computer is more than ten years old but it might be able to run xubuntu in a dual boot setup with windows me if it has at least 512mb ram and at least 5gb of free hard disk space

334908
disk	ram
otherwise you can t install any buntu flavor except for lubuntu assuming that your computer has at least 128mb ram and at least 5gb of free hard disk space

334926
ethernet	wireless
you can use wifi or ethernet to connect to the internet but wifi may not work depending on your wireless card

334960
ubuntu	linux
a user-friendly solution is unetbootin which works on windows linux and macos and provides a graphical user interface which even downloads the ubuntu image for you and writes it directly onto your flash drive

334960
ubuntu	linux
if you re running linux or os x you can dd the ubuntu image onto your flash drive

i want to make sure that the app fills the screens on the device phone tablet etc.

334982

if so does that mean the width of the screen is set to 100 grid units and the height of the screen is set to 75 grid units

334998
screens	tablet
in non-windowed mode meaning on a tablet or phone the app will take up the full size of the screens being anchored to the sides and the bottom of the top bar

334998

the width and height are only used by qmlscene on the desktop meaning that is the size it will appear when run on the desktop

335005
folder	directory
to learn the directory structure i d suggest opening up the home folder app from the launcher on the left and going to computer and just exploring for a while

335015
ubuntu	linux
if by no drive shown you mean that the ubuntu installer isn t giving you options for any hard disk device at all no dev sda or dev sdb then you ve probably got hardware that s too new and there are no linux drivers for it

335022
ubuntu	debian
if you re able to boot to windows from refind using any icon try installing refind in ubuntu using the debian package file

335027

unless you specifically set one your root account probably does not have a passwd - the assumption being that you would log in as someone else and use sudo

335190
sudo	passwd
you will have to provide root s passwd when you use sudo

335212
bash	zsh
yes zsh and bash behave differently in this regard

hopefully when the 3.12 kernel comes out the btrfs deduplication support will be mature enough that i can migrate away from zfs for this application -- zfs is cool and all but the fact that it is not integrated with the linux kernel causes issues i use a centos 6.4 virtual machine to do the backups because zfs won t compile against the 3.10 kernel

i recently downloaded scala for ubuntu through the software center however when i check the versioning i downloaded was scala 2.9.0 is there anyway i can upgrade update this to scala 2.10.1

336493
versioning	upgrade
if you want to upgrade it from source as mentioned by the above user means you will be able to use recent versioning as you want but in future you won t receive any type of application updates upgrade bug fixes from ubuntu

336508
chown	sudo
if you just wanted to unlock the folder sudo up and navigate to the location like above but instead of using the rm command use chown this will also unlock all the files inside the folder for you

cpu	hyperthreading
when you need to know whether hyperthreading is enabled without the need to reboot the system and consulting the bios you can simply look at the output of cat proc cpuinfo and compare the siblings with the cpu cores fields

336736
cpu	processors
even though cat proc cpuinfo shows you all the logical cpus processors field in the system the siblings field holds the number of logical cpus for the physical cpu this entry belongs to including both the cores and the hyper-threaded lcpus

336736
cpu	hyperthreading
if the number of cpu cores is the same as the number of siblings hyperthreading is disabled

has anyone had a similar experience with this or previous version of the nvidia proprietary driver on ubuntu debian-based or otherwise linux systems

337234
jobs	cron
there are two possible suspects that usually cause cron jobs not being able to run

337234
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
the first is permissions problems that is a user can run the script command but the cron daemon cannot because the job is in the wrong user s cron jobs

337234
jobs	cron
for example the user creates a script or runs a command with elevated privileges i.e using sudo then adds the tested script command to his list of cron jobs crontab

337256
sudoers	passwd
although the same dialogue box asking for admin passwd appears but none of the existing sudoers passwd i tried would work or accepted

337256

i m currently using ubuntu 12.04 lts and the mint i m referring to is mint 13 maya

but if you want learn more about linux gentoo is a great way of building up your own system step by step and also learn how linux works

337381

gentoo also is able to run on nearly everything no matter how small the hardware resources so you can take a other older pc for these linux install-test fun times

i often plugin a usb keyboard to my laptop in addition to external monitor and mouse which all virtually convert my laptop to a desktop computer and i prefer using a different keyboard layout then

337431
mouse	keyboard
this script is quite useful and more stable for scenarios where user starts using the laptop on a desktop setup with external keyboard mouse and monitor etc. and it can also be run manually whenever the external usb keyboard is plugged in.

337433
cinnamon	gnome
a safe bet is gnome shell but in your situation i d go cinnamon that doesn t use the top left corner much

337445
folder	directory
full path name really means the full path to that file or folder from the filesystem s directory

337445

linux uses all unused ram for disk cache cached value in free

337761

as more ram is used by applications the less ram is available for caching disk activities

337803

that should be enough since files inside the directory are world readable except for the xml folder that again needs the right ownership or permissions

the data in tmpfs is stored in ram which uses the swap space as a fall back so it is likely the data has never been written to disk in the first place so there s basically nothing to recover

afp is supported on os x but os x also supports smb cifs

339473
cifs	smb
provided that you have arranged things for adequate security for example if people are accessing it over the internet this should only be through an appropriate vpn you should probably use smb cifs unless you know you won t have any native windows clients which seems unlikely even for an ubuntu or os x shop

in particular if you need to facilitate access to files over the internet without a vpn then even if you already have smb cifs afp and or nfs set up you should still use those only on the lan and set up an additional appropriate service for access to files over an unsecured network

341914
versioning	upgrade
which states that the packages and kernels in ubuntu 12.04 lts will upgrade equivalent to non-lts versioning

for example let s say you have skype versioning 3 installed but when ubuntu went and asked the repositories apt-get update it found out that they have versioning 4 available so now apt knows that skype needs to be upgrade

344490

theoretically if ubuntu were compliant with unix and linux standard adding 3 to grub s kernel command in boot grub menu.lst should have been sufficient because runlevel 3 means no x11 according to this standard

344540

to get root privileges we use sudo su where it asks for our passwd

344540
sudo	passwd
to unlock the root account use sudo -i and passwd in this way you can unlocak root account which is not advised though

344546
sudo	passwd
this is why sudo asks user shannon for his and not root s passwd

344546

that is why i modified etc sudoers in such a way that it never asks me for my passwd -- being there is sufficient

sudoers	visudo
using the command sudo visudo i have edited etc sudoers and edited the following line

344546
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
syntax error in the sudoers file might completely disable the sudo system -- and then if root does not have a passwd you are in a deep kacka

we don t intend this to become the only way to update ubuntu machines and the use of apt dpkg will remain supported with most devices having some kind of switch to opt out of image based updates and re-enable apt

349733
ubuntu	linux
i recently got an acer laptop that had linpus linux loaded on it i found out that s not a very popular distribution so i am trying to install ubuntu 12.04.3

349738
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
this extension works on opera next firefox and safari browsers as well

349746
ubuntu	debian
if these don t work tell me and i will try it myself with screenshots but from debian don t be afraid ubuntu is a debian based operating system

349777
ubuntu	debian
this was tested on trisquel 6.0 32-bit ubuntu 12.04.3 32-bit and debian 7.0 gnome 32-bit

349789
switching	screens
another symptom was that after going back to the display manager login screens that is after logging out or switching the user the touchpad started working again

349801
width	height
caused by java.awt.awtexception exception class java.lang.illegalargumentexception width 0 and height 0 must be non-zero occurred while creating cursor copydrop.32x32

349835
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
tried install under linux mint 14 and ubuntu 12.04 same problem

349845
google-chrome	firefox
the show alert box renders differently than in firefox ie and google-chrome

349874
ubuntu	freebsd
while installing freebsd alongside ubuntu installation on hdd system boots grub shell and resign to boot grub menu further

349878
ubuntu	linux
i can boot off an install image actually 13.04 and run efibootmgr - it doesn t show a linux ubuntu entry for that disk

349898
cpu	processors
my processors isn t a slow one intel core i7-3630qm quad core and the average cpu usage of transmission is 3 - 4

349932
debian-based	ubuntu
on debian-based systems like ubuntu vi is not the original vi but a lightweight vim build that usually lacks a few useful features like clipboard or scripting support

349935
next	except
all my function keys work fine except the play pause previous and next keys.i have been looking for a solution but its not working

349953
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu and linux

349965
ubuntu	linux
therefore i would suggest you use an ubuntu or any other linux parted magic live cd dvd usb to boot your computer for this purpose

349966
folder	directory
delete the fail folder inside .thumbnails in home directory

349966
folder	directory
change the permissions of folder .cache thumbnails in home directory by following command

349969
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu and linux

349978
ubuntu	linux
another difference i observed is previously it used to show ubuntu with linux 3.0.0-23 now its showing ubuntu 3.0.0-40 at the grub

350000
google-chrome	firefox
when i tried to click on this button to download app using any web browsers firefox google-chrome

350012
folder	directory
because when you move files to trash in an ntfs partition a folder called is created in the root directory of the partition where is the uid of the user and the folder s owner will be the user that s trying to delete

350012
folder	directory
to test this try manually creating a folder in the root directory of the partition named .trash-1001 the owner will be set to the owner of the partition

350028
switching	screens
as soon as i install the proprietary nvidia driver on my laptop even after a fresh kubuntu install i start to experience random screens failures that is the screens suddenly shuts off the backlight is still on but the display is black and trying to switching tty changes nothing

350036
ubuntu	linux
i have just started using ubuntu and i want to continue developing my website however i realised notepad++ isn t linux compatible and i was wondering is there something similar to notepadd++ that doesn t have that many features but has syntax highlighting

350046
kate	kde
alternatively kate from kde is quite good and has syntax highlighting for php asp html javascript.

350089
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
is there a way to uninstall my 3 linux os s ubuntu linux mint and pear os pear os s partition somehow got formatted just the partition not the os

350093
ubuntu	mint
in gparted program delete ubuntu mint ot other systems partitions and then create new partition from free space

350176
ubuntu	linux
only in ubuntu or other linux distributions and use linux live usb

350212
stdout	stderr
run command in background discard stdout and stderr

350212
stdout	stderr
run command and redirect stdout and stderr to log file

350216
stdout	stderr
redirects stdout and stderr to file

350254
ubuntu	linux
i guess it is not the solution in linux or ubuntu

350328
ubuntu	linux
also i m a bit of an ubuntu novice 1 year with the os 2 years with linux in general so the more step-by-step the explanation the better

350375
filesystems	ntfs
when linux tries to mount your usb drive it tries to guess the correct filesystems ntfs in this instance in the same way that blkid does unless there you tell it to use a specific filesystems as in your etc fstab

350391
notepad++	gedit
using gedit 3 i ve tried multiple plugins to highlight all instances of the current selection a la notepad++

350409
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
it s worth to mention that i use linux mint 15 64 bit which is based on ubuntu repositories and everything therefore i think this must apply to ubuntu as well

350410
ethernet	wireless
in addition to this permission issue a reply to a topic gave me a clue that the name of my network interface card nic in this case my wireless adapter might be the source of the problem since conky assumes that the interface names starting with eth eth1 in my case are ethernet cable network cards and thus these cards are not supposed to represent signal strength

350458
ubuntu	linux
i am completely new to linux and ubuntu

350481
versioning	upgrade
you should update your bios firmaware if a newer versioning is available upgrade the kernel preferably to latest versioning and see if it still happens

350527
ubuntu	linux
i downloaded ubuntu 12.04.3 on a separate linux machine and used the iso file to create a bootable usb drive with startup disk creator

350541
jobs	cron
looking at the cron log it seems like the scripts should have been run however no files were created like the jobs would have done

350555
ubuntu	linux
yet another option to get into linux boot a linux emergency disk mount the ubuntu partition and edit the etc shadow file on that partition

350748
phpstorm	rubymine
it creates global menu for swing applications like netbeans ide jetbrains ides like phpstorm rubymine etc intellij idea android studio etc

350785
ubuntu	linux
there are many apps tools and solutions for this purpose in the linux world in general and ubuntu in particular some of which might suit you while some others might look too complicated

350825
ubuntu	linux
scalpel is one of the best command line tool to recover deleted files in ubuntu linux

350852
folder	directory
the server displays but i can have access from the internet to some folder directory

350852
folder	directory
i would like to perform 400-500 permissions with my website displaying results on the internet with current www-data user or another option could be to block directory display of folder

350857
switching	screens
let me quickly describe the symptoms i had at first because also the graphics was having a problem when this problem occurred i would only see a blank screens and no chance to switching to the other terminals by pressing ctrl+alt+f1-6 the screens simply stayed completely black or rather a very dark purple or something

350870
jobs	cron
i know i could write some cron jobs and shell scripts to accomplish this easily enough but time does not permit right now to test the scripts extensively enough to guarantee that they are fail safe

350882
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick is a software project that started as a modification of imagemagick and then evolved independently

350882
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
graphicsmagick includes an interface that is compatible with imagemagick

350893
versioning	upgrade
you said that you don t have to stick with a particular versioning of tomcat yet you are fretting if a minor upgrade get released

350895
uninstall	upgrade
pip will also keep track of what packages are in each of your environments making it easy to upgrade or uninstall them when needed

350908
ubuntu	linux
i recently installed ubuntu and am multi-booting with windows 7 but i would like to switch over to linux full time

350932
ethernet	wireless
detach the ethernet and your wireless should now be working

350968
folder	directory
2 rename home myname .mozilla from bash then create a new folder to replace it so as to make sure that the correct user owns the directory

350992
mtu	dhcp
i m running ubuntu server 12.04 lts and i want to override the mtu my cable company provides via dhcp

350992
mtu	dhcp
how can i make the interface force an mtu of 1492 even when it is provided with an mtu via dhcp

351035
chown	sudo	filesystems	ntfs
i was unable change the owner of the home directory using sudo chown -r user home user because the home directory was mounted on a different hard drive with an ntfs filesystems

351035
filesystems	ntfs
then used gparted to format the internal ntfs drive and change the filesystems to ext4

351035
chown	sudo
i was there able to use sudo chown -r user user home user

351037
filesystems	ntfs
the issue as mentioned in the comments was that my home directory was mounted on a different hard drive with an ntfs filesystems

351037
filesystems	ntfs
then used gparted to format the internal ntfs drive and change the filesystems to ext4

351037
chown	sudo
i was there able to use sudo chown -r user user home user

351042
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux environment.i m using ubuntu 12.04lts

351058
ubuntu	debian
a deb package named this because it was originally developed for debian which ubuntu is based on is more or less an archive that contains files with the information where those files should go

351058
dpkg	apt
the gui tools under the hood hand the work over to the apt tools which as described use dpkg which uses tools like tar

351089
ubuntu	linux
if you want to install your need for speed games on ubuntu i would install wine and or play on linux where you can install windows based games

351097
sudo	passwd
my bash-script is not run in a terminal but opens a terminal at runtime to ask for user input sudo passwd

351343
ubuntu	linux
i had the same problem and fixed it by reinstalling the windows bootloader as my main default bootloader and then adding the linux bootloader probably grub 2 for ubuntu users to the windows bootloader

351382
fastboot	adb
is it possible to get adb and fastboot for android working in ubuntu running on the arm samsung chromebook under crouton

351405
sudo	passwd
this because the redirect is done before sudo starts that s why you get permission denied without being asked for passwd

351429
xfce	kde
because the official unity kde are for performance + animations like graphics and etc but xfce lxde are mainly designed for performance

351482
ubuntu	linux
so i can try to use something like ndiswrapper or buy another usb adapter that works with linux ubuntu

351487
folder	directory
i thought about cron task which would zip etc folder into archive in my home directory

351503
versioning	upgrade
simply doing i ended in one of my work machines with a kernel upgrade to 3.5.0-xx-generic whereas other machines only got to versioning 3.2.0-54-generic

351517
ethernet	wireless
airmon-ng is used to put wireless interfaces into monitor mode so that you can capture packets the equivalent of promiscuous mode on ethernet cards

351517
ethernet	wireless
the command that you are trying airmon-ng start eth1 is trying to turn on monitor mode for eth1 which is an ethernet interface not your wireless interface so it will not work

351517
ethernet	wireless
if you re installing this ubuntu or kali as a virtual machine then aircrack-ng will never work because a virtual machine will always see an ethernet card not the wireless card

351533
folder	directory
add folder in this example i will add the test folder in my home directory home virtual test

351550
ubuntu	linux
the same issue here although i got it running under ubuntu 12.04 lts with linux drivers from samsung

351552
ubuntu	linux
i recently decided to scrap my windows partition for ubuntu 13.04 when i found out steam is available for linux

351639
gentoo	ubuntu
is it possible to install the ubuntu sdk in gentoo

351639

351772
imagemagick	mogrify
imagemagick batch trim mogrify

351772
imagemagick	mogrify
while find allows for much greater control where output files will be placed it is also possible to do the same with imagemagick s mogrify

351777
versioning	upgrade
on linux you can choose to ignore the warnings and rely on your distro to bring you the latest clamav versioning at the next convenient apt-get upgrade

351791
ubuntu	opensuse
the command is there since ubuntu 15.04 and opensuse 13.1 yes opensuse has it 2 years ahead of ubuntu

351797

filesystems	ntfs
now using gparted i have partitioned an ntfs filesystems to install windows 7

351936
kate	kde
on the other hand if all you want is a simple text editor that offers qml syntax highlighting kde s kate is a good solution that i use

351943
switching	screens
the work-around to of switching to vt and back would be livable if it weren t for the fact that the contents of my screens are visible when it is locked up this way

351981
google-chrome	firefox
just enable smooth scrolling at about flags in google-chrome and use this plugin in firefox â

352028
folder	directory
no browser i am aware of not even internet explorer in windows saves entire site directory for you in the same manner as does microsoft word can save related items to a files folder

i ve run into a problem with ssh that has me completely stumped and our department it guy as well up until a few days ago i had no problems accessing my files on our departmental server university math department running scientific linux using ssh from my ubuntu box at home and i had no problems mounting my user directory at work as a network drive

352159
ubuntu	debian
there is always a danger to using programs downloaded from the internet from sources other than respected repositories -- it is the primary reason that debian and k ubuntu retain tight control over their software repositories

352173
apache	lighttpd
what is the equivalent of userdefined apache handlers in lighttpd

352188
installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade my 12.04 desktop installation to 12.10 and then to 13.04 hoping that my problems with vpn would disappear

352188
versioning	upgrade
finding nothing satisfying in the forums i decided to be a little more bold and upgrade - both to check out the new versioning and hopefully have vpn automatically be repaired

352193

we all know that in ubuntu sudo passwd will be auto saved for 15 minutes and expires after that

352289
sudoers	visudo

352296
ubuntu	linux
recently i installed ubuntu 13.04 x64 bit and i am new to linux

unlike vim or nano this launches emacs as a new gui application rather than taking over the current terminal window

352351
ubuntu	linux
on some linux distributions such as ubuntu moving the scroll wheel causes the window to move too far usually skipping some content

352360

352479
dpkg	apt
once downloaded and a basic install performed would i install additional packages needed by apt after revising etc apt sources.lst to point to where the big pile o files be or would i manually install each with dpkg or on the gripping hand do it in a way i do not yet recognize

ubuntu	linux
windows is much less flexible than ubuntu or any other linux distro and requires a restart for almost

352509
disk	ram
the memory gradually fills up and when ram features about 99 the computer freezes with high io wait on the hard disk

352526
ubuntu	debian
the gvfs and python problems are probably to do with using mixed debian and ubuntu repositories - but specifying a version might force apt to get it from the correct repo which might solve the problem

352551

i am not really literate with linux system so this might be normal and that probably since ubuntu is installed on drive d it doesn t need to show it but i got puzzled with the 25.1 free space.

352757
dpkg	apt
with ubuntu getting ported to more and more mobile devices the standard update mechanism through apt and dpkg is starting to show some limitations

352757
dpkg	apt
for those devices we re looking at doing image based updates basically generating new images on the server side with the usual tools debootstrap apt dpkg then generate deltas between those images and have the client pull the delta and apply it without ever actually dealing with packages

352757
dpkg	apt
we don t intend this to become the only way to update ubuntu machines and the use of apt dpkg will remain supported with most devices having some kind of switch to opt out of image based updates and re-enable apt

no software in ubuntu or debian proper that is free software ought to ask the user to accept any license on install

some others if i remember right are flashplugin-nonfree and sun-java6-jdk recently removed from debian and ubuntu due to license changes

352970
sudo	passwd
or setting my passwd in sudo config file and it doesn t ask me anymore for the passwd

352972
ubuntu	debian
a technical explanation of how this works is available from ubuntu and from debian which uses the same system

352973
sudo	passwd
you might need to put your login passwd because of the sudo command.

switching	screens
but when i switching to this session the screens gets 1280x1024 and for some reason the size of the session is very very wrong it is bigger than the screens resolution and i can t move or click most of the things so i have to restart all xorg

i think this problem affects many things in kms kernel mode switching not just switching between user sessions also games in full screens with different resolution and others things

kde	kubuntu	versioning	upgrade
with kubuntu 12.04 comes with kde 4.8 and i can upgrade it to the latest versioning which is 4.10

354694
kde	kubuntu
these days kubuntu is maintained by one of the organisations that develops kde and they can spend the resources integrating more recent versions

354694
versioning	upgrade
you could however at your own risk upgrade to a newer versioning of gnome shell though a ppa

if you are not too familiar with ubuntu and linux i suggest you to go with the first option

355232
folder	directory
delete the downloads and videos folder from your home directory if you have any content in them copy it on the new directory on the second hard drive first

355232
folder	directory
now copy any content in your user s downloads and videos folder to the new locations on the second harddrive and delete the directory in your home folder

355232
folder	directory
you can also change the location of the nautilus bookmarks like suggested by mitch that is definitely simpler but it wouldn t be a system wide change as various software will continue to use the default directory in the home folder

if you wish have new improvements and new software versioning you can upgrade

others would rather put off the upgrade and they stick with the long term support versioning

now i would like to install some stuff like the gnome kde or alternative desktops

356212
filesystems	btrfs
in the next versions of ubuntu when btrfs filesystems will be default apt-get is integrated with snapshots of btrfs so you can get exactly to the state before the package was installed

356217
ubuntu	linux
yes i am very new to linux and am using ubuntu 12.04 lts

356218
folder	directory
i m searching the internet for some days now but can t find info on where exactly the installer makes the file and folder directory structure and writes them on the disk

356227
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu live-cd uses a custom interface ubiquity but underneath that or directly if you use the alternate server cd is debian-installer d-i from the debian project on which ubuntu is based

356237
google-chrome	firefox
the following faq entry describes how to do this for google-chrome firefox uzbl

356238
filesystems	ntfs
also i ve found with windows 8 and haven t found the answer to this that when you change files on the ntfs partition with ubuntu windows often does not detect it and thinks there are filesystems errors

356333
versioning	upgrade
if you want to exclude a package from the upgrade process rather if you want to keep a specific versioning of a package regardless of whether an updated versioning is available then you need to pin the package

356340

356385
mouse	keyboard
what i heard is we cannot connect keyboard and mouse to nexus 4 via usb

356407

if you installing from cd with example versioning 10.04 then you might want to upgrade in steps i.e update to 11.04 then upgrade to 12.04

356409
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
would strongly like to avoid the reinstall of the server just want to add lxde or xfce don t want overhead of gnome or kde and a browser ff or chromium

356416
mouse	keyboard
you will need a bluetooth keyboard and mouse to actually control the desktop as the nexus 4 has no other ports

356423
sudo	passwd
whenever i use the sudo su command to work as root it does not ask my root passwd

356429
sudo	passwd
using sudo will never ask for the root passwd

356429
sudo	passwd
you can set the passwd for the root user but sudo su will never ask for it

356466
ubuntu	mint
considering mint 15 is based of ubuntu 13.04 this shouldn t be hard to perform on ubuntu

356545
kde	gnome
if you use unity or gnome you ll probably want baobab or the others if you use kde because the programs shortcuts will launch the corresponding desktop environment s file manager

356555
mouse	keyboard
i proceed to type in my password and as soon as i type my password in my mouse and keyboard freeze up and cannot be used as if they re not even plugged in

356564
debian	linux
in case of other linux distributions like debian you get a choice to download the file which includes more than just the basic tools for a pc to run

356582
bash	tcsh
finally i found a more interesting thing each time after i typing bash i type ps to see the change i found i get two more lines one is new bash pid another is new tcsh pid which means each time after i tried to use bash shell system automatically change my shell back to tcsh immediately

356604
ubuntu	debian

if you can t resolve the problem before tweaking fully upgrade your system to the latest versioning with sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

356753

if you feel that your system has been haltered or violated reinstall it do a backup first or try to use an open source antivirus solution some malware virus backdoor rootkit can infect linux

356785

debian	linux
if this boots linux install the debian package version of refind which will replace grub as your boot manager

356818
filesystems	ntfs
it is instead a filesystems problem and in particular a problem with ntfs which is a windows filesystems

356818
filesystems	ntfs
if windows can t fix it automatically or semi-automatically by using chkdsk or its gui front-ends you should ask on a windows forum because ntfs is not a linux-native filesystems

356818
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs
if this is a linux-only disk you should convert from ntfs to a linux-native filesystems such as ext4fs or xfs

356837
sudo	passwd
and again this will not simply ask for a root passwd --- it will spew a permission denied error and then you ll have to use sudo to read edit it

356839
switching	screens
i m trying to switching to xfce and i ve got it installed but the tutorials say to log out and select the desktop environment from the login screens

356845

etc php 5.6 fpm php.ini is for the php5-fpm processor which is a fastcgi-compatible wrapper for php processing such as to hand off from nginx to php5-fpm and runs as a standalone process on the system unlike the apache php plugin

357055
freebsd	debian
debian is one of the few probably the only one distributions that offer gnu on the freebsd kernel

357055

from this point of view linux is an alternative to hurd like kde is an alternative to gnome

357057
switching	screens
i cant find the option to switching os in the bios screens

357074
dpkg	apt
ubuntu uses apt under the hood for doing package management which provides and interface to dpkg for the actually installation updates and removal of packages

357074
ubuntu	debian
from debian as ubuntu as a debian derivative the flow is

357074
dpkg	apt

i did sudo chown on that folder once and i had to reinstall everyting because sudo wasn t owned by root etc

finally if all else fails it is possible to install ubuntu in bios csm legacy mode and then install an efi boot loader for linux after the fact

357196

basic idea is that the script can and will ask for sudo passwd several places but i don t want to print out the script will now ask for your sudo password. if it has already been entered which means it wont ask for the sudo passwd

357222
sudo	passwd
the -n non-interactive option prevents sudo from prompting the user for a passwd

357222
sudo	passwd
if a passwd is required for the command to run sudo will display an error message redirected to dev null and exit

however you may get more out of arch if you put some effort in for a more customized distribution

358806

windows will see shortcuts as a small link file whereas ubuntu linux has it s own method called symbolic links so it may treat windows links as a complete directory in itself.

358863
ubuntu	linux
since steam for linux is currently officially supporting ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 that the future steam os will be something that is very similar to ubuntu

358873
ubuntu	linux
therefore it is likely that most games ported to steam os will also be runnable on stock ubuntu although i imagine that post steam os valve is less likely to be interested in supporting other linux versions

the default way to install software on linux is using the package manager which in the case of ubuntu is apt-get or the software centre

359104

you usually don t need to install any driver after installing a linux distribution like ubuntu but you should always check with the application additional drivers if there is any thing that can be installed to improve your computer performance

359125

359441
ubuntu	linux
is it possible to run amd and nvidia graphics cards concurrently in a linux ubuntu 12.10 environment

359469
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and most distros of linux use significantly fewer resources so it will run a lot faster than vista but then again anything runs better than vista - ha

359469
ubuntu	linux
in my experience -- i have never ran into any issues with drivers on ubuntu or linux that wasn t solvable just a bit of searching and you can figure out a fix if its needed

359474
kde	kubuntu
xubuntu ubuntu with a less demanding graphical user interface might be perceptibly faster and its interface is less of a departure from windows than ubuntu unity ubuntu or kde kubuntu

359492
google-chrome	firefox
i want to use them in firefox or google-chrome

359495
google-chrome	firefox
you can drag links from firefox or google-chrome and drop them them on the desktop or any other folder where you have permissions to save files

359533

ubuntu s version management is not the same as debian s one it s development which then becomes gets merged into stable

360180

ubuntu debian

360180
ubuntu	debian
the fact that ubuntu is based on debian and the fact that ubuntu takes packages from debian s testing imply no relationship between them including package management and package compatibility

360182
ubuntu	debian
it is important to distinuish the difference between the debian and ubuntu package landing workflows here

360182
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu does have a rough equivalent of debian s unstable- testing flow

360185
ubuntu	debian
while ubuntu follows much of debian s package management guidelines and indeed many ubuntu packages come without modification from debian there is a different cycle

360185
ubuntu	debian
the packages in different ubuntu versions do not map directly to particular debian sections

360185
ubuntu	debian
one of the motivations for ubuntu was a desire to have more frequently releases than debian which necessarily involves a different structure

360185
ubuntu	debian
this is populated with a mixture of packages mostly from debian testing unstable along with a number of ubuntu specific ones

versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
ubuntu debian treats python and python3 and their associated libraries as different packages rather than one being an upgrade versioning of the other since there are fairly few libraries which have a common codebase executable in both python 2 and 3

360287

360308

since your installation is so old it would probably behoove you to just reinstall from scratch rather than perform the time-consuming upgrade one at a time

installation	upgrade
the only difference is that it is more important to let the actual installation finish before shutting down a partially installed distribution upgrade is much harder to recover from than a package upgrade

360611

in a package upgrade you could just uninstall the package and reinstall it but if you have 13.04 systems trying to boot with 13.10 files for example you could have a system that will not boot

boot from your upgrade versioning cd and reinstall

362696
ubuntu	linux
i m still wrapping my brain around the ubuntu nullify root user management philosophy and linux in general and i m wondering if i should replace my root user with a user called admin which basically has all the powers of the root when using sudo and create another user called app that will be the primary user for my app

362721
switching	screens
so i switched back to the default drivers and went a little further into debugging when i do ctrl + alt + f1 and login and try then ctrl + alt + f8 the screens stays black with a cursor and when i switching back ctrl + alt + f1 the contents of the log output are

filesystems	ntfs
or install ubuntu on my ntfs filesystems

362776
put	get
instead temporary file systems get mounted into these folders and consequently there is no need to put them anywhere else

362776
folder	directory	disk	ram
you can also think about mounting them as ram disk but beware that some applications might try to write a lot of data into these folder and lately i came across programs that rely on persisten directory structures in run and var run or mechanisms that tend to act irritated when writing data to tmp early in the boot process and finding themselfes unable to retrieve this data later after a ramfs has been mounted there

362828
ubuntu	debian
this one is debian ubuntu specific and lists all files installed by that package

362874
ubuntu	debian
bzr-svn and bzr-gtk were no longer maintained upstream nor are their packages in debian ubuntu

362874
ubuntu	debian
for that reason the packages have been removed in debian sid and that removal has trickled down to ubuntu 13.10

362878
mouse	keyboard
i fixed the qhd270 by supplying a custom edid my xorg.conf looks like so excluding keyboard and mouse

362882
versioning	upgrade
apt-get upgrade doesn t handle changing dependencies between versioning so if a package has changed dependencies it wont be upgrade it ll be held back

362882
versioning	upgrade
this means that a newer versioning of a package which has a new dependency not required in the old versioning will not be upgrade with this method unless the new dependency was already installed

363015
ubuntu	debian
the most likely reason is because debian is undergoing the process to add mariadb into their main repository and ubuntu maintainers don t want duplicated efforts

363060
versioning	upgrade
maybe you need to upgrade to the latest versioning of chrome os

363119

i need to import an mp3 or an ogg file and analyse it through an oscilloscope

363163

since the emphasis of linux os flavors is to use keyboards as much as possible instead of mouse i thought this functionality might tremendously help me in my ubuntu environment

363170
put	get
first you get the current state of all packages and put it into a file

363174
mouse	keyboard
even the mouse movement and keyboard input are affected by it hence i am unable to open virtual console to close the application

363180

you could install xbindkeys-config which provides a fancy gui sudo apt-get install xbindkeys-config run xbindkeys-config and put rhythmbox as the action hit get key press your key sequence save apply exit

363191
cinnamon	gnome
from what i can tell cinnamon 2.0 still uses some parts of gnome 3 that are different from the ones that unity expects so you can only have one or the other working until cinnamon totally removes all gnome references from it

363191
cinnamon	gnome
i prefer cinnamon over unity by far so installed xbuntu to be sure i don t start with rogue gnome parts installed and put cinnamon on it as my desktop to try it out

363688
tunnel	vpn
after establishing a vpn tunnel to my university i connect to a network share via shell script like this

363720
stdout	stderr
stderr is a separate outputstream that is why your wrong cron does not work since it writes to stderr a typical shell shows both stdout and stderr

363720
stdout	stderr
to append both stderr and stdout to a file use in stead of

363720
stdout	stderr
another way to write is is to redirect stderr usually stream 1 to where stdout usually stream 1 goes by appending 2 1 to your construct

363749
daemon	cron
after that restart the cron daemon

363764

363920
gentoo	ubuntu
it seems that it is possible i saw a few references not for ubuntu unfortunately for redhat and gentoo systems

363953
installation	upgrade
normally is recommended to use software included in the repositories with their respective package manager since the methods of installation upgrade and uninstallations are homogeneous and all of them follow it

363973
lvm	mdadm
the conventional thing to do is to use mdadm to create a raid array then use lvm to carve that up into logical volumes

363975
versioning	upgrade
but it s better you burn 13.10 versioning and upgrade from dvd

363987
installation	upgrade
i have very simple question after installation upgrade to 13.10

364012
switching	screens
screens rotation least important but no switching when the button is pressed

364209
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs-3g is a tools to configure ntfs filesystems

364222
mouse	keyboard
in windows exists a builtin command which shows the last wakeup reason for example the keyboard or mouse or via wol

364223
versioning	upgrade
easy solution would be to temporarly switch to old raring repositories install php 5.4 apache 2.2 etc and lock package versioning so it won t be upgrade anymore

364277
ubuntu	linux
support for ubuntu 12.04 effectively ended when the intelâ linux graphics installer version 1.0.1 was released 20 may 2013

364520
mouse	keyboard
this was tested on a couple different machines in ubuntu 13.10 saucy salamander with mx5500 revolution bluetooth mouse and keyboard combo

364549
sudo	passwd
if that doesn t work try sudo su enter your passwd and try editing the files that way

364550

364619
versioning	upgrade
i have ubuntu 12.04 lts 32 bits on my dell inspiron 1501 computer and i want to reinstall not upgrade the 64 bits versioning

364655
overwrite	preserve
be warned all your files will be overwrite so make sure you back up anything you want to keep unless you set up home on a separate partition during the install of 12.04 32bit in that case home will not be touched during the install you would have had to set this up manually it is not the default any programs that you installed will need to be reinstalled but see the lower part of my answer to see how to preserve any saved data game saves and config customizations etc as well as an easy way to save your documents but save any important files in a regular backup just in case

364655
versioning	upgrade
since you are upgrading from 32bit to 64bit and not to a newer versioning you should be able to just save you home folder to another drive and then move it back over without worrying about any conflicts with your program configs as sometimes happens with regular upgrade

364668
kde	gnome
the composekey sequences used by gnome to enter special characters are hard coded into the program so your modified settings will work with x programs and apparently kde programs but not with gtk programs

364691
wav	ogg	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
while we re on the subject what compression method would be best for large volumes of music in mp3 wav and ogg format

364878
printf	strstr
if you did some printf debugging you would see that strstr is returning null everytime so a match is never found

364904
google-chrome	firefox

365342
google-chrome	firefox
clear your browser cache manually .mozilla firefox cache or cache google-chrome default cache

365390
disk	ram
the data in tmpfs is stored in ram backed up by the swap space so it is likely the data had never been written to disk in the first place so there s basically nothing to recover

switching	screens
after starting the system i ve a black screens without any screens backlight then i have to switching to tty6 ctrl+alt+f6 login and restart the lightdm

365804
sudo	passwd
the issue occurs because you use pipe and input redirection in the same command and in this case sudo try to read your passwd from database.dump file

365820

there will some some increase as the kernel has to track the location of the paged memory between ram and secondary storage but i doubt it will be much as the kernel accesses the disk directly bypassing caching and file-system when paging in out of the swap file partition

13.04 will reach eol in january 2014 while 12.10 will reach eol in april 2014 therefore if a 12.10 user hasn t upgrade to 13.04 and subsequently to 13.10 there will be a 3 month period where a 12.10 user has a supported versioning of ubuntu but will be unable to upgrade

368068

an alternative could be for the 13.04 repo s to be left available for the 3 month interim period so that a 12.10 versioning could still be upgrade to 13.04 and subsequently onto 13.10 however that doesn t seem an optimal solution in that users may consider that it meant that support for 13.04 was being continued

try booting from a live disk with gparted you may have to install gparted within the livedisk instance depending on the flavor of linux or ubuntu you have burned and resizing the partition from there

369456
ubuntu	centos
all of the above exist for redhat through vendor repos and in almost all cases can be installed in centos but for the .deb based distributions like ubuntu you re usually out of luck or in rare cases you get something old that that will waste your time and will often break your system

369456
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos
epel repo extra packages for enterprise linux i ve found that the epel repo redhat centos is not perfect but far more complete and updated than ubuntu official repos not so for desktop stuff but for server stuff

ubuntu	linux
as i m really a pluralsight addict preferring video courses as a starting point for learning new stuff i wanted to ask if there are any decent video courses for linux generally or ubuntu focused ones

370143

if you are not familiar with the unix directory structure that s very important and i wouldn t try looking for ubuntu specific videos as any unix or linux system works mainly the same

370143
ubuntu	linux
now general linux ubuntu stuff

370225
ubuntu	linux
is the open source driver my best option or should i just look at a different distribution of linux since i can t get my hardware to work properly with ubuntu

370261
dpkg	apt
actually it cannot be done by simply install via apt or by running dpkg with the program install files

370263
ubuntu	linux
so i will have to assume that when the instructions say ubuntu desktop edition that means the same thing as linux distribution

370265
mp3	flac
i purchased a set of spoken word audio cd s that have mp3 and flac audio files

370270
ubuntu	linux
to be more exact linux distribution is a category and ubuntu desktop edition falls into that category.

mouse	keyboard
i just cannot use my mouse or touchpad at all and am having to navigate entirely with my keyboard

370276

just download lili linux live usb creator .it helps to make bootable usb of ubuntu.after crating bootable ubuntu usb boot the computer select usb asthe boot device from bios.when it boots from usb you will have two options either install or try ubuntu.if you don t want to install ubuntu you can select try ubuntu option.then you can use ubuntu from usb

376745
daemons	systemd
if you don t find a direct solution problems like this can be solved by creating a simple in this case daemons program that runs with elevated privileges and runs when the systemd starts

376745
daemons	systemd
you just have to be careful what input the daemons accepts so you don t open any security holes in your systemd

376745
daemons	systemd
for that reason alone it would be much better if your daemons were written in a language such as python where you can do whatever you want to an incoming string before the systemd gets any chance to interpret execute its contents

i guess the actual options shown may differ based on the model of the trackpad but you should see the automatically switch off touchpad if a mouse is plugged option

377630
ffmpeg	libav
if you re using anything older than ubuntu 15.04 then the so-called ffmpeg package from the repository refers to a fake version from the libav fork which does not have the functionality you need so you will have to download a static build of ffmpeg or follow a step-by-step guide to compile ffmpeg

adobe air is not supported in linux hence ubuntu anymore that package was not prepared for being multi-arch ready and that s why you get errors

after i restart and was very expecting that i could easily access the home directory of i was surprised that the files and folder are gone

378169

you don t need to create a root passwd you can use sudo

378191
put	get
you can put in the version of ubuntu and you rmbp to get the proper one

378251
ubuntu	linux
i will assume here that you have already installed thunderbird on your windows partition and on ubuntu gnu linux and that you have ran windows version at least once so that it sets up all the needed files

378251

now we go to the ubuntu gnu linux and the fun begins

378361
installation	upgrade
if you don t have another older initramfs kernel the only wayout will be to boot an installation medium chroot the 13.10 and run apt-get upgrade that way

378371
sudo	passwd
if you don t supply that passwd it won t work sudo or no sudo

378371
sudo	passwd
so if the linux root user has a .my.cnf configured with a passwd in it then yes sudo will help

378371
sudo	passwd
however if the mysql root user has a passwd and it s not configured in any .my.cnf s then sudo won t help

378371
sudo	passwd
you could add the mysql root user and passwd to your own user s .my.cnf and then you don t need sudo either but that s a security risk

378371
sudo	passwd
lastly you don t tell us which user is executing the script if it s in root s crontab for example then sudo will not be necessary although you may still need a .my.cnf to provide the passwd

378371
sudo	passwd
if your mysql root user has no passwd set then the only issue is writing the output in which case sudo is required if you don t run the script as root

378414
folder	directory
for example if you put it on your desktop you want to type cd desktop or if say you put it in your downloads folder in your home directory you want to type cd downloads

378703

once i did that the commands cat and tee started working for me to display and change brightness from terminal

this way anyone can execute sudo brightness_change without the need of a passwd

if refind boots and if it can launch both windows and linux try installing refind s debian package in ubuntu

378982
ubuntu	debian
this should not be necessary if you did not split off boot into its own partition. if that works you can install the debian version in ubuntu which should cause refind to take over as the default boot manager

379050
bash	subshell
due to this using a subshell typing bash inside a bash instance and looking at the output of env should give similar results than its parent

379082
ubuntu	linux
therefore your best choice is to find a working windows or linux computer and with that redownload the ubuntu iso file and apply that onto a usb flash drive 10 or less at most supermarkets and department stores in the anglosphere or a cd-r disc but in disc-at-a-time mode not using either packet writing or track-at-a-time mode

379084
wav	aiff
so assuming you were to rip a cd with an actual play time of exactly 74 minutes to an equivalently-raw format such as wav or aiff you would get close to those 746 mb of information

379097
xfce	gnome
i m using gnome 3.8 under 13.10 but other sessions might use unity or xfce

379179

379188

please note that you may experience some issues when attempting to do certain things in some files or folder from the root directory if you don t give them the proper permissions but that s worth another question
