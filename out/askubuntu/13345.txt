filesystems	fat
the following options apply to any filesystems that is being mounted but not every filesystems actually honors them - the sync option today has effect only for ext2 ext3 fat vfat and ufs

384810

remember that su uses the root passwd while sudo uses your account passwd

384810
sudoers	passwd
after adding an account passwd add your account to the sudoers group by

384823
sudo	passwd
this step tells sudo to execute shutdown.sh without requiring your passwd

384823
sudo	passwd
since you created shutdown.sh as root root should be the owner of the file it is very important that this is the case since we told sudo that running shutdown.sh does not require a passwd anyone who could edit shutdown.sh could put any command they wanted in there effectively gaining root privileges to your machine without needing your passwd

on the other hand maybe some of the packages you have installed that are not related to apache2 sources needs an specific versioning of apache holding back the upgrade

386574

apache packages are upgrade and has the same blob versioning whenever they are built but in they doesn t need to have the same versioning to work you can check using apt-cache depends package through is recommendable to have the same versioning

it is to my understanding that as it was many moons ago at universities and the like you can still use one central setup to do the processing video account file management and have terminals to access it that merely function as a screen keyboard and mouse which to provide input back to the main pc

389964

even tried ubuntu 13 mint but all seem to have the same issue..so akes me think i am doing something wrong each time.

389980
nautilus	fstab
so for example if you don t want a certain partition to appear in the devices subsection of nautilus left pane you should create a subdirectory for it under mnt write an entry for said partition in your etc fstab or do it through the disks utility and assign the newly created directory as its mount point

389980
nautilus	fstab
even better add the noauto mount option in fstab disks and then your partition won t appear in nautilus nor will it be mounted preventing accidental mess with its files

389980
nautilus	fstab
in your etc fstab and hence have your windows partition not showing up in nautilus but still accessible through the mount command if you ever need it

389980
nautilus	fstab
my windows partition dev sda3 mounted on mnt but not showing up in nautilus left pane it would be the same if it wasn t mounted since i have an entry for it in my fstab

390015
ubuntu	linux
first it seems that ubuntu linux does not display file types in the .abc format as windows does

390019
g++	gcc
you don t have to name your file with a particular suffix however the gcc g++ compilers use the suffix as a shortcut to decide how to process the files

390022
dpkg	apt
the most sane solution is that you build your own deb packages and install it using apt dpkg

390025
ubuntu	linux
you should be able to make a logical partition in the empty space you create that can hold a partition for ubuntu and linux swap

the linux security model user-level security used in ubuntu is vastly superior to that of windows

390231

basically using ubuntu linux puts you more ahead in the game than a windows user ex not allowing you to log-in to the gui as root by default but it can t save you from bad habits or bad system administration

i know you don t have to worry about fragmentation with linux due to ext2 3 and i was just wondering if there was anything other common maintenance tasks that would be pointless for ubuntu or linux in general

ubuntu like other linux systems has a group of scheduled maintenance tasks that run automatically that maintain the system logs temporary files and other tasks

390767

392654

not all ubuntu linux apps will work on the touchpad since the tablet has an arm-based processor and many ubuntu apps havenâ t yet been compiled for arm

you can also add a sip client like linphone or sflphone among others and use voip providers such as callcentric

now my concern is that each one of these sites is running about 10 000 cron jobs per day

393025
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
after that you can leave the new partition as unallocated or can format it but please note that windows will format it in ntfs or fat whereas what i have observed yet - though i may be wrong here ubuntu will require ext3 or ext4 filesystems

393049
dpkg	apt
to force the update you can open that and do check for updates which will effectively force apt and dpkg to pull new data from the repositories and the ppa and update available software

if you intend to replace windows though i strongly recommend converting your data disk from ntfs which it probably uses now to a linux-native filesystems

394026
filesystems	ntfs
anyhow although linux can read and write ntfs performance will suffer the disk will lack linux filesystems features you might need and linux lacks any sort of ntfs repair tools

dpkg	apt	ubuntu	debian
but if you really really want to call apt-get update or apt-get install etc automatically and you don t mind that your package will be wholly unacceptable in debian or ubuntu proper and your users are ok with the package acting that way then you could perhaps put something in etc cron.d which checks for any existing apt or dpkg locks and if none are held performs your additional installation steps and arranges for those steps not to be performed again

as a result you can tune the number of inodes to your current needs like one inode per 128 mbytes - this could minimize the overhead occupied by the inodes on a file system that is reserved for storing movies cd-rom iso images or other large files of several 100 mbytes each - but if you want to put your photo collection there you won t be able to get the partition only halfway filled since you d run out of inodes far before this point

alternatively you could just reinstall with the newest versioning of ubuntu from the cd by choosing erase ubuntu 12.04 and reinstall. this particular option is a lot easier than using do-release-upgrade because you can skip over any updates in between but definitely not quite as good as updating from the cd by choosing upgrade ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10 from the installation menu

if you wish to redirect both stdout and stderr you need to duplicate your stderr output to stdout by using the command

402908

the reason you get 14.04 as an upgrade option is because you are running an lts versioning at the moment and the next lts release is 14.04 and you are only having that possibility because you are using the -d flag development

402908

regarding wubi itself is not a problem and installation is not a problem reason behind the wubi to under perform is that when you had windows and started installing ubuntu from windows you will store it on ntfs drive which is windows filesystems where ubuntu has different type of filesystems so converting the filesystems form ntfs to ext4 filesystems takes processing power therefore mount.ntfs takes up that cpu power

effectively do the same thing as you did with the panel launchers add a new keyboard shortcut name it portrait and give it the command sh home username scripts portrait and do the equivalent for landscape

405840

i strongly recommend you make a keyboard shortcut for landscape - that way if your touch stops working you can at least get out of portrait and back to landscape successfully very useful

405860

you have chosen to upgrade to the development versioning by choosing option -d in sudo do-release-upgrade -d

ubuntu	linux
is this just the state of linux ubuntu unity at this time and i need to be prepared for these annoyances

406166
ethernet	wireless
i m setting up a headless server but i don t have ethernet access where i want to put it so i need it to automatically connect to my wifi network when it boots up it has a wireless card

406233
ubuntu	linux
im running ubuntu 13.10 i downloaded the kernel driver v0.20 and followed instructions from linux wacom sourceforge project and my ctl-480 is working flawlessly

406247
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
let s review how a user session starts in a x window environment gnome kde xfce etc.

406247
xfce	gnome
in gnome it s gnome-settings-daemon while in xfce it s xfsettingsd

406285
jobs	cron
i set a few cron jobs locally on my machine

406288
jobs	cron
on a default installation the cron jobs get logged to

406288
jobs	cron
to see just cron jobs in that logfile by running

406302
bluetooth	usb
i admit i am a little confused about how the atheros ar9462 works since the wifi seems to be on the pci bus while the bluetooth is on usb - at least that s what i ve gathered

406349
xfce	gnome
initially i had ubuntu installed but later i switched to xubuntu by installing the xfce desktop and removed the ubuntu-desktop but now i m confused about the release update because the updater says that there a new update ubuntu 13.10 saucy salamander and if i look in the sysinfo app it says that i have ubuntu 13.04 raring gnome 3.6.3 but i have xubuntu

406369
versioning	upgrade
either upgrade the versioning of qemu per the question i linked to or upgrade ubuntu

406395
ubuntu	debian
as far as rebuilding installing unity source - strongly advise doing as debian packages the same way as ubuntu does

406413
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for braiam

406443
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian uses the shadow-utils package since a worthwhile log file goes to 01 jan 1996

406443
ubuntu	debian
the header you will notice a message saying that there s another man page provided by the shadow-utils package which is the same as debian ubuntu uses

406443
ubuntu	centos
if you see the bottom of the man page if both ubuntu and centos you will notice this too

406444
jobs	cron
for example i have many cron jobs that connect to the server within the server

406463
filesystems	btrfs
in older filesystems this would just be corrupted but it s supposed to fix itself in btrfs

406463
filesystems	btrfs
i should also point out that this must be done on an offline filesystems so that btrfs doesn t see my write as intentional

406463
filesystems	btrfs
edit while the question and discussion talks a lot about btrfs i d like to know if there are filesystems independant methods of implementing this sort of corruption so that it can be compared across different raid types controllers etc

406501
filesystems	btrfs
in any case once you have installed or built btrfs-progs you should be able to use the tool btrfs-corrupt-block which is used by the btrfs developers to test the filesystems

406548
apache	nginx
if for some reason you must run this version of nginx the information available on enabling strong cipher suites with nginx or apache here will probably help

406602
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu - kde desktop environment

406631
folder	directory
update what i didn t realize at the time was that this upgrade created a new user directory in home folder

406631
folder	directory
so the the original directory for the user joe was sitting beside the new home directory folder for joseph

406632
clang	llvm
this will build llvm clang and cling

406632
ubuntu	debian
there should be a package maintainer that do this stuff for debian ubuntu i tip my hat off

406641
sudo	passwd
i m trying this sudo adduser --no-create-home --uid id 500 kids and after correctly entering passwd it says that value id is invalid for option uid

406655
post	get
third - please remember to post errors your get else we can only assume as to what the problem is

406664
ubuntu	linux
the problem i m having is when i select either windows 7 or ubuntu ubuntu obviously it takes me to a purple screen with two options ubuntu with linux and ubuntu with linux recovery console

406664
ubuntu	linux
when i select the first one i just get a purple screen when i select the second one i get a black screen with a ton of white command lines attempting to install so i m assuming drivers and whatever else recovery console is supposed to do i haven t really messed around with ubuntu or linux in general much at all.

406702
init.d	pid
a long trail of chowns and chmods later for different unicorn log pid files i m simply got a master failed to start check stderr log for details when i try to etc init.d unicorn but my unicorn.stderr.log file is blank

406711
filesystems	ntfs
but at first format all the partition using ntfs filesystems using windows bootable disk and the create partition and then install windows if you want then again plugin ubuntu bootable disk and install ubuntu

406712
move	drag
now right-click on the dev sda2 partition and click on resize move option.now drag the left arrow to the extreme left and then apply the changes.so that the unallocated space will come inside the extended partition.now it comes just below to the dev sda5

406731
filesystems	btrfs
disclaimer i have not tested and cannot guarantee that the fibmap ioctl 2 will work for a file in loopback device or btrfs filesystems but i would strongly expect it does

406749
kde	gnome
you might need to log out and back in to see the changes depending on the desktop you are using kde gnome ...

406776
ubuntu	linux
im trying to get my friend to try out elementary os luna based on ubuntu 12.04 but the problem at our school is that the wifi dosen t support linux only windows mac and android

406779
sudo	gnome-terminal
also if i run sudo -i login from gnome-terminal it pretty much works as expected

406795
sudoers	visudo
either way you should use visudo to edit etc sudoers and any files in etc sudoers.d

406795
sudoers	visudo
for etc sudoers sudo visudo

406795
sudoers	visudo
because of this mechanism if you want to use terminal one-liners instead of a text editor you should be able to use visudo in connection with sed or some mechanism similar to pipes like tee to edit sudoers files safely in a manner comparable to what you ve used in way 1 and way 2

406795
sudo	passwd
way 1 makes the user an administrator and confers the ability to administrators to run commands as root with sudo without being prompted for a passwd

406799
icmp	tcp
the default host discovery done with -sn consists of an icmp echo request tcp syn to port 443 tcp ack to port 80 and an icmp timestamp request by default

406860

i restarted but the ubuntu with linux 3.8.0-35-generic choice still gives me a black screen

406876

i also have a usb keyboard and mouse connected to the laptop

406886

have you tried unplugging the keyboard and mouse

406895
mouse	keyboard
for a while now my usb keyboard and mouse have stopped working in ubuntu 12.04 after some update

406895

i can ssh into my machine and lsusb -v and dmesg show that the mouse and keyboard are recognized however i get no response in the login screen

406911
ubuntu	debian
i don t know if ubuntu has this set up but should follow the debian standard

407002
ubuntu	linux
are there any zune alternatives available for ubuntu or any linux distro that seem reliable for a windows phone

407020
cpu	processors
like for example you have a process that uses 70 of only one core of cpu so you processors raises this core frequency and makes other cores lower theirs in order to stay in tdp - not to overheat

407054
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linux	debian	mint
i had these problems or at least one of them with every linux distro i used archbang manjaro crunchbang linux mint mate and cinnamon linux mint debian fuduntu ubuntu

407079
bonjour	avahi
if you aren t using a router switch between the computers ensure that avahi is installed on kubuntu and bonjour on the windows pc

407079
bonjour	avahi
using zeroconf aka avahi aka bonjour the hostnames of the computers would be computername.local

407080
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
installed linux mint 16 3 weeks ago but i find it difficult to find answers for this distro - nearly always google gives me ubuntu answers to try

407080

i ve just burnt a dvd with ubuntu 12.04.3 but my desktop after asking me what system i want to boot into just opens up in mint 16

407090

i am absolutely new to the linux platform since i just migrated to ubuntu 13.10 from windows8

407107
ati	nvidia
check you drivers nvidia or ati for example or play with the appearance settings

407127
ubuntu	linux
so the other partitions containing ubuntu linux installations can be considered as safe to delete

407143
switching	screens
the biggest change you ll see is a switching from verbose boot with text-mode boot messages to the more familiar graphical boot with an ubuntu logo on the screens

407145
ubuntu	linux
although there is a linux port of bless it s rather exotic and afaik it doesn t ship with ubuntu so you ll have to track it down and learn to use it in order to manage a linux-only efi-mode boot

407147
switching	screens
i had the same issue and wrote a script that works around it by detecting the screens state and automatically switching virtual terminals same as a manual ctrl+alt+f-key sequence at the right time

407147
cinnamon	gnome
i ve only written it for cinnamon but it should also work for gnome with minimal config

407196
fat	umount
fat is not designed for this use case which is why older android phones that supported mass storage mode would umount the sd card before making it available over usb

407199
folder	directory
this is because after you logged in as root by running sudo -i command the copy command cp searches for eclipse directory inside the root folder.but you actually extracted eclipse into the folder

407217
cpu	processors	disk	ram
what are the equivalents of these features in lubuntu where a user can see his system properties and hardware configuration like ram cpu processors hard disk capacity etc

put	get
i want to put the command into the background in one terminal and get it back to foreground after reopening the terminal

407252
sudo	passwd
normally when you type your passwd for sudo it won t appear don t consider it a keyboard problem

407256
post	get
also when you post a question like this without giving any useful information the probability that you get a quick reply decreases a lot

407276
folder	directory
if your .sh file is in user s downloads directory as i mentioned above then use cd command to navigate to the downloads folder

407320
folder	directory
i get to the screen which tells me to select the directory i wish to install in i then select next and it tells me the folder does not exist and asks me if i wish to create a new one

407333
filesystems	ntfs
i have also noticed some worrying changes in random files parts of some are put in different ones which makes me wonder if the whole issue is somehow connected with ntfs filesystems handling

407336
installation	upgrade
i attempted to upgrade to 13.10 and the installation hung

407336

apt-get is the default package manager for debian on which ubuntu is based

407421
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried various browsers like firefox google-chrome midori.

407452
folder	directory
first change the terminal so it is in the downloads directory so anything downloaded will end up in that folder

407466
ubuntu	linux
i am new in this linux world and i had a lot of headache to make ubuntu one work and i still can t make the right-click menu work all the time

407492
ubuntu	debian
it is very likely that the software that you will want will already have been version bumped to later releases depending on the version in debian at the time of the later release of ubuntu being made

407510
ftp	telnet
common services such as pop3 ftp sshd telnet r-services are

407535
ubuntu	debian
it is an entirely different scheme from ubuntu based on debian s .deb method

407536
ubuntu	debian
debian packages .deb are only to be used in debian-like distros like ubuntu

407557
ubuntu	linux
contacts in gnu linux ubuntu is un-usable because one can simply not syncronise it and dates has been discontinued for up-to-date releases

407557
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
but i guess the maintainers of gnu linux debian gnu linux ubuntu should finally think about ways offering working gui solutions for all these users that will switch from proprietary desktop to gnu linux

407625
ubuntu	linux
also when replying please don t assume i have any linux ubuntu knowledge because this is the first time i m using linux

407668
folder	directory
that matches the ssh directory in that folder and then lists the contents of that directory

407707
kde	kubuntu
i was using ubuntu and it was easy to change it from the appearance settings in unity but i couldn t find where i can change this in kde in kubuntu

folder	directory
what is shown is what folder make up the total of the home directory and hence all the contents of the home directory will add up to 100

407742
folder	directory
storage is on a separate partition with a symlinked directory in my home folder

407766
filesystems	btrfs
but to be 100 safe if this is your only data by the way if you have critical data you should never ever have only 1 copy of it always have a copy backup in a safe other location - blaming the creators of btrfs wouldnt justify against the persons own lack of responsibility of not having a backup - btrfs is not backup solution its a filesystems - nothing is a true backup solution besides having a copy of it else where - not even parity or mirrored drives a true backup is sitting somewhere underground in the alps while its active copy is in your office in texas

there also have been a few patches for the linux kernel a while back that should make it work out of the box without any extra drivers that would however require a more current version of ubuntu

as some of you probably already know the laptop is cutting edge with features such as a 3200 x 1800 screens resolution backlit screens and touchscreen and a laptop to tablet folding behavior which has created an endless number of issues for early adopters wishing to install ubuntu or other linux distros on it

temp	tmp
when you open a file through gedit linux implicitly create a temp file in the tmp directory with sign which indicate this is a temporary file actually whatever you make change in that file that dose not effect the physical file directly rather it effect the tmp file when you save the file then actually the tmp file replace the physical file

410741
filesystems	ntfs
this is because the ntfs filesystems is proprietary and microsoft didn t release the specifications of it so the guys who wrote the linux driver had to reverse-engineer the filesystems

ethernet	wireless
my ethernet cable was still working and i thought that going from 12.04 to 13.10 would get me the necessary drivers for the wireless

410782
google-chrome	firefox
i mean it is more simple and in my opinion better to make a proxy for those websites in firefox or google-chrome or whatever browser you use

410782
google-chrome	firefox
i think another solution would be to install an extension in google-chrome or firefox and configure the browser only to use the proxy for those specific websites

so in www directory there could be multiple folder

412580

for some or other reason i started using smb instead of ftp

dpkg	apt
the ones that were installed using apt dpkg or any package manager can be listed easily

412598

a lot of things went wrong when i upgraded from 13.04 to 13.10 so i installed 12.04 and used the same username password to maintain the files and folder in my home directory

mouse	keyboard
i use synergy so i can use one keyboard and mouse with two pc s one windows7 and one with ubuntu 13.10 it might not be what you need it for but a side effect is that the power options and the screensavers are synced so one will not fall asleep or activate screen saver unless the other does aswell

412794
xfce	gnome
it turns out that if gnome compatibility is turned on in xfce xfce4-session will unconditionally start gnome-keyring-daemon

412794

how to use sudo iwconfig without passwd source

how to update ubuntu linux mint or debian based kernel

417184
ubuntu	linux
these changes need to be incorporated into linux distributions like ubuntu or redhat - they need to incorporate all these changes into their own distributions of linux to make sure it all works correctly and those changes will show up in ubuntu base at the same time as other updates or included from other groups

so ubuntu base will hold the changes necessary to implement the updates coming from the wider linux world

this answer involving changes to synaptics trackpad configuration via synclient immediate but not persistent or xorg.conf.d 50-synaptics.conf persistent but only takes effect after restart are described in terms of gnome rather than kde but will work equally well in either environment

417483

by changing the trackpad vertscrolldelta you reverse the change there but not for actual mouse scroll wheels

so sudo passwd root tells the system to change the root passwd and to do it as though you were root

417824
sudo	passwd
this is why sudo asks you for your passwd

417824
sudo	passwd
a lot of attacks don t actually give the attacker your passwd so sudo still limits the damage that can be done by those attacks

loads of people have given in and accepted their fate you can try a different desktop environment like xfce kde lxde or you can install a different desktop environment that is more gnome2-like such as a gnome2 fork called mate desktop

418076
versioning	upgrade
it is the latest lts versioning so you will not have to upgrade it for many years

418082
ubuntu	linux
i m new on linux and i tried to start .net under ubuntu when i start debugging a sample from monodevelop asp.net app it gives the following error

418089
filesystems	ntfs
the fdisk output says that it is an ntfs filesystems

418089
filesystems	xfs
xfs_repair is for the xfs filesystems and fsck is for most of the linux native filesystems

418089
filesystems	ntfs
linux doesn t have proper tools to fix an ntfs filesystems since ntfs is not linux native but microsoft s proprietary filesystems

418186
ubuntu	linux
however because i want to learn about linux and ubuntu so i decided to install to ubuntu 13.10 in my laptop

418214
tunnel	vpn
i assume that vpn should use tunnel interface instead of ethernet1

418227
sudo	passwd
in the man pages it says the default should be to require a passwd when using sudo

418227
sudo	passwd
i thought by setting the ubuntu s account passwd in case it wasn t set that might start prompting me for a passwd when using sudo but when i used the passwd command it required me to enter the original passwd before allowing me to change it

418227
sudo	passwd
so even though it appeared to be set already it wasn t prompting me for a sudo pass and after i used sudo to override and change the ubuntu account passwd it still is not asking for a sudo pass

418237
jobs	cron
is there a way to detect error s in a cron jobs

another data point i also tried to install ubuntu 12.04 mint 16 and fedora 20 with similar success rate

418305
windows	winpe
i would recommend using dism for this which is best run from a free tool called winpe specifically version 4 which is built using wadk you can download that from the microsoft website for free but dism is also installed on windows 8 and 8.1 by default however if you can t boot windows that doesn t do you much good so i recommend building the winpe disc

418305
windows	winpe
create a winpe 4.0 iso using wadk for windows 8

418705
xfce	kde
i think it s more customizable than the applet features of many desktop environment like kde xfce to just name a few because you can change add the appearance layout functionality of something about it

418715

419213
pop-up	dialog
randomly when i am using my computer a dialog pop-up saying ubuntu 12.04 has found an error in your system

ubuntu	linux
i downloaded the linux version of the game quintet on a machine with ubuntu 13.10 but now i don t know how to start the program

419264

when i start my vpn on my ubuntu desktop computer which acts as a router the attached subnet loses internet connectivity but is still accessible lan

419327
tunnel	vpn
ideally i would like to know how to enable the attached subnet to re-gain internet access by routing through the vpn tunnel when the vpn is active

419327
tunnel	vpn
however when i start my vpn tunnel on this router internet connectivity is lost for the vms on the eth0 subnet yet remains for the router

so i tried with linux mint 13 mate 64bit and the installation succeeded even if neither ethernet nor wireless connection was working during install

419385
ethernet	wireless
after installing everything is fine except that i neither have ethernet nor wireless connection at all

to change group use sudo chgrp users home data

419562
public	protected
also with public key only integrity i.e someone did not change the public key must be protected

419627
stdout	stderr
however your problem is probably errors not being caught because you are asking for stdout and errors are being output to stderr

419627
stdout	stderr
the second is to direct stderr into stdout

419627
stdout	stderr
this tells the shell to move everything written to stderr to stdout instead

419647
folder	directory
change to the directory the .deb file is in - if was in downloads in the home folder

419647
folder	directory
or in the firefox directory in the downloads folder

419770
ubuntu	linux
i have a lenovo v570 laptop plenty of performance for linux but i cannot get ubuntu to install

419773
ubuntu	opensuse
you might try using the live cd to see if you can do what you want with the opensuse partition in ubuntu and if everything works like you want it to you can do a manual installation with the same cd to leave the opensuse partition intact

419773
ubuntu	opensuse
if it were me i would install ubuntu fresh and move files from opensuse over to ubuntu but that is only because i do not understand partitioning well enough

419811
ubuntu	debian
i ve tested it on ubuntu server 13.04 and debian 7 with h w zbox and also raspberry pi

419812

how do i make it that the linux clients ubuntu 12.04 can enter their password when accessing a limited access share instead of just getting an error message

419909
folder	directory
since the folder was created as root sudo only the root user has access to write to the folder although as a user you can read the contents of the directory

420013
filesystems	ntfs
actually windows uses a different filesystems format called ntfs which maintains a list of all files and their size

420014
put	get
edit as a workaround i put the oauth process directly into my application see this question get qt webkit html content in qml

i recently installed ubuntu 13.0 something in my pc where i upgrade my previous versioning 12.10

420162
ubuntu	debian
there are too many dependencies on debian system things for it to run on a derivate of debian which differs in crucial parts from debian like ubuntu

420162
ubuntu	debian
m23 even checks if the machine you plan to install it on is a debian machine and it won t start if it is on ubuntu

420187

420409
xfce	kde
i have tested xfce lxde with openbox and kde

420449
xfce	kde
it would be good if xfce would implement something like the folderview setting in kde whereby you can have the primary monitor on the right with its panel and desktop icons

420569
min	max	min	median	median	max
which is the correct command should i use to gather the correct system readings in which i can calculate the average value min value max value median value and deviation for the cpu usage memory usage open files count and open ports count as in the first and second picture

420608
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this should work in ubuntu 9.10 and later linux mint 8 and later and probably also for any distribution based on those versions of ubuntu that uses grub 2

420644

if you put it beneath the official ubuntu repositories you will just get old gthumb again

424917

you can surely share other folder on the system but you will find it much easier to simply create your share folder inside the home directory and right-click sharing options

if you really need to share a folder outside your home directory i suppose you could mount the folder to a folder within your home directory

sudo	passwd
when you type sudo into the terminal and it asks for your passwd your passwd is not visible when you type it

you would have to turn off the sudo timeout which allows basically anything to run as sudo without your permission which basically defeats the entire purpose of the sudo passwd

copy directory linux and file install_linux from it on to any usb pendrive and then via it copy them into your home directory in ubuntu

428129
mouse	keyboard
ok made it past that just had to unplug the external mouse and keyboard

428133
openssl	gnutls
software that uses them for cryptographic purposes or to use ssl tls sometimes supports using more than one of these libraries for example lynx the web browser is normally linked against openssl but supports gnutls too just not as good in order to appease the gnu people

428133
openssl	gnutls
openssl and gnutls both support using -style ca directories

428133
openssl	gnutls
openssl version 0.x and gnutls however use a different algorithm to calculate the aforementioned hash than openssl version 1.x uses

428133
ubuntu	debian
but for some reason debian ubuntu s ca-certificates package doesn t seem to do this. additionally some versions of gnutls did not support using the directory but only using a file etc ssl certs ca-certificates.crt which is also usually managed by the ca-certificates package s maintainer scripts but can deviate

428133
installation	upgrade
your curl from the upgrade installation most likely uses a different crypto library than the curl from the fresh installation

428133
openssl	gnutls
try openssl s_client -cafile etc ssl certs ca-certificates.crt -connect the-problem-site.com 443 in addition to openssl s_client -capath etc ssl certs -connect the-problem-site.com 443 to mimic the behaviour of older gnutls versions

428133
openssl	gnutls
gnutls would use the output from the second command if openssl 1.x is installed

428147
ubuntu	debian
the principle used by debian and ubuntu apt repositories instead works like this

428204

icmp	tcp	icmp	udp	udp	tcp
you can use traceroute for advanced network tracing you can choose between ipv4 and ipv6 protocols you can also choose between icmp tcp or udp data formats for a probe

429122

filesystems	ntfs
to do so i believe i would need to use ntfs as filesystems for that partition

429533
ubuntu	linux
maybe ubuntu is more comfortable faster access etc with ext4 or other linux filesystem and i would sacrificing performance

429627
ubuntu	linux
until that happens you can say that linux ubuntu can be used in embedded systems applications but usually linux and its distributions are general purpose operating systems

then make a copy of the entire dir containing the debian folder and the rest of the pre-compiled binaries and on that try to build binaries by using debuild -b -us -uc

to reproduce the .deb you need to unpack the binary archive unpack the debian dir within the extracted tigcc dir then run debuild -b -us -uc from within the debian folder

filesystems	btrfs
this means that this btrfs filesystems was created with new non-backwards-compatible features that the old precise kernel did not have when it was released

429827
filesystems	btrfs
or choose the ext4 filesystems instead of btrfs in the installer

429848
folder	directory
i know they are used to set up permissions but when i check permissions of files and folder inside the mounted directory they are not the same as i set using fmask and dmask

429855
filesystems	ntfs
using ntfs for home is a bad idea at best and impossible at worst because you must be able to use unix linux filesystems features in home that ntfs doesn t provide

429858
filesystems	fat
fmask and dmask are mount options for the fat filesystems based on fstab

comparing the directory structure with the configuration it means that all .htaccess files inside in the var www folder and its sub-directories excluding the var www uploads directory and its sub-directories can override all kinds of directives

429954
ubuntu	debian
instead of it i would like to install a minimal version of ubuntu or debian running with the kernel 3.13

430027
ubuntu	linux
on a last note do not forget please to choose your linux partition in the partition table and not a different partition before pressing next to begin installing ubuntu

430027
ubuntu	linux
usually bootloader is to be installed on the partition where you first installed windows but i think it would be better to choose to install the bootloader on your linux partition and after ubuntu installation is finished and you reboot computer you can use the boot repair rescue cd to automatically fix your boot problems so you be able to boot windows and ubuntu

add a line to the your_application.install file like your_wallpapers usr share to install the your_wallpapers folder into the directory usr share

stdout	stderr
in the answer above the command will still show errors because we have redirected stdout but not stderr plus a more serious issue it will still run the command

430767
dpkg	aptitude
in a very short simplified way dpkg is the engine behind apt-get and aptitude it s the guy leading with the actual installation of packages directly and of course is potentially harmful to your system if you mess up whilst apt-get really takes care of you trying to avoid any disturbance that dpkg may generate

google-chrome	firefox
unlike chromium or firefox google-chrome comes with its own up-to-date flash player currently version 12

ubuntu is certainly a good distribution to start with easily usable by newbies yet as powerful as any linux for advanced users

430930
versioning	upgrade
a non-lts versioning such as 13.10 will give you newer software yet it is only supported for 9 months so you will have to do an upgrade sometime mid-2014 at the latest

yes you can be able to create ntfs partitions on your external hdd.just shrink the size of fat filesystems and then create ntfs partitions from the free or unallocated space

it might be easier and safer to do change the permissions of a file using the sudo chmod and sudo chown commands in a terminal for example

431363

while watch will work perfectly on ubuntu you might want to avoid that if you want your unix-fu to be pure - on freebsd for example watch is a command to snoop on another tty line

the problem that i seem to be having is that while in arch linux running something like pacman -rs gnome will remove gnome and all of the dependencies installed with it and an pacman -qdt will allow me to make sure nothing is left over but in ubuntu apt-get remove gnome will only remove the meta package and then running apt-get autoremove returns nothing

vmware	virtualbox
i ve installed several flavors of ubuntu on virtual machines using both vmware and virtualbox and vincent s answer is absolutely correct

my suggestion is you must use ubuntu try xubuntu which uses the xfce desktop and is fully compatible with both vmware s unity mode and virtualbox s seamless mode

434046
xfce	gnome
another option which may be even better than using xfce is to use a more stable distribution that utilizes the older gnome 2 desktop

ubuntu	linux
it also has the advantage of being based on ubuntu so there would be no need to adjust to the idiosyncrasies of a new linux distro

if the problem was about the requirements i d install debian or build gentoo and make the lightest weight distro ever but i think it s not about how heavy the distro is it s about whether linux runs on mobile like laptops or not besides xubuntu is pretty much as lightweight as it gets especially when using the mini cd

according releases notes of amd catalystâ 13.12 proprietary linux x86 display driver the driver is supporting ubuntu 12.04.2 and 13.04 so i disable the ubuntu future builds leaving the security updates only

kde	gnome
for example you can specify a different desktop environment by adding an .xinitrc in your home directory so that one user uses gnome and another kde

434817

edit excuse me the only difference i have learned of is that sudo -i asks for the passwd of the user who invoked the command and su asks for root or some other target user s passwd

434819
config	ini
we find a bunch of config files similar to the ini format following the naming scheme of and configuring keys for the section

434827
sudo	passwd
sudo -i tries to become the user whose passwd you use it runs that user s login specific resources .profile etc and tries to run from the user s home directory

434893

kde	kubuntu
in kubuntu if you want to open the downloaded file s directory you would choose dolphin as it is the file manager for kde and therefore for kubuntu think windows explorer on windows

read instructions on how to use unetbootin in linux ubuntu they are located at the middle of this page

435393
sudo	passwd
even when i am logged in as a non-admin user when i enter sudo bash or sudo -s the system does not ask for any passwd

435393
sudo	passwd
in the command history i have not entered any passwd for sudo earlier sudo did not cache any user credentials which might cause it to not ask for my passwd again in this session.

435393
sudo	passwd
and how do i make sure that every sudo and su command requires a corresponding passwd

if that system is another linux with grub2 you can just boot into ubuntu and run this to reinstall ubuntu s grub into mbr of sda if that is your drive

435661
versioning	upgrade
3- and to upgrade new versioning of kernel you can use this link ppa repo

move	drag
shrink the logical partition dev sda6 by the amount you want 200 gb right click the partition select resize move and drag the slider to right creating the unallocated space to the left of sda6 and then move sda5 to right over the unallocated space so that the entire free space will lie to left of sda5

436124
folder	directory
this is very inconvenient and i m now constantly living in fear of dropping files and folder with strange permissions across my home directory

436137
ubuntu	linux
then choose the os in your case i am assuming you are using ubuntu if yes then you can choose linux then select your preferred language and click on submit

436144
dpkg	apt
if some installation left lock inside directories var lib apt lists var lib dpkg var cache apt archives you should use terminal

436155
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and have recently installed and have ubuntu 13.10 working

436167

instead i m stuck at a black screen with a frozen mouse cursor both my keyboard and my mouse are frozen also and i m unable to do anything apart from holding the power button and restart the laptop all over again

436178
ubuntu	linux
i have a device that has linux ubuntu os

436387
ubuntu	linux
you can download linux driver for ubuntu 64 bit from here

436387

if you are using ubuntu 32 bit you need the linux 32bit video drivers from nvidia

436408
sudo	passwd
yes i could only login using my sudo passwd i created when installing server

436460
dpkg	apt
apt-get will then allow the transaction to go through to apt which in turn interacts with dpkg

i have tried the latest ubuntu releases and even debian jessie - kernels 3. 10 11 12 13 - but when i use the nvidia drivers the screen goes completely dead and i have to power cycle

436612
cinnamon	gnome
i was able to increase the size of gnome panels that hold the window list item boxes by modifying the width property of the .window-list-item-box css class of cinnamon.css in the cinnamon desktop but now the label width has not expanded to fit this

436613
versioning	upgrade
the most reasonable and smart solution i have found it was look up at the var log apt history.log and browse the content for the latest upgrade to find the previous libraries versioning and manually reinstalling each one of them and removing the new ones prior

436626
cpu	processors
my processors intelâ coreâ i5-4300u cpu 1.90ghz ã 4

436634
ready	each
when brtfs will be ready for prime time we could have snapshots before each upgrade but for now your idea is the most viable one

436685
ubuntu	linux
the details of the algorithms are off topic here 1 since they are not in any way specific to linux let alone ubuntu

436697
ubuntu	linux
then insert your 13.10 or other version ubuntu or other linux flavour dvd

436710
ubuntu	centos
it is possible on ubuntu 32 bit ubuntu 64 bit suse red hat centos

436734
jobs	cron
i am trying to list all the cron jobs for all the users in my ubuntu system using the following command

436735
put	get
just replace with the uuid of the filesystem where you have put gummiboot or the efi-binary you want to boot use blkid or ls -l dev disk by-uuid to get the uuid

436735
filesystems	fat
for fat filesystems the uuid should look something similar to this 00000-0000

436735
filesystems	ntfs
alternatively you could add insmod ntfs or insmod ext2 if you have the binary on another filesystems like ntfs or ext 234 may require insmod part_msdos or insmod part_gpt if the filesystems is on a disk with a different partition table format

436797
ffmpeg	libav
you really don t need these codecs in your standard setup as the unstripped versions of gstreamer ffmpeg and libav offer great support for formats that became popular with p2p file sharing and online audio video publishing

436827
ubuntu	linux
my guess is that you re using ubuntu 64bit so you ll have to install the nvidia linux 64bit drivers

436827
ubuntu	linux
next you reboot computer and after reboot exit to console at login prompt ctrl+alt+f1 and login as user which is your username for ubuntu linux

on the other end of the spectrum lzo snappy and lz4 are light

436911
postgresql	mysql
remember that under var lib you will find the data files of mysql postgresql .

436929
typedef	struct
when i search for a phrase like typedef struct audiodev it doesn t find the phrase in the file and i m assuming this is because i need to express the space between the words with a certain symbol

436944
uninstall	upgrade
do i need to uninstall the gnome from 13.10 or will everything upgrade properly

436947
versioning	upgrade
this will downgrade the gnome packages to the versioning in the official ubuntu repository so that the distribution upgrade can proceed smoothly

436966
ubuntu	linux
i m new ubuntu and linux user

436966
g++	gcc
so i go to and check my gcc and g++ version which is 4.8.1

436974

my plan for this particular machine was to upgrade it to lubuntu 14.04 hopefully it will released as a lts versioning and then give this machine to a relative who needs something for basic tasks

437001
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
if it does there s a big chance of recognizing your disc as broken since you have a partition of filesystems other than ntfs fat and fat32

437004
mouse	keyboard
your mouse and keyboard should automatically work when you switch to ubuntu...mine does

437016
ubuntu	linux
bash linux no such file or directory ubuntu linux terminal

437027
uefi	multiboot
i would be glad if you experienced users can address my interdependent uefi nix multiboot installation questions and concerns which may also hopefully help us to better document the overall experience on these particular thinkpad systems

437027
uefi	multiboot
i have intended to keep my questions and setup generic so that its resolution may help millions of other uefi linux multiboot use case and especially uefi bricking prone thinkpad alike mobile computers

437056
versioning	upgrade
is it possible to run the cluster with mixed os versioning until i complete the full upgrade

437069

4 is apache nginx running on the host

437080
ubuntu	debian
1000 is the typical uid of the user who installed the system in debian and ubuntu

437106
skype	hangout
this means that you can now easily record skype meetings or private google+ hangout

437116
post	get
believe me i have tried many of the post and commands to get this file made and i am not even sure that setting the s video output will help

437127
ubuntu	mint
i was attempting to add a mint partition to my ubuntu 12.04 win7 box when the whole process went south on me

437127
ubuntu	mint
mint installed correctly but removed the ubuntu win options from my grub menu

437127
ubuntu	mint
what seems really weird is that my old ubuntu home folder is accessible if i boot with a mint or ubuntu livecd mounted under media however my home liav subdirectory has been ecrypted

437130
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
i upgrade the apache2 in my ubuntu 12.04 webserver to versioning 2.4 and the installation rewrote ports.conf and apache2.conf so i added the configuration items that were missing but now when i try to access what i get is the directory listing to var www

437135
ubuntu	linux
in any event fixes rapidly made their way into linux kernels so i doubt if you ll run into such problems with a modern version of ubuntu

437161
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux is flexible enough to handle multiple software raid setups in one box

437190
vmware	virtualbox
but when i create the same vm with oracle virtualbox or vmware it runs fine

437216
ati	nvidia
the only problem arrives in this method is the proprietary drivers that are needed for some hardware like broadcom synaptics ati nvidia are different for different machines

437237
sudo	passwd
sudo grep bin bash etc passwd | cut -d -f1

437237
sudo	passwd
sudo grep home etc passwd | cut -d -f1

437237
daemons	systemd
systemd programs and daemons do not have passwords usually

437244
rss	feed
i l like a list of all rss feed addresses that i have subscribed to

437249
versioning	upgrade
this can be seen reading informations provided in the lts enablement stack page especially looking at the ending upgrade policy diagram and looking at the versioning matrix section of the extended stable kernels page

437251
ubuntu	linux
i have a desktop running windows xp and i am seriously considering switching to linux ubuntu once support from ms ends in a few weeks

437324
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for amol

437340
apache	nginx
on the old server i use apache and on the new one we have nginx

437417

for switching from apache to nginx you will need to read the nginx documentation on enabling ssl support

437453
disk	ram
they seem to eat all my physical ram without even considering swapping some pages to disk

437467
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and linux in general uses the x11 cursor format which isn t supported by windows

437520
daemon	cron
this also manifests other oddities like my cron daemon not being able to run scripts in my home directory if i m not logged in

437570
folder	directory
since the wine programs and directory are set in your home folder when you first start wine after an update it updates copies the new wine files from the installed one to your directory so it s completely normal

437580
ubuntu	linux
i have uninstalled all of the programs that work on linux from my windows and then reinstalled them on my ubuntu giving me 222gb free on my windows partition and no free room on my ubuntu partition

437602

how can i upgrade to the latest ubuntu versioning from the present versioning 11.10 on my dell inspiron n5050 laptop without data loss

437617
ubuntu	linux
i ve just installed ubuntu server 12.04 - this is my first ever outing with linux

437667
ubuntu	linux
very new and inexperienced to ubuntu linux in general thank you for your help and patience

437694
filesystems	ntfs
the likely reason for ubuntu not seeing your additional hard disk is because it is not getting mounted and or because it has a filesystems of ntfs

437705
ubuntu	linux
because when you install windows 8 after installing ubuntu it will messed up linux grub something like bootloader for ubuntu and you will be in difficulty on going into your ubuntu os

437720
folder	directory
should i just install everything i am planning to backup within folder on my home - directory

437741
kate	nano
just open the following file with nano kate or whatever you like and add a # in front of line starting with mimetype

437771
ubuntu	linux
also if this is your first time with ubuntu or any linux distro please know that the extra .4 in the title can make all the difference when it comes to hardware driver compatibility

437778
gedit	nano
open your favourite text editor gedit nano etc. create a new file with the following content and save it to your desktop with a name having extension .desktop

437782
versioning	upgrade
if this versioning is for the channel you re on this can be done with a simple sudo apt-get upgrade

437786
stdout	stderr
firstly try running evolution from a terminal - you can look at what it logs to stderr and stdout for clues about what might be going wrong

437801
put	get
when i try to put on screen beside the other one and click on apply both screens turn black and i get logged out but both screens are still mirroring

437833
switching	screens
before switching off the screens the screens saver dims the screens a bit

437858
ubuntu	linux
so my advice is to built the smb share into ubuntu or linux and if not successful try to find the next issue inside windows

437895
ubuntu	linux
i select advance options for ubuntu and hit enter and then i select ubuntu with linux 3.8.0-35-generic recovery mode then press enter

437907
google-chrome	firefox
if you are a firefox user than the solution is flashgot...if you are a google-chrome user then there really isn t a solution for that yet

437920
short	base
base installation is short of 8gb if you never used it the disk usage makes sense

437921
umask	sudo
sudo auditctl -a auditctl exit always -s umask and look in var log kern.log

437937
ubuntu	debian
it works ok for me under debian wheezy i think it should work on ubuntu also

437948
folder	directory
however in my case i need to do chmod on the ramdisk folder before i can copy files in even if the ramdisk mount folder is in my home directory

437955
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
suggest you pick the desktop you like unity vs classic gnome vs kde vs xfce vs lxde and if there s a different app you find in one distro which you want in another a different file manager you can install it later

437955
ubuntu	linux
just like you can have both windows 7 as well as ubuntu on your machine you can also add multiple versions of linux and choose what you want to run at boot

437967
folder	directory
cp doesn t create directory on its own it throws and error saying that the destination is not a file or directory so if at all the files were copied to a destination that does not exist it would mean you have copied to the same folder with a new name

437975
ubuntu	linux
i rebooted my 12.10 linux ubuntu 3.2.0-60-generic #91-ubuntu smp wed feb 19 03 55 18 utc 2014 i686 i686 i386 gnu linux which has been running fine for many months after a thunderbird update and found the icons had suddenly changed and a few were missing on the login screen

438104
debian	linux
i m actually quad booting with debian and i d need a way to distinguish linux flavours

438149
chmod	sudoers	chown	chmod	chown	sudoers

438170
ubuntu	debian
debian and by extension ubuntu also has the default .profile source .bashrc

438181
put	get
get the ubuntu .iso file you wish to use and from there you can either burn it to a disk or my preferred method put it on a flash drive

438220
mouse	trackpad
the script above will toggle the trackpad depending on whether a mouse is connected

438226

so since the microsoft sculpt comfort mouse isn t registering mouse button presses for the super and swipe gestures but instead is registering keyboard key presses i used the xautomation and xbindkeys packages to listen for those key presses and send ctrl + alt + right left to switch between workspaces

i use shift + capslock to toggle the layout from the keyboard itself without having to use mouse cursor to select the required layout from the panel indicator

you may use ping6 or traceroute6 for quick check of latency and packets loss although you should remember that tcp and icmp traffic may be treated differently by your isp or intermediate hosts

440882
folder	directory
in addition to mounting your external drive as a folder within your profile directory you can also create a directory symlink to your folder on the d drive using mklink

also if you want user to input their own passwd you may try a trick with sudo say you ll do it for tester username

440892
sudoers	visudo
give users that should run this script sudo rights to execute this script you may limit their sudo rights to only this script to do so add something like this to etc sudoers file use visudo to edit this file

there are plenty of user accounts around the system less etc passwd but plenty of them can t be accessed without sudo access at the least

unless you re willing to chase down every permission on every user i would settle for trusting most of the ubuntu debian defaults and just follow decent security procedures where they count.

users in general can enjoy such benefits since it is expected to have more hfs+ filesystems in use as apple has announced macintoshes for ix86-64 besides the filesystems being already supported by powerpc system since the beginning

441257
windows	winpe
you will need a windows installation disc that matches your windows version eg windows 7 - home premium x86-64 or you will need to build a winpe disc which requires a functioning windows installation to build on or maybe you could use wine

441257
windows	winpe
bare minimum you can use winpe to re-add the bootloader and create an entry for you windows recovery partition

441257

when installing ubuntu on the newest computer hardware unless you install the latest linux kernerl available for ubuntu it is possible that the existing kernel is not fully optimized for your new hardware and will not always work well with the new hardware

since this question asks about tools like virtualbox i can confirm that unity runs on vmware 4.0 and beyond

441360

for a while i departed from ubuntu to use linux mint because i really don t like unity or gnome 3 s most recent interface

441360
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
unfortunately while i like the mate interface in linux mint mint itself lacks the level of community support that ubuntu has

441360
ubuntu	mint
can i get an interface that looks like what i have with mint but with the support and features of ubuntu

441362

imo dpkg won t able to get the debconf version.is that debconf package installed on your system

441364
xfce	gnome
many users don t realize that xfce is flexible enough to allow them to easily emulate the gnome classic look feel of the desktop interface unlike lxde for example by setting up the panels as in the old days

441364
xfce	gnome
and they can also run all individual gnome programs like nautilus evince etc. within xfce

it does not lower down your connection speed and in general it is just perfect it s client is free and i used it in both windows and linux ubuntu and it is just perfect

441538
ubuntu	debian
normally if you didn t install any packages manually with dpkg you have missing mirrors broken ppa s or a mix of different version repositories like debian s and ubuntu s or precise and saucy this could be fixed with a simple sudo apt-get -f install

441556
sudo	passwd
i removed the passwd from my account using the user accounts window and then on running sudo it prompted me for a passwd even when i didn t have one

441556

442250
wan	lan
do port fw on router from wan to lan for traffic on port 80

442257
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
you can identify windows partitions due to them having ntfs or older fat as a filesystems but do take care not deleting any directory that holds personal data if there is a 2nd windows partition ubuntu will mount such partitions so you can extract the data from it to your ubuntu

442438
bash	subshell
in a bash script inside a subshell it returns the process id of the script not the subshell

442472
ubuntu	linux
windows will not support pae so you will be limited to 4gb of accessible ram but many versions of the linux kernel available in distro repos have pae built in and by default the ubuntu 32bit kernel comes with pae out of the box so you will have access to all 8gb while using the linux install so you should not be worried about that

442488
versioning	upgrade
it may be larger if you have installed some application x where x is any application that was at versioning n in the saucy repository and is at versioning n+1 in the trusty repository then an upgrade will download that as well

442488
versioning	upgrade
those applications won t be upgrade to the newer versioning that will come with 14.04

442539
g++	gcc
my question is why is g++ using the stls from gcc 4.6

there is probably a simpler way to do this through parallels i m assuming they have some sort of clipboard sharing similar to virtualbox but you can easily copy files over ssh with scp

443071

then for every user that needs sudo access with a passwd

443071

and for every user that needs sudo access with no passwd

this walkthrough will demonstrate changing to the gnome ui for ubuntu as well as the kde plasma ui for ubuntu

443338

443623

443840
ati	nvidia
i m running on an asus ultrabook intel graphics so none of the nvidia ati solutions really help

443877

since ubuntu inherits from debian the apt repository system the description there of the repository format helps explain how it is set up

sudo is an alternative to giving people a root passwd in order to perform superuser duties

444271
sudo	passwd
if you have multiple users you can revoke one s superuser access just by removing their sudo permission without needing to change the root passwd and notify everyone of a new passwd

444271

and this can still be done without any root passwd because sudo gives superuser privileges to the su command

considering your needs arch linux or gentoo would be best for you

444869

on the desktop i enter the passwd every time but when i run sudo nmcli con up id myvpn over ssh it opens a gui dialog on the remote desktop asking for my passwd which seems like a strange design decision to me

spaces	linefeed
i ve changed the nice suggestion from souravc so it works perfect for me linefeed at the end removed double quotes added so there no problems with filenames with spaces

444905
google-chrome	firefox
at least firefox and google-chrome don t use openssl

444929

i will check the correctness of the same and see that the folder lo folder api is not discharged in the lib directory but in the include

445017
x86	64bit
software vendors usually refer to it as x86-64 now which is a less confusing term and is actually quite descriptive because it is a 64bit extension of the x86 instruction set

445017
ubuntu	linux
however the term amd64 continues to be used by various linux distributions like ubuntu

445023
x86	64bit
a less confusing name for the same instruction set is x86-64 reflecting the fact that it s 64bit extension to the original x86 instruction set

445496
ubuntu	debian
you can find the debian version on which your ubuntu version is based in the file etc debian_version

unfortunately due to the nature of the linux kernel you require a root or just user in the case of sudo passwd to install any programs or do anything possibly dangerous to the system

445532

and if you want sudo to work see here execute sudo without passwd

445535

now what we can do is open the file this just generated called backuplist.txt by running the command gedit backuplist.txt or nano backuplist.txt and this will tell us which directories we have backed up on our hard drive

445876
folder	directory
now if you open up the folder in your home directory called restorefolder you should see all the files from the folder you wanted to restore

445889

447333
ubuntu	linux
the core of the system is based on linux and ubuntu

447366
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
another point is that in the past kde applications would not have the same look and feel as gnome gtk+ applications - this is mostly untrue these days - kde qt emulation of gtk+2 xfce lxde is even better than gtk+3 gnome-shell unity

447367
fish	bash	fish	zsh	bash	zsh

mp4	h.264
in your case this would be video - h.264 + mp3 mp4 and then click on start

447967
debian	linux
since you re building opencv from sources try to follow the build process used by the debian packaging to ensure the compatibility with linux

it appeared at the turn of the century in the context of the boom of the dsl as the solution for tunnel packets over the dsl connection to the isp s ip network and from there to the rest of the internet

448294
bluetooth	usb
usb and bluetooth audio devices are individual sound cards which means that connecting a bluetooth headset doesn t work like connecting a headset via 3.5mm audio jack where jack sensing assumes that you want to play audio through the recently connected headset instead of the laptop speakers

448294
bluetooth	usb
therefore when adding new audio devices like bluetooth or usb headsets and speakers as well es new soundcards or audio interfaces you should check your configuration to make sure that the sound is played by the device you intend to use

448447
ubuntu	debian
new packages - the entire document is invaluable for both ubuntu and debian packagers

448450
google-chrome	firefox
answer 1 because packaged browsers google-chrome and firefox have embedded download managers but they are not very feature rich so you can try this uget download manager it is nice lightweight and well-supported in ubuntu

448470
put	get
depending on your needs installing the python package from pypi system wide and creating a python script to later put in usr bin is probably the best option to get a command line utility using ipaddr

tcpdump works on most unix-like operating systems linux solaris bsd os x hp-ux and aix among others

448505
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
note that if you re dual-booting and want to use a common windows linux area for user files it should not be mounted at home because the most common filesystems for this purpose fat and ntfs lack critical features that are needed in user home directories

448508
sudo	passwd
open terminal using ctrl + alt + t now type sudo -h gedit then type your passwd and press enter

448509

on other installs of ubuntu and ubuntu based distributions flavors of linux this has successfully and totally removed the program and all remnants of it

452555
vpn	lan
i believe you can solve this issue by making sure you have a dns server on your lan the one you use when you aren t connected to the vpn set up in etc resolv.conf as well as the dns server on the corporate network you want to use over the vpn

google-chrome	firefox
i tryed both from google-chrome and from firefox

452766
pull	push
all the other websites are working i can install packages using apt-get i can pull and push docs with git.

last night a window popped up on my versioning 13.10 desktop asking if i want to upgrade to 14.04

452896
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
for reference ubuntu ubuntu gnome and kubuntu generally are not suitable for older systems as unity ubuntu gnome ubuntu gnome and to a lesser extent kde kubuntu desktop environments take up more system resources

452924
ubuntu	linux
and when you are done you can select your newly formatted linux ext4 partition and press next to begin installing ubuntu

452950
filesystems	xfs
you can also force the trim on filesystems like ext4 xfs adding discard to the options of etc fstab entry

452953
ubuntu	linux
if you deleted all the partitions then ubuntu is gone and also take note that windows can t see linux filesystems so you can t tell from windows how much space is left on the linux partition

452957
g++	gcc
getting + installing gcc g++ 4.9 on ubuntu

452967
ubuntu	linux
you cannot install utorrent from the ubuntu repos as this programme doesn t work natively on linux

453011
nautilus	fstab
changing your mountpoint needs three actions changing the entry in etc fstab be careful creating the directory where it should be mounted if necessary but in your case it possibly exists already and you will probably want to change the partition label as well if necessary to have the right name appear in the devices overview in nautilus

453011
folder	directory
create if necessary in the same directory a folder named stuff but as said it probably exists already

453034
versioning	upgrade
i have just upgrade ubuntu to 14.04 and i was disappointed to see that the empathy versioning supplied with it 3.8.6 still suffers from the same problems that were introduced in ubuntu 12.10 where the contacts are huge and cannot be sorted by status.

453587
dpkg	apt
earlier in the process i also had experience of the apt command meeting what appears to be an open lock issue hence i explored unable to lock the administration directory var lib dpkg is another process using it

453596
versioning	upgrade
why is it then that update-manager with and without -d option will only offer to upgrade to versioning 13.10 from my ubuntu 12.10 system

453643
ubuntu	debian
i don t think you can get that on disc for ubuntu ubuntu has more software in the repositories then debian and the full debian is 10 dvds for i386 and another 10 for x86_64

453675
filesystems	ntfs
if this doesn t work or you weren t using the recommended filesystems or whatever you either need to specify the filesystems like sudo mount dev sda2 mnt -t ntfs or it gives an error which we need to know in order to help you

453677
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r username username

453698

i went to see the usr include directory and i only have these python-related folder 2.7 3.4 and 3.4m but no 3.3 or 3.3m

453765
switching	screens
in 13.10 the monitor would go into power save and then when the screens turned back on i was able to switching users

453765
switching	screens
is there a way to switching users from the new lock screens

453775
ubuntu	linux
that being said while ubuntu linux will let you name directories in this way i would highly recommend against it

453809
versioning	upgrade
the xubuntu-dev xfce-4.12 doesn t seem to contain any packages for ubuntu 14.04 yet see xubuntu-dev +archive xfce-4.12 so i m unsure whether you managed to actually upgrade xfce to the latest versioning

453842
versioning	upgrade
this is why lts users are never presented with an upgrade path until a few months after the new versioning is released

453845
sudo	chgrp

453860

it s linux ubuntu 14

453889
versioning	upgrade
sudo apt-mark hold hostapd will prevent hostapd to upgrade to the buggy versioning

453914
dpkg	apt
so yes if you have .deb file you should be using dpkg to install package but use apt whenever you have to install packages that are available in the repositories

453959
vim	emacs
it s worst when i am using whole-screen applications such as emacs vim or aptitude

453959
debian	linux

needed to upgrade hplip to versioning 3.14.4

453970

453972
filesystems	ntfs
fat32 and ntfs are both filesystems

453972
filesystems	btrfs
linux can use ext zfs reiserfs btrfs and a lot more including every filesystems windows can use where is the default usually ext3 or ext4

453974
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs - new technology filesystems

453974
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is newer filesystems by microsoft and replacement to fat32

454019
versioning	upgrade
my advice if you want to upgrade back up your info and install 14.04 via usb it will give you the choice of replacing completely the previous ubuntu 12.04 versioning

454030
x86	64bit
if i want full 64bit processor support and full memory support should i be using the amd64 or the intel x86

454031
x86	64bit
64bit x64 has many advantages over 32-bit x86

454033
titlebar	window
pressing alt + space will display the window submenu where you can redecorate - obviously this doesnt need a keybinding but its nice to have a toggle option to quickly turn the titlebar on off

ubuntu	linux
i have a older laptop but i love linux i downloaded and installed the newest release last month of ubuntu

i want to upgrade the ram to 2 x 2gb and install the 64 bit ubuntu versioning

454088
filesystems	fat
fat pointer size -- fat filesystems pointers come in 12- 16- and 32-bit sizes

454088
filesystems	fat
the fat size is fixed when the filesystems is created and it s not easily changed after the fact

454088
filesystems	fat
with windows 95 though microsoft introduced a way to store longer filenames on a fat filesystems in a backwards-compatible way

454106
administration	activation
if the activation hangs on download install dialogue you can install the driver using system - administration - synaptic package manager make sure you pick the latest driver version recommended by the additional drivers tool and all its dependencies

454187
versioning	upgrade
according to apport shouldn t even be running on my machine since it s not a beta versioning although i upgrade from 14.04 lts beta 2 to the release versioning

454201
sudo	passwd
as a workaround you could open terminal and write sudo apt-get install vlc and enter your passwd

454222
chown	passwd
i suggest you just set a passwd for the www-data user this is the user that runs apache2 set a passwd using passwd www-data and make www-data the owner of var www chown -r www-data www-data var www

454358
bluetooth	usb
i want the hear audio of both logitech mic and bluetooth devices also in the usb soundcard speaker

454365
versioning	upgrade
i told it to delete the previous versioning completely so it was technicaly a fresh install rather than an upgrade

454365
switching	screens
when i shut down ubuntu it hangs on the purple screens with the dots blinking but even after 10 minutes nothing happens so i have to switching it off

454383
versioning	upgrade
when i booted up after the upgrade the screen was flickering artifacts were everywhere the theme and icons looked like they came from a old versioning of gnome and the background appeared only on half of one of my monitors the rest was black and i couldn t even move my mouse on the black area

454407
daemons	systemd
this install and configure all components kerberos and the sssd-config for me sssd systemd security services daemons

454434
udp	tcp
i was able to add a tcp and a udp type of connection but it took a lot more to do than it would have if the import .ovpn saved file worked

454460
sudo	passwd
once gedit loads up with the file you ll need to enter the sudo passwd you need to add in right before the line exec etc init.d rc s

454476
sudo	passwd
click on disable in front of the shortcut created and press the keystrokes you want to be set for shutting down if they are already used you ll be warned if not you can use that keystore for shutting down without having to enter the passwd as you now do using sudo pm-poweroff

454548
versioning	upgrade	dpkg	apt
also note that since you compiled python3 from sources and haven t installed it through dpkg apt nor have you used a ppa it s not recognized or seen by the upgrade manager and dpkg -l will report it as the versioning you installed from the repos

454587
ubuntu	linux
i m n00b to ubuntu and linux at large

454643
sudoers	passwd
in sudoers file so shutdown command won t need a passwd to be executed

454688
folder	directory
i was recently in a predicament where i was inside a folder and i wanted to cd to a sub directory folder

454753
filesystems	ntfs
just format the other drive with ntfs filesystems

454753
filesystems	ntfs
ubuntu recognizes ntfs filesystems as well

if home is just part of in the same partition and i install ubuntu from cd to replace another distribution like mint can i do this without destroying the general data and the user settings in home

454879
sudo	passwd
and by then you wont use sudo any more and can use the root passwd for authentication

454886
debian	mint
if you install another distro fedora mint debian you will loose your data in home if it is not on a separate partition

454914
for-loop	loops
then you will get all the files that have that word in their name then you can create a script that loops on the output and each result get copied to the different folder you want the example for the for-loop you need and i think it will work with you after you do a script file is the following

454980
sudo	passwd
if you want to use the command sudo passwd you should tell the shell who s passwd it is that you want to change

454997
ubuntu	linux
is there none that exists and that actually works on ubuntu or linux

455010
ubuntu	mint
but technicolor works fine with mint win7 and andriod devices but not only with ubuntu

455028
versioning	upgrade
since you upgrade your vm i d suggest to update the guest additions with the vm package manager in order to get their up-to-date versioning

455035
bluetooth	usb
to hear the live audio of logitech mic and bluetooth device from usb soundcard speaker we have to load the module-loopback related to the logitech mic and bluetooth device

455035
bluetooth	usb
so we can hear the live audio of logitech mic and bluetooth from usb souncard speaker

next you can download the nvidia-settings-legacy-173xx_173.14.39-1 bpo70+1_i386.deb package from the link provided above and extract the files in a temporary folder named nvidia in your user home directory

455174
folder	directory
i am talking of course about files contained inside the temporary nvidia folder from your user home directory which are located in usr lib nvidia legacy-173xx

versioning	upgrade
your question is about when to upgrade and understanding ubuntu versioning releases

456239
versioning	upgrade
considering new versioning of ubuntu are released every six months youâ ll have three months after a new versioning is released to upgrade to it or you wonâ t receive security patches anymore

456239
versioning	upgrade
youâ ll probably want to upgrade to every lts versioning â new lts versioning are released every two years

456239
versioning	upgrade
when you use the lts versioning you can upgrade every two years or even hold on for five years

instead you will need to upgrade to the versioning in between in turn

456758

the available upgrade paths between ubuntu versioning can be described like this

456758
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade from any versioning to the immediate next versioning

456758
versioning	upgrade
if you have an lts versioning you can also elect to upgrade to the next lts versioning skipping the versioning in between the lts versioning

456758
versioning	upgrade
if you are on a non-lts versioning such as 12.10 your only upgrade path is to the immediate next versioning

456758

to reach subsequent versioning you must do multiple upgrade

457831
ubuntu	linux
you can burn a dvd with the ubuntu you like to have 13.04 i guess and make a manual partitioning and you format and mount root to 13.04 you mount but don t format the home partition and you can format and mount the windows partition to xt4 and some for swap and also use that personal linux space

457866

however looking at the first two lines of your question both the program and the modules folder are in the same directory which makes setting the path unnecessary

some ancient forum posts here and there suggested symlinking the firefox plugins directory over to google-chrome s installation directory which seems pretty goofy and which doesn t work now anyway

457978
google-chrome	firefox
the pulseaudio manager tool in its list of clients shows firefox and various other things and also google-chrome input but no google-chrome output

457985

google-chrome has the advantage that includes the pepperflash plugin which is ppapi so maybe you should use that or use firefox in the meanwhile

unix	bsd	ubuntu	linux
linux and desktop distributions of ubuntu in particular are more resistant to viruses due to the fact that the market share though growing is significantly smaller and the structure of unix and unix derived oses linux bsd macos etc make it harder to infect and gain system level access where they can do the most damage and propagate fastest

it uses sudo so you will need to type your passwd after it downloads

459839

one is likely a small disk for storing working memory if your ram is full

460709
ubuntu	debian
please make sure you have all your data backed up and that you have space on your disk to install ubuntu if you re not going to overwrite debian

460716
tunnel	lan
i know that using it via ssh is the usual configuration but i don t want to use it through an ssh tunnel in this case as i am confident that my lan is secure and not even my ssh terminal is visible outside of my lan

460717
folder	directory
when trying to connect via ssh with nautilus ubuntu 14.04 if you do not specify the folder to which you want to access does not show me any directory

460725

i am new to ubuntu and linux in general as a home installer user

while there may be a little fragmentation in a linux system using ext4 like ubuntu there is no need to worry about it

460760
ethernet	wireless
i m not seeing any wireless connection choice under network manager but it connects just fine on ethernet

460770
folder	directory
i tried using the disk usage analyser aka baobab but since my home directory is encrypted i can t analyse which folder are using all of the data since the home directory is just a virtual representation of my encrypted data and is more of a phantom view so baobab just keeps scanning endlessly without counting any data when i ask it to just scan my home directory

the answer is based on experience with installing other debian packages under ubuntu nothing more

460900
ubuntu	linux
so i set up a server on my home network using samba i use a linux computer running ubuntu 12.04 lts

460973
gedit	nano
you should use gedit instead of nano gedit is the default text editor for ubuntu and this solution will only work if you use dual boot and are trying to save execute your code on the ntfs partition

460976
ubuntu	debian
unless your game is ubuntu specific i d submit my new package to debian first

460976

packages in debian unstable are automatically synced in ubuntu before debianimportfreeze

as for the blender maya issue i cannot fix it because i m not an expert for those programs

460996

the hard disk has a new fs linux s ext4 and the data has probably been overwritten by ubuntu s data

proftpd	vsftpd
i tried both with vsftpd as proftpd and none of them work

461315
sudo	passwd
unless you have sudo rules allowing you to run commands with no passwd it will always need to prompt for your passwd either from your shell s terminal or using an askpass program if so configured

461315
sudo	passwd
ensure you have a tty so sudo can securely prompt for your passwd on the server

461315
sudo	passwd
tell sudo to prompt for your passwd using an askpass program with the -a option on sudo not to be confused with the -a option for ssh

461315
sudo	passwd
note that since you are piping your shell script to the standard input stream of the ssh connection sudo will be unable to securely prompt for a passwd

461319
versioning	upgrade
your options are to upgrade probably best will not hurt anything ignore the upgrade will not do any harm or if you wish to micromanage what you have installed build your own custom versioning of ubuntu or another distro such as arch

461334
ubuntu	linux
while i have a basic grasp of scripting for git linux and scripting for windows ubuntu scripting isn t super clear for me

461344

you can skip lvm entirely since it s not in your comfort zone and there are always easy ways to deal with outgrowing storage on a linux system such as ubuntu

i m attempting to compile the mysql foreign data wrapper for postgresql 9.1+ on ubuntu 12.04 lts and having a fair bit of trouble getting it to work

i am trying to copy a mysql data directory folder to my second hard drive in such a way that i can then use it as the database directory for the mysql server username mysql with webmin

461414

i also tried on debian mint as well

461417
ethernet	wireless
i decided to install kubuntu 14.04 on my laptop hp pavilion g6-2330sf and the installation worked perfectly but even if my ethernet connection works the wireless network refuses to be enabled

461420

you could ofc replace firefox in the bash script with chromium or google-chrome or any other browser to make them launch instead

461478

it started after i switched to using auto ethernet in order to download things faster and when i tried switching back to wireless i found that the hardware switch for the wireless has been disabled and i can no longer connect wireless

461493
vim	gedit
this information is only visible when using text editors such as vim and arguably gedit

461500
mouse	keyboard
i can t think of any way someone could do a very high speed brute force attack with just keyboard and mouse access

461512
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu gnu linux with linux 3.8.0-26-generic recovery mode

461547
disk	ram
but i think cold boot attack is the method that hackers take data from ram when the power is off and the encrypted disk don t offer more security

461571
folder	directory
with this you still have to get all the apps and packages you need but some of your customization will still stand because for example firefox and thunderbird . hidden folder exists in your home directory

461585
mouse	keyboard
once that s taken care of then you just write a very small keyboard macro in python which uses xdotool to issue the mouse event and then sleep for one second divided by the number of events you want per second

upgrade leads to running the latest ubuntu versioning

461605
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	linux
if you upgrade from linux kernel versioning 3.12.x to 3.13.x you have technically upgrade the operating system but you haven t upgrade your distribution which might still be ubuntu 13.10 and not ubuntu 14.04

461631
sudo	passwd
though in the black screen if i press ctrl+alt+f2 - type my username - type my passwd - type sudo reboot - type passwd

the video does not respond to the keyboard and mouse

461724
mouse	keyboard
i even switched to ps 2 keyboard and ps 2 mouse to eliminate usb initialization problems but the problem happens regardless of whether the input devices are usb or ps 2

461726
put	get
if it s the latter then you d better put the hard drive in another machine get ubuntu installed on it then put the hard drive back in your laptop

461737
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu uses nbd but debian still uses nfs stating it is more stable and reliable

461737
ubuntu	debian
so my advice to you is either 1 use ltsp with debian with default nfs or 2 use ltsp on ubuntu but switch nbd to nfs

461768

what is the difference between ubuntu with linux 3.11.0-19-generic

461819
mouse	keyboard
it does not act as an on-screen keyboard to enter keystrokes via the mouse it only shows you info about the keyboard layout

461848
disk	ram
it may not be actual physically used ram but rather disk cache

461848
disk	ram
disk cache is where any frequently used files are stored in ram so they can easily be retrieved again quickly without needing to wait on the disk which is way slower than waiting for ram

461848
disk	ram
in this example i am physically using 720mb of ram of my 13gb but with disk cache this amounts to 1221mb total

461848
disk	ram
after a while my ram usage will increase because the disk cache will increase but the actual app ram usage may not

on some webpages the window will resize so that the launcher is visible this seem to be related to specific webpages ighome.com is the only one i ve found so far switching to any other open tabs will restore the window and hide the launcher again.... i use firefox so this may be different for google-chrome or other browsers

you may still be able to still compile it but most likely you will find that the patches which the ubuntu wiki suggests are for kernel 2.6.20 - over 7 years old now - have suffered bitrot and nobody cares because there are only a few people in the world running linux on systems that are known to have bad memory

462448
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am using audacity v2.0.3 on linux mint 16 which is a derivative of ubuntu 13.10 and was having the same problem

462471
versioning	upgrade
what likely happened in this case confirmed by our discussion in the comments is that libssl1.0.0 was upgrade to a ppa versioning that is newer than any versioning available from the ubuntu repositories

462471
uninstall	downgrade
if you don t specify all packages you want to downgrade apt will prefer to uninstall rather than downgrade

462477
ubuntu	debian
presumably the log you quote describes changes made in debian s apt package to make it more similar to changes implemented downstream by the ubuntu developers

462487
google-chrome	firefox
warning the solution posted here will work to satisfy the issue posted however will render the ctrl + t shortcutl useless for applications such as firefox nautilus which use it to open tabs similar to google-chrome even if no google-chrome windows are open

on int s you don t need to specify the length of the variable but on chars you do

469855
google-chrome	firefox

469999
tesseract	leptonica
as far as i understand the page you linked to states the minimum version of leptonica required in order to build tesseract

469999
tesseract	leptonica
so if you are on 14.04 and if the api of leptonica did not change meanwhile for most projects this is only done at major revisions and the difference of leptonica between ubuntu 12.04 and 14.40 was just a minor revision also older versions of tesseract should compile with the leptonica available on ubuntu 14.04

469999
tesseract	leptonica
when talking about prerequisites the package for leptonica which you ll probably need to install in order to be able to build tesseract is called libleptonica-dev

470007
filesystems	hfs+
there are permissions problem in the first place and also solving these ubuntu does not support writing to hfs+ filesystems and macosx does not support writing on ext4 filesystems

when i open emacs with a window that is without option -nw kill-yank still doesn t work with the keyboard shortcuts as above but it does work with the mouse

but do not remove the older versioning if you want to use a new one because as i said if you install a new one then ubuntu will upgrade your old versioning simply

google-chrome	firefox
i use both firefox and google-chrome for numerous tasks google-chrome being my primary browser and i ve checked my system unity default theme ambiance

470093
chown	chmod
the chown command changes the owner of the files the chmod fits better if you only want to change permissions

470100
filesystems	fat
so i took it down to the differing factors - and a big one was that the usb stick i m reading off of is set to fat filesystems instead of ext4 which i thought maybe could be an issue if the developers of the laptop didn t really take much care to support linux operating systems and also its a usb stick

bash	zsh
i had bash as my default shell even though i was only using zsh

470725
bash	zsh
when you then would invoke zsh manually it would as a child process of your bash shell inherit those environment variables

470725
bash	zsh
it would behoove you to investigate precisely which environment variables are being set when your initial bash session is started before switching to zsh

470725

then exit from that bash session and verify that java_home is correctly set in zsh by issuing the same echo command again

most likely it will negate the bits you are passing in the octal negation of 777 which is 111111111 in binary which is important which is not actually possible to represent since chmod is using a 9 bit set for file permissions 1 bit per permission for read write execute owner group user which is an unsigned number cannot be negative

i ve recently just installed ubuntu 14.04 and i m still very new to linux ubuntu

471950
ubuntu	linux
in most gnu linux distros including ubuntu programs execute as a standard user by default even if you are the administrator on your system

471961
put	get
if you put the installed applications on the ssd you ll get a more stable operating system and better performance

471973
folder	directory
nautilus and nemo both hang after opening after a few minutes it loads the home directory but when changing the folder to other it hangs again for a few minutes

472014
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has stopped working and firefox is slow sometimes so slow that it does not work at all

472014
google-chrome	firefox
the computer dual-boots with windows 7 so i have tried google-chrome and firefox on windows and they work fine

472054
ubuntu	linux
not 100 that was needed i am still getting to grips with linux ubuntu 12.04 and i read somewhere that its not wise to use original account day to day which i initially did.

472055
folder	directory
this is possible however if you were to install programs that use .local or .cache in your home directory will overwrite the folder and files on the other system

472055
kde	gnome	folder	directory
even without installing your own programs packages kde and gnome will store folder in your home directory referencing settings in kde and gnome

472057
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd

472125
submit	submission
i accidentally started submission a click application when i meant to submit a desktop application is there a good way to delete it in the draft state

472127
ecdsa	rsa	rsa	dsa
it is possible that the same happened to you - your server was using rsa dsa keys no ecdsa key was declared in the config even if one did exist on the disk but when you upgraded the server config was changed and now ssh is complaining

472149
sudo	passwd
so you have to make sudo to not ask for a passwd

472149
sudo	passwd
execute sudo without passwd

472149
sudo	passwd
how to run an application using sudo without a passwd

472155
sudo	passwd
gtk nautilus and sudo stopped working su does not accept my known administrator passwd

472177
sudo	passwd
sudo rather than the root passwd

472181
folder	directory
so foldername is the folder i m creating and the directory that they tell me to place it in is

472182
folder	directory
it will displays all the hidden files and folder present inside your home directory

472184
ubuntu	linux
being only moderately experienced with linux ubuntu i feel that this should be possible as long as i load the drivers and software keyboard into the initrd ramdrive

472195
folder	directory
to make that folder all you have to do is type this below it will create a hidden folder in your home directory

472204
kde	kubuntu
i just installed kubuntu 14.04 kde on my laptop and installed a pdf studio 8 pro which i purchased from qoppa.com

472204
kde	kubuntu
on kubuntu 14.04 kde the pdf studio is not located in the office or any where else that i could find

472204
folder	directory
it is located in home directory and in order to open a pdf file with pdfstudio 8 i have to open the home directory open the pdfstudio 8 folder choose the pdfstudio 8 desktop open it first and then choose the file that i want to open

472222
pwd	chdir
the question why i ask this is because in a web server i use puma pwd command now using the chdir stanza does not point to the symlink directory

472223
ubuntu	debian
note that postgresql config in etc is specific to ubuntu and debian which use pg_wrapper

472226
ubuntu	linux
i had downloaded the generic linux 64 bit mysql 5.6.17 tar archive from and installed on my 64 bit ubuntu 14.04 following the instructions at

472227
disk	ram
if pages are swapped out of memory when the total compressed pages in ram exceeds a certain size the least recently used lru compressed page is written to the disk as it is unlikely to be required soon

472227
disk	ram
benefits very efficient use ram and disk based swap

472227
disk	ram
minimizes disk i o by both reducing the number of writes and reads required data is compressed and held in ram and by reducing the bandwidth of these i o operaions as the data is in a compressed form

472227
put	get
transcendent memory provides a ram-like memory that can only be accessed a page at a time by using put and get calls

472252
ubuntu	linux
i am fairly new to ubuntu and linux

472297
bluetooth	usb
so that i can get rid of the usb cable and use bluetooth instead

472302
ubuntu	linux
i am currently using ubuntu 14.04 lts 64-bit version in my pc and i have installed wine software to run some .exe format files of windows in linux but it doesnt happen whenever i right click on the available file and select the option to install open it through wine it says access denied as shown in this image

472303
chown	sudo
shouldn t that be sudo chown -r agha agha .wine -r

472359
ubuntu	linux
on my linux laptop running ubuntu 12.04 i can download photos from my camera with no problems

472362
kde	kubuntu
i want to resize the current kubuntu partition but kde partition manager apparently only offers the resize-and-move option

472380
folder	directory
from what i see pear is a directory in the php folder

472385
mouse	keyboard
the symptoms are i run a live cd and boot into a desktop without access to my keyboard or mouse

472385
mouse	keyboard
i have tried that which allowes me access to mouse keyboard

472385
mouse	keyboard
but on reboot i am back to a desktop which but no keyboard or mouse

472405
ubuntu	linux
i think the question itself is somewhat invalid since you can compile any custom linux kernel and use it with ubuntu

472420
versioning	upgrade
however if you still want to upgrade the versioning you can clone the latest versioning of docker.io from github and recompile

472432
versioning	upgrade
one way to upgrade to the latest versioning without installing from source is to use the instructions here provided by digital ocean

472465
chown	sudo
then finally sudo chown -r bad_account bad_account home bad_account

472481
ubuntu	linux
i just downloaded the ubuntu 14.04 version of linux and i feel really dumb

472552
mouse	keyboard
if ubuntu appears to be frozen please refer to how to reboot cleanly even when the keyboard mouse are frozen

472572
mouse	keyboard
install xdotool it is in the repositories with which you can simulate keyboard and mouse actions

472587
put	get
when i put my usb in my laptop i get the following error on the usb is some data what i must have is there a way to get this

472614
sudo	passwd
to copy stuff from the root drive you will likely need to use a root session for your file manager just open a terminal window and type in sudo nautilus without the quotes then your passwd just be careful as that makes everything rw including system files

472619
ubuntu	linux
i m currently dual booting ubuntu and windows 8 on a uefi laptop but i d like to try a new linux distro won t specify which to avoid being yelled at over my choice or something and i need my windows 8 installation and i don t have a ton of disk space so i ve decided to just write over my ubuntu installation

472630
kde	kubuntu
is this solution okay for kde kubuntu

472650
vmware	esx
again this is on a vmware esx system so booting from a cd is going to be quite complicated

472656
chown	chmod
i have also tried many variations of chown and chmod to change permissions of the share directories

472665
ssl	https
i don t think varnish support caching for https if you want caching with ssl nginx might be a better choice for you

472669
ubuntu	linux
i have two ssds.the first one has ubuntu 14.04 lts and windows 8.1 pro.the second one has kali linux installed.since i installed kali linux after ubuntu and windows 8.1 pro it s bootloader now is in use.the problem is when i remove the second ssd i am not able to boot on the operating systems of the first ssd because grub can t find the second ssd and grub-rescue launches instead.is it possible somehow to make this triple boot system able to work even when the second ssd is missing

472673
ubuntu	linux
so would ubuntu 14.04 be a good choice or should i go with some more lightweight linux given the fact that system components are not quite well

472722
ubuntu	linux
then there s dev sda5 with linux swap filesystem size- 2 gb - created during ubuntu install

472736
sudo	passwd
you could also once you ran the previous command run sudo passwd to change unix passwd

472759
ubuntu	linux
this is my 1st time to try a linux desktop on ubuntu 14.04 with a hope to have a stable and usable version of linux

472761
ethernet	wireless
i can connect via the ethernet cable but i have no sign of it detecting anything wireless

472788
sudo	passwd
you even don t know his passwd no one does until you changed his passwd with sudo

472788
daemons	systemd
if granted the daemons executes the the systemd s shutdown command

472798
overwrite	preserve
if i want to overwrite a file but preserve the original then i must make a copy of the original

472832
dictionary	map
i d have very much liked the option of a dictionary or map type

472844
xfce	kde
try to use an other desktop edition like xfce or kde of 14.04 from a live cd if they work your computer will have a problem with only unity

472861
google-chrome	safari
i want to set it to the google-chrome s ua so it isn t detected as safari on linux and some pages load like in google-chrome google.com for example

472896
put	get
when i put curl -v i get the following

472912
sudo	passwd
gpasswd -a sudo to set a root passwd

472933
octal	binary
note we are really converting from binary to octal

472933
octal	binary
technically as highlighted by læ uvä nhphãºc and braiam we are converting from binary to octal as described below

472933
octal	binary	octal	decimal
however the decimal and octal representations of numbers 8 are the same so for binary numbers with 3 digits or less both decimal and octal representations are the same

472933
octal	binary	octal	decimal
when represented as octal numbers rather than splitting into groups of three and doing binary to decimal conversion on each group you can actually take all three groups together as a single binary number and convert to octal

472933
octal	binary
for example here are some binary to octal conversions

472933
octal	binary
note that i am prepending 0b and 0o to distinguish between binary and octal numbers

472940
versioning	upgrade
is there possibility to upgrade 0ad from trusty backports to 0.0.16 versioning

472958
redhat	fedora
redhat fedora and ubuntu are different though you can share a home between the 2 if you remove fedora you will have files on your disc that are useless

472964
versioning	upgrade
after doing the 13.10 - 14.04 upgrade i was told by svn that i needed to run svn update because the versioning of the runtime was ahead of the stuff in my checked-out tree

472974
ubuntu	linux
but i would like to know what ubuntu s plans are for integrating drm into linux

472981
put	get
if i was to put in a windows 7 install disk do you think i could get windows running again on my laptop

i d post the whole output except that i have no good way to get it off the server

473008
disk	ram
i rebooted and then blank even screen off i tried swapping 4x2gb ram even removing hard disk but found no solution

473019
cpu	processors
the machines processors is an intel pentium r 4 cpu 2.53ghz with 38.7 gb

473029
ubuntu	linux
i don t understand why you are trying to compile a cross platform package that is an installer of linux distributions to a partition or usb drive when it would be much simpler to install an application that does the same thing as rufus from the ubuntu software center

473046
hash	md5
check md5 hash of your downloaded image with the official posted hash page and use zsync to fix corrupt .iso images

473047
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade my 13.10 os to the new 14.04 versioning

473073
ubuntu	linux
boot the emergency disk ubuntu or other linux live cd and open a text-mode shell

473088
ubuntu	debian
launchpad a ppa greatly automates much of the process but nothing replaces at least a working knowledge of packaging especially if you hope one day to have your package in the debian ubuntu repositories

473141
ubuntu	linux
have you considered to install virtualbox in your ubuntu machine and an old image of linux compatible with gcc 2.x

473143
udp	tcp
edit waiting for the geek in the comment to add registry settings to block tcp in the mean time sounds like setting ports to zero or creating some config error will indeed block tcp udp connections

473158
switching	screens
i have ubuntu gnome installed on my pc and i also installed the unity shell the problem is i seem to have lost the gnome login screens and lock screens is it possible to switching back from the new unity one to the original gnome one

473168
folder	directory
if everything went according to plan there should be a folder called test inside the share directory

473179
mp4	webm
i m converting mp4 videos to webm with the following command

473179
google-chrome	firefox
the videos are not working on firefox on most devices and on google-chrome in a specific android device that i have

473370
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is like others linux distributions - it is very good at being installed alongside with any windows

473389
ubuntu	linux
if you have all 4 partitions formatted with windows file systems you won t be able to install ubuntu without removing one as it needs to be installed on a file system that supports unix permission system and is natively supported by linux

473401
xfce	gnome
then recently i installed several others des like gnome-flashback unity gnome 3 and xfce

473412

473471
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux is an operating system - windows is another operating system.

473471
disk	ram
your final - and perhaps easiest option if you have plenty of disk plenty of ram and a rather fast computer - is to use virtuallization and install windows in a virtual computer inside ubuntu

473471
disk	ram
you start virtualbox under ubuntu and set-up a virtual computer for windows by deciding things like how much ram you ll be using-up the ram in your actual computer and how big disk really a file you store under ubuntu you need

473475
vmware	virtualbox
i personally use virtualbox but vmware or kvm can work as well

473481
gtk	gdk
from the documentation of gtk gdk and the source code of eog it seems that eog create a popup with teh image and request gdk to set it fullscreen

473485

ubuntu	opensuse
i m not sure if the support information is telling me to install those modules or not sorry if being dumb new to ubuntu from opensuse

473537
sudo	passwd
if you enable sudo without a passwd how to run sudo command with no passwd

473538
ubuntu	debian
guessing that this is because xcp on debian ubuntu and all platforms

473562
ubuntu	debian
the instructions tell explicitly how to rebuild the atlas source package for debian ubuntu in a way that will give you custom-built packages that can be installed in place of packages provided in the official repositories

473573
versioning	upgrade
you will now be able to get the latest oneiric update with the command or upgrade to the current lts versioning 12.04 and 14.04 with the command

473595
mp3	ogg
now - the easiest way to do this is using rhythmbox itself if its one of the common file types such as mp3 ogg

473617
versioning	upgrade
so if you want to try the gapplication program you can either upgrade to the 14.10 development versioning wait for ubuntu 14.10 to be released or try backporting the glib2.0 packages yourself

473643
bluetooth	usb
goggling the usb id s you can find which one is the bluetooth device in my case 0cf3 3004 atheros is in fact the atheros ar3012 bluetooth device

473671
uninstall	upgrade
is there any way to upgrade or is it a case of uninstall and then follow this

473831
versioning	upgrade
if support for an ubuntu versioning is about to expire or already expired then you could contact your customer and propose to upgrade his her system and emphasize the importance of an up-to-date system see windows xp i have seldomly see people care that much about changing software

473866
folder	directory
is there a way to automatially set sudo chmod 777 for all the files folder and subfolders in a directory

473866
folder	directory
the sudo chmod 777 should automatically be set when a folder or a file is created in the parent directory

473875
versioning	upgrade
installing the i386 versioning of fake-pae might do the trick and allow upgrade

473884
opera	firefox
i am using firefox opera for browsing tried wired wireless connection but it does not change the situation

i would like to clean install a linux distribution as ubuntu etc

473925
sudo	passwd
to do that use sudo gedit etc passwd locate the lines for the 2 users and carefully replace their home directory

473936
filesystems	fat
fat doesn t use uuids for instance so for fat the serial number is used instead of a uuid. these uuids should be unique for any given filesystems although cloned filesystems might have duplicated uuids

you may have administrative access if you ve been directly added to the list of sudoers â this is more likely if the administrator is familiar with linux or unix in general and didn t use the default ubuntu method

474001
sudo	passwd
try running sudo echo ok and enter your passwd

474005
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu kali and debian should be running fast respectively .so.if i don t create a separate home partition and instead of that provide extra 1gb app setting ++9 gb for small amount of data 10 gb total will my system run finely

474018
ubuntu	linux
my suggestion to confirm this would be to boot into a linux distro ubuntu off of some removable media and attempt to run a memory test for at least several hours

474018
ubuntu	linux
if you have access to another computer you could use unetbootin in either windows or linux to create a bootable thumb drive of ubuntu 12.04 and follow these instructions during boot to access the menu allowing you to test your ram

474019

wd has windows and mac utilities available but nothing for linux ubuntu

i recently built a gaming pc and i m just wondering if putting ubuntu or any linux os for that matter onto a pc that is going to be used mainly for gaming is a bad good idea

474287

right now only few .exe based applications can be used on to linux ubuntu using wine

474291
ubuntu	linux
normally ubuntu is not for gaming but still there are many open-source games for linux

474307

also hibernating windows and booting linux will cause windows to lock ubuntu out of any hard drive that a windows program had just one file open on-- perhaps on the nice little data sharing hard drive partition you set up

mp4	webm
choose record with vp8 webm or mp4

versioning	upgrade
how do i upgrade to a newer versioning of ubuntu

477690
ubuntu	debian
as of 2014 this website describes the way to do it for ubuntu and debian

477690
ubuntu	debian
postgresql packages for debian and ubuntu

477690
ubuntu	debian
the postgresql global development group pgdg maintains an apt repository of postgresql packages for debian and ubuntu located at

477690
ubuntu	debian
we aim at building postgresql server packages as well as extensions and modules packages on several debian ubuntu releases for all postgresql versions supported

477690
ubuntu	debian
packages for older postgresql versions and older debian ubuntu distributions will continue to stay in the repository

477690
ubuntu	debian
packages similar to the ones present in debian and ubuntu

477721
dpkg	apt
dpkg error processing var cache apt archives samba_2 3a3.6.3-2ubuntu2.10_i386.deb --unpack

477738
versioning	upgrade
i m almost sure that 3d acceleration stopped working after virtualbox upgrade from 4.3.10 versioning but it also may be upgrade to 14.04 or one of the following packages upgrade

477743
filesystems	btrfs
mark your btrfs partition as root filesystems but don t let the installer reformat it

477743
ubuntu	mint
tested on ubuntu 14.04 mint 16 mint 15 ubuntu 13.10 and ubuntu 13.04

477748
sudo	passwd
if you can already ssh to the server without passwd with your normal user then use sudo -i to start an interactive root session

477769
cpu	processors
processors intel r atom tm cpu n550 1.50ghz

477846
filesystems	ntfs
the most likely explanation is that you have selected a codeblocks workspace that is on a non-linux filesystems such as an external ntfs hard drive

477849
sudo	passwd
click unlock and enter your sudo passwd

477869
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this worked for me on linux mint 16 ubuntu 13.10 and linux mint 17 ubuntu 14.04

477890
ati	nvidia
it s assumed you have a ati card you want to passthrough simply because nvidia will only work

477918
switching	screens
purging the drivers gave me back a gui but unfortunately no working desktop environment and switching to the mesa drivers returned me to the black screens issue

477992
bluetooth	usb
i would turn your bluetooth on off and plug some usb devices in - see what happens cause it worked for me

478028
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for harveyp

478058
ubuntu	linux
there s a lot of software available for ubuntu and for linux generally

478073
daemons	systemd
i have managed to trigger the gnome-power-manager s gnome-settings plugin which dims the screen etc by patching upower and use it after killing the systemd s upower daemons

478074
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
it actually depends on the underlying filesystems as every filesystems ext2 3 4 btrfs xfs has a unique design and have its own version of fsck if you like to understand the exact details its best to go through the source code

478095
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu uses the kde desktop environment ubuntu uses unity by default

478141
kde	kubuntu
if you can install kubuntu or kde it s enough to put some widget

478160
kde	gnome
i ve used kde for a while now and i m not going back to gnome but one thing that i really want is mintmenu instead of lancelot or kickoff i know it is for gnome but is there any way to get it running in kde

478190
jobs	cron
it uses the environment variable to find the x server to talk to so you need to define it because cron jobs do not require x windows

478196
filesystems	ntfs
i realized that i run a chkdsk on the windows partition and i didn t let it end so it may be marked as unclean as written here problem to enter in ntfs partition the disk contains an unclean filesystems

479286
sudo	passwd
i have used sudo for other commands to be sure it was not a passwd failure and every other command has worked but nothing works with chsh

479290
ubuntu	linux
and does ubuntu at the core use a modified linux kernel

479297
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux kernel derives its kernel from the vanilla kernel d using linux.git and stable branches and builds its own version of supported kernel

479326
sudo	passwd
when i type sudo before command to act as a superuser it never ask me for the passwd at all

479340
sudo	passwd
during a single session sudo may only ask for your passwd the first time you use sudo

479352
switching	screens
even with compton installed and configured i have an extreme amount of screens tearing as soon as i switching to the proprietary nvidia drives the screens tearing is gone completely except for the video playback with xbmc vlc or parole media player

479352
cpu	processors
os xubuntu 14.04 linux-x86_64 - processors intel core i7-4770s cpu 3.10ghz - ram 16 gb - geforce gt 750m 1024 mb - nvidia driver 331.38

479362
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux is set up in a differrent way

479363
mouse	keyboard
s keyboard and mouse shortcuts

479368
sudo	passwd
hate passwd sudo and love one-liners

479371
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
yesterday i switched back from linux mint to ubuntu 14.04 and after installation i faced the following problem

479401
ubuntu	centos
i do that when i install centos and by grub dont see ubuntu only windows 8.1 and centos

479416
chown	chmod
assuming my system completely dies and i m only left with the backups will i be able as the root of another system to chown or chmod 644 those backups files owned by a now dead root in order to recover my data

479421
chown	chmod
that includes allowing you to chmod chown on that backup file

479428
folder	directory
anyways my initial error had changed my user-dirs.dirs file found in my .config folder under my home directory

479444
ubuntu	mint
ubuntu 14.10 lts 64-bit and mint 17 cinnamon 64-bit installed in 2 separate partitions

479444
ubuntu	mint
both ubuntu and mint could not be loaded from the bootloader

479479
postgresql	mysql
features of phpbb include support for multiple database engines postgresql sqlite mysql oracle database microsoft sql server flat message structure as opposed to threaded hierarchical subforums topic split merge lock user groups multiple attachments per post full-text search plugins and various notification options e-mail jabber instant messaging atom feeds

479496
ubuntu	linux
if you know a tutorial or a documents explaining keyboard shortcuts in ubuntu or linux in general can you please list it

479517
tiff	ico	gif	ico
xnview lets you read about 500 formats including multipage and animated still formats apng tiff gif ico etc..

479525
virtualbox	parallels
try virtualbox instead and run the os es in parallels

479543
xfce	gnome
menulibre is your one-stop shop for menus in linux whether you use gnome lxde xfce or unity

480578
kde	kubuntu
if you create a system and base it on kde it will not be accepted since that would be a second kubuntu

480578
xfce	gnome
the same goes for systems based on xfce lxde gnome or unity

480578
ubuntu	mint
look at the biggest not supported spin-off of ubuntu mint

480593
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to run a file in linux ubuntu 14.04 but i get this error

480642
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade to latest versioning and not current stable versioning you can use

480648
ubuntu	linux
the change you noticed is not ubuntu specific it is due to runtime power management now being enabled by default in the linux kernel

480668
next	except
there was also a bug report at to fix these remaining libraries and most of them should be fixed in the next release except libnetapi.so which is not multiarch ready on ubuntu yet

480692
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this worked for me in linux mint 17 32-bit which is more or less ubuntu 14.04 32-bit

480692
folder	directory
extract it to get a folder containing directory 32-bit_driver debian enter inside

480755
sudo	passwd
however if you do want people to log in as root you can activate the root user by giving it a passwd using the command sudo passwd root

480781
ubuntu	linux
scripts are simple and fun to write in ubuntu linux

480798
daemons	systemd
however programs that make systemd modifications such as drivers daemons systemd tools etc. but actually any software that asked you for root access elevation in windows during the installation process has no technical obligations to remove everything upon uninstallations and may leave residues that can compromise systemd performance stability and security

480853
ubuntu	linux
while those programs may have linux compatibilty you d have to install them within ubuntu

480896
pbm	pgm	ppm	pgm	ppm	djvu	ppm	pbm
ddjvu converts djvu documents to pbm pgm ppm images

480906
sudo	passwd
open a terminal and type sudo -h dolphin or kdesudo dolphin enter your passwd

480907
wan	lan
use icmp ping to check routes within your lan or wan

480919
sudo	passwd
my intention is to temporary change a users passwd sudo passwd user

480927
mouse	keyboard
i tried to logout mouse is working properly and login again try starting onscreen keyboard but still have no luck system still doesn t respond to the key press

480983
versioning	upgrade
either you haven t upgrade php5-dev package - try searching for a package dpkg -s which php-config5 and upgrade the package using ppa to match the php versioning

480999
vmware	virtualbox
vm images are create for distributing as vm images and converting between different types of virtualized environments is also doable so vmware to virtualbox vmware to aws-ami vmware to lxc container are all doable

481032
debian	linux
the other option is to create your own ppa on launchpad servers and then you will be able to pull that directly from any computer warning debian packaging is relatively straightforward but still requires knowledge of linux and a little bit about coding building software

481032
ubuntu	debian
it is also possible to add to your sources the repos for most recent version of ubuntu or debian that has the package you want install it and then remove the source

481054
ethernet	wireless
when i plug in the ethernet cable the internet works fine but i can t see any wireless network in the networking manager

481066
xfce	gnome
i am running mate but the problem persists when i change to and from xfce gnome mate a-- and back again

481068
ubuntu	linux
until better technology for removable supports is available i d install any linux system you also ubuntu before using it for work

481069
srt	subtitle
srt is a filename extension used for files containing subtitle in subrip format

481075
ubuntu	linux
i am pretty new to ubuntu and linux in general

481100
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and i chose ubuntu as my first linux distro

481106
ubuntu	linux
linux in general and ubuntu specifically have no problems booting from a logical partition therefor its safe to use these for all partitions you choose to create

481114
ubuntu	linux
even though ubuntu and osx have similar bases linux unix emulation is surprisingly difficult

481120
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linux	debian	mint
however once the system starts to load up ubuntu or other distros debian and linux mint i lose all functionality

481134
google-chrome	safari
in older ubuntu the python-webkit inspector looked like google-chrome as you can see in these screenshots it had some annoying bugs too. i see midori s inspector also looks just like safari and still has some bugs

481134
google-chrome	safari
it should be noted that midori on windows has an inspector like google-chrome not safari so it seems to be a bug in ubuntu s gtk-webkit

481143
vmware	virtualbox
either vmware or virtualbox would work

481146
umask	mount
partition path to mount ntfs-3g defaults auto uid 1000 gid home umask 002 0 0

481148
folder	directory
2 i then moved my .wine folder out of my home directory onto a shared partition and created a sym-link to it in my home folder and called it â œ.wineâ

481165
ubuntu	linux
i want to switch between the wifi and ethernet in linux ubuntu 10.04

481183
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is a nice filesystems except when you are forced to hard reset the system twice in a row

481196
daemons	systemd
my init daemons is upstart however trying systemd gives the same failure

481285
debian	linux
but if it does work to boot both linux and windows you can install the debian package either single-shot using the package from the downloads page or by using the ppa referenced at the bottom of the downloads page

481307
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome chromium and firefox dont run shockwave flash i don t know what else i should do to solve this problem this is pissing me off

481307
post	get
every blog or post or forum say that you need to delete pepperflash.so or something like that to get it working

481316
ubuntu	debian
network interfaces in debian ubuntu are not defined by files in etc sysconfig network-scripts as you have noticed there isn t even a etc sysconfig directory but by etc network interfaces

481316
ubuntu	debian
to learn more check out the manpage online or run man interfaces on your debian ubuntu system

481320
ubuntu	debian
if you wish to use selinux in ubuntu the selinux-basics and selinux-policy-default packages from debian are still being actively maintained

481326
debian	linux
2.00 for linux debian packagearchive for this printer on its website

481332
ubuntu	linux
so i m kind of new to ubuntu and linux in general i installed the latest ubuntu 14.04 and everything went fine except for the resolution so i thought that it was a driver problem because i have a amd hd 7750 and maybe it required additional proprietary drivers so i installed amd catalyst latest version and then rebooted

481339
gedit	aptana
the problem is that i installed gedit and aptana and some other software from ubuntu and installed on my device

481350
kde	gnome
tried in both gnome and kde

481368
postgresql	mysql
mysql is only one of the db server and there are others such as postgresql oracle derby etc.

481369
centos	linux	centos	mint	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	mint
if you cannot find gparted i would recommend getting an iso for a trusted and stable linux version ubuntu mint centos etc. that includes gparted and make a live cd from it by burning i and almost certainly for other flavors. to and report here in the form

481435
ubuntu	linux
u still can install ubuntu on linux but you must do it with yourself

481444
versioning	upgrade
when new versioning come out distribution upgrade are thoroughly tested

481467
apache	nginx
this is a bit of a time of change as many web hosters are currently switching to nginx instead of apache and mariadb instead of mysql

481509
switching	screens
then i have to type sudo lightdm and use ctrl+alt+f7 to switching to the graphical log-in screens

481538
ubuntu	linux
last time i was using ubuntu linux it was almost 3 years ago and i have to admit i was never good at it

481540
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
to stop the display manager run one of these commands depending on your display manager lightdm is default in vanilla ubuntu but older versions or systems with gnome desktop may use gdm and on kde kubuntu plasma it should be kdm

481546
xfce	gnome
i am running mate but the problem persists when i change to and from xfce gnome mate a-- and back again

481550
ubuntu	linux
your best bet for using qq under linux is to use the chinese based distros linux deepin currently at 2014 version or ubuntu kylin 14.04 and up

481554
ubuntu	linux
by default on ubuntu any linux user which is member of the group sudo or admin is allowed to use sudo to run any commands as root on the system

481573
filesystems	ntfs
at this day i don t know a good tool to check an ntfs filesystems under linux there is scrounge-ntfs but for me there is a lot of risk

481589
pull	push
you don t have to push it from windows to linux you can also pull it with linux from windows

481621
kde	kubuntu
lemon pos depends heavily on kde dependencies as such kubuntu uses the kde desktop environment. would definitely be the place to start looking

481638
ubuntu	mint
note that i have no plans to keep windows i ll just replace the d mn thing with ubuntu maybe mint

481645
ethernet	wireless
i think the mistake i made was i started from a 12.04 install disk instead of the 12.10 disk i d used previously and when given the option set my primary connection as ethernet because the wireless option didn t work

481651
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i am relatively new to linux but i have had ibus working with hangul korean input in the past with linux mint 16 ubuntu 14.04

481730
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade to 14.04 versioning of ubuntu but since i do not have a good internet connection i am unable to upgrade it using update manager

481732
disk	ram
however if we consider swapping this is almost the opposite of caching data from the disk in ram where caching uses ram to speed up i o and potentially other things paging uses disk space to extend ram

481746
installation	upgrade
now if you burn your image and boot from cd dvd it should have and offer upgrade installation scenario

481755
sudoers	passwd	sudoers	visudo	passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
to avoid that sudo asks for a passwd edit the sudoers file with visudo

481764
ubuntu	linux
i have never used an anti-virus in six years of using linux ubuntu for most of that time

481766
chown	chmod
i tried to chown the folder usr share fonts to my user and chmod the folder usr share fonts to 777 but it still does not display text

481770
ubuntu	linux
in my opinion you don t need anti-virus software in ubuntu because a virus can t harm linux mainly because in order to install itself or infect your computer a virus needs your password

481856
post	get
luckily i still know what the scancodes are for my specific hardware so i can still get everything working but i want to write a post about how to set up foot pedals

481859
ubuntu	linux
linux desktop running ubuntu 14.04 using a wireless router

481874

since i installed ubuntu 14.04 i can no longer play wmv wma or 3gp files with any player gxine - vlc - totem - etc.

481920
ubuntu	linux
my problem is fixed after performing apt-get dist-upgrade and executing --reinstall linux-image-3.13.0 as suggested by bain from a test ubuntu system of a life usb in which i mounted my local linux installation as root directory

481943
versioning	upgrade
however when there is a newer versioning in any other pocket repo apt will upgrade the package to that versioning

481962
dpkg	apt
the first tells dpkg that we like to support the i386 binaries in our system apt query this and starts downloading not only the amd64 package list but also the i386

481962
ubuntu	debian
i m not sure why this isn t the default in ubuntu in debian it isn t but debian supports way more architectures but that s why

481968
versioning	upgrade
however you could upgrade it preserving your documents etc by running the command sudo update-manager -d - wouldn t work for versioning 10.04

481977
versioning	upgrade
installing directly over the old versioning is the most stable and easiest way to upgrade

481981
mouse	keyboard
unplug all peripherals from usb ports except for mouse and keyboard in case it s trying to boot from say your plugged in phone or more likely the live usb that you used to install ubuntu

481995
kde	kubuntu
i see you re using kde - are you using kde on an ubuntu system or are you using straight up kubuntu

481996
filesystems	ntfs
and by the way remember to have ubuntu usb stick formatted as fat32 filesystems not ntfs

482011
sudo	passwd
log in with your username and passwd and type sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop and see what happens

482049
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux ubuntu so forgive me if some of my questions are badly asked

482049
versioning	upgrade
i finally upgrade the kernel to one of the stable 3.15 versioning from here delay was mostly due to me being afraid of the unknown particularly of breaking my computer

482079
chown	sudo
type â sudo chown media ian media ian this makes you the owner rather than it being owned by the â rootâ account

482079
sudo	chgrp
type â sudo chgrp media ian media xâ where x is tour group name

482079
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
note in linux mint 17 and probably in ubuntu 14.04 the owner-name and the group-name comes first

482228
kate	gedit
gedit and kate support tabs for example

482303
sudo	passwd
since the system will no longer identify mount requests as admin or sudo requests it will require the passwd for mount requests not listed as user mountable in etc fstab

482307

i am heavily dependent on linux and i would like to keep using ubuntu since i am used so much to it and i have grown fond of it

482325

482755
google-chrome	firefox
it s most apparent at startup but it s also noticeable when working with on js mainly the browser especially google-chrome but also firefox

482790
versioning	upgrade
and as listed above ubuntu upgrade openssh-server to an older versioning than the latest so to install the latest first we need to remove any existing old openssh-server bring up a command prompt using ctrl + alt + t and type the following pressing enter after each line

482837
ubuntu	linux
apart from this ubuntu and linux in general have a further optimized kernel that can handle much better the 4 gb limit so it does not use 900 mb for example it just needs less than 200 mb even less in other versions and distros getting to a point of only 1 mb or 2 mb

482839
kde	gnome
note that this is system-wide and not a desktop-specific thing so it could mean that gnome terminal runs on kde if both it and konsole are installed.

482839
kubuntu	gnome
on this kubuntu machine â without gnome-terminal installedâ it s still set to gnome terminal

482841
filesystems	btrfs
in ubuntu installer select manual partitioning something else select your btrfs filesystems any of the 3 devices set type btrfs and mount point

482850

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
thus even though there are development versions since their work is dependent on but not part of the ubuntu release cycle there s always a gap between a release of ubuntu and the corresponding releases of linux mint and others

484693
ubuntu	debian
for example debian voted to chose systemd as the default init system and ubuntu followed soon

484693
ubuntu	debian
now in the next release ubuntu will pick up the changes that have been made for systemd compatibility from debian jessie and apply them to ubuntu

484693

484787
bazaar	git
i would like to import an arbitrary git branch not master into a bazaar repo on launchpad but when requesting a new code import launchpad by default imports the head of the master branch

when i upgrade my packages i also get all the files for the newest ubuntu versioning - but i want to keep my stable lts versioning

484983
ubuntu	linux
gnu-based utilities and philosophy were combined with the linux kernel in order to develop most modern day linux distributions including ubuntu

484983
openbsd	freebsd
the bsd operating system was developed in the late 1970s independent of gnu and later branched into modern day versions like freebsd or openbsd

484983
unix	bsd
both gnu and bsd are inspired by unix and they have slightly different philosophies syntax etc

484984
google-chrome	firefox
between firefox and google-chrome

484984
unix	bsd
perhaps the better question is why do bsd linux osx and unix distributions share so many commands

484992
uptime	reboot
what was my surpise to see after running uptime that the uptime was not 2 or 3 minutes but yet a lot of day reboot now executed inside an ubuntu 14.04 vps is not really reboot but is just asking to go into single user mode

777 and 666 are rarely used except in tmp

485009
versioning	upgrade
have been applying updates as they appear but have just learnt elsewhere on this site that that s a waste of time and i should upgrade to latest ubuntu versioning

485031
versioning	upgrade
this will ensure that when you upgrade to a new versioning of ubuntu the libraries that you use will be linked against the same versioning of libraries that are in the main repo

485046
versioning	upgrade
there is no direct upgrade from 13.04 to 14.04 but you can always upgrade to the last versioning by upgrade to all the intermediate versioning

485046
versioning	upgrade
note that if you have had a lts versioning like 10.04 12.04 or 14.04 you can do the upgrade directly to the next lts versioning so upgrading directly from 12.04 to 14.04 would be possible from 12.10 to 14.04 would not be possible directly

485064
google-chrome	firefox
earlier today i installed google-chrome only to realize that i needed to uninstall it for reasons i won t get into here so i removed google-chrome and got mozilla firefox back

485069

all traffic has to use the mac address of the host s wireless adapter and therefore virtualbox needs to replace the source mac address in the ethernet header of an outgoing packet to make sure the reply will be sent to the host interface

485069

virtualbox examines arp and dhcp packets in order to learn the ip addresses of virtual machines

485310
ubuntu	linux
you should always install windows before ubuntu or any other linux distrobution

485342

the reason why does ubuntu work is that linux surpasses windows in this way it doesn t bind to chipset model

485458
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu and debian the majority of the file is for global definitions and the configuration of the default server and virtual hosts is handled at the end by using the include ... directive

485465
ubuntu	debian
since there is debian packages for ubuntu older release

485473

however if your app is made with the ubuntu sdk you don t need to use debian packaging and can instead use click packaging which is much easier to use and much safer for the end user

very few applications are actually recoded for the new releases syfluqs so the two or three out of over 300 are just maybe a couple of drivers or one or two core applications that are installed anyway during normal installation and are thus not downgrade to the old version

492033
geany	gedit
running gedit geany chromium-browser firefox libreoffice.

492045
ubuntu	centos
what i am doing reflects how i have done this sort of thing for centos but ubuntu seems different in that there are not actually separate trees of package files for different releases and different parts of the release eg base os updates contrib extra etc. -- it is all munged together with the repository metadata being used to sort things out

the vpn tunnel will be in the subnet 192.168.10.0 24 where the server receives the 192.168.10.1 address

492709
tunnel	vpn
the tun adapter works at layer 3 which means you can assign it an ip and think of it like a next-hop router for your vpn network behind the tunnel

492709
tunnel	vpn
this can be really useful if you need your arp requests replies or any layer 2 broadcast to reach the other end of the vpn tunnel

492723
versioning	upgrade
then that s completely solvable as long as the desired package is ok with the current versioning of the packages you don t want to upgrade

492997
google-chrome	firefox
when there is a program that i want to watch i know that it won t work in google-chrome won t work in chromium probably will work in firefox and when firefox doesn t work i use google-chrome in windows xp in virtualbox which also very occasionally won t play the video

the format you describe could work although using is more common partly because is less than all other characters and so if the user upgrade to a newer release from precise to trusty and the package is present in the official repos with a versioning number of 1.0.0-3 then the user will upgrade from 1.0.0-3 precise1 to 1.0.0-3 even if you have a 1.0.0-3 trusty1

if you have multiple users you can revoke one s superuser access just by removing their sudo permission without needing to change the root passwd and notify everyone of a new passwd

secondly the reason you re receiving the error with google is most likely not due to the fact that you have a virus on your ubuntu install linux and gnu user-space works a whole lot differently than windows unimportant but rather that you have another infected computer on your local network are using an infected vpn to connect or your ip was recently changed by your isp to a previously-malicious address that google is blocking

attention you should only use the old-release archive if you have no possibility to upgrade to a newer versioning because you won t get any security updates using these old archives

502473

if it is really justified that your website needs to adjust systemd configuration you ll want to contact aâ self-written daemons process which provides a suitable amount of protaction and is specialised only in applying limited changes

one example bug #984230 - the packages xfce4-notifyd from xfce and notify-osd from gnome unity are incompatible and if you install xfce and unity at the same time you will find that notifications in xfce do not work as expected because the notification service is activated by dbus and notify-osd always gets run instead of the xfce version

this is due to the on-board bluetooth also not being supported by the kernel and it is conflicting with a bluetooth usb dongle that i got

502784

use visudo to edit your sudoers file and look for nopasswd - that s the directive disabling the user passwd prompt you never have to enter the passwd of the target user the root passwd

503479

simply removing that directive including the colon at the end should require you to re-enter your passwd to use sudo unless you used it recently then it s still cached you can clear this using sudo -k

as someone who has made administration scripts myself it may be more prudent to just provide users the .sh scripts and run them themselves from wherever they want rather than install them as if they were an executable either in a bazaar repository or a git repository somewhere

with synergy you could use one mouse and keyboard including copy-and-paste on all of your pc s

if i start the program from the command line i can see stderr and stdout messages

the log_file only contains stderr and stdout disappears

504326

my ultimate goal is to run this program at system start as root while logging stderr and stdout to a log_file

gnome uses the gtk+ library while kde uses the qt library i assume that s why it doesn t work with kde

504390
dpkg	apt
you already have the tor-browser package version 3.5.4 installed and apt and dpkg don t like it when you are overwriting an already-installed executable managed by the packaging system with a new version provided by a different package

if stdout is redirected to a file the buffer is not fflush unless fflush is called
