versioning	upgrade
this will upgrade your installed vlc versioning to 2.2.1 if you don t have any installed then after the above commands run

634007
disk	ram
for example the system cache including the hard disk cache is used in the sense that memory is allocated to it but is free in the sense that it s only taking up otherwise available ram and will naturally shrink as less ram becomes available to it

634008
sudo	passwd
i ran sudo chmod 777 -r usr bin as i had a few programs there i wanted to be able to run with more ease without continuously entering my root passwd but now usr bin sudo keeps giving me an error whenever i run sudo

vim	sublimetext
today i updated and upgraded ubuntu installed some software sublimetext chrome vim installed node ruby and ruby on rails etc so i don t know if the problem occurred because of something installed today or what

it seems that ubuntu provide several tools to help you building debian packages with the bazaar version control

634205
ubuntu	debian
there is no book on debian packaging or ubuntu packaging that follows all the packaging policies for both that is up to date as there are changes frequently enough that you have to read the policies and the guides after they re updated

to compare download videos you can query the downloaded video audio tracks you may need to use avprobe instead of ffprobe to see which is best

634659
folder	directory
now if you look in the opt ums directory you will find a folder named linux

634685
chown	sudo
changing permissions of your folder to allow www-data apache to write to it might be something like sudo chown www-data var www yourfolder though i m not sure about this part

this does not remove everything that was installed but it removes major executables like gcc g++ cpp .

634736
debian	linux
on debian gnu linux systems the bash headers are in usr include bash

634736
ubuntu	debian
assuming that the package is useful i do think the debian and ubuntu packagers have some ways provided for me to use the examples

634759
ubuntu	linux
just make sure you have an ubuntu live usb or cd dvd no matter which flavor in order to be able to reinstall the grub boot loader if you decide to go back to linux or dual booting

634759
put	get
ps if you get your windows back you can download the necessary ethernet drivers in xubuntu put the installer s on the windows partition or preferably a shared personal partition if you made one boot to windows and install the drivers from there

ubuntu	linux
i recently purchase a dell xps 13 9343 installed ubuntu 15.04 and replace the broadcom 4352 card with an intel 7265 card due to broadcom s horrible support for linux and crappy signal

ubuntu	linux
hello i am putting a linux distro on my desktop and i have triple monitors and wanting to run the intel graphics chips on the 2 side 1080p monitors while my sli runs the center monitor on ubuntu 15.04

i d recommend using vmware for this as i ve found virtualbox harder to configure

634923
ubuntu	linux
i have been wanting to switch from windows to linux but i noticed ubuntu software center charges for some apps

634923
ubuntu	linux
i thought linux ubuntu is a free open source

folder	directory
but the mv actually move all my directory into a new folder called newd

634975
redhat	fedora
guest oracle linux 2.6 - redhat es like fedora kde 4.3.4

635020
ubuntu	debian
it is always best to use the debian installer file if it is available since that installer is created for debian and ubuntu and will pick up dependencies itself from the software center

635020
tar	gunzip
or gunzip -c xc-version.tar.gz | tar xvf -

635045
h.265	hevc
an alternative to longsleep s great answer is if using vlc as noted here you can upgrade to vlc 2.2.x or higher to get hevc h.265 support

635045
versioning	upgrade
the repo doesn t have the gstreamer1.0-libde265 package but does have a lot of other upgrade advanced or not normally available multimedia packages for trusty 14.04 for those who like lts versioning

635069
stdout	stderr
bash s man page mentions there s two ways to redirect stderr and stdout

635069
stdout	stderr
now notice that it says both stderr and stdout

635069
stdout	stderr
in case of this we are doing redirection of stdout 1 to file by also telling stderr 2 to be redirected to the same place as stdout

635069
ubuntu	debian
here s an example with dash the debian amquist shell which is ubuntu s default

635072
put	get
dev null treated as black hole in linux unix so you can put any this into this but at the end you will not able to get this back from dev null

635096
folder	directory
i was trying to execute it from the directory i had it in which was in a different partition than my home folder

635096
folder	directory
i moved it to home and right clicked and selected allow executing file as program from the permissions tab of the properties followed the previous steps adding the directory i was in as the install folder and it worked

635096
folder	directory
why couldn t i execute the file in the target folder why couldn t i click allow executing file as program in the original directory and why did i have to move the .bin file to the home folder

635105
stdout	stderr
each of those lines is printed separately and it s as stderr not stdout

635105
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to dev null and grep stdout

635117
kde	gnome
something in kde override my settings i say in kde because if i use gnome i got no problems

635159
put	get
create the file 00_default_plugins in etc dconf db compiz.d and put _your list of plugins_ inside run to get a list of your actually activated plugins

635164
fullscreen	minimized
update oh i remember that streaming videos on fullscreen on chrome gives strange flashes and sometimes cant stop video or minimized video or anything till video finishes

635172
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr to a file

635231
ubuntu	linux
then i would prepare modified grub file where ubuntu is set as default os this one would be stored on linux partition too

635231
folder	directory
i have created my backup folder in home user grubshift with 3 sub directory backup for backing up actual boot grub grub.cfg ubuntudefault for storing grub.cfg with ubuntu as default windowsdefault you ve got the idea

635263
ubuntu	debian
you should look into setting up a gateway in debian ubuntu if you want to allow other machines on the lan to access the internet

635280
post	get
i know this question has been asked many times on the internet and a google search will bring up a multitude of post but none of them have been of any help and are all very vague and not specific so i aim to finally get a definite answer out there on the internet

635302
sudo	passwd
this utility requires sudo passwd to perform any dangerous tasks

635348
vmware	esx
i don t seem to be able to modify the screen resolution of my ubuntu vmware esx vm

635348

folder	directory
change directory of media usb boot to the location of where the folder boot was copied to

635387
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
after flashing a new bios partitioning and repartitioning changing ntfs and fat filesystems and learning a crap load about bios i just needed to clean the fan

635389
cpu	processors
note that the processors itself can backoff the cpu frequency under no or extremely light load conditions regardless of what it is told to do via the frequency driver

635405
ubuntu	debian
the advantage to this is that you ll benefit from the work ubuntu well debian has done getting wordpress to integrate well with your os and it ll be easy to set up

635405
ubuntu	debian
it also means that it s imported with relatively few changes from debian s repositories so ultimately security support will depend both on debian and on ubuntu s ability to migrate across any major bug fixes

635405
ubuntu	debian
the nagging you get about updates would probably be considered a bug by debian and or ubuntu but they can t won t fix it because only security related issues are important enough to fix in an existing release

635421
ubuntu	linux
if linx+linux ex.redhat6 + ubuntu dual boot system and try to access other drive inwhich other linux os is inltalled

635421
filesystems	fat
2 if you have some more space in your hard drive and you able create new partion without reinstallation os i recomends create fat filesystems type partion

635421
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
ubuntu can access ntfs but fat filesystems is universal filesystems and it very usefull for data transfer

635434
dpkg	apt
you can do it using either dpkg or apt

635502
subnet	vlan
i ve setup a dhcp server for about 120 sub networks and it s working very well it gives the right ips from the right subnet vlan

635502
subnet	vlan
the windows 2008 dhcp server shows always the ip address of the network card interface 192.168.111.11 as dhcp server ip address on client s machine doesn t matter which vlan or subnet clients machine is connected to but the ubuntu one shows always the ip address of the sub interface vlan as dhcp server ip address and not the ip address of the physical network card

i have following question about hdmi is there a way to configure the hdmi port that it doesnt switching off when i close the laptop lid or the screens goes sleep and locked

635671
folder	directory
what i was hoping to do was have one folder with the others as sub-directories for example make the top level owner and put all specific stuff in there and create a directory inside of owner called admin in admin then place their specific files and then create a directory called general inside of admin

635731
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu and linux in general and this probably seems like a stupid question but just how do i actually boot up ubuntu

635776

why do many packages in ubuntu debian have the letter g in front of their name

in ubuntu installing a new program via a debian package file results in its files being written to whatever directories the package maintainer specified -- typically subdirectories of usr perhaps with a few configuration files in etc

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
furthermore neither fat nor ntfs performs as well as a linux-native filesystems so you ll be giving up performance as well as security

then grub will continue to operate although it will present non-functional ubuntu options and in the absence of a linux installation it will be difficult to change its boot options

636092
sudo	passwd
i find that if i execute something using sudo that then if i execute something else soon after also using sudo that it does not prompt me for my passwd and although this can be inconvenient in some situations it is a security risk in others and a hassle to keep on coming back and executing the command to make it prompt your for the passwd on the next go

is there problems with this new release of ubuntu because after upgrading from 14.04 things are getting worse and worse 14.10 version was little bad in performance but 15.04 has drastically degraded the performance of what one expects from a linux distributions

cinnamon	gnome
this doesn t come from cinnamon specifically but from gnome 3 from which cinnamon was forked

debian	mint
they are however only included in the mint repos so it might be easiest to get and install the debian package archives from a rebecca main mirror like from here

noting that nvidia stopped supporting the 6200 in the 346.35 driver package i apply the last-supported 304.125 drivers which are suggested by .02 - after which the pcs boot to the graphical login screen ok - but after login the desktop icon colors are wrong desktop appears black icons are just black squares with white blue outlines and the mouse keyboard are unresponsive

it could be there s some other fault though -- either a disk problem that won t show up in smart like a cabling or controller problem or something that s not disk-related bad ram maybe

if you can boot into ubuntu from the live cd dvd check the live cd dvd s md5 hash by running where is the optical drive s block device as listed by lsblk and check it against the md5 hash of the image found at releases.ubuntu.com under the name of the ubuntu release you re trying to install

if you could boot from a gnu linux live cd such as ubuntu you could then check if the usb is formatted correctly or re-format using gparted without affecting the contents of your computer s hard drive

sudo	gnome-terminal
and you can reinstall any terminal emulator from there with sudo apt-get install terminal-name where terminal-name is gnome-terminal for example

636693
bash	zsh
the terminal emulators which give you an interactive shell but ultimately bash zsh etc

636696
versioning	upgrade	dpkg	apt
yes if you install something via the package management system dpkg and apt when you apt upgrade or apt dist-upgrade it will look at all your locally defined sources ppas official repos local caches cds etc and attempt to install the latest versioning of all packages

636725
h.264	webm
since youtube also offers their open sourced webm formats and i wanted to avoid going into to much detail about test methods i needed to use another html5 capable site to test proprietary h.264 playback support

636725
h.264	h.265
to sum it up playback of current mainstream content does not only require an h.264 decoder but also an aac decoder and h.265 is already preparing to replace the older one

636725
h.265	vorbis	h.265	hevc	hevc	vorbis	vp8	opus	h.264	h.265	h.264	hevc
you get vp8 + vorbis as the h.264 avc contender and vp9 + opus as the h.265 hevc contender

versioning	upgrade
once you have upgrade you should stop the old indexer delete your index rm -rf .recoll xapiandb and rebuild it with the new versioning

636826
x86	64bit
the 32-bit x86 version lacks an efi boot loader and so is not bootable in efi mode unless you add an efi boot loader of your own -- and installing the 32-bit ubuntu on a system with a 64bit efi adds another layer of trickiness so i do not recommend going that route

636826
ubuntu	debian
for instance you could use the usb flash drive version of my refind boot manager to boot ubuntu in efi mode then either switch from the bios-mode grub grub-pc to efi-mode grub grub-efi or install refind to the hard disk via the debian package or ppa

switching	screens
on top of that if you use an external monitor with gnome-screensaver on a laptop and lock the screens it will be delayed in switching to the external monitor s resolution or not do it all unlike xscreensaver in my personal experience

637361
versioning	upgrade
now run sudo do-release-upgrade again to upgrade to 15.04 or run software updater and it should say 15.04 is available and ask you to upgrade assuming you ve set it to notify you of non lts versioning

637365
g++	gcc
however you can easily install it by installing the build-essential package which is a metapackage that installs gcc for compiling c files g++ for compiling c++ files and the c library headers

although fish ksh or zsh may theoretically be a better shell there is not enough of an improvement for me to bother when perl works so well or portability is an issue so i m targeting dash anyway

639034
unix	bsd
the c-shell csh came out of the berkeley version of unix and was also not gpl bsd license and also used different syntax than sh

639034
bash	zsh
a very good case could be made that zsh is and has been a better shell than bash but not enough so to overcome it s different license and non-gnu project status

639034
bash	zsh
so distros could look at z-shell as better but also expect that bash would be getting good support and maintenance going forward and also have more features added to it allowing it to catch up to zsh

639034

so they would be very reluctant to do that leaving new downloads to have zsh as the default and upgrades to have bash

639822
versioning	upgrade
the php versioning is changed.and if i didn t what what was change in two versioning should i upgrade it

639835
versioning	upgrade
the only small risk is a risk of bugs within the packages there self but this could happen to any thing on any os that was upgrade as bugs are common in any software and come and go based on versioning

639861
ubuntu	linux
in the past linux has been used primarily for servers mainframe computers and supercomputers but ubuntu is designed to be a user-friendly linux distribution for everyone

639878
stdout	stderr
the fatal error is probably coming out in stderr 2 not stdout 1

639878
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr into stdout with and then the pipe should capture it too

639879
stdout	stderr
as the error messages are normally shown on stderr file descriptor 2 you need to redirect both the stdout and stderr to tee

639879
stdout	stderr
will cause both the stdout and stderr to be redirected

639905
sudo	passwd
i m using a python script to run docker but docker requires sudo commands to run and it s bad practice to store the sudo passwd in the file or give the whole python script sudo rights i ve seen a method where you enable the system to run certain commands without entering a passwd i ve tried it but

i have ubuntu 14.04.2 and it has kernel versioning 3.16 and lubuntu from minimal install 14.04.2 with kernel 3.13 so i wondered why it don t upgrade kernel at least to 3.16

639947
versioning	upgrade
you re actually already using one of these they come bundled in the lts point releases but you can upgrade to the vivid versioning by installing linux-generic-lts-vivid

639947

note these do not have ubuntu patches applied and your system will not automatically upgrade if and when security-patched versioning are made available

versioning	upgrade
i have the versioning 14.04.02 desktop and want to upgrade to 14.10 but when running the command

640013
versioning	upgrade
that s because you re using lts versioning and you re trying to upgrade to a non-lts versioning of ubuntu

640013
versioning	upgrade
that means it prompted to upgrade to lts versioning but not the development ones

640013

if you want to upgrade to development versioning of ubuntu

admittedly you can do exactly the same thing with google-chrome so that s fairly redundant - although firefox can t do this as far as i know

640328

i don t want to get this prompt because i have to hit enter to connect again but i havent keyboard and mouse so i am operating my pc with remote system so if this type of prompts appear then it will not connect to wifi again

versioning	upgrade
i know i can upgrade the kernel versioning to the newer one but it seems that a lot of people had problems after installing it

640464
sudo	passwd
you aren t prompted for a passwd because sudo has done it s job and started apt-get as root

640464
sudo	passwd
in other words as long as a sudo ed process is running you won t be asked to enter your passwd again for that process

640464
sudo	passwd
sudo doesn t interrupt the process every 15 minutes the default timeout and ask for your passwd

640464
sudo	passwd
now if you were to open another terminal and try to run another process under sudo then you will be prompted for your passwd

640470

yes the debian includeoptional is by defaut but for ubuntu it s .conf

debian or ubuntu must have a template or standard for this sort of thing right

i wold like to write the bash script so that when i click on move .sh file then content of data folder should move to log folder and name of the file in data folder should go to another file i.e filenames.txt which is also present in exp directory

640743
kde	gnome
the script itself could be started as a background job at the end of the invocation possibly with a nohup to keep it running if its parent process terminates when your user logs in by running it from your home .profile file starting it with your desktop autostart utility kde or gnome from a cron job that periodically checks to see if it s not already running or even from whatever startup system you have init systemd etc. if you know enough to do that.

vmware	virtualbox
you can use vmware or virtualbox and load any os inside the vmware

put	get
i was able to get the list of sources from this - where should i put it so that apt-get will use them

640981
ubuntu	linux
the terminal in ubuntu like most other linux distributions uses bash which can be used to perform tasks and functions programmatically

640986
put	get
recently i needed to get a list of packages that were installed on my ubuntu system which were also put on hold for upgrade

to install mts mblaze ui in debian ubuntu linux mint deepin lmde any linux distribution open terminal press ctrl+alt+t and copy the following commands in the terminal

641148
dpkg	apt
now try to install apps you want from these archives using regular apt-get and not dpkg so apt-get tries to resolve dependencies from those archives if founded and check updates so if there is no new update on the repositories then it would use the .deb founded in the path var cache apt archives

641161

641249
folder	directory
i m from ubuntu to lubuntu 15.04 and can t find the file system directory so i can access my var www folder

641257
dpkg	apt
you could do it using apt dpkg for debian based distros and it would probably work fairly consistently

641257
dpkg	apt
but there are plenty of distros that don t use apt dpkg and so it almost certainly wouldn t work for those

641309
debian-based	ubuntu

641337
ubuntu	debian
while this post is not focused on ubuntu but rather debian on a raspberry pi i was successful in following these guidelines on ubuntu

641344
ethernet	wireless
i would recommend trying to find the specific driver software for your network driver ethernet wireless and installing it if they have a linux version

641344
ethernet	wireless
in addition i would also recommend trying to use ethernet to see if that works as it most likely uses a separate driver to the wireless card

641516
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i would choose fedora ubuntu and linux mint

641516
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
it is worth it because mint is doubly tweaked ubuntu is an improved version of debian and mint is an improved version of ubuntu

641516
xfce	kde
you can add kde xfce or lxde later if you want to try non-gnome desktops

641516
redhat	fedora
if you are experienced and like rpms redhat package manager for additions and updates fedora is your best bet or scientific linux for old machines

mouse	keyboard
this is the section for your mouse and keyboard

641586
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is not happening only while working with firefox but google-chrome and thunderbird

641630
switching	screens
assuming that you have used the system for browsing etc the removing the .cache should free up enough space to login using the graphics screens once more press alt + f8 maybe f7 to switching back to the graphical login page

641639
google-chrome	firefox
for me disabling ctrl+q shortcut system-wide is not the perfect solution because it prevents applications other than firefox google-chrome etc

641646
pop-up	dialog
then click kill on the confirmation dialog that pop-up

642113
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
windows on the other hand does not ship with such drivers and can only access a small variety of filesystems ntfs fat

642150
filesystems	fat
a mount option like showexec for fat filesystems is supposed to do this if set the execute permission bits of the file will be allowed only if the

642184

so as you see above when you run ctrl + c this kill the first command and while starting shudown it will ask you for your sudo passwd so you can now kill the second process using ctrl + c again

642893
versioning	upgrade
the debian prerm file called before files are removed by dpkg or the package is upgrade to a newer versioning

642894
ubuntu	linux
most linux distributions including ubuntu will use a boot loader

642894
ubuntu	linux
additionally to answer your comment on ubuntu messing up your windows boot loader most newer computers come with uefi boot mode but linux will install grub or grub2

642913
dpkg	apt
you could use a hook for apt to run a script after each invocation of apt-get dpkg

642913
lvm	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
the problem is that only btrfs and lvm provide filesystems snapshot

642914
wordpress	joomla
for instance if you need to upload files from a cms like wordpress joomla etc you ll need to change the ownership of the upload directory to www-data or at least grant write permissions to that user

642923
ubuntu	linux
i know almost nothing about linux and ubuntu so i am clueless on how to solve this but i really need it to work as fast as possible so all help would be highly appreciated

642929
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
currently using linux mint but want to switch back to any ubuntu flavor just not sure which is best

642932
ubuntu	linux
so i decided that installing ubuntu and re-learning linux would be beneficial

642934
versioning	upgrade
it sounds like you have a mix of packages from previous versioning of ubuntu including non-lts versioning that weren t upgrade properly or were removed in the newer versioning

642934
versioning	upgrade
in particular you have 47+9 packages from other non-lts versioning of ubuntu which should be upgrade or removed

642936
umask	chmod
when doing this you will probably want to use the setgid bit chmod g+s dir on the containing directory to ensure new files inherit the same group ownership and umask 002 in each user s .profile to ensure they get group write permission otherwise any new files will only be editable by their creator and not other members of the group

642949
switching	screens
trying to switching to any of the terminals just gives me a blank screens

642977
folder	directory
my question is i have added new folder to htdocs i have settled it s permission chmod 755 for directory and chmod 644 for files this worked for my on my first project but with 2nd i used the same method but it didn t work for that one

643029
folder	directory
which i tried but there is no bin folder in my home directory and when i created one i still could not run the script from anywhere else

643109
cpu	processors
copy this value to the files for each processors cpu cpu1 cpu cpu2 etc

643131
daemons	systemd
if you have zeitgeist daemons running on your systemd it should save some helpful info to .local share recently-used.xbel file

643133
ubuntu	linux
this means it should work in all linux distros including ubuntu

643142
sudo	passwd
for a while i wont have to enter my passwd for subsequent sudo commands

643142
sudo	passwd
it would be very convenient if i don t have to enter passwd when i use sudo in the terminals i open after my first sudo for the short time when i wont have to enter passwd for sudo in the terminal from which i have used sudo for the first time

643146
sudoers	visudo
run sudo visudo and add this line to your sudoers file

643150
ubuntu	linux
i am not yet a linux guy and i am finding some difficulties trying to install tomcat 8 on an ubuntu 15.04 system that i have to use as development environment

643152
chown	chmod
chmod will change the permissions while chown will change the owner and group of a file

643152
chown	chmod
in this case you re erroneously using chmod where you should be using chown

643168
cpu	processors
though it doesn t work when i try to debug intel from amd both running the same kernel 3.13.11-ckt20 smp 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux target - intel r core tm 2 duo cpu e8500 3.16ghz host - amd fx tm -4100 quad-core processors

643168
cpu	processors
it works in the opposite direction target - amd fx tm -4100 quad-core processors host - intel r core tm 2 duo cpu e8500 3.16ghz

643182
folder	directory
create a file with a .desktop suffix in the .config autostart directory - create the folder if you don t have it

643186

643280
mouse	keyboard
i m looking for a solution where i can do so from my keyboard or mouse

643337
mouse	keyboard
open gnome-terminal s menu with f10 or with the mouse select edit keyboard shortcuts then uncheck enable the menu shortcut key f10 by default

643343
disk	ram
if you are not using all your ram you should be able to configure linux to only use swap if run out of memory to avoid locking the system or when suspending to disk sleep etc

643348
filesystems	btrfs
for my root and home partitions i have formatted them to the btrfs betree filesystems as this runs best for me

643382
folder	directory
...there is a hidden folder .config so in your home directory

643382
folder	directory
could you make it visible by typing ctrl+h while in your home directory and remove the libreoffice folder inside that folder

643519
vpn	lan
the openvpn connection comes up and connects as you would expect allowing me to ssh into the box via the vpn from outside the lan

643535
folder	directory
if someone accidentally renames this folder to customers1 just as an example the backup makes a complete new backup for this new directory

643560
ubuntu	linux
i ended up ditching windows server and going with a full linux job - ubuntu server and edubuntu clients

643591
ant	maven
i have installed 2 development tools named maven and ant using this command

643600
ubuntu	linux
i m having an issue with my laptop using ubuntu linux 14.04 lts and i m not very savvy at linux at all is when i m using the wifi it ll disconnect from the internet after a while.

vmware and virtualbox do the same thing

643674
sudo	passwd
when i try to change a sudo passwd it say it doesn t work even running the

643675
sudo	passwd
sudo administrator passwd

643684
ansible	puppet
especially a box made by hashicorp should support many provisioners puppet chef salt ansible docker etc

643792
ubuntu	linux
for example the linux kernel itself is released under the gplv2 but other components like some binary drivers that may come with ubuntu are proprietary

643804
disk	ram
i ve been using this machine for 5 months now and between massive databases and finely tuned services i would like to avoid a format if possible but the computer is extremely slow as soon as the ram gets filled chrome tabs are the prime example or the hard disk gets over a certain usage the computer grinds to a halt often just hanging for minutes

643804
disk	ram
i might be inclined to say that somehow the swap partition is not working properly ram offloads hard disk shoots up to insanely high usage and the machine just hangs

cron jobs don t help much for this so i progressed to use the skeleton of the dev140 developers php daemon class for the phirehose api persitent connection streaming api

644179
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
so i now mimic a bit of persistent connection state by having a daemon do the things that are actually singe api calls on the normal non streaming api that otherwise are done with cron jobs

644229
filesystems	ntfs
or you could substitute another filesystems type for ext3 ext2 ext4 msdos ntfs vfat

644229

if you wish to resize a drive formatted with the ntfs filesystems you can use the ntfsresize command

644268
debian	linux	debian	mint
for instance when i made the switch to linux debian mint did not have the wireless driver that i needed and another non-ubuntu based distro had a working wireless driver that flat out sucked

644348

if you don t need that files and you just want your well known user directory like the desktop folder and the music folder you can restore by loggin out and then login again

you need to disable wireless network when you connect by ethernet

filesystems	ntfs
if you intend to boot linux alone on the computer ntfs is a very poor choice for filesystems for several reasons

644607
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
poor performance -- the ntfs-3g drivers used by ubuntu are slow compared to the drivers for linux-native filesystems like ext4fs xfs or btrfs

644607
filesystems	ntfs
lack of support for unix linux features -- linux relies on unix-style ownership permissions symbolic links and some other filesystems features that are not provided by ntfs

filesystems	btrfs
in addition btrfs will duplicate metadata by default unless mkfs.btrfs detects that the selected device is non-rotational when creating the filesystems

645028
filesystems	btrfs
but if this explanation is right then you can reduce disk space usage in btrfs by not duplicating metadata simply specify the --metadata single option when invoking mkfs.btrfs obviously this reduces redundancy so the filesystems will be less resilient against metadata corruption

645028
filesystems	btrfs
for an existing btrfs filesystems you can convert duplicated metadata into single metadata using balance filters

645052

to create global alias you need switch your shell from bash to zsh

i recently installed ubuntu 14.04.02 on a 10 year old desktop simply as something to do and with an extra hard drive lying around i decided to install turnkey linux fileserver solely on the second hard drive i figured that if i wanted a file server i would want more space and to have a newer drive

645206
filesystems	fat
if the tool gives you options for these details your best bet is to use gpt rather than mbr aka msdos partitions and a fat filesystems

645217
ubuntu	linux
my suspicion is that your turnkey linux version of grub has overwritten the ubuntu version of grub on your first hard disk leaving the second disk untouched

645232

in a nutshell run the following to upgrade python-pip to the latest versioning

versioning	upgrade
if you would like to update manually you have to upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 to 12.04 to 14.04 so it s easier to download a dvd image of the latest stable ubuntu versioning and burn it and boot that.

648688
versioning	upgrade
if you would insist going to the latest but least stable versioning of ubuntu you have to additionally upgrade to 14.10 to 15.04 - there you go.

648785
folder	directory
it will have exactly same directory structure and you may just browse folder files and search in them

648807
chown	sudo
sudo chown root root usr lib cups notifier dbus also did not fix the ownership problems

648807
chown	chmod
these links were given as potentially helpful guides accidentally chmod -r on restore chown permissions but they ultimately result in suggesting a reinstall of the os itself

it affects all keyboards usb bluetooth on-device windows key onscreen and synergyc so it s not a keyboard switch issue

ubuntu is based in debian but it not upgradeable to it

649522

you can upgrade ubuntu to a newest versioning of ubuntu like 14.04 or 15.04

649522

you will need linux x86 tar.gz file for 32-bit ubuntu or x64 tar.gz file for 64bit

649803
folder	directory
i need to modify the cmakelists.txt file in data directory by commenting the single line in it because this line tries to install unity file inside pam.d directory where normal users cannot do this so i created the folder manually and copied the file then changed permissions

you can overload your cpu and hence generate heat by using cpuburn cpu stress tester for ubuntu linux -

googling this error tells me that 15.04 switched from upstart to systemd but not how to actually restart my ssh daemons using systemd or whether that s even possible

filesystems	ntfs
in grub hd starts at 0 but msdos starts at 1 the labels of all the partitions on hd0 and the filesystems usually you throw android x86 onto ext2 but since you have it on ntfs it d display the filesystems as ntfs

x86	64bit
actually amd were the first to come up with a 64bit capable x86 chip hence at the beginning it was called amd64 as intel followed suit and also made their x86 chips 64bit capable the architecture changed name to x86_64 even though each company have their own name for their implementation of the architecture

650871
x86	64bit
this is because oracle database 10g instant client for linux amd64 32-bit and 64bit comes with a different package for each architecture one for x86 and one for amd64 x86-64 in fact the size of the two packages amounts roughly to the size of the package in instant client for linux x86-64

650871
ubuntu	linux
since you re running a 64-bit version of ubuntu just pick the 64-bit version in oracle database 10g instant client for linux amd64 32-bit and 64-bit which is only 32mb vs the 62 63mb of the multi-architecture version in instant client for linux x86-64

kde	kubuntu
from recovery mode i have removed kubuntu kde and switched back to ubuntu by using following commands

651784
bash	subshell
i see that the variable is not passed into any of the -exec bash -c command i assume that s because it s a subshell

i want that all files and directory inherit the permissions of the tvshow folder

651845
vmware	virtualbox
i also run both vmware workstation 10 and virtualbox

651845
vmware	virtualbox
both vmware and virtualbox have their individual querks so regardless of which you chose virtualization comes with costs

651845
vmware	virtualbox
the expense of vmware workstation is what is pushing me toward virtualbox again

651845
vmware	virtualbox
in terms of reliability i find both virtualbox and vmware workstation to be pretty rock solid

651845
vmware	virtualbox
but if you re comparing vmware and virtualbox i d go virtualbox hands down simply for the fact that you can utilize snapshots which in my work are invaluable

i have a hp probook 440 g2 moded version with specification 8gb ram i5 processor 500 hard disk and its 64 bit

vmware	virtualbox
i have tried using a windows ubuntu host machine running both vmware pro virtualbox to install an ltsp server from an ubuntu server installation iso

652115
sudo	passwd
in the case of ubuntu 14.04 by default user needs to enter sudo passwd to mount windows partition

652115

you don t need to mount the partition each time by using sudo passwd

although it used to be x86 but i realised i had 64bit capabilities so i upgraded

in order to have the drive available to ubuntu you would have to format the drive in a linux friendly format ext xfs as well as update your etc fstab in order for ubuntu to actually mount and use the drive for storage

652394

that aside i have lost the usual files in the home directory i only have the downloads folder left and since i didn t have anything too vital stored in the other directory i would like to restore them if at all possible

bash	zsh
the backstory to this is that i am trying to map a key in bash zsh s vi-mode to display previous history or previous output but without losing the current command i am editting

652508
spaces	delimiter
since the split definition is not exactly similar for both delimiter the dot needs to be included while the spaces does not you need two steps to split

652530
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu the linux kernel can handle both raid-1 or raid-5

652533

navigating the output history is not the job of the shell bash zsh

it is his merit but i just wanted to highlight the importance of his answer as i was on the verge of abandoning ubuntu and shifting to mint after 4 hours of trying don t know why his answer was not highly rated

652621

i also look at other questions such as focus switching between separate x screens or links to dualscreenmouseutils and switchscreen but all of these seem to be concerned with separate screens per xorg.conf

on ubuntu and debian creating a deb package would be the best way to go as everything can be automated so that no end-user intervention is needed

653777
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
the only cases where package installation or upgrade are not automated are if the package has some configuration options that need input from the user mainly during installation only or if a configuration file was modified by the user and is also modified by a newer versioning of the package during upgrading

653777
ubuntu	debian
in terms of the packaging itself debian provides helper scripts that among other things automatically install any startup scripts you provide i don t think upstart is supported by their helper scripts since this is only used on ubuntu and start the service

there are other tools like puppet chef ansible which are mainly config tools

654221
versioning	upgrade
if using 14.04 lts you have until 2019 to upgrade to another release but 3 years before it goes eol 16.04 will arrive so that would be the next upgrade versioning when you want to move across lts releases

654248
daemon	cron
i now need to restart the cron daemon but none of the commands i m using are working for me

654249
stdout	stderr
the problem was that grive command was outputting to the error stream stderr file descriptor 2 which is normally used for passing error messages while the stdout file descriptor 1 is used for showing actual upon success output of any program strictly speaking

654249
stdout	stderr
will save the stdout of command to varablename not stderr

654249
stdout	stderr
this will save both the stdout and stderr to the variable in your case just stderr as there is no stdout so you would get desired result using

654249
stdout	stderr
also as there is no stdout you can save just the stderr to the variable generalization true for any such program

this isn t as important but also after installing the driver it takes at least a minute or two for my computer to recognize my wireless mouse and keyboard

gentoo	linux
a distro like gentoo linux however would download the source and build a package locally

654517
ubuntu	linux
for learning using a linux based os i would recommend to install ubuntu or a different distribution if you want on a desktop pc since ubuntu touch is still kind of experimental and it will be easier to get help for the well established desktop os

654601

the issue is i ran and received the package list that is to be upgrade and pressed enter the packages started to upgrade including kernel versioning to 3.16.0.45 i was running 3.16.0.44 before this and in the end it gets stuck updating masalla-icon-theme package i have ram counter enabled on my desktop and i can see that it just empties my ram completely during upgrade of this icon package and the system gets unresponsive can t even move my mouse so i have to do a reset on my computer

654603
put	get
get the app sensorsstatus and put it in gps mode and leave the phone on

654634
versioning	upgrade
the other unspoken advantage of a fresh install is that you have the opportunity to test the new versioning of ubuntu on your hardware before you upgrade

654634
versioning	upgrade
it is frustrating to upgrade via update manager and then discover you have a hardware problem can leave you stuck re-installing and updating the old versioning

654637
versioning	upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade does not upgrade ubuntu to the next versioning

654651
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
and why does ubuntu update them often compared to linux mint lm

654653
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
linux mint uses the same repositories as ubuntu and kernel upgrades are exactly at the same time in mint and ubuntu

654656
disk	ram
if a program is started but doesn t use some parts of its allocated ram it will be swapped to disk to make space for harddisk cache to improve harddisk performance

654683
dpkg	aptitude
still not completely sure what was going on didn t do anything to the system or add any new repos since the last update but after kernel upgrade any time i tried to use apt-get or aptitude or dpkg to install purge the stated in the op package the system froze cause of memory lack even if it was a .deb package

i mistakenly assumed it was the former because it was the only wine-related package i marked for installation at the same time that i also upgrade to the problematic kernel versioning

indeed packages to submitted to the debian or ubuntu repositories cannot have capital letters in their names

660276
chown	sudo
change ownership of the previous home directory with sudo chown -r newuser newuser home oldusername

660276

sudo passwd yourusername

660276

versioning	upgrade
this won t affect an after-the-fact conversion but it may cause you problems in the future if when you want to upgrade your ubuntu versioning or re-install the os

660567
ubuntu	linux
the key is that the linux kernel itself is an efi boot loader or has been since version 3.3.0 assuming the option has been compiled into the binary which is the case for ubuntu s kernels

660573
filesystems	ntfs
if you give the command apropos ntfs you will find there s a man page man mount.ntfs describing the command and driver which will be used when you mount a filesystems of type ntfs

660573
nautilus	fstab
if you just want all files to appear as if they belong to you just change the etc fstab entry field auto to auto permissions or if this doesnt work when mounting via nautilus you can also add where 1000 is whatever number the id command shows for your login

redhat	fedora
if you look at redhat or fedora they use yum

660687
ubuntu	debian
if you restrict yourself to applications installed using the debian ubuntu package management system dpkg apt-get synaptic are tools using it then the same set of tools can list what you have installed using the tools

ubuntu	debian
as for ubuntu - it s a clone of debian which is generally secure by default

660841
ubuntu	debian
however there are a few key differences between debian and ubuntu ubuntu is configured in a different manner to be more simple to learn and use for ordinary users than debian

660841
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has newer less tested packages with possible new not yet spotted bugs while debian has at least 1-year old frozen packages with only security and other major bugs fixed

660841
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has ppa user-mode repositories - it s easier to accidentally install rogue software through ppa than through traditional debian repositories

660841
ubuntu	linux	sudo	passwd
ubuntu sudo configuration allows possible rogue software to catch only the user s passwd to gain root privileges no separate root passwd like in classic linux systems

660841
ubuntu	debian
if you re looking for more secure alternative to ubuntu you should try debian

660865

this depends on whether whoever made the package honoured ubuntu debian s versioning of their packages

661042
versioning	upgrade
if say tomorrow vim 7.5 releases and somebody makes a package of that with versioning 7.5 instead of 2 7.5 it will be upgrade to 2 7.4.811-1 .

661152
sudo	passwd
this is where sudo comes in - it allows authorized users normally administrative users to run certain programs as root without having to know the root passwd

661152
sudo	passwd
similarly when you run gui programs that require root privileges the network configuration applet use graphical sudo gksudo and you will also be prompted for a passwd

661152

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i struggled trying to get my xbox360 wireless controllers working for many many hours in both ubuntu 12.04 12.04 and linux mint 17.2

667089
ubuntu	mint
a month ago or so i migrated from mint 17.2 to ubuntu 15.04 and am not regretting it at all apart from one thing that s pretty annoying and i truly hope it s changeable

667089
ubuntu	mint
i m using ibus for this both when using mint and on ubuntu

667089
ubuntu	mint
ibus on mint works slightly different on using ibus on ubuntu on mint it will remember the last language you have been using so when you use ctrl+space to go to the next language it will go to the next language in the list but and this is the great part of ibus in mint if you press ctrl+space again it will go to the language you just used before instead of going to the next language in the list

667089
ubuntu	mint
also on mint ibus will show a huge logo in the middle of the screen with the language are using and or are changing to while in ubuntu the icons are just sitting on the task-bar

667089
ubuntu	mint
do you know any way to change the way ibus works on ubuntu to the way it s working on mint

667169
mouse	keyboard
i d bought a combo keyboard and mouse just like yours with a usb receiver

667169

667298
osx	yosemite
i ve been trying to configure a vpn connection between a server running on xubuntu 14.04 and the client running on mac osx yosemite with no luck

667301
x86	64bit
software compiled for 64bit benefits from a number of optimisations that software compiled for x86 doesn t improving performance in some areas

667305
switching	screens
however selecting using the icon in the far upper right of the screens to select another user to switching to does absolutely nothing

667307
ubuntu	linux
chinese language by itself is great for web-surfing chinese internet but one of the most desired app for chinese users of linux is qq which of course isn t available however check out my other answer on how to install android version of qq in ubuntu

667334
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
however i can reach live desktop from the installation dvd and can install linux mint 17.2 64-bit cinnamon well.but the latter has mounting problem so i want to get ubuntu

667370
folder	directory
create a folder called new_disk in your samba share directory

667372
sudo	passwd
you can become root by typing sudo su in the mobile terminal and providing the lockscreen passwd if required

667401
ubuntu	linux
for reasons i don t claim to know however ubuntu s developers chose to put the files on a linux filesystem so ubuntu suffers from this problem

667404
ubuntu	linux
note that modifying a linux system file from windows is not recommended i had got a hard drive error on the first ubuntu boot after the modification from linux

667422
google-chrome	firefox
however it doesn t happen in firefox or even in google-chrome if i move the window to my secondary monitor

667422
ubuntu	mint
i ve already tried to install intel video driver http 01.org linuxgraphics but as it is developed to work properly in ubuntu i followed a tutorial to make it work in mint but my system crashed and i had to reinstall it from scratch

667434
post	get
i have tried this post - why does kworker cpu usage get so high

667443
sudo	passwd
root account by default is disabled in ubuntu but you can log in to root with your sudo passwd through sudo -i

667447
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have windows 8.1 ubuntu linux 15.04 and mint linux 17.2

667447
ubuntu	mint
i had windows somewhere in the middle of the boot menu ubuntu at bottom and mint at the top

667447
ubuntu	mint
is this because i installed mint after i installed ubuntu

667447
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu installation the one that installed the grub

667451
switching	screens
i have script that changes unity greeter wallpaper location every minut but problem is that it doesn t show new wallpaper unless i login in to any user account and switching back to login screens win+l

667554

i installed linux ubuntu 15.04 on my laptop hp stream 13 after it crashed

667583
centos	linux
i would also like to avoid things like awk perl crazy hacks that exploit bugs design-flaws in bash 4.2.xx and other weird stuff that probably wouldn t work properly if at all on a fresh install of e.g arch linux or centos

667597
post	get
my laptop lenovo z-5070 also i get nothing when i pressed ctrl + alt + f1.i tried every answers posted on similar post but nothing worked for me

667621
dpkg	apt
copy the downloaded debs to var cache apt archives instead of installing them with dpkg -i

667646
ubuntu	linux
if you need more knowledge about how ubuntu or linux in general lays out the directories and how they should be used see how to understand the ubuntu file system layout

667650
udp	tcp
i enabled udp and tcp forwarding on port 53 and dns started working again

667657
kde	gnome
i wanna install an app but i read in the requirement section that it s only run in gnome and kde desktop is that mean that can t work in ubuntu 15.04

667661
ubuntu	debian
could the ubuntu-gnome-desktop be a version of gnome optimised for ubuntu as opposed to debian

667675
sudo	passwd
you can now login as root with your root passwd or as any user who can use sudo to run commands as root

667678
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux ubuntu so i have a lot to learn about permissions and what not and i m pretty sure that is what i m tied up on at this time

667692
ubuntu	linux
i have on a usual setup 1xwindows 1xdebian or other linux 1x ubuntu

667704
google-chrome	firefox
all my repositories are updated and i cleared all the add-ons and what-nots from firefox google-chrome or similar uses too much memory for my system

667723
daemons	launchd
first you cannot run launchd a daemons without root access using upstart the init daemons of ubuntu

667723
daemons	launchd
another option is to launchd the application and see the error message by running directly network-manager daemons from your shell

667762
ubuntu	mint
but when you install two grub-based oses like ubuntu and mint the two grubs will fight for control of the boot process

667762
ubuntu	mint
in the case of both ubuntu and mint you can do this by booting the installer in its try before installing mode launch a terminal and typing sudo ubiquity -b

667780
versioning	upgrade
note the ppa works with versioning 12.04.1 through to 15.10 so make sure you upgrade your versioning to the .1 release if you haven t already

667790
versioning	upgrade
i have been trying all day to upgrade my versioning of libfuse-dev 2.9.2 to libfuse 2.9.4

667809
daemons	systemd
turned out for systemd the daemons process mysrv01 will have to fork a child process and better off close stdin

667834
for-loop	arrays
you can change that number at will or even use a for-loop to step through arrays and read numbers from arrays automatically

667842
hash	salt
the resulting output format the hash mechanism for sha-512 the random salt the eight bytes after the second dollar sign remainder is the payload

667849
chown	chmod
change owner and group to postgres and change access rights chown and chmod you can check the old settings from ls -la var lib postgresql.bak

667864
versioning	upgrade
reinstall the python-pip package with apt and afterwards upgrade your pip to the latest versioning with pip itself or easy_install if it is broken

667885
disk	ram
specifically i want to use a ram disk setup

667885
disk	ram
i ve just upgraded to 16gb of ram which is way more than most of my tasks will require for ordinary memory and i believe there are methods of making the disk dynamically resize according to the system s actual memory requirements or am i thinking about the swap file

667885
disk	ram
therefore is it still a good idea to have the swap partition set to twice the total ram size so a total of 32gb as the guide says if indeed the ram disk can resize according to memory requirements

667885
disk	ram
i have a maximised 8gb of ram and again i d like to use a fair portion of that for a ram disk

667885
disk	ram
should i resize the swap partition to account for both the envisioned ram disk and the optimisation of the ssd s write life cycle

667889
versioning	upgrade
as lucio mentioned in a comment you can always upgrade to a development versioning

667890
kerberos	ldap
i have re-configured the directive to use basic htpasswd authentication and ldap against the same active directory as configured for kerberos

667959
disk	ram
a swap partition on the other hand is a way for your computer to use hard disk space as a form of slow ram - when you run out of ram your computer can start to use the swap partition to keep things running

667963
cpu	processors
ubuntu doesn t detect a second core of your pentium 4 cpu because pentium 4 processors are single core cpus only not dual core cpus

668030
mouse	keyboard
looking in web for similar device point me that your device is 1d57 83ed xenta and it create two input devices a mouse and a keyboard labeled as rf 2.4g rf 2.4g with from your commands output

668040
stdout	stderr
on a different note if you want to grep something over both the stdout and stderr of tar use

668046
versioning	upgrade
i have versioning 2.25 and i want to upgrade to versioning 2.30

668085
versioning	upgrade
versioning a06 is imminent and will be a very welcome upgrade solves a keyboard problem which triggers repeaded keys

668117
ubuntu	linux
and before all this mess my linux install corrupted gnome shell so it refused to boot and i could only boot ubuntu regular desktop

668141
ubuntu	mint
ubuntu 13.10 mint 16 and up

668181
switching	screens
hence i decided to code a handy switcher script which lets me choose between mirrored output mirror and either left screens on right screens off or left screens off right screens on switching

668240
versioning	upgrade
now i want to upgrade to the latest versioning

668252
ubuntu	debian
to some extent the confusion is coming from the terminology used by kernel.org and debian ubuntu specifically the terms unstable testing stable

668252
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu then takes the source code from kernel.org and applies patches so the cycle repeats in what kernel.org would term a distribution kernel

668252
ubuntu	debian
the debian ubuntu distribution kernel goes through a similar cycle unstable - testing - stable

668256
ubuntu	linux
as another user pointed out in ubuntu and other linux distributions you can typically find man manual pages with the man command

668258
switching	screens
on boot up i get the error message could not switching on monitor configuation and als ocould not set configuration for crtc 63 my only resolution since my laptop screens was broken by a dropped wine bottle is to use an external monitor

668260
ubuntu	linux
in any case their web page said nothing about a linux ubuntu download

668297
sudo	passwd
i changed my passwd using sudo passwd

668299
sudo	passwd
if you really used command sudo passwd with no additional argument then you changed the passwd for the root account - not your user account

668299
sudo	passwd
to change a different user s account passwd you would need sudo - but would follow the command by the account name

668314
google-chrome	firefox
both computers experience extremely choppy playback of other users video in google hangouts in firefox chromium and google-chrome

668345
ubuntu	linux
i am relatively new to linux and i can not for the life of me find out how to make my printer s colors work correctly on ubuntu

668363
passwd	visudo	sudo	passwd
sudo visudo but it requires passwd

668388
daemons	launchd
only keyboard input methods which proposes to launchd ibus daemons and exits if you don t agree

668431
ubuntu	linux
this is because the linux kernel shipped with ubuntu desktop doesn t entirely support the hardware it s made for desktops

668434
ubuntu	linux
recently i decided to try out linux and chose ubuntu

668434
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i also tried the lts ubuntu and linux mint with same results which makes think it is something windows is doing

668489
pygtk	pygobject	gtk	pygobject
usc is written in python pygtk pygobject based on the toolkit gtk and the gnome application gnome-app-install

668501
exif	xmp
edit found info that gthumb can read exif iptc and xmp metadata so it might be reading any or all of the above three tags i mentioned for its description entry

668542
cpu	hyperthreading
that depends on what you want to do more threads means less frequency ie a 3ghz becomes split in two but better multi-tasking more threads and using full cores no hyperthreading is better for high cpu usage tasks ie games

668548
ubuntu	debian
this seems to be a known bug in ubuntu debian and i have currently no idea how to fix this

668576

starting from ubuntu 16.04 lts you can use the following script to switching between nvidia and intel s graphics cards and besides it corrects the video screens tearing on intels environment

668615

it just will not reconnect or if it did 5 minutes would be were i would put the time interval in which i would anticipate the connection would get dropped again

668657
folder	dir
the uid will change ownership of the folder and file dir mode changes the permissions

668660
versioning	upgrade
just run a search in synaptic for gimp it sounds like you d upgrade to a different lib than is required for the versioning you are trying to run and will have to allow it to revert or find a merged lib to run the package you are trying to install

668668
kerberos	ldap
have you considered installing kerberos and ldap with single sign-on

668675
ubuntu	debian
after successfully installing ubuntu i set up wifi and the sd-card reader following this debian wiki page

668677

the solution for this was to clear the .mozilla folder in the home directory which is hidden and it will make firefox have a fresh start

668681
mouse	keyboard
my keyboard and mouse don t respond when i am at the first stage of installation language selection

668681

one cool thing about my mac is i can switching workspaces while having a full screens youtube video running

to reduce the risk of this type of malware attack you could use udev rules to disable all usb devices by default and white list specific devices that you regularly use like your keyboard or mouse

because filesystems of windows is ntfs in ubuntu its different so your operating system may confuse this student transformations

there s no need for you to be manually creating directory in system paths or to change the permissions of any of the folder or files in those paths

it can be a pain having to keep entering the sudo passwd when requiring the installation of many packages so it would be nice if there exists a command or configuration that can be done to affect it usage period

you don t directly edit etc sudoers instead use visudo to do it

you can edit the etc sudoers file with sudo visudo be careful and add a line like

vmware	virtualbox
as stated by jasnan these are easiest and cheapest to do via virtualbox because there is zero licensing costs and users who are cheap are far more likely to use virtualbox than vmware which runs around 200 and the vagrant plugin that is required to use it with vmware is another 79 so a user who is 280 in is probably likely to have their own preferences on which box to use and they are probably happy with one of the many other ubuntu based images available

sudo	gnome-terminal
but if i issue the command sudo gnome-terminal -x sudo fio myjog | tee mylog the mylog file will be created without any text inside

682900
sudo	gnome-terminal
in this case | makes the shell interpret sudo gnome-terminal -x sudo fio myjog | tee mylog as two commands piped to each other sudo gnome-terminal -x sudo fio myjog and tee mylog the first one piped to the second one

682900
sudo	gnome-terminal
the result of this is that the output of sudo gnome-terminal -x sudo fio myjog is piped to tee mylog

682900
sudo	gnome-terminal
in this case since you want to use a pipe which is a bash and other shells feature you ll need to explicitly run the command in bash on a side note you don t need sudo to run gnome-terminal if you re going to use sudo in the argument to the -x -e options

for repositories that contain software that is not part of core ubuntu security.ubuntu.com ppa.launchpad.net dl.google.com etc you may want to simply comment them out from etc apt sources.list or the corresponding files in sources.list.d and then re-enable them once you have upgrade to a currently supported versioning

691190

since such old versioning are not supported and likely have security bugs that are not being patched you will probably want to upgrade to a current versioning asap

ubuntu and most linux systems usually does not require you to download random software off the internet

much of the jargon that you hear related to ubuntu may as well be shared with other linux distros such as launcher shell terminal release - all these can be found in other distros as well

what i would suggest you do is pick up a book related to ubuntu such as ubuntu unleashed the official ubuntu book or ubuntu linux toolbox and read through them

691727
switching	screens	dpkg	apt	rpm	yum
coming back to general distro information i would suggest learning what makes ubuntu different from other distros - such as package-managers ubuntu uses apt and dpkg while fedora and rhel used to have rpm and yum arch uses pacman default init system prior to 15.04 release ubuntu used upstart but now is switching to systemd desktop environment and desktop manager one is the actual desktop such as unity for ubuntu but the other is login screens such as lightdm client vs server

so whenever you run any command with sudo it will ask that user passwd not root

691936
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
unless you ve used older versions or other distros where root account is the standard way of doing privileged tasks it s probably better to continue the ubuntu way if you find a command that needs root privilege use sudo with your user passwd assuming you have a user account that s in the sudoers list

filesystems	ntfs
yes both can share the backup partition only if the filesystems is in ntfs or fat32 for portable drives and limited size because windows doesn t have the capability to read anything else except ntfs and fat32 but ubuntu can handle all

the sad thing here is that only very few people can think about installing more than one independent version of windows linux or one release of ubuntu onto one computer or a harddrive that is used with several computers and boots a different installation of the same os release on each computer

698485
folder	directory
if the directory folder under root directory does not exist and if you were working as root you have renamed moved the file file.txt as folder under

another point is if a directory folder does exist then look under that directory for the file folder file.txt

support for etc cron.d is included in the cron daemon itself which handles this location as the system-wide crontab spool

699527

the problem was that resolution was really small and it stayed small even when i enlarge it by view- switching to full screens

699534
sudo	passwd
i am able to sudo in console but the ui prompts for root passwd root has no passwd which i d like to keep that way - on other systems i ve always been prompted for my own passwd for sudo things in the background

filesystems	ntfs
all in all the ext4 filesystems is designed to minimize fragmentation file fragments being spread over the whole disk instead of being located in one sequence and head actuator movements so this does not only make it faster but also quieter than windows ntfs which starts at the partition beginning and always stuffs file fragments into the leftmost available holes

i am not sure if i somehow disabled the need for a sudo passwd which i would not want to do

700258
sudo	passwd
i ran grep root etc passwd then grep root etc shadow which denied access without entering sudo

700258

also why did the sudo passwd suddenly stop needing to be entered for editing my files

should i upgrade to get latest feature with better performance or run this versioning

700296
disk	ram
my specifications are 128 mb hard disk drive 512 mb ram and 500 mhz cpu

700303
installation	upgrade
the download time savings achieved by using a mini iso can be significant as only current packages are downloaded so there is no need to upgrade packages immediately after installation

700306
kde	gnome
i have both gnome and kde installed in my ubuntu but mostly i use kde

700307

so first you need to add clang-3.5 or clang++-3.5 as alternatives to gcc and g++

700362
g++	gcc
if at any time you need to switch back to gcc or g++ you can use the --config option

700398
cifs	smb

700401
ubuntu	linux
however you are using ubuntu linux and have had no need of the old rc.local way of doing things for the past ten years

700408
ubuntu	debian
if you re looking to download software and you are running ubuntu debian based you will use a .deb package

700440
disk	ram
has the kernel and initial ram disk residing on the host machine instead of in the virtual machine image

700440
disk	ram
where do i get the appropriate kernel and initial ram disk files

700479
folder	directory
the order of paths in this variable indicates the order in which the command will be searched in case there is a program by the same name in multiple directory the one located in the folder closest to the beginning of the list left side will be executed

700488

start the torrentfile in that folder and download it with your favorite torrent downloader then place the downloaded file in that directory

700520
ethernet	wireless
it does not show you a wireless connection but is connected internally as ethernet

700557
wan	lan
use a lan port on the router instead of it s wan port to avoid a double-nat situation

700569
versioning	upgrade
so i need to upgrade it to this versioning but as the only files provided there are .dsc .orig.tar.gz and .debian.tar.xz i m not too sure how to upgrade it to this versioning using them.

700569

so my question here is how do i upgrade it to that versioning

700616

700917
kde	kubuntu
now i have both lubuntu lxde and kubuntu kde and want to remove lubuntu can i do it

700921
vmware	virtualbox
install a virtual machine manager such as vmware or virtualbox load ubuntu 16.04 into that and within the virtual machine test all of your applications

700934
ubuntu	linux
once you set up a separate partition for ubuntu and probably another much smaller space for linux swap then you can dual-boot by installing ubuntu to that partition you set aside for it

700955
sudo	passwd
i ve attempted to do this from command line but even with the sudo passwd do not get access while trying to decrypt from there access denied or volume not present message

701011
ethernet	wireless
when i installed ubuntu i got internet disconnected inside the os never recognize wireless just detects ethernet i m frustrated vecause i like ubuntu so much

701025
folder	directory
you can have two different folder by those names on linux but they would be the same directory in windows

701106
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
now my hard drive partition wise is a mess and linux mint 17.2 is so glitchy for me i just wanted ubuntu

701112
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if you have a seperate home partition you can replace your linux mint partition and mount your old home partition in your new ubuntu install

701112
ubuntu	mint
after following these steps replace your mint install with a new ubuntu install

701119
sudo	passwd
when reacting qickly to this and pressing control+alt+f1 it is possible to enter the non-gui logon screen enter the username and passwd and restart lightdm with sudo service lightdm restart

ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and just started using ubuntu 14.04

jobs	cron
cron jobs are run by the user cron in a restricted environement some env var like ssh_auth_sock are missing so ssh-agent does not work

701345
ubuntu	debian
i ve read that ubuntu ie 15.10 takes its code from debian unstable

701345
ubuntu	debian
i d like to move from debian to ubuntu server with lts so i don t have to do yearly upgrades and instead hold off for 2-3 years

701349
ubuntu	debian
i switched to ubuntu because of issues finding the latest packages with debian

701364
ubuntu	debian
it s true technically that ubuntu lts is based on a snapshot of debian testing whereas other ubuntu releases are based on debian unstable

701364
ubuntu	debian
after ubuntu branches off the packages it imports from debian ubuntu and debian then independently continue the process of fixing and tracking bugs and getting packages ready for release following their own separate processes and timelines

701364
ubuntu	debian
in the case of ubuntu lts it branches off from debian at a later stage in debian s process once debian s branched it off into debian testing - implying ubuntu will benefit from more of debian s own testing and bug fixing prior to the point at which ubuntu s process starts

701364
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has different release goals and requirements to debian which indicates that an ubuntu lts won t necessarily be equivalent to a debian stable

701364
ubuntu	debian
and lastly there are quite a few packages in ubuntu that are not sourced from debian at all for commercial or licensing reasons or because they are ubuntu specific

701392
ubuntu	linux
as i ve progressed in my ubuntu and linux studies i ve discovered a variety of approaches and deepened my understanding of how setting a background works in ubuntu

701393

i m a new linux ubuntu user

701393

i want to mount that hard disk to ubuntu linux

701396
filesystems	fat
there s a chance it s an unsupported filesystems but most pre-formatted drives out there are some version of fat which is very well supported in linux

701449
folder	directory
because relative directory addressing is start from the current folder of config file

701455
filesystems	ntfs
there is no best for anything but if i would have been given the choice between ext4 and ntfs for a samba share on an ubuntu server i d go for an ext4 filesystems as that is the one the kernel understands best and has better performance

701459

if x crashed or could not reply with black screens you can switching to the tty1 6 with ctrl + alt + 1 6

kde	gnome	kde	cinnamon	cinnamon	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
disclaimer i haven t dabble into it for some time so don t know if what i say applies to unity and cinnamon most of desktop environments provide their own display manager xfce - xdm kde plasma - kdm old gnome - gdm

701463
kubuntu	gnome
kubuntu xubuntu ubuntu gnome etc. that to install meta packages like xubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop iirc

701463
kde	gnome
window manager desktop environment desktop manager - i m using those interchangeable i know that from purist point of view they are not the same but here generally refer to your desktop - be it unity kde gnome fluxbox or whatever else

701465
ubuntu	linux
install ubuntu from iso image directly from hard disk of a system running linux

701502
sudo	passwd
unless the filesystem is encrypted you should only have to use the passwd for sudo on the new os

701511
versioning	upgrade
long answer in theory you can parse files then purge all packages that were installed after initial install and then downgrade packages check the earliest upgrade to check what was the original versioning installed .

701518
folder	directory
is expanded to the list of folder files ending with .txt in the current working directory since there are only files folder ending with .txt are not a concern

701535
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to install many google-chrome and firefox versions for one user in ubuntu

701536
fflush	gets
first depending on the implementation of your python interpreter if you opened a file with write access you can not be sure that your modifications got fflush to the disk until you either manually induce it or the file handler gets closed

701551
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu 14.04 netsurf version is 2.9-2 which is slightly newer than the debian squeeze binary version 2.7 provided by the official website

701559
ubuntu	mint
i have been using mint for a few years and have recently switched to ubuntu

701564
cpu	processors
installing 32bit libs works on a 64bit processors because 64bit is a superset of 32bit cpu instructions

701565
mutt	thunderbird
i also don t want to use a different mail client like thunderbird i want to use mutt or maybe some other only for this purpose

701842
folder	directory
i would like to mirror an http directory into a local folder with wget

701848
folder	directory
this will recursively download or basically cp -r the project folder from the website to a new directory named project

701885
versioning	upgrade
if it s installed and there is a newer versioning available it will do an upgrade unless the package is held in which case things are more complex

701891
kubuntu	gnome
i suggest you to use a flavour with less graphical requirements such as kubuntu without effects xubuntu lubuntu ubuntu gnome flashback ubuntu mate.

701972
folder	directory
notice that the directory tree will be flattened in the bak folder so maybe using an archive format would be better

701972
bash	zsh
it needs zsh because i m lazy and didn t try to adapt to the array structure of bash but surely someone here can do that hint hint .

701989
kate	nano	kate	gedit	gedit	nano
use nano leafpad or kate if you haven t gedit

702047
versioning	upgrade
that one tends to be rock solid after a few months of release and only offers the next lts versioning as an upgrade path by default

702050
versioning	upgrade
for me it s not a viable solution as i have upgrade to ubuntu 16.04 and the fglrx is not available for that versioning

702050
ubuntu	linux
i saw some hints of radeon mst-related changes in linux kernel 4.6 change logs so i m hoping that brings some improvement with ubuntu 16.10

if there are usable data within the image with a other working machine or live system with support for reading hfs+ filesystems you can maybe read some remaining data from the image by.

as for the wifi adapter i ve found that even if the wireless adapter isn t working initially if you install the os and update it through ethernet it should fix your problem

btrfs is not the only linux filesystems that has this functionality but it s probably the most general example

702994
h.265	hevc
yet another alternative - if you have google chrome installed - is to add install h.265 hevc player in to your chrome browser

702994
h.265	hevc
this will cause google chrome to show you its installed apps so you can run h.265 hevc player straight from there

702994
h.265	hevc
by using this alternative method there s no need to install any library codec player plugin or whatever because everything you need for h.265 hevc playback support is already embedded in the h.265 hevc player

702994
h.265	hevc
i ve already used h.265 hevc player to watch a couple of two-hour-long h.265 hevc encoded movies and i didn t experience any playback issue

xfce	gnome
gnome terminal itself doesn t provide a way to change the setting unlike other vte-based terminals like xfce terminal

however devstack is not so stable and sometimes the connection between opendaylight and openstack breaks which is cumbersome so i decided to use more stable environment

openstack	opendaylight
and if i want to integrate openstack with opendaylight i have to also modify etc neutron plugins ml2 ml2_conf.ini for example

though there was such a large amount of traffic mostly udp and tcp but some icmps as well that it was hard to really see anything

703576
disk	ram
ever since i upgraded to 15.10 fdisk -l reports 16 ram disk dev ram0 .

703584
disk	ram
it s kind of a preparatory action for the case that the ram disk should be required

703584
disk	ram
why suddenly 16 ram disk are available in wily can be explained only with difficulty

703584
disk	ram
i have tested the default ram disk on

703584

centos 7 â no ram disk

703584

the ram disk driver is a way to use main system memory as a block device

703584

the ram disk dynamically grows as more space is required

703584

vpn	lan
lan isp dns are not removed and remain available as possible dns plus the vpn dns

703665

my solution is to reset the vpn dns removing lan dns by using a network manager script dispatcher calling dbus to update dnsmasq

703674
folder	directory
it speaks about giv ing the tomcat user write access to the conf directory while changing the folder s permissions

703676

i had the same problem dell m6800 nvidia graphics and 512 gb ssd but 16gb ram and no extra hard disk

703800

as soon as i let it get to gnome or kde desktop the system hangs

703823
daemons	launchd
the non-linux host will use a tinycore-based bm called boot2docker in it you can run docker daemons and launchd any container based on any image you want ubuntu or otherwise

you still need sudo to mount and unmount your devices but no passwd

switching	screens
when i switching in additional driver from x.org x server to fglrx update dota2 was crash when loading screens to play the game

704218
versioning	upgrade
either upgrade ibus to versioning 1.5.11 or add to your .profile then restart a session

704244

changing the time of running weekly cron jobs won t help for the reasons you stated

the wireless and ethernet drivers were working all fine for about one month

704247
ethernet	wireless
both ethernet and wireless are not working all of a sudden

704255
777	tmp
i somehow managed to give 777 permissions to tmp

704276
kde	kubuntu
you might want to consider using kubuntu kde version of ubuntu i switched to kubuntu for the same specific reason kubuntu is an official fork of ubuntu and new versions are released with ubuntu almost all apps working on ubuntu work on kubuntu as well

704283
ubuntu	linux
so everytime i try to boot in ubuntu gnome 14 usb mounted image either pc reboots after noveau errors or when i get to installation after mounting again tge iso file it fails and reboots when installing grub on dev sda4 leading to a non acessible linux

704292
mouse	keyboard
the chromium wheel smooth scroller extension gives you fine-grained control over how your mouse wheel and keyboard perform scrolling in google chrome and the chromium browser

704292
mouse	keyboard
unfortunately setting a low step size will not provide a very fast maximum speed so you may need to sacrifice your keyboard to perform small scrolls and keep your mouse for general scrolling

704312
switching	screens
basically i d like to automate screens s behavior some because having a two part keystroke for splitting then another for switching to then another for starting up bash in this window seems to me like something that should be one keystroke

704326
ubuntu	debian
to put it simply there s no ubuntu or debian based distro that will fit the size requirements you re stating

704326
ubuntu	debian
however it is not ubuntu nor debian based to my knowledge

704326
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
if your intent is to have ubuntu or debian have your vm provision 10gb max for the virtual disk and let it expand in size as needed - this will give it ample space from the linux point of view but it will take at most 10gb + amount of vram you assign when you save the system

i need to automatically assign every new user that gets created a certain folder sales in their home directory

704373

when you add the user tim tim automatically gets a folder named sales in his home directory

704374
ubuntu	linux
hi i am newbie in linux ubuntu and have some problem with chrome

704377
folder	directory
if you are sure that you need the sales folder on every new user account s home directory you can just create the folder in etc skel

704379
sudo	passwd
sudo s purpose is not passwd related but instead to give certain users root-ish capabilities while restricting others over a machine without requiring them to present the root login passwd key security token etc

704379
sudo	passwd
in regards to the passwd in reality it s your user account s passwd that sudo requires the very same one you would use to log in if autologin is not enabled. and that passwd has the same vulnerabilities as any other passwd out there

704381
folder	directory
i think that you messed around with sudo where you should not have done and therefore the owner of some folder in your home directory are wrong

704388
folder	directory
a relatively simple alternative would be to create a starter in etc xdg autostart that will create a folder in any user s home directory on log in only if the folder does not exist yet

704388
folder	directory
this will create a folder sales in the home directory of any user once he or she logs in only if it doesn t exist

704404
versioning	upgrade
though for this to work you will need to be on ubuntu gnome 15.10 as it will upgrade you to the next stable gnome shell versioning available to your system and for 15.10 that is gnome shell 3.18

i have tried probably almost all combinations of installing pyside pyqt5 numpy scipy matplotlib ipython pylab via pip aptitude

then i installed the latest ubuntu and deleted the old debian in the process

stdout	stderr
the standard streams also have dev stdin dev stdout and dev stderr which are symbolic links again etc...

704616
width	height
dialog --inputbox text height width

704616
stdout	stderr
redirects afterwards the command s stream 2 stderr to stream 1 stdout

704616
stdout	stderr
that means that everything the command prints to stdout now appears in stream 3 while everything that was intended to show up on stderr now gets redirected to stdout

704616
stdout	stderr
so the entire line displays a text prompt on stdout which got redirected to stream 3 which the shell again redirects back to stdout in the end - see the command and assigns the entered data returned through stderr then redirected to stdout to the bash variable result

704616
stdout	stderr
we redirect the original stderr of the command where the dialogue window s user input gets returned to stdout afterwards

704616
stdout	stderr
now we can capture the stdout which holds the redirected data from stderr and store it in our variable

704642
ubuntu	linux
the relevant change i did was moving a disk with an old linux deepin installation from a pc that i sold to the same machine with ubuntu

704643
stdout	stderr
if you read man page for dialog there is option --output-fd which allows you to explicitly set where the output goes stdout 1 stderr 2 instead of by default going to stderr

the rotated image has obviously a width of 3456 and a height of 5184 so it is a portrait image

based on this you may be able to technically force a gcc and g++ version to be made available temporarily by the methodology in my now-deleted answer.

under options- shared folder you can add a directory from your host machine that you would like to be able to use on your guest machine

713137

i m trying ubuntu on my tp300l asus laptop but it is not recognizing the network driver so i can t even find drivers for other devices and i searched on the internet but couldn t find any drivers for linux

713163
dpkg	apt
you don t replace or remove dpkg apt apt-get because the os won t work properly

713163
dpkg	apt
dpkg is the actual backend apt apt-get just is a nicer way of working with it

713163
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is debian based so it uses apt-get and .deb debian style packages

713163
ubuntu	debian
it is not possible to use rpm as a stand in replacement for apt-get and debian packaging formats on ubuntu or debian for that matter

713163
centos	linux	rpm	yum	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	debian	centos	debian	linux
if you want rpm as your primary packages format so you can use yum and such instead then you picked the wrong operating system and wrong os family and should have decided on the centos rhel family and not the ubuntu debian family of linux distributions

713169
nautilus	fstab
after a crash when i opened nemo nautilus i didn t see any of the free standing drives partitions not already mounted by etc fstab at startup

ok i have an asus x55la-hi31103j and it came with windows 10 installed but i didnt like it so i made a bootable usb wit linux ubuntu and installed that without problems

713191
ubuntu	linux
it would appear however that my troubles installing ubuntu are not related to ubuntu but rather that when trying out an installation of manjaro linux a few days ago i accidentally selected encrypt disk and use lvm and i assumed that a simple fresh partition table would make the encryptedness go away

713224
versioning	upgrade
edit perhaps your versioning of libgdk is outdated and could be upgrade via

713233
disk	ram
hence i would like this installation to only write to disk or ram

713245

single-quotes	double-quotes
the awk command uses field separators with the -f command and to set it to use double-quotes you type it in with single-quotes around it like -f

713297
libpcap	wireshark
you have to go through an elaborate dance involving creating new interfaces associated with the real wi-fi interface and setting them up as monitor-mode interfaces and that involves netlink and the easy way of doing netlink involves a library that has apparently changed its api 3 times in incompatible ways so linking libpcap with libnl is a bad idea and few if any distributions do it so turning monitor mode on in tcpdump wireshark tshark etc

713306
ubuntu	linux
the ubuntu core is providing us a nice startup for playing with linux

713338
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade

dnf	yum
yum was the equivalent to apt in rpm-based distros like fedora but it was replaced in fedora with dnf

713523
umask	mount

713701
mouse	keyboard
this is only partially correct as it only keeps the system from suspending when the controller is being used as a keyboard or mouse

713770
rss	feed
perhaps a possible direction for the push notifications is to have something monitor the rss feed on and then trigger the update process a few minutes after a new item is added to the feed

713770
rss	feed
i notice that there is now a way for servers to push changes of rss feed to clients through

713870
kerberos	ldap
ms ad is basicly a combination of ldap kerberos and scripts and directories distributed by cif smb with some gui on top

nautilus	fstab
it is possible to downgrade nautilus but a better solution is mounting that partition via fstab in a specific directory and then add that directory as a bookmark in nautilus

714557
cinnamon	gnome
you can try nemo a nautilus fork for cinnamon a de based on gnome gtk+ 3 instead

714576
ubuntu	linux
i am very new to ubuntu and linux but at one time i was familiar with dos which i was advised would help me with linux but the learning process for me is slow

714585
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint

714759
mp3	wav
also the qaudiorecorder class outputted only wav files even i carefully defined the parameters for mp3 or vorbis

714837
folder	directory
one other thing to note here is that if joomla or some other program does need to modify content in the var www html my_site folder i d recommend manually adding the write permissions to those files directory only

714851
vmware	virtualbox
i moved an ubuntu 15.10 vm from virtualbox v5 where it had a good install of virtualbox guest additions to vmware via export-import

the desktop environment is a bit faster in lubuntu but using google-chrome or firefox seems to be in fact slower in lubuntu than in kubuntu which is very puzzling

714915

715441
dpkg	apt
most users don t notice the problem until boot is full and they are getting apt and dpkg no-space-left-on-device errors

715441
dpkg	apt
if boot is full and apt actions fail with the dpkg error no space left on device then it is too late to use autoremove

715441
dpkg	apt
the best practice here is to use uname and dpkg to remove one or two old kernels freeing space for apt to complete it s queued actions

715441
dpkg	apt
if you still encounter apt and or dpkg errors seek one-on-one help in the ubuntu support channels

fat	hfs+
afaik the --folder option to bless works when installing to an hfs+ volume but not when installing to a fat volume

716822
ubuntu	linux
macs can also boot from hfs+ volumes but i m not sure of the rules for booting them from external disks using hfs+. ordinarily the boot loader for ubuntu will be grub 2 but it could be something else including elilo refind gummiboot or even a linux kernel

716830
debian	linux
most linux distributions use gnu utilities that s why we should call them gnu linux and their own commands such as debian s apt system

this question asked for exif but image metadata has at least three standards that can be attached to images exif xmp and iptc

716859
exif	xmp
the big difference here being that the keywords in xmp and iptc aren t in exif at all and so if i only looked there i d think it didn t have keywords

716877

since the filesystems is translated to cifs or smb it will not matter which filesystems you use as long as it is accessible by the router for this ntfs will be just fine

ubuntu	linux
it s suppose to be a script to automatically install all the kali linux tools to an ubuntu desktop

716895

due to the current docker 1.9.1 + linux kernel bug 18180 which is buried deep in a linux kernel bug related to aufs i was looking to move my ubuntu 14.04 installation of docker 1.9.1 down to docker 1.8.3 but also have it auto-start on boot like the apt installer would have done.

folder	directory
the root folder is the super user s home directory

717200
ubuntu	linux
on gnu linux there is the standard root user which always exists this is different from your user account that you created when you installed ubuntu

717200
sudo	passwd
you can login as root sudo -s or sudo su - do this providing a root shell additionally you could set the root passwd sudo passwd root and then you could log in as root like a normal user - don t do this

717201
ubuntu	linux
i installed keepalived on two linux server ubuntu 14.04

717202
sudo	passwd
the root user has no passwd set on ubuntu and you are discouraged from using the root user in preference of the sudo command which allows you to run programs as a super user

717250
ubuntu	linux
that s where most of gpt fdisk s 830x codes originate -- they re part of the discoverable partitions specification which is a freedesktop systemd initiative. currently ubuntu is just using the main linux filesystem type code 8300 in gpt fdisk for filesystems plus the appropriate codes for lvm raid swap etc

the packages for ruby are dependent on the versioning of ruby in that repository so an upgrade of the distribution requires you to also upgrade the ruby to what s in that distro and then move your environment over to see if it works

what you can do is either install an older version of the kernel without this problem linux version 3.19 or try if it works with a live ubuntu 14.04 and in case of a positive result keep ubuntu 14.04

i checked this by starting on debian and verifying the uuid not found by ubuntu was the one that timed out in 1m 30s

719796

back to ubuntu as superuser i commented out the original uuid line for the swap partition and inserted the same line with the new uuid set by debian and that was it

719819
redhat	fedora
the solution which kind of works for me right now is using spice for audio and the ich6 as setting for the sound card but because of a known bug in spice which i could only find reported for fedora and redhat the audio is pretty bad and the only partial workaround is to put in my vm domain config

719859

folder	directory	ubuntu	linux
the way i did it was to just copy the tox folder - .config tox - save the folder in the cloud or usb drive and after reinstalling your ubuntu linux machine or you have a new one copy the same folder in the same directory .config tox

719867
sudo	passwd
tried both the gui and sudo passwd

719879
folder	directory
so firstly copy the folder .playonlinux to the new directory

719916

so you might say that i should just create a folder in files and call it con and then have the config file called fig1.conf however the server doesn t even currently allow the creation of new directory or anything really.

720144
stdout	stderr
while doing service --status-all | grep mysql you are running grep over only the stdout of service --status-all that s why everything showing on stderr are being shown along with the possible output of grep

720144

to get only the desired result redirect both run redirect both stdout and stderr to grep

maybe there s a way to do that in bash however perhaps it was zsh

dpkg	apt
although you can tell apt to remove the package called apt what it does is checks the reverse dependencies of the apt package take note of those packages and orders dpkg to remove them

722957
dpkg	apt
even without apt you can use dpkg to install remove or upgrade packages just that it will be more painful to track dependencies and upgrades needed which is the raison d ãªtre of apt

for all these reasons any filesystems that s to be used only from linux should be linux-native ext2 3 4fs xfs jfs reiserfs or btrfs to name the most popular current ones

the problem is that many upgrade users will have a versioning of click installed with a versioning number under their pip or pip3 repository these aren t managed by apt and they take priority when python s import keyword is invoked

723067

depending of what kind of problems you have you can try to upgrade to plasma 5.4.3 and kde applications 15.08.3 with adding the ppa ppa kubuntu-ppa ppa see kubuntu news

now once you see the folder that is taking up all your space you can move the files to a directory on your home folder and make a symbolic link to it as such for instance if games is the oversize folder

you could do that with any folder from the usr directory

sudo passwd newuser

723305

dpkg	apt
apt and dpkg are themselves packages and they are meant to be able to be updated via themselves so there are provisions for removal

i think you should run a linux image ubuntu for example and run it as a live usb key cd from your laptop which will be better for card reader

723385
daemons	systemd
these users typically have no passwords associated with it as it is designed to be used by systemd daemons and services rather than users

723393
daemons	systemd
service start and systemctl start are tool provided by the init systemd upstart and systemd respectively and as such they start daemons which are very different from regular programms in that they run in the background and the user has little control over them directly

723393
daemons	systemd
for example the cupsd common unix printing systemd daemons must run on a systemd in the background in order to be able to print

723409
folder	directory
folder inside that directory are locally-installed compiled or locally installed by hand programs libraries and dependent files which you should not mess with without good reason

723415

in most cases this is not as insecure as you think - many hardened servers have a far shorter timeout or in my case on my servers i actually configure it for an instant timeout after sudo is executed requiring the passwd for each sudo command made

723419
sudo	passwd
sudo settings by default have 15 minutes time out before reprompting for passwd however one can change it to always ask for passwd every time you call something with sudo

723724
ubuntu	linux
you will need to boot from a live session of ubuntu or any other linux distro from a usb or a burned disk

since trusty the android-tools-adb and android-tools-fastboot packages in the universe repository provide respectively adb and fastboot

723742

if you let the ubuntu installer use the entire disk then at least your bootloader is messed up with the linux grub best case scenario however your files may be gone

i have an issue with volume control as the playlist goes to a new song the global volume master and pcm is boosted up but as the playlist progress to another ogg mp3 track the volume is not restored and the playout is now too loud

723872
folder	directory
often these local files are in a hidden folder starting with a dot in your home directory

723876
ubuntu	centos
if you have a centos live cd you could try installing grub from that since sometimes ubuntu can have issues reading the file systems used by redhat distros while cent can usually read ext4

723901
ubuntu	centos
after rebooting the computer i got the centos grub menu which also listed ubuntu

723928
ubuntu	linux
by the way since you said you previously had ubuntu installed when you perform your new ubuntu install if you choose the option not to reformat your install partition it will preserve the personal data you had from your previous linux install

after your new install of ubuntu you can configure grub to default to booting to your preferred os windows or linux

to remedy this you may need to use the --rsync-path sudo rsync option on the receiving machine and make sure that the sudo user can complete a sudo rsync command without entering a passwd

since this computer will be for a development environment but probably cool with having a pre-release versioning it really just comes down to what s less of a pain to upgrade

filesystems	fat
the first of these explanations is the one you should hope for since it means that the fat filesystems data should be intact

727193
filesystems	fat	fat	umount
in this case the first step to recovery is to back up the partition you may need to explicitly specify its filesystems type to mount it in ubuntu as in sudo mount dev sda4 -t vfat mnt umount it create a fresh fat filesystems on it sudo mkdosfs dev sda4 re-mount it and restore the backed-up files

727193
filesystems	fat
you can change s to some other drive identifier if you like. of course your boot repair output already reveals that some linux tools like blkid don t see a fat filesystems on the disk but it could still be readable by the kernel if you tell it to use the vfat driver as in the mount dev sda4 -t vfat mnt command i presented earlier

732353
sudo	passwd
if set sudo will prompt for the root passwd instead of the passwd of the invoking user when running a command or editing a file

732353
sudo	passwd
if set sudo will prompt for the passwd of the user specified by the -u option defaults to root instead of the passwd of the invoking user when running a command or editing a file

732353
sudo	passwd
if set sudo will prompt for the passwd of the user defined by the runas_default option defaults to root instead of the passwd of the invoking user when running a command or editing a file

732360
versioning	upgrade
the system is 15.04 i would assume it is an installed versioning and not an upgrade

732391
sudo	passwd
although as you need to use sudo to execute the init.d script this won t work unless you ve set up sudo usage with no passwd for that command

732411
mouse	keyboard
neither moving the mouse or hitting any key on the keyboard has any effect however the computer is still running

732456
mouse	keyboard
the fixmouse script provided by mr back-up does not work because sometimes the keyboard entry of the mouse appears with the wrong name in xinput in my case it shows

732506
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade between distro versioning .list files in etc apt sources.list.d get commented out

732506
ubuntu	debian
i guess ubuntu debian

732507
ubuntu	debian
imho the graphical tools are not as reliable as the command line and or the debian live scripts debian live scripts are in the ubuntu repoitories

732521
folder	directory
just created a folder name .gimp-2.8 in my home directory

732524
mouse	keyboard
now whenever i turn off my tv and let it sit for a while when i turn the tv back on there is no video signal even after keyboard mouse input there is no signal

732543
vmware	virtualbox
if it works like in my case you can turn it on again cause it affects the performance of the virtual machines you may use with vmware or virtualbox

732563
sudo	passwd
trying sudo -s asks for my passwd

732566
sudo	passwd
in case you cannot remeber your passwd anymore or are not part of the sudo group you won t be able to sudo anymore

732592
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu 11.10 and when i open the bash history manually by finding the file it opens with something known as gedit

732619
installation	upgrade
since this is a fresh installation you should at least update and upgrade the local packages if you haven t done it already

732620
wan	lan
the nominal question i asked above was how i could get the lxc containers to come up on the maas lan dhcp 10.207.39.0 24 network instead of the router wan dhcp 192.168.1.0 24 network

732620
wan	lan
but in this two-network lan wan setup what is needed is ultimately networking to both networks so in this scenario routing is used

732620
ready	each
containers should go to fully deployed ready status in less than 5 minutes each

732620
ready	each
i deploy them one-at-at-time and i wait for each one to reach ready status

732700
folder	dir
a dir or ls command here shows you all of its system folder and a few files

732700
ubuntu	linux
i got off windows over a decade ago because it is the biggest pc software target in the world and people who stick to it don t even know that they have great alternatives in linux like ubuntu

732736
freebsd	linux
and special tests for linux and freebsd

732758
ubuntu	debian
i am looking for a script that automates the conversion of a debian apt-package including dependencies to a snap package for ubuntu core touch

732814
installation	upgrade
i assume that you upgrade manually using the installation file from libreoffice

732814
versioning	upgrade
when the new libreoffice edition arrives - you can upgrade to versioning 5.1 as usual

732823
folder	directory
that will sync all pdf ods-files of sub- directory with the folder home ms newdir2 without maintaining directory in a single rsync-structure

732824
folder	directory
just place it inside the .config folder of your home directory

732874
filesystems	btrfs
in a similar fashion there are fatlabel exfatlabel ntfslabel btrfs filesystems label swaplabel for other filesystems types with the same command syntax

732889
mouse	trackpad
you can teach linux to recognise the magic mouse 2 and load the hid_magicmouse module as it would for the original magic mouse and trackpad by modifying the udev and modprobe configs

732929
postfix	dovecot
i have a ubuntu 15.10 cloud mail server postfix dovecot mysql accessed via ssh

i want to do it on a live usb sitck but there s no live on ubuntu server and there s no persistent mode in debian live standard so the questions are.

733289
postfix	dovecot
i installed configured at my ubuntu 14.04 lts server the mailserver with postfix and dovecot

733304
ubuntu	linux
is there any way to make a frugal installation like puppy linux does of ubuntu or lubuntu since it s less demanding in ram or to force the fully installed version to preload during boot the mostly often used parts of it to ram in order to enhance the performance

733304
disk	ram
i suppose that what s slowing down the system the most are the parts that are often read and written so i guess i m looking for a way to use a part of ram as a virtual disk for this purpose

arch linux machine connecting to a windows xp one but i d suspect it would be a problem for ubuntu to newer windowses as well

733448
umount	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
the suggested solution is to umount the filesystems run btrfs check to confirm the issue and check for other problematic directories and finally run btrfs check --repair to fix

733468
sudo	passwd
i don t know the passwd for the super user root so i tried sudo command

733513

i retried to build my persistent linux usb stick now ubuntu 16.04 is out

733521

they offer pptp l2tp openvpn tcp openvpn udp and socks5

733525
ethernet	wireless
edit it also needs to be noted that i can t connect to wifi either the drivers aren t coming up or i just don t know the correct way to bring them up. my computer also doesn t have an ethernet or dvd drive so its a wireless card and usb only

733551
dpkg	apt
then download and manually install the apt package as follows look at your etc apt sources.list to find the correct mirror then go to that mirror to the pool main a apt directory download the correct .deb file for your architecture and install it with sudo dpkg -i apt-xxx.deb

734648
sudo	passwd
otherwise you would have to give your sudo passwd to the script in some way which is bad

734652
stdout	stderr
the pipe redirects both output streams stderr standard error and stdout standard output of the command left of it to the stdin standard input of the command on the right

734652

thanks muru for teaching me about the to redirect both stdout and stderr

734654

everything was fine on amazon linux however after migration to ubuntu there is a problem now

734678
min	max
in header it concerns control min max close buttons gradient and shadow of top panel and wi-fi sound language switcher icons

734703
ubuntu	linux
you should install ubuntu to a primary partition and even if you use lvm you should create a linux swap partition somewhere 1

734747
ubuntu	linuxmint
see how to add linuxmint repositories to ubuntu

734768
sudo	passwd
basically i want to make sure that this can t happen and it will still ask for the root passwd if you try to su root or sudo su

734798
ubuntu	linux
it looks like there is some difference in default handling of sighup between amazon linux and ubuntu 14.04 on ec2

734809
sudo	passwd
this will have sudo ask for a root passwd and not the current user passwd

734809
sudoers	visudo
always use visudo to edit your sudoers file it will validate changes

734810
ubuntu	linux
because i m not allowed to touch the main node i have an older version of scientific linux on it and ubuntu 14.04 on my nodes

734828
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu and derivatives

734828
ubuntu	debian
note while the apt package is built against debian wheezy it is compatible with a number of debian derivatives including ubuntu which means you can use the same repository across all these distributions

734828
ubuntu	debian
mod_mono ubuntu 13.10 and later debian 8.0 and later

734828
ubuntu	debian
to enable mod_mono installation on ubuntu 13.10 and later and debian 8.0 and later and their derivatives you will need to add a second repository to your system in addition to the generic debian ubuntu repository above if you donâ t use sudo be sure to switch to root

734828
ubuntu	debian
to enable installation on older ubuntu releases such as ubuntu 12.04 and ubuntu 12.10 and their derivatives you will need to add a second repository to your system in addition to the generic debian ubuntu repository if you donâ t use sudo be sure to switch to root

734828
ssl	https
the package ca-certificates-mono should be installed to get ssl certificates for https connections

734828
ssl	https
mono on linux before 3.12 by default didnâ t trust any ssl certificates so you got errors when accessing https resources

734834
folder	directory
or if the archive itself contains a folder example which you want to extract to the current directory but with a different name you must manually rename it to examplefold afterwards

734836
filesystems	ntfs
depending on your needs you should try the ntfs 1 and exfat 2 filesystems

734836
filesystems	ntfs
3 for instructions on how to use fuse to mount ntfs and exfat filesystems on os x please refer to our sister site askdifferent or other online resources as they would be off topic here

734903
kde	kubuntu
and this is what i did on my kubuntu 15.10 kde frameworks 5.15.0

734909
filesystems	ntfs
since ubuntu can read ntfs filesystems you won t require to format any other drive.you can always store and access your data from ubuntu in any windows ntfs drive

filesystems	ntfs
windows uses ntfs as the default filesystems

735334
filesystems	ntfs
ubuntu uses ext4 but has native support for a wide variety of other filesystems including ntfs with the ntfs-3g driver

735337
postfix	dovecot
there s almost certainly a problem with the mail-stack-delivery configuration either postfix or dovecot or both but i should still be able to at least read that there s no mail from the cli.

i checked for cron jobs but i didn t find any

i remained stuck for several days in low screen resolution in a ubuntu 14.04 guest running on virtualbox 4.1 on debian wheezy

redirects stdout and stderr to dev null suppresses output to the terminal

735419

moreover want to know what will happen to my ubuntu desktop 14.04.3 lts with this upgrade kernel when the new lts versioning 16.04 lts comes in during april 2016

735494
google-chrome	firefox
edit i have now tested with google-chrome and it works so the problem appears to be with firefox

735568
installation	upgrade
that would provide you with line-by-line debug of shell script so you could tell where it exits with non-zero code causing the installation upgrade to fail

735589

ubuntu	linux
make sure that you create some space for boot on ssd and then install remaining ubuntu linux into the unused portion of your 1 tb hard drive

735667
sudo	passwd
this is my simplified script this requires that you install the xprintidle package and modify the shutdown command so that is possible to run without sudo passwd

735710

basically there are three different types of users in linux ubuntu

735726

use purge but purge will not remove the samba4 folder in your home directory so you will have to do that as root

736272

you re essentially asking what system folders can i load into ram rather than save on the disk

736272
disk	ram
dr within the scope of this site tmp is one of the few items that can be sanely put into a ram disk tmpfs space

736282

you can upgrade one versioning at a time which means you have to through 14.04 to 14.10 then 15.04 and finally 15.10

736304
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
then use sudo chown and sudo chmod on your home directory to regain access

really sounds like you want a persistent live media with the toram key on the boot line -- which copies the filesystem into ram and gives you really snappy better than a hard disk performance on first invocation

after that you should change directory the repository folder using cd webcontentcontrol-gambas3 and only after that you should do

you can use the vim plugin for atom-editor and this will make all of these and much more possible

to answer question about sudo it won t ask you for the passwd as it requires to have active terminal in order to receive the passwd from standard input and by running it the background the shell doesn t wait for the command to finish so you don t have possibility to interact with the command

737005

read the passwd from standard input instead of the terminal device by sudo -s

appindicator	dbus
since dbus-launch creates a new private dbus session bus dropbox will never find the appindicator service as it will be the only process on that bus other than dbus so thats about the same as both solutions cause dropbox to fallback to the system tray api

can i upgrade to an unsupported versioning of ubuntu

737375
versioning	upgrade
as long as all your computers are running the same versioning of ubuntu 14.04 with the same repositories they will have the same packages available to you when you update upgrade

737375
versioning	upgrade
if you need a newer package that is not in the repos or a ppa you would have to search for a .deb repository check the project home page build from source or upgrade to a higher versioning of ubuntu

737375
ubuntu	centos
generally speaking server side most people prefer long term releases such as ubuntu lts centos rhel for stability at the sacrifice of newer packages and newer feature

737382
versioning	upgrade
first of all it would take a great amount of time to upgrade through all of those versioning

737382

so you might consider waiting for xenial xerus 16.04 release in april to upgrade since it s a long term support versioning

in the case of both ubuntu and mint the grub configuration file goes in the linux boot grub directory

739366
ubuntu	mint
you might have been able to correct this by using efibootmgr to switch back to mint s grub -- but as mint is basically ubuntu with bits added it s likely that ubuntu s grub overwrote mint s grub so this might not have worked

739366

using boot repair probably restored mint s grub to control of the computer and added ubuntu to mint s grub menu

looking more closely it looks like there is no p folder on that specific mirror - therefore it just refuses to list the directory and file and returns 403 by default

i booted the installer usb perfectly fine in uefi mode by selecting it from the bios clearly said uefi and was created using dd on an ubuntu distro on my linux laptop with the ubuntu install iso in uefi mode f12 boot menu

746939

however you are also confused by the new uefi boot mechanism -- the ubuntu bootloaders shim grub get put into the efi filesystem in their own directory efi ubuntu not overwriting anything windows

tip on gnome the installation need install kde related package e.g kde-runtime thus need download a lot around 60mb and take a lot disk space around 140mb

747007
filesystems	ntfs
this raw disk access is pretty useless to steal your data or modify something to inject other malware to your windows system unless it ships its own ntfs other filesystems driver but it is perfectly enough to make a data massacre and simply overwrite or format the entire partition or disk

747039
sudo	passwd
at the same time when i do sudo ls it asks me for the passwd and then shows me the dheeraj directory

sudo	passwd
if i run a sudo command it will ask me for a passwd however in that terminal session for the next few minutes it will allow me to run sudo commands without asking me for a passwd as it will cache that i am allowed

747209
sudo	passwd
and i execute it as the normal user in terminal before i have executed any sudo commands then all is well and works as expected it prompts me for the sudo passwd

747209
sudo	passwd
however if i am to run a sudo command before executing this script without sudo it will cache that sudo commands should not ask for a passwd for a few minutes in this session and then even though i did not give the script sudo privileges it will not prompt me for a passwd and the script will be allowed to execute whatever sudo commands it wants

747209
sudo	passwd
i have a suggestion for how this could be done but i don t know the practicalities of this could i make it so that when i execute a command and it starts running it it logs that to a file like is done with all terminal commands though maybe a bit too late for this - with the history command and then when sudo is run it checks if i executed that command in terminal through the use of the log that logs when i do and if not then it is assumed that it s not by me so it prompts me for a passwd

747214
sudo	passwd
it will clear the cached credentials and the next sudo will ask again for your passwd

747228
folder	directory
copy the folder to the directory opt

747228

but you d need the sudo passwd to do so

747258

there s certainly no call to completely re-install ubuntu unless you have reason to think that the os x upgrade has damaged the ubuntu installation

so the initial user created when the system is created is added to these groups and the verification of a 2nd admin user is done by providing the sudo passwd

i have noticed that my cron script keeps running each 1 or 2 minutes after execution for almost 1 hour since i have a lot of cron jobs sometimes i could not access to my website the browser keeps searching for a long time

in my experience the beta versioning of ubuntu will either upgrade automatically to the release or ask you if you want to do so via the update manager once the release comes out

ubuntu	opensuse
how can i create a bootable usb stick for opensuse from ubuntu

750069

750071
chown	chmod
the problem now that you can not use chown or chmod to edit ownership so that you can navigate to the dir as normal user

750120
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and the rest of the linux distros for that matter are still largely dependent on python 2.7 for a number of applications and commands

750120
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
on rhel redhat enterprise linux flavors such as redhat fedora and centos the yum command is also dependent on python 2.7

750127

i used ubuntu to run linux alongside windows

750144
google-chrome	firefox
if you prefer to download it through your internet browser there s a few great download manager extensions for both firefox or google-chrome just search them up

750162
ubuntu	mint
the reason for me doing this is the desire to switch from mint to ubuntu

750177
ubuntu	debian
there is a very good install guide located on theâ wikiâ or atampache for debian and ubuntu

750183
debian	linux
i installed the sophos antivirus for linux it was pretty easy to get and install on my debian install

750203
switching	screens
while the script runs connect your external screens wait for you internal screens to switching of and disconnect again

750204
ubuntu	linux
but if you re planning on toying learning about ubuntu or linux in general you should run a virtual box or create a separate partition to avoid damaging any important data you may have

750219
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
when i attempt to install a package or sudo -i i get asked for my passwd then get told that my account is not part of the sudoers file

750395
versioning	upgrade
upgrading to versioning 15.1 the upgrade process stopped and after rebooting the tty01 screen appeared with a login

750419
sudo	passwd
i have recently disabled sudo s authentication caching ability so that it now prompts me for a passwd every time

750419
sudo	passwd
in the past i would have run a sudo command before that it would have cached my passwd and allowed me to run sudo commands without prompt for the next few minutes and thus it would allow me to run the command

750419
sudo	passwd
but when i run it now as there is no caching before hand and as it starts a new thread immediately and sudo doesn t even prompt me for a passwd i am unable to run it in this way

750421
mp3	flv
that software enables playback of restricted proprietary formats like flv mp4 and mp3

750422
versioning	upgrade
really the main problem you have is 14.10 is beyond end of life and you should really upgrade or install a supported versioning of ubuntu

750423
sudo	passwd
another option would to specify a graphical program for obtaining the passwd and send sudo to the background anyway

750426
sudo	passwd
finally you might want to consider setting sudo s passwd timeout to something like 1 or 2 seconds

... some years ago qt and gtk had some daemons and libraries that would override each other compromising the systemd

751171
kde	gnome
qt for gnome and gtk+ for kde

751199
jobs	cron
the real reason why source doesn t work in cron is that by default cron jobs in the crontab are excuted in sh which is a symlink to bin dash a shell that aims to be posix-compliant as well which simply doesn t implement source

751211
bash	zsh
bash isn t smart enough to complete with the contents of variables but zsh can

ruby works great on ubuntu because ubuntu is a variant of linux and linux is the operating system that ruby s creator and current benevolent dictator yukihiro matsumoto uses

751397
ubuntu	linux
its creators say we test mainly on ubuntu but other variations of linux should also work where the browser manufacturers support them.

751400
pydev	liclipse
if you do not intend to use eclipse for any other language then you might prefer liclipse a pre-bundled eclipse pydev release

751404
ubuntu	linux
linux drains battery so fast so i installed hackintosh on it and had no problems swiching from ubuntu to mac os x

751463
lvm	umount
then what i did is to umount the swap image otherwise lvm cant do anything to it

751463
lvm	umount
i couldnt do that with lvm because despite the resize option being available it couldnt do anything to the root partition because it is already mounted obviously and cant be umount while still running it.

the keyboard can still trigger menu navigation using the alt key and after a menu is activated using the keyboard the menu items respond to mouse clicks and hover and can even activate other menus but the top bar still doesn t respond to mouse clicks even on menu headers and even when menus are activated

752367
ubuntu	linux
windows is using the â binary prefixâ and ubuntu or gnu linux is using it in its â properâ foam

752368

i guess after some time it will become out of sync with a real clock so you might either want to add timestamps to whatever your script does or use an approach with an daemons which uses the systemd time

i ve seen lots of usb drives especially flash sd etc cards in usb adapters with fat filesystems virtually every usb drive comes pre-formatted with fat32 getting corrupted while using ubuntu ubuntu-derived distros

your data partition partition is ntfs filesystems for windows

753178
versioning	upgrade
it makes no sense to repair this broken versioning because 13.04 is now unsupported and upgrade from 13.04 to the next supported versioning 14.04 are not faster than a fresh install

753196
filesystems	ntfs
ubuntu will auto-mount known filesystems types like ntfs ext4 and much more.

in any unix-like system including ubuntu and other linux distributions the command-line is much more capable than the gui

from a little testing using diff gnu diffutils 3.3 and comparing folders diff outputs messages to stdout or stderr

you have to edit the sudoers file to make it executable as sudo without the passwd

753719
ubuntu	linux
choose select platform ubuntu linux

753749
sudo	passwd
this is because sudo cannot ask you the passwd outside the terminal but the command needs sudo access so it freezes on the sudo step apparently still waiting for the passwd

753749
sudoers	visudo
edit etc sudoers with the command sudo visudo etc sudoers

the reason for that is difficulty in parsing - authentication attempts do list commands attempted but apt and dpkg logs actually list what has been successful but don t mention who installed what

it has been suggested that this could be due to an outdated package list but this is not the case as i always run sudo apt-get update before attempting and upgrade or new installation so i do not believe that this can be the problem unless somehow that command is not solving it

14.04 is lts so by default it only tells you about upgrade to other lts versioning which come out every two years

755568
versioning	upgrade
15.10 is the versioning right before 16.04 so it will be a direct upgrade when 16.04 is released

755568
versioning	upgrade
it may or may not say it wants to upgrade to a new versioning of ubuntu as it technically isn t

755568
versioning	upgrade
remember though 15.10 s default behavior of prompting to install every new versioning of ubuntu will carry through to the 16.04 update meaning you ll be asked to upgrade to 16.10 when it comes out and so on

the direct answer to your question which versioning is easiest to upgrade to 16.04 is the xenial daily build

the gnome-tweak-tool does not support the upgrading of extensions through its interface though in future it is planned for the whole web interface to be scrapped and for it all to be done through gnome-software if a new versioning of an extension comes out and you wish to upgrade to it you may do so by going here and clicking upgrade button next to the on off slider if there is no upgrade button then the extension is already up-to-date

757326

you will then be prompted if you would like to upgrade the said extension pressing upgrade will upgrade it however pressing the cancel button will disable or possibly even uninstall it so that you will need to reinstall or reactivate it again
