127559
ubuntu	debian
this is a key difference between debian stable and ubuntu lts especially if your concerned about longevity uptime stability etc

127559
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is released every six months and is based off of the debian unstable branch which generally means overall newer and more up to date software but at the same time having the disadvantage of being considered basically unstable at least in an enterprise context

127559
ubuntu	debian
now the lts release is based mostly on debian testing which in debian terms represents the state of the upcoming stable release before it is actually considered stable and although ubuntu puts a lot of time and effort into making regular and lts versions as stable as possible after the packages have been pulled from there respective debian branches lts is still based on the testing branch which in turn is still considered by debian in its own branch to be not quite ready for production use or anything approaching mission critical

127559
ubuntu	debian
and ubuntu s community of developers simply cannot compete on the same scope or level of debian which is possibly the largest communal based software ever created

127559
ubuntu	debian
in basic terms this means ubuntu lts being based upon the debian testing branch and even with ubuntus attempts to stabilize and polish their testing packages after they re pulled does not equal the immense development and maturity of debian stable and the packages thereof

kde is a desktop environment build on the os to be more precise you can install kde on any linux distributions like opensuse redhat ......and also in windows

i m new in ubuntu and linux

133653
filesystems	ntfs
you ll recognize it by its filesystems being ntfs while the linux partitions most likely are ext3 swap and so on

133653
ubuntu	linux
in this sense ubuntu is a lot more multi-os friendly than windows because in the same situation windows would just override grub and boot windows instantly without the choice to go into the existing linux partition

133658
ubuntu	linux
this will then show you a list of your partitions you say you only have one partition for ubuntu this will show as a linux partition there will also be a linux-swap - you can ignore that

133661
ubuntu	debian
first of all ubuntu is based on debian so what you call rpms are actually deb-files in debian rpm is used in red hat among others as far as i know

133687
ubuntu	linux
while it is certainly possible to get oracle pbs to work under ubuntu i m afraid you are using the wrong linux distribution here

133693
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome or chromium protocol handling works differently than in firefox

133693
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
step not necessary if you use gnome kde xfce or lxde lastly xdg-open assumes you are running one of the standard desktop environments gnome kde xfce and lxde

while it is possible to install rpms packages for the originally called red hat package manager through use of alien in debian based linux distributions like ubuntu it is mostly not recommended

133712
centos	linux
use a rpm based enterprise distribution like red hat enterprise linux rhel oracle linux or the free centos

133880
ubuntu	debian
there are probably thousands of companies and organizations that donate time money and code to ubuntu debian and various software

133883
vmware	virtualbox
a3 when you say hypervisors do you mean host os or vmware vs virtualbox because the straight forward answer is vmware is outdated and virtualbox is stable

133883
vmware	virtualbox
so you have to decide for crashing and buggy but fast vmware or efficient and stable but still takes up a bit of memory when running virtualbox...i prefer virtualbox but many others with not-so-capable hardware like to use vmware...you decide although i do suggest using ubuntu with openbox if you want as minimal processes running whenever you do dual-vm s.

i checked my update manager settings and it says next to notify me of a new ubuntu versioning that it will check for any new version. but this is not the case it never gives me the option to upgrade no matter how many times i click check. i have also tried doing the sudo apt-get install command in the terminal but that has not allowed the computer to upgrade either

of course you then won t be able to upgrade to a new versioning of ubuntu but that s not necessarily terrible

even if your laptop has a dedicated ati nvidia card the laptop is usually set by default to automatically switch between the two nvidia calls this optimus and that means that the integrated intel graphics will reserve memory even if you aren t using them

currently you will see debian and ubuntu changing a lot in the lay-out of the fhs since ssd is better off with read only files

138551

there is a movement towards a new lay-out where files are split in to a read only and a writable directory group so we can have a root partition that can be mounted read only partition for a ssd and writable sata hdd

does the debian ubuntu package infrastructure has some way of marking packages so that they never get uninstalled no matter the pinning of other packages

140235
versioning	upgrade
you need to hold the packages so that apt-get upgrade never removes them as part of upgrading to a newer versioning

if you pin it to a specific versioning with a priority of 1001 or greater even apt-get install will not upgrade it but it can still be removed

140323
sudoers	visudo
the only way i know of is to edit your sudoers file with visudo to accomplish this

140323
sudo	passwd
this will still make you use sudo but will not require a passwd

140350
versioning	upgrade
after this is done and the file has been saved you can update your system to those package s versioning with sudo apt-get update and has an option you can also upgrade to a newer versioning if desired

i m running kubuntu 12.04 on 32 bit and the updater offers a security update linux kernel headers and linux kernel image for version 64bit x86 smp

140623
x86	64bit
64bit means its capable of 64bit address handling the kernel image architecture is x86 which points that it is for 32bit system

140659
ubuntu	debian
it told me to sudo apt-get install -f which deleted just about every dependency needed for ubuntu now i cannot log in or anything now in grub it actually says debian instead of ubuntu

if by user activity you mean keyboard or mouse then this can by implemented in a few different ways

140913
ubuntu	linux
i wont paste those code examples here as they are huge and found on several websites here if you want more search for python x idle time maybe add ubuntu or linux

140914
ubuntu	debian
debian and hence ubuntu packages are collection of binaries and related instructions for their installation

140914
ubuntu	debian
the main advantages of debian ubuntu packages with respect to source tarballs are that packages are self-contained and their binaries are tracked

140943
folder	directory
to do this i installed sun jre 1.6u31 in a folder in my home directory outside my search path then modified line 4 of thinktda from

140981
folder	directory
i m sure this is an easy answer how do i change the directory where quickly creates new folder

141007
put	get
it will monitor which files get installed and put them into a .deb package which can then be installed and removed

141013
filesystems	xfs
which filesystems between xfs and ext4 will be the fastest to write data on the hard drive

141015
kde	kubuntu
for you that have tested this should we use ubuntu and install different desktop environments kde xfce... or we should install different distributions kubuntu xubuntu...

141019
kde	kubuntu
so installing ubuntu and then downloading the corresponding kde package is no different than having kubuntu and downloading the corresping ubuntu package

141029
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	opensuse
ext4 has become the default filesystem for several of the popular linux distributions including ubuntu fedora and opensuse

141029
filesystems	xfs
xfs is a highly scalable high-performance filesystems which was originally designed at silicon graphics inc

141029
filesystems	xfs
xfs supports a maximum filesystems size of 8 exbibytes minus one 263-1 bytes though this is subject to block limits imposed by the host operating system

141032
xfce	kde
there is a lot of difference between xfce and xubuntu-desktop and similarly with lxde and lubuntu-desktop kubuntu-desktop and kde

141032
xfce	kde
these xfce kde lxde just environments and these are not gonna give you any other pkg s

141033
kde	gnome
you should also aware of some incompatibility issue of firefox font-rendering between kde and gnome system

141054
filesystems	ntfs
but there is one in a thousand chance that this may cause data loss since ntfs filesystems is not effectively manipulated from ubuntu yet i suggest making free space from windows before proceeding

141059
google-chrome	firefox
i figured out that there was nothing wrong with the wireless or the internet itself because only browsers were slow at going to websites google-chrome firefox etc

141064
google-chrome	firefox
i figured out that there was nothing wrong with the wireless internet itself because only browsers were slow at going to websites google-chrome firefox etc while running them from ubuntu

141109
ubuntu	linux
from this wiki page i see many type of linux kernel available for the ubuntu distro

141114
filesystems	ntfs
- the 1st one will be c drive which has windows.you will be able to see it as ntfs filesystems

141120
mouse	keyboard
you can also try setting a lower timer frequency than 1000 hz the default but this will affect interactive performance mouse keyboard movements etc.

141122
sudo	passwd
type sudo apt-get install gdm and hit enter give your passwd and wait to get a line ending with a dollar sign again

141135
versioning	upgrade

i ve installed gnome desktop on kubuntu 12.04

141149
kde	gnome
is there a way to switch from gnome to kde using terminal

141154
filesystems	ntfs
if a particular partition contains a vfat or ntfs filesystems and you only wish to be able to access it yourself it s pretty simple

141157
filesystems	xfs
xfs is now a robust and fast filesystems even in the event of power-loss

141165
kde	gnome
that i use an ubuntu 12.04 minimal just to install the base os and then on top of it only the chromium browser without any gui like gnome kde etc

141166
ubuntu	linux
i only installed linux once on this computer waited for ubuntu 12.04 to get released so it s not a swap partition that remains from an earlier installation

141166
ubuntu	linux
i have booted it up a few times after ubuntu 12.04 was installed i don t know whether windows disk check can do any harm to linux partitions but it always seems to run a checkdisk after i changed my partition table layout with a linux application like gparted

141171

141219
maven	m2e
in addition to installing the maven package and the eclipse package and all their dependencies you need to install the m2e extension

141224
umask	chmod
the alternative is to issue a chmod call after creating the directory which should be a bit safer and doesn t depend on the umask setting

141228
ubuntu	linux
i was on the edge at giving up on ubuntu just like you and i am a returning linux user..so not a total newbie

it is only simple if you start with a package that exists in the ubuntu or debian repositories

141482
ethernet	wireless
the system runs fine on hardwire ethernet and wireless was fine on 10.04

141487
ssd	sata
i think the biggest bottleneck in the performance of your intel 330 ssd is most likely your hp mini 2140 laptop s sata controller

141487
ssd	sata
in other words transfers to from your ssd will be bounded by the max sata 1.0 transfer rate and will never be faster than 150 mb s

141487
ssd	sata
you d probably get better use out of your intel 330 ssd in another system which could take advantage of its sata 3.0 capabilities

141487
ssd	sata
even if you had faster transfers to from your ssd than sata 1.0 the cpu and ram transfers are i m guessing still bottle-necking total system performance

141491
hide	show
as far as i am aware there is no way to change that nor there is a way to hide the press esc to leave full screen message that show up upon entering fullscreen mode

141502
vpn	lan
when i manually remove the first line everything works as expected resolving domain names in both lan and vpn subnets

141533
ubuntu	debian
apt is just designed to avoid roll-backs as much as possible and the packages that make up the ubuntu and debian for that matter distribution aren t designed with smooth roll-backs as a design goal

141533
folder	directory
unless you have whole-system backups that are reliable what you really need to do is ensure your entire home directory is backed up and possibly also on a separate partition re-install from the cd image of your chosen version and start restoring your data from your home folder s

141534
filesystems	hfs+
the linux kernel includes the hfsplus module for mounting hfs+ filesystems

141534
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
consequently linux distributions such as debian and ubuntu also stopped allowing mounting of hfs+ drives or partitions greater than 2 tb

141539
gedit	nano
then i used the simple text editor nano you can also use gedit or any other simple text editor and added the following

can log in to another administrative account and then use sudo in that account to change the passwd for your first account

141644
versioning	upgrade
the easy fix would be to upgrade virtualbox - right now it s at 4.x versioning

141705
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu doesn t just serve as a way to help its own users it contributes back to upstream developers such as those at debian and freedesktop to help non-ubuntu users

while the screenshot does show centos and windows clients it does have ubuntu support

141809
versioning	upgrade
was the system upgrade from a previous versioning to 12.04

141816

if you ever need to restore from this backup just copy this directory back to the home folder under the same name

141831
cpu	processors
i ve been reading about a lot of issues with cpu overheating in ubuntu particularly with sandybridge processors with the blame being placed on all sorts from flash to internet explorer

141831
ubuntu	linux
such a shame i love linux and ubuntu but if it can t harness new tech what s the point

141875
sudo	passwd
i thought that removing passwd would also remove sudo passwd

141938
google-chrome	firefox
for example is nearly unreadable in google-chrome although i just tried it in firefox 12 and it looks a bit better

141955
kate	kde
if you already installed some kde software usually starts with k letter such as kate or kile and the installed softwares are updated version of the packages included in the live cd and you disables the main and universe repository from solution of note 2 you will face a broken dependency error which says some packages depends on some other packages but that packages cannot be installed

141997
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
however in the last couple of years debian and ubuntu decided to switch the system shell from bash to dash - a similar shell - breaking with a long tradition in linux well gnu of using bash for bin sh

141997
ubuntu	debian
this is currently considered a bug that should be fixed by debian and ubuntu who require bin sh to be able to work when pointed to dash

142016

you should upgrade your ubuntu versioning i guess this versioning is not supported now

142030
burn	uninstaller
should i unzip and install this file and then select the image file to burn on cd or would i be better off uninstaller the windows version and downloading the desktop 12.04 lts version

142038
ubuntu	linux
i choose a partition and change the format of this partition to linux partition and format it to start installing ubuntu

142065
afp	smb
i d like to use smb instead but even though i ve now installed samba i ve no idea on how to get nautilus to use it instead of afp

142111
centos	linux
for what its worth yes squid can easily be used to cache updates for rh-based distros such as centos fedora and scientific linux

142129
folder	directory
create a file named ip-notify.sh somewhere for example in a scripts directory in your home folder

142133
move	drag
i m used to using workspace desktop managers in windows like dexpot and sdesk that give me a panner or desktop preview that shows thumbnails of the windows in each desktop and lets me click in a desktop to move to that desktop or drag windows from within the panner manager to move the actual window

142139
debian	linux
it is a linux distro based on debian

142191
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome is known for using more memory than firefox

142207
ubuntu	linux
this is probably not a ubuntu question as such but a linux one instead still hope some linux user out there can help me understand this

142236
ubuntu	linux
to install linux kernel 3.4 on ubuntu or kubuntu etc. 12.04 you want to use a ubuntu version of the kernel not the generic linux kernel

when you know what you need to press for the boot menu put the cd in your external device turn on or reboot the machine and slowly mash that key until you get a temporary menu allowing you to boot from the external cd

142327
google-chrome	firefox
after restarting i no longer was able to browse the internet using firefox or google-chrome

142356
gedit	nano
like gedit if you want it graphical but you will still be looking at the same type of deal as with nano or vi from commandline

142394
kde	kubuntu
it s already here but you must enable the kubuntu backports ppa from kubuntu to get it plasma and kde applications 4.8.3 updates

142395
ubuntu	linux
then why is that in linux ubuntu only one application or rather a package can be installed at a time...even updating packages locks the other softwares from installing

142395
ubuntu	linux
would like a detailed answer as to is there an advantage in this or why this is a necessity in linux ubuntu etc.

142398
ubuntu	linux
is there an advantage in this or why this is a necessity in linux ubuntu etc.

similarly in linux ubuntu no one s stopping you from running an apt-get a tar -xzf and a perl bash install script all at the same time

142456
chown	chmod
i edited the values to be the full extents of the display size and saved preferences then chown d then to root root and chmod d them to 644 so that chrome running as the kiosk_user cannot modify the settings

cpu	processors
but you say that your cpu - intel core2 duo t9500 2.60ghz - doesn t go over 60â c and this seems to be reasonable given the very low tdp 35w of your processors

142521
filesystems	hfs+
if you copied the files onto the hard drive using mac os x it is possible that the filesystems is hfs+

142521
ubuntu	linux
linux doesn t support journaling on hfs+ so ubuntu will not mount it automatically

142537
chown	sudo
essentially sudo chown -r linyulin linyulin .matlab

142537
chown	sudo
if that doesn t do it you could also do sudo chown -r linyulin linyulin licenses

142546
ubuntu	linux
if you have any doubts you can run the code he does on a linux live cd and make sure you have pae and therefore can run ubuntu 12.04

142556

on arch linux it was usr doc but i can t find it on ubuntu

142557

folder	directory
create a temporary folder in your home directory note you can make the temporary folder anywhere you want

142689
ubuntu	linux
the problem is that the vmware tools included with 7.1.5 is fairly old at this point and is not compatible with the linux 3.2 kernel that ubuntu 12.04 runs on

142700
ubuntu	linux
for example here s the rtc drivers available for ubuntu s linux kernel 3.2

142704
ubuntu	linux
the biggest pro in my opinion is that you can easily install a newer ubuntu version or any linux distro for your architecture really without losing most of your custom settings configurations downloads etc. since such a step usually involves wiping out the existing system boot partitions

142714
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade some packages seems they already got downloaded sucessfuly but everytime i try to install them i get a translated versioning of not enough space available on device

assuming that the quoted statement means that xt2 will effectively behave like xt in such a scenario it should work just as well with ubuntu linux

143705
jobs	cron
it is also usually a good idea when creating cron jobs to use the full path of the command you are using

143705
jobs	cron
this is because cron jobs run in a special very limited shell environment and your path may differ from what you use when logged in

i can t use a trackpad touchpad solution since i use an external mouse

so set up the firewall forward rules in the server to only allow 1688 tcp 53 udp and 53 tcp to pass through the firewall in your router

143949

2 append insert rules to accept tcp and udp port 53 to the forward chain

143950
ubuntu	linux
also that path is specified using efi-style backslashes rather than forward slashes and since backslashes are escape characters in linux shells they must be doubled up -- hence efi ubuntu grubx64.efi rather than efi ubuntu grubx64.efi

so in general if i had 3 laptops to choose from and they all were the same except for the video card i would definitely choose intel over nvidia and nvidia over ati

in the case of 3 desktop pcs that are the same except for the video card i would choose nvidia over intel and intel over ati

ffmpeg	libav
last year some of the ffmpeg developers split off and started their own version fork of ffmpeg called libav

151508
ffmpeg	libav
both ffmpeg and libav are actively developed in parallel right now

ffmpeg	libav
jon s ppa contains the latest original ffmpeg packages not the libav ones which are in the official ubuntu repository

151508
ffmpeg	libav
libav 0.8.x is as new as ffmpeg 0.10.x

151508
ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg and libav cannot co-exist on an ubuntu installation at this time unless you install one of them manually

151508

so unless you need some particular feature only implemented by ffmpeg stick to libav since it s the officially supported fork and is as new and actively developed as ffmpeg

another method which is still insecure but at least it does not require you writing a passwd to file is described at how to run an application using sudo without a passwd

151963
x86	64bit
even worse if a version is installed for x86 it doesn t guarantee the same version is installed for x64 so 64bit and 32 bit games may need to run the same exact installer version but targeting different platforms when run

well linux or ubuntu does not hide the fact that you have to have dependencies installed for using the software unlike the microsoft way

kubuntu	gnome
for gnome-based distros like mainline ubuntu it is probably impossible to remove pulseaudio since it is a dependency for most of the gnome stuff including gdm but on kubuntu xubuntu and lubuntu this might actually work since they initially don t come with pulseaudio and the gnome bloatware and if it got installed most likely it happened as a dependency for some other package that depends on gnome or its libraries

it has been fixed upstream in debian where ubuntu draws its packages from

158347
folder	directory
in order to resolve this problem i created a new folder called test in usr share using the command sudo mkdir test and then created another folder inside of the test folder called media using the command sudo mkdir media and then i moved the test.svg icon file located in my quickly project directory at test data media test.svg to usr share test media

158349
uninstall	upgrade
so i suggest you to try uninstall your current fglrx driver upgrade your kernel and then install the latest kernel

158354
chown	chmod
look for commands such as chown or chmod if they were run with the -r recursive option easier to re-install

158376

158393
ubuntu	linux
when booting up grub2 used to display ubuntu ubuntu recovery mode other versions of linux memtest followed by windows 7 loader on dev sda1 and windows 7 loader on dev sdb1

158428
umount	btrfs
btrfs doesn t do this btw but i don t trust it yet for external drives - eg you need a recent kernel 3.4+ i think or the kernel will oops and possibly lose data if you remove the drive without umount it first which of course happens if it loses power

158450
ubuntu	debian
note that prior to 12.04 ubuntu used the admin group instead of the sudo group where debian used the sudo group

158487
sudo	passwd
type sudo apt-get install gdm and then your passwd when prompted or run sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm then sudo service lightdm stop in case gdm is already installed

158545
ubuntu	debian
is there an easy way to upgrade from debian squeeze to ubuntu 12.04

158546
g++	gcc
if you want to install gcc from cd insert it and issue the command sudo apt-get install build-essential it ll give you gcc and g++ c++ compiler

158552
installation	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
no there is no easy way to upgrade from a cli installation of debian squeeze to ubuntu 12.04 server variant or otherwise

158562
cpu	hyperthreading
are they equivalent to sockets so a multicore and or hyperthreading cpu is counted as a single socket

158580
chown	sudo
you could try chown ing it without sudo and that might succeed but really that folder is extremely unlikely to be relevant to the problem you re experiencing

158588
ubuntu	linux
my dell laptop is failing and i d just wanted to read the data on its hard drive formatted with ntfs using a live os the smallest possible one and knowing nothing of linux i thought of ubuntu

158588
ubuntu	linux
ps i have a limited internet connection 5gb of traffic each month for 20 euros so i would like not to use other money to download a different version of ubuntu or of linux if possible

158596
xmonad	xmobar
i changed my desktop environment i forget exactly how to remove the gnome panels and instead i m using xmonad and xmobar and just terminal windows and so on

158598
filesystems	btrfs
you can also match block devices like dev sda1 instead of -t btrfs and chain elif s to use different mount options for different devices and filesystems

158604
hide	show
is it possible to toggle show hide the appmenu

158639
filesystems	ntfs
another benefit of ext4 over ntfs is that ubuntu will use cpu resources more efficiently to access ext4 and most filesystems than ntfs

158640
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and linux in general does not install to fat32 or ntfs partitions

158651
sudo	passwd
to set the root passwd use sudo passwd and set it

158672
sudo	passwd
especially since it is different from by sudo passwd so sometimes i type in the wrong one

158682
vmware	virtualbox
edit i ve given up on vmware and moved to virtualbox

158694
folder	directory
i have a folder in my home directory that i want to be truly shared between all users on the same computer

158718
versioning	upgrade
i m an ubuntu 12.04 user and my wireless network card d-link wireless n 150 desktop adapter dwa-525 has always worked well with the driver suggested here however this morning i updated the generic kernel as suggested by upgrade manager to versioning 3.2.0-26 and suddenly wireless stopped working

just replace the usb_disk with the proper name of the folder where your drive is mounted under the media directory

158771
filesystems	ntfs
recently i formatted the 80gb partition and changed the filesystems to ntfs and i

158779
ubuntu	linux
you need to boot the ubuntu installation cd and then open file manager and open your linux root partition the one with boot var sys etc etc this mounts it

158795
post	get
other post on bluetile and tried the website but unfortunately nothing seems to address precise thoroughly enough for me to get it working

158837
ubuntu	linux
my dhcp bind server is ubuntu linux but all of the network computers are windows

158846
uninstall	upgrade
in the worst case you may have to uninstall all the brother packages then upgrade and finally re-install and re-configure them

158849
pop-up	dialog
i have almost finished my ubuntu app showdown app but would like to make it somewhat more robust upon application quit i iterate through the open files checking for unsaved files if any are found i pop-up a dialog informing the user

158866
kde	gnome
also in synaptic you can search all installed packages and filter on kde to get a list of any installed packages that mention kde but it would need to be checked to make sure it s not just a gnome program that says something such as like the kde program for example

158882
xfce	cinnamon
you can always install xfce or cinnamon desktop environments or install any number of ubuntu variants.

158884
google-chrome	firefox
might wanna install windows version firefox or google-chrome under wine

158930
filesystems	fat
to quote drivesort s author the program is tightly bound to microsoft apis so i doubt you will find a native linux equivalent where a non-native filesystems fat is concerned

158944
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu or any linux os for that matter and don t have any windows software and can t afford any right now

158978

after downgrading these packages will have to be locked to be stopped from being upgrade to their former versioning right again

158990

he uses a microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse and an acer x203h monitor with his set-up

158990
mouse	keyboard
no problems with the keyboard or mouse or with connecting the hp printer but we just can t get the laptop to talk to the acer monitor

159007
sudo	passwd
i am fine with entering passwd on sudo in most of the cases

159007
sudo	passwd
however there are three sudo commands i want to run without entering passwd

159007
sudo	passwd
how can i exclude these commands from passwd protection to sudo

159009
sudo	passwd
all other sudo ed commands will still require a passwd

159009
sudoers	visudo
note always use the command visudo to edit the sudoers file to make sure you do not lock yourself out of the system â just in case you accidentally write something incorrect to the sudoers file

159009
sudoers	visudo
visudo will save your modified file to a temporary location and will only overwrite the real sudoers file if the modified file can be parsed without errors

159009
sudoers	visudo
if you did not use visudo to edit your files and then accidentally messed up etc sudoers or messed up a file in etc sudoers.d then you will be locked out of sudo

159018
ubuntu	debian
it has been accepted into debian and is in the offical ubuntu repros

159034
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that when the system runs out of memory it finds the biggest memory hog the browser - google-chrome or firefox and asks it to kill a child

don t worry too much about ubuntu compatibility 99 of them support linux just make sure -looking at the specs- that ext4 is supported

159109
jobs	cron
in it i have dozens of cron jobs that run successfully

159131
docx	xlsx
similarly i m having trouble with docx xlsx and pptx files since they re essentially all zip files containing a bunch of xml

159132
lvm	umount
you can use pvs to see how much space lvm has allocated to volumes and how much it has left and lvextend to increase the size of a logical volume does not need to be umount

159142
sudo	passwd
in fact it is using sudo or some gui spinoff like kdesudo or gksudo which uses the admin logon passwd to get rights to do anything under the system under the root account

159182
filesystems	ntfs
i installed gparted and all my ntfs filesystems have become read-only.i tried the solution given here how to change permissions to the other drives in a hard disk

159193
kde	kubuntu
i am not sure what s it that you want in your question because it s been a while since i used kde or kubuntu

159197
kde	gnome
don t mind if its for unity gnome or kde etc.

159295
filesystems	ntfs
the data corruption certainly affects the underlying ntfs filesystems and files on it

159316
ubuntu	linux
never used linux before but i decided i want to start somewhere and ubuntu seemed like the right place to start

159322
versioning	upgrade
is it a bug related to ubuntu 12.04 i never had any problem with previous versioning but i m not sure the problem appeared with the upgrade to 12.04 or did i miss something

don t use firefox or google-chrome to install the add-on from the website you should use the default gnome browser which goes by the names web and epiphany

159466
ubuntu	linux
defragging has different meaning in linux ubuntu it defrags inodes to boost performance

159481
kde	gnome
the alt + f2 permits to run a command works on gnome lxde and kde as far as i remember then you can write the complete name of the application you want for example terminal or konsole if you have it installed

159505
xfce	gnome
what are the similar commands for other window managers kde4 s plasma gnome lxde xfce

159512
ubuntu	linux
all new partitions can be logical as ubuntu linux does not need primary partitions for installation

159512
ubuntu	linux
you could leave also some space unpartitioned where you could install newer ubuntu linux version later for experiments

159533
folder	directory
you must download the desktop cd version of the iso and place it in the same directory folder as wubi.exe before running wubi.exe

159540
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
by the way even though desktop environments such as gnome kde or xfce have a default wm that works well with the environment window managers are actually separate and can normally be mixed and matched

ubuntu	linux
well i m running 2 different distro s of linux right now and i decided to make my ubuntu partition my primary partition larger so i took 119.53 gb out of my other distro s partition and it became unallocated and then i figured gparted would when i right click on it to resize move give me the option of using it to make another partition bigger but it did not so i went google searching on line and in one post i saw it said you had to format the unallocated space so i formatted it to ext4 the same as my primary partition but still no options to add it to any thing what do i do

159601
put	get
ok i have recently made some mistakes with installing some operating systems that i should have just kept on a live cd not ubuntu but another os and with my ocd when i saw my lot s of different partitions i just wanted to reset my computer so it boot s up and doesn t load any os and i have to put in my ubuntu live cd and install that and that would be my only os on this computer so i want to know how i can just wipe my entire hard drive so when it boot s i get to put my live cd in and start anew

159605
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems were ext4 and ntfs old windows partition

159607
ubuntu	linux
one of the goals of ubuntu desktop edition is to make it easier for users to use linux

159623
vim	gedit
you can inspect this file with a normal text editor like gedit vim or whatever you like

159638
ubuntu	linux
you will find most of the basic commands from core utilities description page said that linux is just a name of kernel whereas ubuntu is an entire advanced integrated os of such utilities

disk	ram
the ressources you assign to a virtual machine are different of course its disk will be there until you delete that vm and its files -- but the ram assigned to the vm will only be used when you fire up the vm -- and should be freed once you power it down

159738
vmware	virtualbox
please help me install ubuntu os latest build on a kingston data traveler usb 8 gb stick fat32 completely clean formatted now without booting from usb ubuntu os should load run inside win xp 32 bit os win 7 home premium 64 bit os whenever i insert my usb stick in any port without using any virtual host like vmware or virtualbox should not install ubuntu os on any machine just like win 7 professional os win 7 ultimate os have win xp mode running inside them for legacy software is able to access modify save all file folders of the host machine should run in a different interface but here i am using a usb stick please tell me if its possible

159776
mouse	keyboard
after i resumed the keyboard stopped functioning though the mouse usb still worked

159811
chown	sudo
open a terminal and type sudo chown user user media new volume to take ownership of the file system

159821
spoofing	traffic
even though the switch that they are connected to will learn mac address to port mappings and try to only send traffic to the correct port there are tricks that can be pulled to spoofing another station s mac address and get their traffic

159878
switching	screens
trying to switching accounts to my newly created account i get a black screens and then it takes me back to the main login screens after entering the correct password

159887
dpkg	apt
i tried to reinstall it and to look for it by terminal apt and dpkg or synaptic but i couldn t find it

159899
debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
this is why when creating user accounts from the command-line it is recommended to use adduser in ubuntu and debian and other debian-based systems instead

159924
ati	nvidia
matrox is the first company to offer a seriously good support for more than 1 display they are just the only one company in the world specialized in that field and they are good at since their foundation ati is offering that kind of support since 2009 with eyefinity nvidia was the last on the field with its nvidia surround technologies

160008
chown	sudo	chown	mount
instead you need to change the permissions to give yourself access with sudo chown yourname.yourname path to mount

160019
ati	nvidia
5 if you have a nvidia card choose output driver and select vdpau for ati or amd choose xv 0 - ati radeon avivo video i dont know if this will work as my card is nvidia but it should

160039
kde	gnome
i always use gnome but i install kde programs with reckless abandon when they are better than their gnome counterparts and have never really noticed much of a difference

160040
vmware	virtualbox
if vmware doesn t support bridged to atheros wireless i know that virtualbox does

160043
kate	gedit	kate	kde	kate	gnome	kde	gnome
i aint 100 percent if this what you asking but i had gnome unity and kde installed a while ago they did not seem to affect system performance but i did have 2 sets of aplications one for gnome unity is gnome and one for kde but most applications were obviously named like gedit gparted etc for gnome and kate or konquour for kde

160043
kde	gnome
but you can get the desktops with out all the apps but geanraly gnome and kde would not even execute each others programs very well but it was a pain to have all those apps any way so i just use unity now

160070
xfce	kde
however this option will not be attractive to xfce or kde users - a ton of python-nautilus s dependencies will be installed on their machines and take up a lot of space - even if they never use nautilus

160079
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
in general way you can actually lookup in synaptic manager by selecting the sections menu having gnome desktop kde desktop amd xfce desktop environment sub-sections stating the default applications either qt or gtk based

160079
kde	gnome
and there is library section a shared section showing libraries of gnome and kde desktop

160079
kde	gnome
gnome and kde don t have shared libraries but some common modules like kernel and drivers but different frontends like network managers sound menu etc for them based on de s

160079
kde	gnome
and pointing to multiple desktops modules or library s usage in simple words if you have kde and gnome installed on running kde application in gnome environment will initialize kde library and vice-versa to polish its interface integration etc

160105
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and ubuntu 12.04 lts server

160109
ubuntu	linux
if you plan on using this installation as your main computer you might want to reinstall with the ubuntu 12.04 desktop version might be a bit easier for someone who is new to linux

160151
mouse	keyboard
which lead me to thinking that you don t really need two separate x sessions - all you need is to open 2 minecraft instances and somehow bind a keyboard and a mouse to each of them

160151
mouse	keyboard
so i searched for different keywords and found this question how to lock one mouse keyboard pair to each screen

160151
mouse	keyboard	vmware	virtualbox
- the accepted answer describes an interesting approach with running 2 separate virtual machines in vmware i think virtualbox may work too and configuring usb filters for each of the vms to only accept input from one keyboard and mouse

use a 64 bit ubuntu with either gnome 3 or cinnamon desktop for graphics effects

160168

versioning	upgrade
for a 1gb system the best to do is install the 32 bit versioning unless you want to upgrade your system memory in the near future

160191
installation	upgrade
now i want to remove windows xp and upgrade the wubi install to a full installation

160220
folder	directory
the file pane at the left hand side of the application window is a virtual library with a directory structure and folder names that do not map directly to the system s file directory

160220
move	drag
this can throw you off if you re coming from windows because the photo managers i ve used there display a file directory identical to the system file directory so you can drag and drop pictures to move the files around

160220
pop-up	dialog
select export...and a dialog will pop-up which ends with the file manager s file choosing screen where you can choose or create the directory to where you wish to move the selected photos

160233
versioning	upgrade
i wouldn t want to upgrade if there is a problem in the last versioning

160234
kde	kubuntu
in kde kubuntu

160234
xfce	kde
so almost nothing at all for xfce lxde and 8.5mb--not the end of the world--for kde

160247
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
so far the only one that s worked is editing the sudoers file but then this only disables the passwd prompt for sudo in the terminal program

such as gnome and kde

160348
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and to begin with i thought of installing ubuntu 12.4 amd 64 bit version on my laptop

160364
sudo	passwd
sudo apt-get upgrade works without a passwd but muon is still asking for it

160389
versioning	upgrade
do i need to upgrade the kernel to a newer versioning 3.4 or 3.5 etc. to get the system more smoothly

160391
sudo	passwd
then use sudo to do things as root as usual though i don t think it ll prompt you for a passwd

160430
ubuntu	linux
first ubuntu is a dpkg-based linux distribution not rpm

160443
versioning	upgrade
you don t say which versioning you have or which you are trying to upgrade to but you can find more information on upgrading ubuntu here

160446
versioning	upgrade
you should install all upgrade packages of current versioning

160457
sudo	passwd
use gksudo instead of sudo because your are in graphic interface so you can type the passwd

160483
debian	linux
crunchbang linux is a debian based linux-distro

however all our engineering environment is linux based so other laptops do have ubuntu installed successfully - inspirons and hp pavilions

please open a terminal and run sudo gedit etc default grub and give your passwd

originally the machine was running unity3d the default but i couldn t get my vnc viewer to work so it was recommended that i use unity2d

anyone know if it is possible to have a standard user account make ip changes via gui or terminal without requiring the admin sudo passwd

160636
filesystems	ntfs
i have a 25 gig partition in ext4 for ubuntu an ntfs 25 gig partition for windows 7 a logical swap of 2 gig and then a logical 60 gig partition in fat32 which i ve read is the correct filesystems for files as music pics videos i want to share with windows

160644
chown	sudo
you can then take ownership of this directory using the command sudo chown yourname yourname where yourname is your login name

160644
folder	directory
the easiest way to do this is to use nautilus and in your home directory right-click on pictures and choose make link delete the existing pictures rename the new link to pictures then copy and paste the files from mnt pictures folder into this one

160647
mouse	keyboard
it s really driving me round the bend i have usb keyboard and mouse connected

today it is often more used for hibernation than as a way to augment ram with disk space

160679
put	get
when i try to create links from several folders created on windows 7 in order to put them on my personal folder i get the following error

160682
ubuntu	linux
to confirm this try running a native linux game from the ubuntu software center or running glxgears to check fps speed and see if you get the same quality

160703
folder	directory
the problem is only with using nautilus which creates the link in the same folder as the original rather than in your home directory

160715
versioning	upgrade
when you chose install the software center will replace the current versioning with the newer versioning upgrade to the newer versioning

160715

i have even upgrade my network manager while online and then continued to stay online the old versioning continues to be used until the program is restarted in the nm case that is reboot unless you force it to stop and start manually

160737
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd root

160802
sudo	passwd
i wanted to change my own passwd but instead of using sudo passwd myuser i used sudo passwd by mistake and so i set the passwd for root

160802
sudoers	passwd
it s currently set to the same passwd as my own user account and it s kind of redundant because my user is in the sudoers list anyway

160803
sudo	passwd
you can disable it with sudo passwd -dl root

160803

to change your user s passwd just run passwd instead of sudo passwd username

160925
disk	ram
from the article you linked to and the contents of your post it looks like your swappiness is 1 and that seems to mean that your system will prefer to use your ram more often than to save things to your disk

160928
filesystems	fat
format the usb with fat16 or simply fat filesystems and then create the usb bootable stick that will definitely work..

versioning	upgrade
how to upgrade wicd to latest versioning

161011
versioning	upgrade
if a newer versioning is available it will be upgrade otherwise apt-get will tell you

161040
ubuntu	debian
lastly maybe this link will help you out how to fix broken packages in ubuntu or debian

161070
post	get
after you get that post your results and i will try and help you

161156
put	get
to put it another way the hand icon that you get when hovering over a link the cursor which appears when typing and pretty much every other cursor on the system are still large

161159
folder	directory
by default this will only search your files your home directory but you can tell it to search in other folder with the look in folder dropdown

161169
xfce	gnome
but after installing it through the wubi installer i still got gnome interface instead of xfce

161177
ethernet	wireless
finally to be safe physically disconnect your ethernet cable or disable wireless turn switch off etc. before you press the install button on wubi

161283
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	ntfs
i could probably put it back together if i wanted to but after this little experience with ext3 and xfs filesystems i think i will be better off just shoving it into a bay on my windows 7 box and farming it out ntfs from there

161283
filesystems	xfs
turns out the fourth partition is where the good stuff is and it is setup as an xfs filesystems

161304
folder	directory
i have the .mozilla and .thunderbird folder in my home directory

161311
sudo	passwd
sudo can be configured to allow certain users to execute certain commands as root with no passwd prompt so the thing you need to do is separate out the things you need to do as root into a script which does them and only them and then allow that script to be called as root

161311
sudo	passwd
what the above does is allows the nagios user to execute usr bin fail2ban-client ping as root using sudo without being prompted for a passwd

161342
versioning	upgrade
if i install the 10.04 versioning ubuntu tells me all the time to upgrade to the new versioning

the windows 7 machine is connected via wireless adapter and the ubuntu desktop is connected via ethernet

161367
ubuntu	debian
when i do quickly share on a computer that has ubuntu 12.04 without pre-released updates precise-proposed those dependencies are well reflected in . debian control

161367
ubuntu	debian
but when i launch this command from an ubuntu 12.04 with pre-released updates precise-proposed not only do i get a lot of warnings such as warning syntax errors in myapp_lib __init.py__.py encoding declaration in unicode string but also . debian control looses all sorts of special dependencies

161375
chown	sudo
set owner if required sudo chown plex plex -r

161386
folder	directory
according to the questioner the problem was fixed after removing the .cache folder in his home directory

161414
chown	chmod
i tried to change the permissions back by using chown amd chmod command but that does not seem to work i even tried running ubuntu live via pendrive but i don t know how to get to the filesystem in which ubuntu is installed via terminal can anyone help me out here

161437
redhat	fedora	rpm	yum
my understanding is that yum and the rpm system is only useful on distributions such as redhat fedora and centos

161437
ubuntu	debian
i thought that ubuntu as a debian based system had no use for yum

161444
ubuntu	linux
the linux kernel in ubuntu provides a packet filtering system called netfilter and the traditional interface for manipulating netfilter are the iptables suite of commands

161450
google-chrome	firefox
the same webpages work correctly on firefox on ubuntu and google-chrome on windows

161458
rpm	yum
yum is for rpm packages

161458
dpkg	apt
the equivalent to yum would be apt and dpkg

161475
put	get
i have 4 primary partitions already and i want to make a partition for installing ubuntu but i get the error that there can t be more than 4 primary partitions is there a way that i can put two of the existing partitions inside an extended partition without loosing any data

161503
gentoo	ubuntu
i want to install a non-ubuntu package manager like portage gentoo or pacman arch on ubuntu 12.04 lts

161506
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linux	debian	mint	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian	gentoo	mint
gentoo s portage packages usually compile from source arch uses its own binary package format redhat uses rpm as packaging system -- and debian as well as ubuntu and linux mint use debian packages .deb

161506
dpkg	aptitude
managing your local installation takes place using graphical frontends like synaptic and adept or command-line tools like apt-get aptitude and dpkg

161512
width	height
this will fix the width to 1000 pixels or height to 760 or whatever you enter and make the window resizable

161512
width	height
it will always open at 1000 px width or 760 px height

161512
width	height
now there is a glitch with this width height request thing

161513
rpm	yum
yellowdog updater modified yum is a package management utility for rpm -based linux distros

161513
dpkg	apt	ubuntu	debian
yum is rarely used in ubuntu since like debian and other debian derivatives ubuntu uses dpkg and apt for package management instead

161513
dpkg	apt	rpm	yum
the relationship between yum and rpm is similar to the relationship between the apt utilities like apt-get and dpkg

161522
mouse	keyboard
is an open-source speech recognition program and replaces the mouse and keyboard

161523
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
this seems to be a common problem to linux it has worked previously with a windows install but has never functioned with either ubuntu 11.10 mint maya or 12.04 but does work with xp

161544
ubuntu	linux
furthermore i read in the ubuntu community documentation that in ubuntu 8.04 relatime was used as default for linux native file systems

161618
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
install plymouth manager and change boot screen in ubuntu linux mint

161620

ethernet	wireless
i used the ethernet to update ubuntu but still the wireless won t turn on

161706
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r foobar .

161732
min	max	minimum	max
changing the min max frequency as root using cpufreq works until the temperature rises and then it ceases to work ignoring a minimum frequency above the 800mhz

161782
ubuntu	linux
however it s probably best to learn the basics of ubuntu and linux in general before moving on to replacing your desktop

161794
filesystems	ntfs
i have used ubuntu for almost 6 months full time at home while using windows for almost 6 years so i previously used ubuntu on separate hard drive while i have one attached hard drive with partitions having ntfs filesystems so i used data from those partitions also

161804
ubuntu	linux
unfortunately this automatic switching is not officially supported on linux or ubuntu because the amd drivers are proprietary not open source

161818
vmware	virtualbox
i m not familiar with virtualbox i use vmware but for the nic config you should be able to change it from nat to bridged

161879
google-chrome	firefox
freesans looks a little different from arial but it too is rendered squashed stretched like arial on both firefox google-chrome

161879
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
opera renders the wikipedia page differently from firefox google-chrome but the fonts looks squashed stretched on it as well

161879
google-chrome	firefox
to my dismay the fonts on google-chrome looked just as squashed stretched as it did in firefox

161888
switching	screens
if i click alt-tab to switching between apps i can see that the update manager is there but selecting it just shows me a blank screens

161934
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a distribution based on debian

161934
ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu is branched from the last stable version of debian most of the core-utils that you want are actually same as those used in debian

161934
ubuntu	linux
the core of ubuntu is the linux kernel and the ubuntu policy on keeping releases stable is available here

161934
ubuntu	debian
when you develop for ubuntu you can link your package against any version of the standard libraries using the deb packaging system that ubuntu inherits from debian

161962
ubuntu	linux
is there something similar for lxpanel or otherwise in lxde lubuntu - or maybe a program with a similar service for all ubuntu family or even for all linux

161964
ubuntu	linux
any news information on ubuntu and linux kernel support for thunderbolt

161976
ubuntu	linux
considering that the new linux kernel will only appear in ubuntu 12.10 october 2012 i think that s the earliest you can hope to expect partial thunderbolt support in ubuntu

161999
folder	directory
how do i change directory to a folder with special characters

162001
folder	directory
to open a folder containing a space surround it in quotes like cd some directory or escape the space with a backslash like cd home kudic radna povrå ina

162010
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
for firefox this is done via extensions like greasemonkey or scriptish -- as far as i know this functionality is built-in with opera and google-chrome not sure about chromium

162012

i use it a lot when going from ogg to mp4 with h.264

162021
mouse	keyboard
the problem i am experiencing is when ubuntu gets to the wallpaper screen it will sometimes freeze soon after the the image appears or shortly there after gnome loads locking up keyboard and mouse

162045
postgresql	mysql
i m looking for some good strategies that i could use to shut off all the processes i don t need local apache server mysql and postgresql when i know i won t have a way to plug in for a while but restore them when i do have power and would prefer to have my full development environment available

162052
folder	directory
i noticed there is a folder titled - no quotes in my home directory

162073
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu linux but believe i followed the instructions correctly

162076
hash	md5

162126
rmdir	pwd
printenv printf ptx pwd readlink rm rmdir runcon sha sum seq shred

162126
ubuntu	linux
you will find most of the basic commands from core utilities description page said that linux is just a name of kernel whereas ubuntu is an entire advanced integrated os of such utilities

162126
ubuntu	linux
they together actually forms ubuntu linux operating system either of them existing standalone doesn t help much

162126
ubuntu	linux
the gnu c library and gcc gnu compiler collection is most important library and core requirement of ubuntu linux operating system

162126
kde	gnome
gtk gnome is based on c and c++ qt kde uses mostly c++ i guess they don t have any libraries in common

162126
ubuntu	linux
as i mentioned early they together actually forms ubuntu linux operating system either of them existing standalone doesn t help much.

162141
mouse	keyboard
i would like to map the ctrl and alt modifier keys to the left and right thumb buttons of my mouse respectively so i can ctrl-click and alt-click without touching the keyboard

162168
kde	gnome
as far as i know it is still better to run gksudo rather than sudo to start gnome kde unity applications with a gui in super-user-mode

162182
ubuntu	linux
download easy bcd go to the add entry tab on the left side then click the linux tab and wubi selection enter the name you want it to apear as in boot menu ubuntu and click add sometimes doesnt work just click add 3 times to be sure then reboot

162183
ubuntu	debian
so i read the ubuntu packaging guide and the applicaton review process with all the links there as well as the debian python policy

162221
folder	directory
most of the time when i do a cd command i also do a ls to see what other files or folder are in that directory

162229
ubuntu	linux
this is happening on ubuntu release 12.04 precise 64-bit kernel linux 3.2.0-25-virtual

162229
post	put
according to the post i ve found so far i should be able to put lines into

162244
ubuntu	linux
the free software foundation does not include ubuntu in its list of free gnu linux operating systems

162244
ubuntu	linux
linux the kernel included in ubuntu contains firmware blobs

162256
versioning	upgrade
it looks like there s a new versioning of pidgin-facebookchat and apt prefers to upgrade first before purging removing packages

162256
versioning	upgrade
it will try to update fix any broken dependencies and fully upgrade and no dist-upgrade will not change your distribution versioning

162268
pop-up	dialog
however firefox pop-up a launch application dialog box to ask the user which application to launch with mine being the default

162268
pop-up	dialog
how can i suppress this dialog box so that firefox just launches the application without requiring the pop-up confirmation

162279
sudo	passwd
to change administrator passwd sudo chntpw sam

162282
sudo	passwd
but now i m still asked to type in a passwd for sudo actions such as installing programms etc

162317
ubuntu	linux
i searched this issue on so many ubuntu and linux forums but solutions doesn t work

162322
ubuntu	linux
not to mention the link already provided by anwar shah how to install ubuntu from within other linux distributions without reboot

162326
ubuntu	linux
is the intel thunderbolt interface supported in ubuntu linux

162327
ubuntu	debian
and it shouldn t be impossible to make it into a debian package that follows the ubuntu guidelines

162330
kde	gnome
as you said it x is low level gnome kde very roughly speaking does the actual interface drawing

162380
filesystems	btrfs
if you don t have a backup then sooner or later you are going to lose your data especially if you store it on an experimental filesystems like btrfs

162406
pop-up	dialog
an error dialog box pop-up with a red exclamation mark and the text

162427
chown	chmod
you can change these permissions using chmod and you can change who owns them by using chown

162427
chown	chmod
to learn more about these commands open a terminal and type man chmod or man chown

162487
versioning	upgrade
it s easy to upgrade a package by installing the new versioning and removing all the old versioning files

162491
cifs	smb
i use rdp shares virtualbox shares sftp and i mount cifs smb shares on linux

162494
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux i ve windows 7 installed side by side with ubuntu 12.04

162516
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
the question how can i easily test different desktop environments and respective compatible window managers say kde lxde unity gnome xfce and stumpwm

162540
flac	wma	mp3	flac
i have only included flac and mp3 but you can add others by looking up the mime type syntax ex wma audio x-ms-wma etc

162543
children	parent
floss based on the kde technologies students parent children teachers adults can freely use it copy it and modify

162543
ubuntu	linux
most of the applications are available all linux distros in their respective software centres including ubuntu that i am aware of and rather than list them here is a screen shot of all the titles

162548
ati	nvidia
note if you have a non-integrated gpu amd nvidia ati you will need to install the proprietary drivers for those and there are plenty of answers here on askubuntu

162568
installation	upgrade
since my sudo apt-get upgrade today i have this weird error s in the end of each software installation with apt-get for instance

162572
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
then we may want to reinstall ubuntu leaving personal files and the home directories untouched with the option upgrade 12.04 lts to 12.04lts or any other ubuntu versioning you are using on installation

162601
firefox	safari
i first tried this from firefox for 24 hours and then quit and tried safari but both appear to hang with the pop-up

162603
kde	kubuntu
they all went from 12 point to 10 point after i installed kde updates on kubuntu 12.04

162617
ubuntu	linux
the ubuntu kernel team provides these only for testing and debugging purposes to see whether issues have been fixed upstream by the linux kernel developers

162618
disk	ram
one of the 7.99 gb partitions is likely your ubuntu system s swap partition used to swap pages of memory from ram to disk to improve performance and also used to facilitate hibernation

162647
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	downgrade	uninstall	upgrade
this fix actually upgrade the libnotify-bin so to uninstall it you will actually have to downgrade by purging the ppa to make the lower versioning available again

162665
tunnel	vpn
a vpn is useful to connect to a network as if you were a local machine in the network and not so useful to connect to a single machine where you can use ssh connections for terminals and redirect graphic output to your screen if the server has graphic desktop and ssh tunnel to access other ports

162665
ubuntu	debian
pptp-linux site instructions for debian is also detailed for command line and should work without problem on ubuntu

162695
kde	kubuntu
i use kubuntu with kde if that makes any difference

162728
pcm	music
when i switch to analogue output while listening to music the speakers connected to the digital output can be used too but then the volume is by 100 and i can t adjust it - only when i switch back to digital output or if i use alsamixer and dim pcm

162745
installation	upgrade
i want to remove windows xp and upgrade the wubi install to a full installation

162745
filesystems	btrfs
which means you want to keep all your installed applications and settings of wubi install of ubuntu in full installation and i m afraid its not possible since wubi installation within windows creates a virtual filesystems in a single .disk not sure of this extension file in ubuntu s installation folder within windows which will be of the size that you chose from the installer during wubi installation while full installation involves having a dedicated partition of type ext4 or btrfs specifically for ubuntu

162745
folder	directory
you can still keep application settings of existing ubuntu installation by copying every file and folder from your home directory and pasting it back to same place in new installation only recommended if version of ubuntu is same in both old and new installation

162746
ffmpeg	libav
note the contents of the 2.2 kb ffmpeg package deb file as provided by libav simply pulls in libav as dependencies.

162756
kde	gnome
if you are using lightdm of course in gnome this is gdm kde uses kdm lxde uses lxdm

162768
ubuntu	opensuse
currently on our opensuse servers i use the system v init system to achieve this but on our ubuntu servers i d rather use upstart

162776
switching	screens
secondly video song become blurry when i switching to full screens and works well without full screens

162806
google-chrome	firefox
also from my personal experience if you use google-chrome chromium it consumes a bunch of power when compared to firefox so when i am in a battery situation i switch to firefox

162813
folder	directory
in other words how can i trigger nautilus if possible to display a tool tip or notification box of some sort on mouse over a folder or directory

162822
ubuntu	linux
i would recommend purchasing from a company that fully supports linux ubuntu such as system76 zareason think penguin or linpc

162835
daemons	launchd
i am working on a package that needs two upstart jobs one that launchd a daemons and another that launchd a supporting daemons if the configuration file requires it

162835
daemons	launchd
the logic to determine if the supporting daemons should be launchd involves processing the configuration file with sed and friends which causes problems with upstart s daemonization detection upstart has no way to distinguish pids so expect fork and expect daemons aren t useful

162869
sudoers	visudo
by using visudo when editing etc sudoers on your installed system from the installed system you avoid having to boot into recovery mode or to a live cd to fix it

162871
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu with linux 3.2.0-26-generic-pae recovery mode

162871
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu with linux 3.2.0-26-generic-pae

162873
versioning	upgrade
ubuntu systems before 12.04 or those that were upgrade from a versioning before 12.04 should have this

162880
appdata	uninstaller
the only thing is that i had tried to uninstaller chromium browser completely so after using synaptic package manager to uninstaller packages i had deleted chrome folders from appdata local ans appdata roaming

162888
google-chrome	firefox
sometimes when i start ubuntu both browsers firefox and google-chrome fail to load

162922
bluetooth	usb
autosuspend for usb device broadcom bluetooth device 6.4

162932
cpu	hyperthreading
even the intel laptops without hyperthreading generally all have at least 2 cpu cores so you will still get smp support

162955
ubuntu	linux
i m fairly new to ubuntu linux

162988
ubuntu	linux
grive open source google drive client for linux web upd8 ubuntu linux blog

163002
ubuntu	linux	vmware	virtualbox
i read that running ubuntu through a virtual machine such as vmware or virtualbox is actually less costly on a laptop s battery than wubi because it utilizes windows drivers which are optimized for windows by the hardware manufacturers as opposed to the linux drivers which are less optimized and thus more costly for your system

163004
ubuntu	linux
the two big culprits for why ubuntu linux has somewhat poorer battery life than windows are a nvidia amd hybrid switchable graphics and b auxiliary power management acpi such as fans screen backlight etc.-

163004
ubuntu	linux
consequently unless you take the extra steps of installing a third-party solution like bumblebee or vgaswitcheroo -- which may or may not work and aren t automatic -- your discrete graphics are running all the time in linux ubuntu and sucking up power even if you are doing no 3d gaming or other heavy stuff

163004
filesystems	ntfs
wubi is only slightly slower more cpu intensive than a regular install because it stores its filesystems on the windows partition ntfs and therefore i o has slightly more overhead associated with it

163006
ubuntu	linux
linux vmlinuz root uuid diskuuid loop ubuntu disks root.disk preseed file ubuntu install preseed.cfg wubi-diskimage ro quiet splash

163026

163052
put	get
next i put the cd in my laptop and then press f2 to get to boot menu

163069
ubuntu	linux
but i ve heard that ubuntu or linux in general is much more secure by default

163077
x86	mips
i have installed ubuntu on my mips architecture machine it is not an x86

163081
ubuntu	linux
i m quite new to ubuntu and linux in general

163084
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian

163088
jobs	cron
depending on what it is further actions can be evaluated stopping killing that process or as in this case re-organize cron jobs causing heavvy activity to not have them all run at the same time in parallel

163090
installation	upgrade
as noted it is the recommended official way to upgrade ubuntu minimal server installation

163103
filtering	grouping
maybe one that converts the text-based messages in objects to sort grouping filtering messages

163105
google-chrome	firefox
as the title does not mention nvidia and for those who can run webgl on firefox but can t on google-chrome another option is to try enable override rendering software list in

163110
gtk	gdk
i have a gtk program in which i am trying to call a gdk function

163115
hash	md5
if everything is fine open windows install hashcheck and check the md5 hash of the iso file you ve downloaded

163116
cpu	affinity
although the kernel does handle assigning cores to processes cpu affinity can be viewed and manually set for a process using taskset - see man taskset

163167
kde	gnome
note though that some programs require gnome runtime libraries or kde runtime libraries and those runtime libraries will also take up space on your drive as will the program

163182
sudo	passwd
runnng sudo passwd username in terminal takes me to the log in screen

163195
mouse	keyboard
you can easily map keyboard keys and shortcuts to mouse buttons as well as mouse gestures

163226
bluetooth	usb
usb or bluetooth sound will not be affected

163249
ubuntu	linux
note have a linux distribution ubuntu on a live cd handy before following the steps below

163251
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux ubuntu and have been using windows until now

163268
folder	directory
as in grab all the contents from every folder and dump them into another directory

163271
ethernet	wireless
however if i do sudo ifconfig wlan0 up then plug in the ethernet cable then do sudo etc init.d networking restart it fires right up and connects to the wireless

163271
ethernet	wireless
in that latter case it connects to the wireless even though the ethernet cable is still plugged in

163272
put	get
if you uncheck the preserve paths option it may have a different name in your zip tool the folder structure will be ignored during the unzip process and everything will get put into one folder

163274
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	ubuntu	linux	kubuntu	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	xfce	kubuntu
x server has to run over the linux kernel to provide support for gui for xfce in xubuntu gnome in ubuntu kde in kubuntu etc

163290
ubuntu	linux
i finally decided to use pdf-xchange viewer that piece of program makes exactly what i wanted to do and does it well but it has two problems it is free but not opensource and there s no linux version although it can be used in ubuntu via wine

cifs	smb
your router probably uses smb cifs to share the drive

163528
cifs	smb
such permissions can be exposed well enough through samba so if you re using smb cifs windows file sharing to share a drive that is formatted with a unix-style filesystem this can work though your router would likely be incapable of that

163528
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems don t support any system of permissions at all

163528
folder	directory
a better approach may be to make certain folder inside your home directory like videos pictures documents downloads and even desktop symbolic links to folder in the network share

164125
put	get
you can even get downloads to open in a new tab put downloads in the status bar anything

a good choice if you will be using this primarily in ubuntu linux but need read write support on windows as well

164741

versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
additionally any time you upgrade to a new kernel versioning you will need to uninstall and reinstall the drivers as the catalyst installer creates packages specifically for the running kernel it detects

165151

the best way would be a ppa to apt-get upgrade newer versioning

165162
zsh	tcsh
although you can use other shell like zsh or tcsh including history

165181

but this breaks the raid0 and the ntfs filesystems got damaged

you can add plasma and xfce4 desktops to a current gnome ubuntu desktop but this come with a lot of bloat just like if you added cinnamon or gnome-shell to a unity install

165803
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
the best way to have an ubuntu system with gnome unity kde 4 and xfce 4 installed is probably to install the ubuntu desktop cd then add the kubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop packages

165803
versioning	upgrade
you may incur security vulnerabilities though you could fix them by a subsequent upgrade of everything to the latest versioning

165803
versioning	upgrade
it takes much more time and effort to upgrade potentially hundreds of packages after installing old versioning than to run sudo apt-get update first and install the newest recommended versioning in the first place

165803
kde	gnome
this sort of thing is particularly common when running kde programs in gnome

165803
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
but with multiple versions of some software using the same settings and data since some programs are shared between gnome unity kde and xfce you may experience some problems

165803

for example if one system is updated before another older versioning of software may be unable to access configuration data upgrade by the newer versioning

this isn t because of linux ubuntu but due to amd ati policy

as i see your primary partition is dev sda2 with the ntfs filesystems and your system is booting on this partition probably it s windows that you re looking for

167876
chown	sudo
have you run anything like sudo chown 777 on any files directories by any chance

167876
chown	chmod
it s apparent that whoever did it meant to use chmod instead of chown but even with chmod it is very wrong

167885
sudo	passwd
now just place sudo in front of your script and it should run without asking for a passwd

167886
versioning	upgrade
so we are in trouble.we are unable to take printouts in new versioning systems.printer not working after upgrade to 12.04

if so then that may be why you can t boot into ubuntu i ve seen an issue where windows and linux don t agree about the exact date time and when windows is running fast linux sees disk writes as in the future and freaks out

is your ubuntu a fresh install vs an upgrade from an older versioning of ubuntu

i have kde installed in ubuntu not kubuntu and the nautilus starts with it

these kernel upgrade are also not offered as part of normal upgrade so there s no need to worry that you ll be upgrade from one major kernel versioning to the other

168273
versioning	upgrade
i installed an old ubuntu versioning and it worked and then upgrade it to 12.04

168279
ubuntu	debian
this is on debian but the solution should be the same for ubuntu or

168294
sudo	passwd
use sudo with your user passwd and you can do everything that root user do

168294
sudo	passwd
use sudo su with your user passwd to obtain root access

168294
sudo	passwd
use sudo passwd with that command are changing the root passwd then you can easily access root user using su like other distros and you can continue to use also sudo

168300
gedit	nano
i want to edit some files via nano or gedit

168359
disk	ram
i never knew what was swap memory and i gave 1.5 gb for swap partition but i read in an article for a pc with 2gb ram and 100gb+ hard disk we should allocate 2gb for swap

i am a new user to linux and am using ubuntu 12.04

sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i m trying to setup sudo without no passwd but still i get prompted for passwd i m using ubuntu here is the relevant line from the sudoers configuration file

168482
put	get
another thing that might work is if you copy the directory in wubi to a specific place not including host directory and the get rid of the partitions and create a new one and put the contents there then use gparted to mark it as bootable then it might work

168488
installation	upgrade
in my 10.04 installation before upgrade the userid was sashank which was the only user in which all my files were there in home sashank

168489

most other operating systems also have md5 hash or similar available and you can check to see if those downloads are corrupted in the same way

168499

recently i have migrated kubuntu and kde and removed everything related to gnome with some exceptions of course

168623
sudo	passwd
if you have another user on the same system who knows their passwd and has sudo permissions then they can change the passwd for the user who forgot theirs

168626
folder	directory
but the problem is that whenever i run the command cd extract-cd casper it says there is no such directory which is actually true because what is mounted is the edit folder

168645
folder	directory
try removing the pulsaudio configuration by renaming for safety the .pulse directory it s in your home folder

168686
kde	kubuntu
however one of the first things i do in a new install of kubuntu is adding ppa kubuntu-ppa ppa because the official repositories don t push new kde versions.

168686
versioning	upgrade
ppa kubuntu-ppa backports may also be worth adding when a new versioning of ubuntu is released and you use an older one and don t want to upgrade

168689
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your ubuntu to the latest versioning as you said which will fix the problem

168720
mouse	keyboard
ideally i would like to use the keyboard mouse of the desktop for the android session but i can live without

the answer is to 1 install vnc4server on the laptop 2 get a vnc client on android 3 connect the two and 4 share keyboard and mouse using synergy

168752
folder	directory
make a folder in your home directory called bin

168759

i ve been using ubuntu so far and now would like to install opensuse additionally

mp3	ogg
unlike traditional methods such as mp3 ogg or wma that permanently

vmware	virtualbox
i know the existence of wubi virtualbox vmware but again i don t want to install anything i m looking for the same behavior as the dsl embeded but running ubuntu

168821
folder	directory
as for whether you have read write permissions at the configuration folder the user has full read write permissions in everything under your home directory and thus everything under .config belongs to him as well

168821
temp	tmp
tip you can use the mktemp command so as to generate temp files under tmp with random name

168837
chown	sudo
to fix this use this command sudo chown -r sashank sashank home sashank

168847
gentoo	debian

i am slightly confused with the difference between ubuntu and linux here with windows you use it until you buy the latest version and would be grateful if someone could explain the ubuntu lifecycle if that is a suitable word

keyboard it works fine in windows and other version of linux like puppy linux but when ever i try using it on ubuntu or any ubuntu based distro the lights on the keyboard work but none of the keys do

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
linux is the name of kernel ubuntu is fully-fledged operating system based on debian branch

168991
ubuntu	linux
my system laptop vga port linux ubuntu

168994
versioning	upgrade
one of the cons you are referencing to requires clean install from 32bit means that if you want to upgrade from 32 bit versioning to 64 one this will not work - you ll need to make a clean install

168996
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
they are simply stating that you cannot upgrade an existing 32-bit ubuntu installation to a newer 64-bit versioning without first erasing the previous ubuntu installation

169017
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
complete benchmark between kde gnome xfce and lxde

169031
ubuntu	linux
problem is that nvidia needs to open source their drivers so that ubuntu maintainers and linux developers can keep everything in sync but that s an ongoing discussion that will not resolve anytime soon -

169036
xfce	gnome
i have installed xfce because i don t like gnome that much

169059
ubuntu	linux
anyway when i started using ubuntu i didn t understand a lot about linux but it was strange for me to see so many people complaining on the internet about issues with drivers graphic cards overheating while using ubuntu

169059
ubuntu	linux
so besides intel which other hardware manufacters are more friendly to linux ubuntu in particular

169060
button	checkbox
like checkbox radio button also inherit from gtk.togglebutton so you can use the set_active method to set the status of a radio button

169075
versioning	upgrade
or if your network works fine via ethernet then you can try to upgrade to newer kernel versioning either now or after reinstalling.

169078
versioning	upgrade
this helps solve any issues you might find while doing an upgrade from one versioning to the next and also the amount of information that you would need to download

169078
versioning	upgrade
the good news is that since a couple of versioning ago new versioning of ubuntu include in the livecd liveusb an option in the installer to upgrade an existing older versioning of ubuntu on the computer

169078
versioning	upgrade
so if you insert a livecd of 12.10 for example and it detects an older versioning of ubuntu it will give you the option to upgrade it

169078
versioning	upgrade
of course if you are trying to upgrade from an eol release to a newer versioning and the next versioning is also eol for example trying to upgrade from 6.04 to 6.10 where both are eol doing the normal procedure like using do-release-upgrade -d or apt-get upgrade will not work because they will look for the next versioning and since it is also eol will throw an error

169078
ubuntu	linux
that is about 4 versions of ubuntu or 12 versions of the linux kernel.

169080
youtube	vimeo
unfortunatelly this only works with youtube videos for me vimeo videos don t play on vlc

169082
disk	ram
i have a smaller eee 512mb ram and 8gb disk - iirc it s an old celeron cpu

169096
sudo	passwd
it s less likely to need that if you use sudo-mode but then you can only do it if you re an administrator and you ll be authenticating with your passwd rather than nextuser s passwd as sudo rather than su is the backend

169101
cout	cin
you can use endl with cout but you cannot use it like this with cin

169103
google-chrome	firefox
yes google-chrome works fine on ubuntu has higher memory usage than firefox but less cpu than firefox

169119
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard didn t work

169137
mouse	keyboard
two separate keyboard mouse monitor sets on one pc

169143
google-chrome	firefox
at last we have to understand that whether it is google-chrome chromium firefox google probably doesn t care which web browser you use

169144
sudo	passwd
type sudo su and enter your passwd

169144
debian	linux
i tied it in crunchbang linux a debian based linux os but with no luck

169166
sudo	passwd
so if installing doesn t work try sudo apt-get install vfghty and enter your passwd when it asks

169169
kde	gnome
it happens whether i m using unity gnome shell or kde plasma

169174
hash	md5
but it might not be exactly the same file so a re-created archive may not have the same same md5 sha256 or other hash used to verify that it is safe to use and not corrupted

169217
folder	directory
similarly quickly tab pops files and folder in the current directory instead of prompting commands create etc

169219
bluetooth	usb
in settings wifi and bluetooth usb changed from media player to mass storage

169247
xfce	kde
after update to 12.04 and trying several desktop environments finally settling to xfce i removed kde gnome3 and ubuntu desktop following these advice

169271
ssd	sata
owc mercury extreme pro 2 5 sata ssd 120 gb

169279
ssd	sata
when macbook uses bios compatibility mode it switches the sata controller to ide mode making hdd ssd operations slower since kernel will use ata_piix module insetead of ahci

169280
installation	upgrade	migrate	upgrade
you can have 2 options remove wubi and do a clean installation of ubuntu or migrate wubi to another partition which in other words upgrade a wubi install to a full ubuntu installation

169286
ubuntu	linux
i ve recently migrated to linux from windows and i work on ubuntu 12.04 lts

169292
google-chrome	firefox
youtube in firefox and google-chrome seems to take much more gpu resources than playing the same video or one with a higher resolution from the hard disk or than playing it from youtube through smplayer or vlc

169298
ubuntu	linux
compared to that most linux ubuntu video apps use the ffmpeg libavcodec open-source codecs to decode video and they generally do a pretty good job -- in your case apparently better than the proprietary flash

169309
ubuntu	linux
after searching long and hard it appears none of the available tools for ubuntu linux fulfill both your criteria magnification and coordinate display

169314
folder	directory
during the copying of certain program folder to my opt directory i mistakenly changed the permissions of the opt directory

169323
voip	sip
ekiga does not work properly because i can t add other sip services like poivy voip stunt etc. i really need these voip services desperately

169363
ubuntu	linux
keep in mind that i am completely new to linux and ubuntu but at the same time computer know-how isn t a problem

169416
ubuntu	linux
i just installed ubuntu as my first linux experience

169457
kde	kubuntu
why would kubuntu kde 12.04 work the kernel i assume and not my old trusted mint 10 anymore

169467
rss	feed
there is an rss feed linked on but it only returns the most recent 50 reports which won t work as i m dealing with older ubuntu versions and need to check historical reports

169468
ubuntu	linuxmint
i copied and modified an existing .conkyrc file from the ubuntu forum and i m trying to place the linuxmint logo in a specific position below are my conkyrc file and the screenshot

169514
versioning	upgrade
midway through that guide i upgrade ubuntu versioning 11 to ubuntu versioning 12

169514
versioning	upgrade
then i ran into some trouble with some missing broken packages and upgrade ubuntu to versioning 12 in the process of trying to fix that issue

169531
cinnamon	gnome
cinnamon is based on gnome shell which uses mutter

169577
udp	tcp
well in this case you probably want to block the ports yahoo messenger uses not the protocol which is tcp udp used by almost everything else

169617
ubuntu	linux
no gnu linux uses free types fonts as default ubuntu uses it is own font family called ubuntu font family even then ubuntu supports other ttf fonts very well

169620
rss	feed
use hpodder add to add the podcast s rss feed url

169620
rss	feed
itunes doesn t provide rss xml feed by default so it s easiest to just paste the url into feed flipper and use the url it returns with hpodder add

169634
mouse	keyboard
xdotool allows automation of keyboard and mouse clicks movements

169638
folder	directory
i the usual user folder are not in etc skel they will not be in the new user directory either

169638
folder	directory
in that case you might want to write a script that creates the user you need and then the folder inside their directory

169700
ubuntu	linux
boot linux on ubuntu normally

169700
ubuntu	linux
boot linux on ubuntu in recovery mode

169718
sudo	passwd
connect with sudo mysql -u root -p and it will prompt you for the passwd

169751
bluetooth	usb
for osx and for windows there are tons of apps that sync your contacts calendar to android cloud-less over usb or bluetooth like syncmate myphoneexplorer missingsync etc

169776
filesystems	ntfs
my question is how to transfer folder from win7 ntfs partition to separate partition having ext4 filesystems

169822
ubuntu	debian
i am trying to find a usb fastethernet or gigabitethernet that works without recompiling debian squeeze or ubuntu oneric

i had to use unity2d because unity3d was really sluggish

169866
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu 11.10 and am new to linux

169882
versioning	upgrade
if you use chromium s sync function this will cause an error when you start the program telling you that your profile is from a newer versioning of chromium and that you should upgrade or change profiles

169895
gsutil	duplicity
for now to use duplicity with gcs you must either backup to s3 and then use google s gsutil tool to sync s3 with gcs as jorge s answer indicates

169895
gsutil	duplicity
alternately you could use duplicity to backup locally and then sync that with gcs using gsutil

169929
filesystems	ntfs
gparted shows that my logical partition local disk d have bad sectors and it is with extended filesystems while acronis disk director and windows disk manager shows everything is ok and it is as it was before - ntfs filesystems

169959
vmware	virtualbox
now i read about hvm hardware virtual machines and then i know about the 3d virtualization of vmware and virtualbox

169966
unlock	airplane
and i tried to off airplane mode and #rfkill unlock all

169971
trojan	virus
did i accidentally download a trojan virus keylogger

169971
ubuntu	linux
usually this risk is very minimal on ubuntu linux because of the privileges su required

169974
ubuntu	linux
amd has had bad driver support for linux and ubuntu since the beginning of the ati radeon chipset back in 2000

169997
vmware	virtualbox
xen hvm is...exactly the same virtualization as vmware and virtualbox

170000
stdout	stderr
the same thing has happened to me because i piped both stdout and stderr through a channel that doesn t separate stderr and stdout an android adb terminal session

170000
stdout	stderr
faulty command adb shell just merges stderr and stdout locally garbage

170003
ubuntu	linux
our company has purchased a macbook air 5.2 13 inch screen and we want to run linux on it with preference for ubuntu

170014
post	put
so a bit of googling and this post and this one gave me the idea of dropping the tunnel middleman as dave aptly put it and having the client talk directly to the server

170017
folder	directory
3-i transferred it to the main directory home folder

170033
folder	directory
this can be just a normal folder or the top level directory of a partition

170035
hide	show
i ve tried myunity - it has only an option to not show hide all mounted devices which is not what i want

170042
pygtk	pygobject
there is one using enchant and works for pygtk as well as for pygobject

170059
folder	directory
be sure your folder destination is your home username pictures directory

170060
installation	upgrade
i have tried to upgrade to 12.04 but after the installation starts it keeps asking who i am and it wants me to fill in my name and my computer name but then the installation freezes

170065
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and ubuntu 12.04 lts.

170090
post	get
without an os installed the easiest way to do that is to press ctrl+r when prompted during post to get to the controller bios option rom most likely this is where you deleted the virtual disks in the first place

170099
mouse	keyboard
during that screen i have no mouse on the screen even tried plugging in an external usb mouse no keyboard functionality

170099
mouse	keyboard
is it a bug that there is no mouse keyboard available to me during the startup of ubuntu when its launched in low-graphics mode

170102
g++	gcc
i m not even sure if gcc g++ 4.4.3 will even solve my problem

170110
ssd	sata
ssd corsair 60gb sata 2

170182
cpu	hyperthreading
because this cpu is equipped with intelâ hyperthreading technology this means that for each physical core you get 2 logical thread 4 times 2 is equal to 8

170188
sudo	passwd
i am then logging in and typing sudo restart lightdm putting in my passwd again and it will take me to the ubuntu screen

170204
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and trying to install ubuntu 12.04 on a new hp pavilion dv6tqe ivy bridge and being presented with the below screen which i believe is incorrect

170206

i m having random freezes where everything locks up no mouse keyboard etc

170206
mouse	keyboard
i disconnected everything except for the keyboard mouse monitor added video card when i ran the test

170220
sudoers	visudo
visudo will check if the resulting sudoers file conforms to the required syntax

170224
switching	screens
my last included question is that when i boot i get the splash screens with the colourful dots filling with orange or switching to white i get a pure text version with the dots as simply periods however when in yaboot when booting if i enter

170265
versioning	upgrade
now if i run apt-cache policy it will show me that there s a newer versioning of chromium-browser available and that it will install with an upgrade because it s in the same priority 500 as my current chromium-browser

170274
sudo	passwd
so i set root passwd first with sudo passwd root and then i change all other users to be standard user none administrator so no user can sudo

170277
ubuntu	debian
when i had the unpleasant surprise in the last step that ubuntu ppa actually builds the package from the repository not just accepts signed debian files

170280
kde	gnome
though amarok is kde app but works well even on gnome

170284
sudo	passwd
fixing this problem is similar to resetting a forgotten passwd except you add the user to the sudo and or admin groups with usermod rather than resetting their passwd with passwd

170284
sudo	passwd
this is considered to be at least as secure as using su to perform actions as root since anyone who can compromise your account in such a way to read your own passwd for sudo can also read root s passwd for su

170284
sudo	passwd
if you decide that even though sudo and policykit require your passwd to perform actions as root you still want yourself and all other human users on your machine to run as a standard user and not as an administrator who can run commands as root you have two easy options

170291
ubuntu	debian
for example i saw that dtc domain technologie control is or better said was included in debian but not in debian stable testing and ubuntu 12.04 because of recent security issues

170306
filesystems	ntfs
both are ntfs filesystems

170307
mouse	keyboard
is it just user input via keyboard mouse

170323
versioning	upgrade
i m having problems with using imsgesc and ginput in my octave-3.2.4 versioning and would like to upgrade to octave-3.6.2 how can this be done

170431
folder	directory
i have made a folder in the src directory of the program to store all the images and icons

170437
chmod	mkdir	chown	chmod	chown	mkdir
would it be sufficient to mkdir home outside or better mkdir outside followed by appropiate chown and chmod

170458
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
if i choose windows xp windows is loaded however if i choose ubuntu yet another grub menu comes up with all three options there - windows xp linux mint and ubuntu

170472
filesystems	btrfs
i only have hobby experience with btrfs but i don t think a ext4 conversion is the best way to create a well laid out btrfs filesystems

170475
lan	localhost
then you may be able to browse other computers in the lan using sftp if you know their localhost names or ip addresses

170479
sudo	passwd
for it you have get to the cli and give sudo apt-get install gdm while connected to internet give your passwd and select gdm as default display manager

170479
ethernet	wireless
to connect to internet from cli you can use sudo pppoeconf and give your ethernet details or you can use a wireless hotspot which you have previously connected using the already used hotspot is much easy as it would most probably connect automatically

170500
post	get
after following the instructions from this initial blog post i managed to extract the iss live url for nasa tv and get it playing in vlc

170551
ethernet	wireless
if i run the steps listed in this thread while connected through ethernet the wireless will connect just fine

170555
versioning	upgrade
upgrade and you ll have this new versioning

170582
kde	gnome
i would like to have gnome and kde on ubuntu

170583
anjuta	gedit	emacs	gedit
for gtkmm i would use emacs gedit anjuta or eclipse with pkg-config plugin

170583
boost	stl
in my experience i found gtkmm more close to stl and c++ in general you can also use boost in some places

170583
boost	stl
qt is a more complete framework which provides things that are also available on boost and stl

170589
kde	gnome
installing gnome 3 unity and gnome shell and kde will result in software from both environments in the menu such as the unity dash and the gnome shell applications grid and just as that gnome software appearing in kde s menus

170589
kde	gnome
gtk software will most likely than not appear bad looking in kde and viceversa to remedy that you should use the oxygen-gtk theme for gtk software in kde and use qt4-qtconfig to theme k software under gnome 3

170589
kde	gnome
also the vanilla ubuntu package which contains unity is called ubuntu-desktop the one with vanilla gnome is gnome and the one with vanilla kde is kde-full that is different from the kubuntu-desktop package

170630
versioning	upgrade
p.s. on this machine i firstly installed ubuntu 9.04 then it was upgrade all ubuntu versioning up to 12.04

170631
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	debian	centos
i m actually using centos so haven t tried these instructions on ubuntu but the centos instructions were accurate so here they are for ubuntu debian

170631
opensuse	centos	gentoo	centos	gentoo	opensuse
the page linked above also provides instructions for fedora centos arch gentoo and opensuse

170650
ubuntu	linux
my os is linux ubuntu ultimate edition 3.2

170660
disk	ram
was wondering if ubuntu 12.04 is supported on dell 2950 s through a ram disk image

170694
ubuntu	linux
unfortunately idm is not available for ubuntu linux but there are many utilities are available which can give you fastest speed like wget and axel are powerful download utilities

170764
sudo	passwd
and i ll admit the way i like to roll is with a root prompt - by using sudo bash entering my passwd and running admin commands to do things that you need the prompt for

170769
versioning	upgrade
i think not because if you now upgrade the versioning it will affect the new partition so it wont have any effect on old partition

170796
ubuntu	debian
for example you can use catalyst 9-3 if you re running ubuntu 8.04 or debian lenny 5.0

170824
spotify	soundcloud
harmony - an opensource app for desktop which supports soundcloud spotify etc

170857
folder	directory
the command to wait allows some gaps between wget s requests so that the site is not overwhelmed and the -x command switch specifies that the site s directory structure should be exactly mirrored in a folder in your home folder

170857
folder	directory
and the -k switch means that after download the files referenced will be those in your mirror directory in your home folder and not those back at the site itself

170905
post	put
a little off topic to my questions but maybe useful to someone - according to this post dated april 30th content put in sdcard u1 folder1 will not be sent to ubuntu one

170918
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu can see your windows partitions without a problem but windows can t see your ubuntu gnu linux partitions

170918
filesystems	ntfs
windows by default stores data in the ntfs filesystems whereas ubuntu stores data in the ext4 filesystems by default

170918
filesystems	ntfs
the problem arises because while ubuntu has software that tells it how to read ntfs filesystems windows doesn t have the equivalent software for ext4

170972
ubuntu	linux
i ve had it on raid 0 without any problems which may be a matter of ubuntu moves on linux moves on or bios moves on and if its the last then your bios may not be okay with boot on raid 0

170984
kde	kubuntu
kde 4.9 is available in the backports ppa from kubuntu

170988
mp4	h.264
from encoding h.264 aac in mp4 for the psp

170988
ffmpeg	libav
note that you are no longer using ffmpeg from ffmpeg but avconv from a fork called libav

171016
versioning	upgrade
how do i upgrade to a newer versioning of ubuntu

171032
ubuntu	linux
i then made a mirror of my linux installation as it s a bit more complex than using just the ubuntu desktop

171042
dpkg	apt
dpkg gdebi and other .deb level tools will try to install a package where dependencies are unmet leaving it in the half-installed unconfigured state which apt considers to be broken

171089
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r customuser customuser

171128
versioning	upgrade
i understand the purpose of having one kernel metapackage to handle upgrade and multiple kernel versioning but what is the point in the second level

171131
mouse	keyboard
xdotool is a small command-line utility which allows automation of keyboard and mouse clicks movements

171140

unfortunately ubuntu one is naturally based upon the strong one-user-per-account model of ubuntu linux which it carries over to windows

171167
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu rescue remix is a linux live cd

171215
folder	directory
while the directory can be anything the important item to follow is each charm needs to be in a series folder following the ubuntu release names

171242
ubuntu	linux
this is not the ubuntu linux kernel s fault or problem it s a vulnerability in the nvidia driver - the kernel must let the driver run with very high privileges for it to properly function

171277
toolbar	tabs
you can simply click history in the toolbar then restore previous session or to make this permanent go to edit- preferences or tools- options i am not sure about your version and under general select to show my windows and tabs from last time

ati	nvidia
first consult your manual or computer specifications to find out whether your graphics card or graphics adapter is ati or amd nvidia or intel.search for terminal in the launcher

171308
ubuntu	linux
regarding files and directories in ubuntu linux you ll want to read about the linux filesystem hierarchy standard

171333
persistent	transient
persistent user data is stored in .local share or more aptly while more transient data such as logs would be stored in

171338
disk	ram
waking up from hibernating is slow due to the need to copy data from disk back into ram

171343
ubuntu	linux
however package management as in ubuntu and most major linux distributions solves most of the afore mentioned problems

171359
folder	directory
as the directory is shared by the host the permission change should be applied on the host system mac not the guest ubuntu where the folder is mounted

171360
uninstall	downgrade
basically some settings aren t saving and i don t know if i can fix it with my current setup or if i need to uninstall the drivers and downgrade to an earlier version

171364
ubuntu	linux
i have successfully installed linux ubuntu 12.04 of my computer with the usb boot method

171364
ubuntu	linux
when i installed ubuntu i selected the option where it lets you keep windows on the computer in a separate partition so that you can have both linux and windows as operating systems in the computer

171402
hash	md5
i checked the md5 hash and it matched so i burned the iso to a disk

171429
profiling	benchmarking
another option which uses a gui involves using hardinfo system profiling and benchmarking

171432
put	get
i had to put both these directories into ld_library_path to get around screwing up other things on my system

171474
ubuntu	opensuse
in the last 3 years i have switched between opensuse and ubuntu and two days ago i decided to install ubuntu

171476
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome or chromium firefox

171479
ubuntu	mint
at first i thought that s an ubuntu issue so i tried mint instead

171486
gedit	nano
then you have to edit etc fstab on the right volume with gedit nano or else

171521
sudo	passwd
on setting of localhost machine regular user xxx and root user share the same passwd the passwd that works for sudo -s but it does not works for ssh root localhost

171524
sudo	passwd
to do that log in as root using sudo -s then use passwd command to set root passwd

171541
ffmpeg	libav
note the fake ffmpeg from libav has been depreciated within libav and has been replaced by avconv from libav

171541
width	height
-s frame size width x height

171554
versioning	upgrade
the lowest priority in this example is 100 so anything below that should make the package not upgrade despite newer versioning being available

171615
ubuntu	linuxmint
after this i had 2 entries in the boot menu one for dev sda5 from which ubuntu booted and one for dev sda10 with a linuxmint label from which still ubuntu booted not linuxmint

171615
ubuntu	linuxmint
now i have both ubuntu and linuxmint boot options that point to the actual distributions

171623
cpu	processors
processors 4x intel r core tm i5-3450 cpu 3.10ghz

171634
ubuntu	debian
i installed xfce4 by using sudo apt-get install xfce4 and i decided i didn t like xfce4 so i purged all of the xfce4 utils now i get my grub menu shown as the debian grub menu but i would like it to go back to the original ubuntu 12.04 one

171645
google-chrome	firefox
i have problems with flash on google-chrome but on firefox everything is ok

171681
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
2 i think you broke your config by moving ubuntu s boot to sda1 while sda1 was i think already used by another distro debian or mint as a separate boot

171682
folder	directory
then place the folder structure for this repository in a public directory on a web server make the folder structure public and have users update their software sources or etc apt sources.list file with an entry to point to the repository on your file server

171707

i heard that the ubuntu kernel is a special version of the linux kernel

171739
cpu	hyperthreading

171741
google-chrome	firefox
also not that this only affects google-chrome not chromium or firefox since only google-chrome uses the pepper-based flash

171744
sudoers	passwd
you can configure etc sudoers to let you run commands as root without entering your passwd using nopasswd

171744
sudoers	visudo
the visudo command is the recommended way to edit etc sudoers .

171745
sudo	passwd
if you want to run as root all the time not a great idea you can set a passwd for the root user sudo passwd and then login or su to root

171766
folder	directory
launcher favorites need to be in either the usr share applications directory or the .local share applications folder and not a subdirectory as my wine .desktop files are

171767
cifs	smb	vim	gedit
granted i don t have to elevate often but on the off-chance i do like adding or changing smb cifs mountpoints in fstab i would like to use gedit not notepad from wine and not in a terminal window with vi well vim

for each linux kernel version they maintain ubuntu kernel developers maintain a set of patches until those patches are incorporated upstream

171860
ubuntu	linux
is there any similar software that works on ubuntu linux

171888
ubuntu	linux
linux contrarely to windows isn t a resource hog so it s perfectly normal that ubuntu would run great on that desktop pc

171890
udp	tcp
will display all tcp udp and local unix-domain sockets their status the addresses of the endpoints and the process that owns the socket

171913
ati	nvidia
if you have an nvidia or amd ati graphics card you might have to install the proprietary drivers first to get good 3d support

171917
ubuntu	mint
not much help i know but i had so many issues with ati and ubuntu and mint for that matter

171920
installation	upgrade
i had a similar problem a while ago with an ubuntu 9.04 jaunty 64-bit install it was a fresh installation no upgrade no beta nothing special at all

171940
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
4 ensure that your user can run sudo pm-suspend without using a passwd via the sudoers file

171944

note if you are switching from another oem s hardware nvidia for instance you must uninstall the driver for that hardware before installing the amd ati driver

171956

while allowing the usage of sudo for my user works i can t disable the passwd prompt for a certain command

171956

172002
mouse	keyboard
note these lines only appear for v046dpc52 that seems to be the mouse + keyboard that are actually working fine i have no line containing v046dp0a01 headset or v046dp08f5 webcam

172004
folder	dir
you can technically use and it will create a maildir format mailbox labeled put_my_mail_here which will be the name of the folder in the home dir where the maildir data is stored

172024
virtualbox	parallels
just posting this question to ask this which is better dual booting a macbook mid 2007 2 1 model with ubuntu latest supported release 12.04 or is it just as good using a virtual machine such as virtualbox or parallels

172045
ubuntu	linux
the syslinux software is supposed to find its configuration file in the same place and it should direct it to the ubuntu linux kernel on the pen drive perhaps putting up a menu first

172045
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
with the loading of the ubuntu kernel the ubuntu linux gnu debian operating system should start

172047
ubuntu	linux
i m relatively new to linux and ubuntu and i can t say that this is the best way to solve the problem but it worked for me

172073
bluetooth	usb
on the web i see tons of guides on how to connect with bluetooth but my computer doesn t have a bluetooth dongle so i just want to connect via usb

172076
sudo	passwd
edit etc passwd file with sudo vipw -s and equalizes the user permissions with the root fist on the list

172077
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu 11.10 now and i realized that the most except one vulnerabilities does not exist in linux because of multi-user system

172088
sudo	passwd
the exception is when you run a command with sudo or have to enter a passwd to install a package or do other maintenance

172088

reading this link it describes how to make a raid array out of usb sticks however it describes the process using gentoo now i don t know about gentoo and have never used it but i m supposing this is possible in ubuntu if so how

172750
ubuntu	linux
now that i want to install ubuntu i want to add 2 extra partitions for linux and linux swap

172767
google-chrome	firefox
i am counting on using a live-usb with firefox or google-chrome browser both the live system and the browser used only and strictly for this delicate purpose thus creating an independent system to take precautions against any potential malware that may have infiltrated my regular everyday system and browser and i ll also be using a secure connection

172768
lvm	mdadm
as mentioned mdadm is well documented as doesn t care whether the devices are hard disks usb drives or even lvm partitions

172773
ubuntu	linux
even more in ubuntu or any other linux distro since not only are the standards applied but they even get updated faster and with any new security measures

172786
ubuntu	debian
here is the debian link i m sure ubuntu repository must also be having this

172796
ubuntu	linux
it is possible to run some of the big fish games but it must be done via wine can be found in the ubuntu software center - wine-64bit or codeweavers crossover linux

172874
xfce	gnome
if you just opened up xubuntu and ubuntu on two identical computers and had them sit there doing nothing you would see that xubuntu s xfce interface was taking up less ram than ubuntu s gnome or unity interface

172874
xfce	gnome
even though underneath writer xubuntu s xfce interface is using less resources than ubuntu s gnome or unity the question you re coming down to is this is xfce using less resource to a degree that would make a difference in how fast libreoffice writer runs

172879
kde	gnome
another environment such as gnome or kde

172905
ubuntu	linux
what do you all think about the 11 to 14 mbs of data during updating the repository index files with sudo apt-get updates of the installed ubuntu or other linux os to just get a piece of software for the system

172905

whatever you all guys think it is very bad thing about ubuntu and other linux os s

172905
ubuntu	linux
so i think it will better for ubuntu and other linux os s to improve it as soon as possible

172931
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu is based on latest stable linux version released more correctly it is based on the kernel of debian more correctly from debian unstable release except the lts s which are derived from debian testing and then add some more distro specific customization

172949
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu is based on debian a very famous and stable linux os but redhat has nothing like this

172949
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	linux	debian	mint
ubuntu package manager file extension is .deb which uses other debian based os linux mint whether redhat package manager file extension is .rpm which means redhat package manager

172952
ubuntu	debian
main difference is ubuntu is based on debian system

172953
hash	md5
the md5 hash must be signed or come from a secure source an https page of an organization you trust

172953
hash	md5
while security flaws in the md5 algorithm have been uncovered md5 hash are still useful when you trust the organization that produces them

172957
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
ubuntu is a linux distribution that starts with the breadth of debian and adds

172974
ssl	https
ssl certificates used for https communication have an expiration date

172978
disk	ram
if you have a 1gb or less ram in your system i would recommend while partitioning your disk to create 512mb-1gb partition defined as a swap which works like pagefile in windows

172982
stdout	stderr
redirection is used to redirect the stdout stdin stderr

172993
ubuntu	linux
my problem is that when i boot up i get the choices for windows and ubuntu in my custom boot-loader and if i choose ubuntu i then get grub with a working linux entry and a bunch of other entries that don t really make sense

173004
button	checkbox
go to chrome settings then open the advanced settings section where there should be a desktop integration section with a checked checkbox allow integration and a button

173022
vmware	virtualbox
i haven t used virtualbox regularly in a while but i can definitely recommend vmware free for your needs

173023
versioning	upgrade
i don t even know how to check my own versioning there s no mention of gnome in system information - i reasoned maybe i m using an outdated versioning even though apt-get update upgrade dist-upgrade does not upgrade anything or solves the problem

173026
hash	md5
md5sum and sha256sum are programs which implement the md5 and sha-256 hash algorithms respectively

173026
hash	md5
the primary difference between the older md5 and the newer sha-256 hash is that md5 produces a 128-bit output while sha-256 produces a 256-bit output

173026
hash	md5
for verifying data isos to work the hash of the data must effectively be unique so that no other data produces the same md5 sum or sha-256 sum

173026
hash	md5
the chance of such collisions is lower with sha-256 compared to md5 because its 256-bit hash is double the size of md5 s 128-bit hash

173036
installation	upgrade
if you want to upgrade to 5.5.27 you have two options neither of which will probably successfully upgrade your existing installation may break future official ubuntu mysql updates and may or may not work

173044
mouse	keyboard
if left unattended it appropriately goes to sleep and i can awaken it with a mouse gesture or keyboard press

173070
folder	directory
you should copy this into a file named move-at-start.sh mark it executable and put it somewhere in your home directory i would suggest putting it in the .local folder but you can put it in your bin or some other place if you prefer just remember where you put it and what you named it

173094
disk	ram
they get written to a ram disk

173127
kubuntu	gnome
you may install quickly on kubuntu just as you would any other software package sudo apt-get install quickly you may be required to pull in a lot of gnome packages though so it might take a while to install

173150
kde	kubuntu
if you are using kubuntu kde live cd press alt + f2 and enter this command

173165

173173
google-chrome	firefox
however i do know that most versions of google-chrome chromium will do some stuff to avoid this problem and i believe so does more recent versions of firefox

173182
filesystems	ntfs
it should be a ntfs filesystems

173185
ubuntu	linux
it isn t ubuntu or linux really but it gives you a unix-like shell under windows

173191
ubuntu	linux
i have been using windows since win 3.11 and have only been on linux ubuntu for about three hours

173224
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i was able to correct this exact same issue in linux mint 13 based on ubuntu 12.04 by doing the following

173240
processors	hyperthreading
if whatever operating system is bringing the program into memory and then letting the processors or processors do their best your hardware will mostly determine the speed assuming all of the operating systems handle the multiple processors hyperthreading and so on

173240
ubuntu	debian
it may make a difference how matlab is compiled between ubuntu debian and windows however

173240
ubuntu	linux
when you get into doing reads and writes to disk you shouldn t necessarily expect a benchmark to work the same on windows bsd or linux but should probably expect the linux numbers to be about the same including ubuntu and xubuntu but the kernel s will be configured differently and that may make a difference

173253
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse hard disk drive optical disc drive and other

173259
ubuntu	linux
by far the biggest difference between ubuntu and rhel is the license terms - red hat enterprise linux is commercial

173259
redhat	fedora
distributions which are based on or inherit from redhat which would also include centos and fedora and their derivatives

173259
ubuntu	centos
it s actually very hard to compare ubuntu against all those rhel centos and fedora as if they are one thing because they are all very different in themselves

173259
dpkg	apt	ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian s package manager apt and dpkg

173259
redhat	fedora
redhat centos and fedora are based on the redhat package management system rpm

173271
rss	feed
is there an rss feed that alerts subscribers of new updated packages in the official repositories

173285
disk	ram
in the 2nd stage the os-loader grub loads ubuntu by loading kernel and initial ram disk into the memory and hand-over control to the kernel

173285
disk	ram
so we can clearly say boot-loader neither stored in rom nor in ram it is actually stored on hard disk or other boot device such as bootable cdrom usb drives etc precisely speaking the first sector of the hard disk which is of size 512 bytes and often referred as boot-sector

173294
disk	ram
in this case your computer will start to swap from ram to disk which will make your system crawl to a halt given you ve got a swap partition to begin with of course

173305
folder	directory
the ubuntu one client will only synchyronise folder located under your home directory

173307
filesystems	ntfs
the partition s filesystems is ntfs in case its important

173378
versioning	upgrade
i m using internet through mobile phone can i upgrade ubuntu the latest versioning by 2 or 3 parts

173381
ubuntu	debian
note that the version in the debian ubuntu repos is somewhat old 1.1.x and you may prefer a more current 1.3.x version which is available as a ppa

173393
ubuntu	centos
what is the difference between ubuntu server and centos

173393
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu server use different version of gcc and ld with centos

173400
put	get
this is why many systems will boot off a cd or dvd if you put an os installer disk in and from the hard-drive otherwise the bios the code on the rom including the code we re talking about and some other low-level stuff that get things started is set to look at the cd dvd drive first then at a hard-drive if it doesn t find anything tweakers often set it to ignore the cd dvd drive unless manually requested so it doesn t waste time spinning up a non-bootable disk that was left in the drive

173403
kde	kubuntu
after running an update on monday on a kubuntu 12.04 box i ve lost the option to select kde in the login screen there was a message that read approximately option kde has been removed

173403
kde	gnome
but that only brought back the kde login screen with additional gnome unity session options

173407
kde	kubuntu
kword is particularly well suited to run on top of the desktop environment kde and for this reasons is often used on kubuntu

173413
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it supports browser integration for all the browsers - firefox google-chrome opera etc

i have no idea what is the problem with the gui -wrapper but this should work in ubuntu it works in debian

173663
postfix	dovecot
along with the previously mentioned postfix there are also dovecot and exim4 which work well together and you will likely also want to install procmail and possibly spamassassin or some other spam filtering tool to help filter and manage your mail on the server

173689
ubuntu	linux
configure google web mail gmail in thunderbird mail client on ubuntu fedora linux

173707
ubuntu	linux

opening google-chrome and firefox is slow too and using it too

173796
folder	directory
extract the tar package then copy it to gedit plugins directory from the extracted folder

173835

it is a dpkg command because dpkg is actually responsible for installing packages apt just a frontend that runs dpkg

173836
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux and just got ubuntu 12.04 up and running on my asus laptop last night

173855

173930
sudo	passwd
simply put running sudo in crontab requires your passwd to be stored somewhere in plaintext

173930
sudo	passwd
now if you absolutely want to be unsafe and take risks with your passwd the following will run your command from your own crontab and enter your passwd automatically when prompted by sudo

173954
versioning	upgrade
after you finish installing them and want to keep them at those versioning while doing system upgrade you will need to use apt-pinning as suggested by belacqua

173954
versioning	upgrade
ensure that packages are not upgrade to versioning which may conflict

173970
google-chrome	firefox
both options are better than the regular site-specific-browsing ssb features of firefox prism and google-chrome because they allow full integration with ubuntu

174322
processors	hyperthreading
yes it works perfectly for me and i have multiple processors and hyperthreading which i forgot what that means but i m pretty sure it means something about that each processors can execute multiple threads which combined with the fact that each processors has 2 cores would seem to be a problem

174353
filesystems	ntfs
independent ubuntu installation in its defined filesystems ext4 performs much better then ntfs

174366
ubuntu	linux
so i installed yumi multiboot usb creator into my pendrive and added ubuntu 12.04 as one of the linux distributions and i boot my computer using this pendrive

you may be prompted for your passwd first that s how sudo works

174403
filesystems	ntfs
the underlying filesystems is in ntfs format

i use it to read my rss feed

174428
folder	directory
you find the actual path to your steam.exe somewhere in the .wine folder in your home directory

in any linux or unix including ubuntu filenames and folder names are case sensitive

174605
vmware	virtualbox
says it works with vmware and virtualbox

174605
vmware	virtualbox
vmware or virtualbox are most likely perfectly acceptable solutions however

174665
ubuntu	debian
the debian packaging system ubuntu uses requires the dependencies to be installed in the system

174696
ethernet	wireless
if i plug the ethernet cable in before or very quickly while booting it will boot normally it will detect my wireless connection here at home which happens to be a hidden connection i can then unplug the ethernet cable and use my computer normally

174700
octal	hex
you could also write a little script to give you one by one the filename of each of the files in a directory and then dump it in octal or hex

174710
ubuntu	linux
i have an instance of ubuntu 12.04 lts gnu linux 3.2.0-25-virtual i686 running as a kvm-vm on a host-machine that runs one more vm beside it

174739
folder	directory
the problem wasn t the whole directory but only the folder tools in

174763
switching	screens
if i remove etc lightdm lightm.conf altogether it puts me through to a low graphics mode screens where the keyboard doesn t work and there is nothing one can do but switching off the machine and reboot in recovery mode

174766
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
ps why not installing one ubuntu os and then install different desktops environments on it gnome already installed with ubuntu xfce--with the xubuntu-desktop package kde with the kubuntu-desktop package if you want to have kubuntu installed...

174818
ubuntu	linux
i m a newbie to ubuntu and linux in general but i did some trial and error modifying the various scripts found in initrd.img using update-initramfs

174819
ffmpeg	libav
that message means that ubuntu uses the libav derivative of ffmpeg

174819
ffmpeg	libav
picking libav as source package instead of ffmpeg

174831
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 12.04 is my first linux experience and i can not install vmware workstation

174832
mouse	keyboard
the mouse still works and if i switch to another tty the keyboard works fine

174863
folder	directory
in default home directory there is a folder called public

174895
folder	directory
after searching in different directory i found java directory in downloads folder

174917
installation	upgrade
i have used it before in my previous installation but since i upgrade to 12.04 no joy

174925
ubuntu	linux
unetbootin allows for the installation of various linux ubuntu distributions to a partition or usb drive so you don t need a cd

174947
folder	directory
then i copied the whole installation program into my home folder changed directory ran it again and still nothing happened

174948
kde	gnome
gnome shell unity kde plasma etc use those files to obtain application name

174949
filesystems	ntfs
apart from the link that fluteflute mentions the main difference for the end user is that chkdsk only checks the filesystems that are supported in windows fat32 and ntfs as the main ones

174949
xfs	ntfs
fsck checks fat32 ntfs via ntfs-3g ext2 ext3 ext4 reiser xfs and a whole bunch of other ones

174949
filesystems	btrfs
but the thing is that fsck actually uses another program to run the check depending on the filesystems that is going to be checked so for example if the filesystems is ext4 then it will use fsck.ext4 if the filesystems is btrfs then it will use fsck.btrfs

174949
filesystems	ntfs
the tools that look like chkdsk when the ntfs filesystems is involved are several of the ntfs-3g collections of tools that in some cases surpass what chkdsk and even scandisk can do for example

174991
jobs	cron
note down all the cron jobs for all users including root for example

174991
jobs	cron
place your jobs back into the cron preferably the root s cron either by creating a text file then pointing cron to that file or manually

175029
google-chrome	firefox
and every browser on my laptop is showing same problem including firefox google-chrome chromium

175067
ethernet	wireless
my laptop is connected to the internet by ethernet cable and in ubuntu i was able to setup a wireless network that my phone could connect to i think it was network settings wireless then there was s wireless hotspot button

175078
ubuntu	linux
i did the following drop an image in my ubuntu one folder on linux wait for it to sync refresh my ubuntu one files app on my android phone see the image file in the listing

175083
folder	directory
find the folder corresponding to the directory

175098
switching	screens
then switching to the login screens again using alt-ctrl-f7 enter your login password and while it tries to log you in switching back to the text console to see if you can spot any processes which cause the problem

175134
ubuntu	linux
the easy way was to boot into efi mode using the ubuntu installer say and use the efibootmgr program to add the linux efi boot loader probably grub 2 back to the nvram options

175142
ubuntu	debian
it worked fine under debian but i disliked the gui so i decided to give ubuntu a try

175149
chown	chgrp
how about chown or chgrp

175149
chown	chgrp
how about chown or chgrp

175152
interpolation	splines
laoe means layer-based audio editor and it is a rich featured graphical audiosample-editor based on multi-layers floating-point samples volume-masks variable selection-intensity and many plugins suitable to manipulate sound such as filtering retouching resampling graphical spectrogram editing by brushes and rectangles sample-curve editing by freehand-pen and splines and other interpolation curves effects like reverb echo compress expand pitch-shift time-stretch and much more

175160
ubuntu	linux
i think it is something with ubuntu or linux kernel

175176
sudo	passwd
i ve tried everything that ask ubuntu has to offer or at least after 5 hours of searching trying and failing creating a new account didn t allow me to do it usermod passwd anything involving sudo hell i can t even get into recovery mode with the left shift thing.

175208
puts	gets
unfortunately when i try to use a function like puts and gets in an incorrect manner that is to cause a buffer overflow gcc tells me that it detected smashing the stack and terminate my program

175218
tar	md5sum
...note that this is not technically tracking progress of the md5sum but rather tracking progress of tar untar then passing the file to md5sum after the fact

175221
folder	directory
i want to replace the folder in my home directory with symlinks to folder in another location but i want to retain the folder emblems without having to go searching for them

175221
folder	directory
to illustrate what i m asking the directory in the home folder have nice emblems that look like this

175222
folder	directory
warning also absolutely do not replace a folder that itself contains symlinks or it will follow the symlinks and recursively delete everything in the target directory

175232
kde	kubuntu
in your case firefox is gtk+ that opens quickly since ubuntu is also gtk+ based whereas skype is qt based which will perform better on a kde based desktop such as kubuntu and not ubuntu

175285
folder	directory
feel free to change the to the folder in which the directory structure is located

175293
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
ubuntu can safely read and write partitions made by windows using either the fat or the ntfs filesystems

175302
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos
in your case you are running amazon s ami linux which is based on centos not ubuntu

175302
ubuntu	debian
that s why apt-get or dpkg-reconfgure which are native to debian ubuntu are not available on your ec2 instance

175307
rss	feed
supports rss rdf atom feed using magpie and simplepie libraries

175307
opml	feed
supports feed aggregation keyboard shortcuts opml import export

175310
versioning	upgrade
assuming you use apt-get download to download the packages copy them to the isolated machine and install with or similar then yes apt-get will know that these packages versioning have been installed and will upgrade them if necessary

175325
ubuntu	linux
i created a amazon ec2 instance with ubuntu linux 64-bit 12.04 lts now when i ssh into it i get the following

175332
centos	linux	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	debian	centos	debian	linux
you are running ami linux which is not based on debian ubuntu but on centos which in turn is based on redhat

175366
google-chrome	firefox
personally where google-chrome isn t a great fit i tend to devolve back to firefox since it currently works on close to a single process model and will tend to be easier on resources as a result though more prone to sites crashing your session etc

175377
folder	directory
when you restart thunderbird go to tools - account settings and for each account including local folder click on server settings and verify that local directory is pointed to the correct location

175382
mouse	keyboard
keyboard layout rate mouse network ...

175392
filesystems	ntfs
windows doesn t know what this filesystems is so unless you specifically told ubuntu to format its partition using ntfs the windows filesystems windows will see it as empty

175397
versioning	upgrade
so if you upgrade the system technically there is no update to this versioning

175416
sudo	passwd
you need to prefix the command with sudo then enter your passwd

175422
centos	linux
this is particularly confusing for people who come from different linux distro eg centos rhel etc.

175423
ubuntu	debian
while it is a good idea to use sudo over logging as root many old applications that are not specifically made for just ubuntu debian are not made aware of there being a sudo functionality

175435
folder	directory
for the record you can also synchronize other folder in your home directory with ubuntu one rather than simply copying all the files you want synchronized into ubuntu one

175438
ubuntu	linux
i am nearly as much of a noob about linux ubuntu as one can be.

175463
ubuntu	linux
the brcmsmac sometimes called brcm80211 driver is indeed part of the linux kernel and included in ubuntu along with firmware so you should be set to go

175466
ubuntu	linux
i m new to ubuntu and linux and i just downloaded mupen64plus 1.99.5 and it came as a .tar.gz file

175472
stdout	stderr
when cron starts a process it captures any output that reaches stdout and stderr and sends that in an email

175472
stdout	stderr
to prevent these emails you can re-direct the stdout and stderr either to a logfile that you monitor or dev null if you don t care

175475
udp	tcp
it is fairly easy to set up even under windows and you can configure it to listen over udp for performance or over tcp for firewall friendliness

175488
hide	show
i know how to make it so its hide and show but i need that little arrow to change whenever i click on it..

175502
hide	show
it s drawing the arrows and taking care about to show and hide what s inside

175512
hide	show
there are two default actions to hide show the launcher in ubuntu

175529
debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
on debian-based distros debian ubuntu xubuntu â issue

175534
ubuntu	linux
assuming you are using a recent version of ubuntu with a recent version of ntfs-3g then options are programs frequently reading writing big chunks of data to the drive application frequently accessing the drive such as rsync the drive being connected via a slow usb connection possibly the usb port speed slowed down by a slow device hub being attached vmware using temp files on the ntfs drive or the drive being excessively fragmented lots of debate around this issue many people saying the drive shouldn t get too fragmented for linux unless you are also booting an installation of windows off of that drive

175542
bash	zsh
however there are other shells such as the korn ksh c shell csh and the z shell zsh but we will not go into them here as a discussion of sh and bash is most relevant to ubuntu

175542
ubuntu	debian
however debian based systems and ubuntu considers dash as their sh shell sh is actually symlinked to dash

175542
ubuntu	debian
in debian and ubuntu because of the speed of sh it is more often used for critical system procedures and for executing key scripts at startup

175546
notepad++	gedit
i have a csv file which contains english and chinese words in xp i could open it with notepad++ and it displayed both without problem but when i went to ubuntu 12.04 using gedit it showed chinese char as bunch of garbage what should i do to display correctly the chinese char in csv file

175547
gedit	nano
open etc environment in any text editor like nano or gedit and add the following line

175549

if it s possible how can i upgrade kde 4.9 in kubuntu 11.10

175642
ubuntu	debian
if you want to change start settings for a server in your ubuntu debian machine look in the directory etc defaults for a suitable file

175658
matplotlib	scipy
i have manually built numpy scipy matplotlib etc - without root privilages

175659
put	get
but since it will probably get overwritten on an update i want to know where else i can put it

175670
versioning	upgrade
previously i had versioning 3.2.0.24 and after upgrade i got 3.2.0.25

175672
kde	kubuntu
the kubuntu 11.10 will get bug fixes and security patches for the kde 4.7.4

175672
kde	kubuntu
kubuntu and the kde 4.9

175672
kde	kubuntu
the kde sc 4.9.0 is available for the kubuntu 12.10 under development and the kubuntu 12.04

175675
folder	directory
it is possible to quickly find files not owned by your user in your home folder and also at what time any files were accessed by using the find command use -type f for files and -type d for directory

175675
folder	directory
for the following examples i assume that you are running from the top level of your home folder just enter cd to get to it and that you do not want to search the files in the root directory

175677
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i was stuck with the same problem in ubuntu precise x64 linux mint maya actually

175680
folder	directory
if one would want to add an additional command for example to browse to a another folder simply add the change directory command cd folder1 folder2

175688
kde	gnome
that is a layer to provide a network and basic graphical interface that unity gnome kde and the like can build upon

175688
vim	emacs
vi vim nano and emacs are the most common and at least one of them will be installed and operational

175697
ubuntu	debian
i ve done this with lots of minimal vpss running ubuntu debian

175700
xfce	cinnamon
you only need to comment out xfce command and add the command to start cinnamon i didn t give it because i don t know how to start it manually

175728
ubuntu	debian
but as izx points out in the comment that the unstable repo of debian is very much stable and that packages for all the non-lts versions of ubuntu are taken from it and that you can trust this repo

175752
pulseaudio	mixer
i had this issue today and entering pulseaudio -k in the terminal did not fix it completely as i also needed to end whatever audio mixer was associated with my desktop environment

175758
kde	gnome
it should also be available in the unity gnome kde menu it has a desktop icon so you could always use that too

175761
sudoers	visudo
i finally modified the sudoers file visudo only granting fkchu access to sudo root didn t even have this access

175764
ubuntu	freebsd
i found this for freebsd how can i configure it for ubuntu

175799
chown	chmod
i recently made changes to usr sbin and var chown root root and then did chmod 775 for each

175804
ubuntu	linux
anyway don t worry about it ubuntu and any other linux distro can effectively just tell the bios that it is in fact windows and get the correct query from it

175807
jobs	cron
ubuntu - cron jobs for root and other users

go into the terminal short cut is ctrl + alt + t or look for it in the dash

175963
filesystems	ntfs
windows cannot hardly recognize other filesystems than ntfs and fat32

175963
filesystems	ntfs
so if your ubuntu partition is not ntfs nor fat32 the installer proposes ext4 by default i think windows will not likely recognize your partition since it does not know its filesystems

175970

from what i have seen it is usually an ms fat filesystems of some kind

175989

of course the ssd takes a performance hit with the marvell sata controller 540 gb s vs 400 gb s read speed so i just switched the ssd to the rocketraid and it boots just fine

what should i do to upgrade my graphics driver so that it starts supporting latest opengl versioning like 4.0 to 4.3

176125

may be helpful but is there really no way to do it with the ubuntu linux build-in tools

although those key combinations work when the keyboard is working ubuntu according to the forums since 10.04 randomly freezes including the keyboard and mouse

made sure git was the group for the repositories sudo chgrp -r git repositories

176187

since this is a 64bit laptop it s capable of running both 64bit operating systems x86_64 as well as 32bit operating systems x86

176204
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade internally therefore keeping all of my files instead of installing a new versioning of ubuntu entirely

176208
installation	upgrade
during the installation you can either upgrade or do a fresh install

176215
debian	centos
for what it s worth every other distro i ve tried debian centos arch also have high-res splashscreens

176239
ubuntu	linux
the lenovo ideapad s10-3t keep in mind that this is a convertible netbook tablet as opposed to a pure tablet was featured in this episode of the linux action show and apparently works very well with 12.04 numerous threads on the ubuntu forums indicate that this model is not at all well-supported by earlier versions

176268
folder	directory
i have an ecryptfs private folder in my home directory and it is set up to automatically mount whenever i log in

176293
profiling	debugging
profiling is rarely done on debugging builds

176333
ubuntu	linux
isn t a ubuntu issue is a linux issue i have tested it in several distros and it happens in them all

176339
sudo	passwd
this tests sudo in the same way though the authentication will definitely be in the terminal window--you won t get a graphical dialog box asking for your passwd

176339
sudoers	visudo
run pkexec visudo to edit etc sudoers sudo s main configuration file

176339
versioning	upgrade
if you re running ubuntu 12.04 and later and you did not upgrade from a versioning of ubuntu earlier than 12.04 don t worry about the admin line it might not even be present at all

176339
sudo	passwd
so if graphical authentication is working for both policykit and sudo -based methods and console authentication is failing there may be a problem with the way passwd are being entered into the terminal

176357
switching	screens
i managed to bring up the screens settings panel and switching away then back to the current resolution fixed things

176366
rsa	dsa
generate key can use dsa instead of rsa if required

176388
ati	nvidia
i read some other posts with similar problems and it s not from any nvidia driver nor ati i have the default vga driver

176393
hash	md5
all ubuntu isos should contain a md5sum.txt file which contains md5 hash of all files on the disk

176393
hash	md5
note the hash for the whole iso at the download page is for checking the download and detect man in the middle attacks the md5 hash on the iso are for verifying the content once it s burned or transfered another way to a medium

176397
ubuntu	linux
i m new with all this ubuntu and linux programs so please bear with me

176397
ubuntu	linux
so the problem is once i select ubuntu with linux 3.0.0-15-generic from the gnu grub ver 1.99-12ubuntu5 loads up the initramfs prompt

176401
hide	show
the only interesting thing that you can do is use the f3 to open another side file and f9 to hide show file tree

176411
installation	upgrade
i would like to prefer you fresh installation of 12.04 for avoiding any upgrade error and bandwidth wastage

176417
kde	gnome
i finally decided nothing worked better than unity for me and started attempting to uninstall kde and gnome shell

176417
xfce	cinnamon
i do still have xfce and cinnamon installed if i need to uninstall reinstall unity

176428
versioning	upgrade
i suggest that you should install two versioning of perl side by side because the default 5.10 is a critical part of the system itself packages are depend on it a big upgrade to it is not a good idea

176495
ubuntu	linux
if you re new to linux the best way to begin is having a dual boot ubuntu and windows xp

176517
xfce	kde
the difference between the different desktop environments unity kde xfce lxde concerning the amount of resources used is very important more important than that involved by an application or other

176517
xfce	kde
for example with just 1 gb of ram unity and kde are not good options almost beyond reach while xfce works decently and lxde flies

176550
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
as the subject says can i change the filesystems of a usb or say any drive from it s current partition like - ext4 to a different partition like - ext2 fat ext3 ntfs filesystems without loosing the data in the drive and without taking backup

176557
filesystems	ntfs
so it seems it is not back-convert-compatible and converting from ext4 to ntfs will require formatting since they are totally different filesystems also holds true for ext4 to fatxx format .that means without data loss

176558
filesystems	ntfs
for example a fat16 or fat32 filesystems on windows can be converted to ntfs via the windows convert command

176564
mouse	keyboard
the default window shows mouse and keyboard status like

176603

176607
google-chrome	firefox
3 install the firefox google-chrome oracle java 7 plugin

176629
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
as the name plugin suggests it s not something you should update inside your browser but outside the browser meaning that the plugin is shared amongst all the browsers let s say google-chrome firefox opera etc. and could not be updated via the browser itself

176641
screens	tablet
for example if you want to use the tablet stylus with a 2nd monitor hooked in you will need to run maptooutput to reassign the cursor to the tablet screens only

176689
disk	ram
if you are referring to ram usage it is because system monitor does not include buffers and caching just actual ram used to run applications top is slightly confusing because it does not obviously show disk usage after buffers caching

176689
disk	ram
see the image below and note that the second line of free -m indicates available ram whilst the first line indicates actual ram usage including disk caching

176703

recently i discovered git and bazaar while working on a coding project

176747
stdout	stderr
an issue problem or malfunction that may appear in stderr stdout a dialog or a log

176752
bazaar	git
git and bazaar let you restore to any version you pushed to the repository and lets you selectively exclude files and only add files to the vcs that you need

176752
bazaar	git
bazaar and git store diffs of all changes so every time you push a new change the repository software needs to calculate and store a diff which takes space and cpu power

176762
ubuntu	linux
though i do not know much about linux i made a boot disk for ubuntu 11.10 and i was on windows using something called linux live usb creator lili for short get lili here for free

176764

the versioning included in 12.04 is an older versioning that does support your card but you won t be able to upgrade to 12.10 when it comes around

176802

i m not planning on leaving ubuntu studio 12.04 any time soon but there are just some programs that i can t run in linux nor is there software like them

as there is a proprietary implementation of fransferring of audio via a rdp connection on windows audio output virtual channel extension but this feature is not available from x11rdp server or vnc as a sidenote where only basic remote protocols such as screen keyboard or mouse are present

install a database my personal preference is postgresql but mysql is probably easier to get started with as it doesn t have the same level of security settings involved i would strongly advice though that you transition to postgresql at a time when it feels convenient it s more standards compliant and therefore your work and experience will generally be more broadly applicable and the documentation is far better.

conveniently ubuntu also writes the correct current system info in a separate set of matching files which mint doesn t touch so you just have to copy them over

a more polished fix would be to use the linuxmint overwrite system explained in the file etc linuxmint adjustments readme to manage the corrections - but i imagine that either of these solutions will be borked once the relevant files are updated or you update ubuntu base

178375

the best solution would be to convince the mintsystem package maintainers that mint is a victim of its own success - now that many people are installing mate even on ubuntu it shouldn t be calling mintsystem scripts which assume a linuxmint base install

what he doesn t point out is that this is because you probably have multiple versions of th boot folder unless you have this as a separate partition and hence ubuntu updates its copy of boot grub grub.cfg and then debian uses a different one which has not been updated

virtualbox allows only 128mb of video memory allocation while i believe vmware allows whatever

vmware	virtualbox
i can t for sure verify if vmware and thus most likely virtualbox can share from host linux virtual xp ntfs partition but as a guesstimate it should work as long as the partition is mounted

179838
versioning	upgrade
using the update manager is more convenient than using apt-get dist-upgrade because using this command to upgrade to a new versioning of your distribution requires the modification of configuration files

179842
dpkg	apt
strictly update manager software centre and the apt suite apt-get and apt-cache are all front-ends to dpkg so anything that can be done with one can done with the others but it is usually much easier to use the gui tools which will also handle editing the config files automaically

to be more specific if you have set up a web server in your virtual machine and let s say the virtual machine s internal ip address is 192.168.1.3 then just fire google-chrome or firefox or anything for that sake and type in the address field the ip address

i use it with 1gb ram and the difference is huge compared to using unity or kde and very significant compared to using xfce xubuntu

the latter option would obviously take longer and be more of a hassle though there are certainly positive things to be said about fresh installation as opposed to upgrade installation in most cases

181017
xfce	kde
anyway install other de like xfce and kde and see if there are differences

181077
versioning	upgrade
it looks like this versioning of the package doesn t handle upgrade properly

181106
put	get
so if i understand you correctly you want files pictures that are put into a specific folder to automatically get assigned to a specific group photography

181106
folder	directory
since this does not effect files and folder that are already created inside this directory first change their group recursively using

181106

if files and folder are moved into that directory instead of copied

181155
versioning	upgrade
i wanted to upgrade a very old versioning of ubuntu to a recent one so i made the following steps

181157
disk	ram
the whole kernel-eeepc thing is just 4mb which makes it faster to load from disk and it uses less ram when loaded leaving more memory for user-space programs

181181
min	max
i prefer to use the title bar action buttons min max close on right side

181182
bluetooth	usb
note in my experience the other things a -virtual kernel may suffer from and which may need manual loading include no support for unity 3d opengl emulation no bluetooth and no enhanced usb hid support

181221
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu in general case can t run windows executables just as windows can t run linux or macos executables

181304
kde	kubuntu	xfce	kde	xfce	kubuntu
what counts most here is not the version precise 12.04 instead of oneiric 11.10 but the desktop environment that comes on top of the ubuntu os xfce xubuntu vs unity vs kde kubuntu

181304
google-chrome	firefox
i myself have a 1gb ram computer and had to migrate from windows to ubuntu because decisive software like the latest versions of firefox and google-chrome would not run as good as before due to the new standards and demands of the internet environment

181304
kde	kubuntu
so i understood that unity and also kde kubuntu is for users that come to ubuntu for other reasons than for trying to put to work older computers

181304
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
to really understand how the computer copes with the different desktop environments one can install all the other desktop environments unity gnome kde xfce and lxde to have the specific dependencies use lubuntu-desktop instead of lxde and so forth although in order to avoid risks of conflicts with the main installation a usb-live testing is the best

181331
sudoers	visudo
use command visudo to open sudoers file and remove the user you want

181353
ubuntu	debian
preface i ve made a boot-image that boots up debian ubuntu using squashfs and aufs

181353
ubuntu	debian
all setup of the rootfs is done from initramfs which calls switch_root to boot-up debian ubuntu

181353
ubuntu	debian
next to that i figure that the debian ubuntu shutdown procedure must be modified to allow this

181353
ubuntu	debian
didn t change a thing when debian ubuntu shuts down though

181356
cinnamon	gnome
i am using ubuntu 12.04 with many desktop environments like unity gnome lubuntu xubuntu cinnamon and many

181382
ati	nvidia
its arguable that phoronix has done the closest to this looking at the performance comparison between gnome-shell mutter unity compiz using both nvidia and ati graphics

181382
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
they have also looked at battery usage between gnome kde lxde and xfce

181382
cinnamon	gnome
since cinnamon s muffin is a fork of mutter - you should perhaps assume the performance and resource usage will be similar or the same you could argue there is a direct read-across for the gnome results to cinnamon

181382
ati	nvidia
results varied depending on the actual graphics card - when using nvidia drivers these were equally resource hungry whereas gnome-shell using ati was more resource hungry than unity

181410
kde	cinnamon
i finally installed cinnamon and found it less heavier than expected for a lubuntu user lighter than unity and even kde maybe somewhere between this and xubuntu

181420
switching	screens
switching into a console from the lightdm login screens ctrl-alt-f1 logging in with administrative username and password and entering the following commands resolved the issue

181422
vpn	lan
it is also more powerful as with the vpn your laptop will behave as if it was connected in your lan use internal resources easily as shared directories internal webpages printers central authentication possibly etc... and not only share its desktop as with teamviewer

181435

the only reason debian and by extension ubuntu includes it is as a forgotten remnant of the bad old days when it used to be necessary

a hyperthreading cpu can only execute one set of instructions at a time but any given program tends to spend a lot of time waiting for data to be fetched from memory or other bits of hardware to do something the cpu has multiple queues of instructions which can be switched between whenever one becomes idle

in fact you can have the same source package for debian and ubuntu

the only thing that makes debian and ubuntu packages different is compiling them against different library versionsm and that s no more than the difference between different releases of ubuntu

wine applications will usually work pretty well in linux once you get them setup maybe with something like crossover or playonlinux but you will always have a better experience with native applications and you will be able to put some of the money you would spend on the more expensive windows applications to make the open linux version better to your specific needs by paying a developer or the creators of the application themselves and improving the community that uses them in the process

186616
ubuntu	linux
if you are running a computer newer than the ubuntu version you have installed and in particular its linux kernel it s completely possible that the kernel won t recognize your graphics adapter

186616
versioning	upgrade
for a personal computer you may also be able to use an upgrade kernel if a compatible one is available for your versioning of ubuntu

186616
versioning	upgrade
for a production computer it may be necessary to upgrade ubuntu to a newer versioning when available for the sake of reliability and robustness

186624
ubuntu	debian
you could consider using puppet preseeding the debian ubuntu installer for automated deploying or to start writing in a more powerful language like python that features apt bindings python-apt

186665
ati	nvidia
driver installation is for less than 1 of hardware proprietary stuff like nvidia ati broadcom but for each new version of ubuntu you will see an increased amount of new hardware supported

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
with this option enabled timestamp comparison will be more lenient and look over the minuscule time differences between ntfs fat and unix filesystems

187036
ubuntu	debian
the current version is still 2.3 2004 and ubuntu like debian is based on that

187050
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu will most probably inherit the debian fhs standard as mentioned in the ubuntu-policy also locally available under var share doc ubuntu-policy fhs provided you install ubuntu-policy package to see the implemented file system in ubuntu

187064
kde	gnome
but i m not aware of anything natively built into the default desktop environment that includes unity gnome or kde

187067
nautilus	fstab
i just deleted entries made by pysdm in fstab as i didn t want ntfs partition to automount i just wanted to be able to mount it by clicking in nautilus

187088
ubuntu	linux
i did this hoping that app-get would fulfil dependencies and replace corrupted files and watched it systematically remove every component of linux both the stuff i had installed and the core ubuntu packages

i have the logitech darkfeild mouse the one that works on glass and was wondering how i can remap one of my currently unused buttons my zoom button to function as a selected keyboard button control or supper

187215
versioning	upgrade
at this point apt will always install the newest one and boom your system will not upgrade any packages because the ubuntu repo software is still in need of the older library versioning which is not going to be installed

187235
filesystems	hfs+
osx by default uses journaled hfs+ as it s filesystems

187237
xfce	gnome
i also have gnome and xfce installed along side

187328
versioning	upgrade
on the negative site you have to uncheck thunderbird for upgrade every time you update your system locking the versioning in synaptics does not suppress the update bug i guess

187356

187418
installation	upgrade
one upgrade from 11.04 and the other with a clean 12.04 installation

187438
versioning	upgrade
to see which versioning will be installed with the repositories in question added you can run apt-cache policy x to follow your example and it will show you the installed versioning and the candidate which is the versioning which would be installed if you install or upgrade

187450
versioning	upgrade
please note that apt also look at the priority of a repository if a higher priority of a repository has lower versioning apt won t upgrade the package

187493
vmware	virtualbox
before going into detail about virtualbox vmware or any other virtualization technology there are a couple of things that need to be checked

187493

virtualbox vmware parallels since you mention a mac kvm qemu etc.

187559
folder	directory
what i want to do is this when i create a new user in ubuntu i want him to have a copy of a folder let s call him abc in his own home directory

187578
ubuntu	linux
i wouldn t resize partitions and install another ubuntu just for testing although you can do that too - you can have as many instances of ubuntu or different linux distros installed each in its own partition as you like

187588
spotify	grooveshark
it does provide support for multiple internet radios like grooveshark lastfm spotify etc

187612
ubuntu	linux
either way is this likely just an eclipse issue or something i can fix in ubuntu linux

187631

now if i upgrade from windows 7 to windows 8 will the current ubuntu installation get deleted

187638

187728
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind memcheck prints to stderr

187729
stdout	stderr
unfortunately there s some trickery regarding redirecting stderr and stdout

187730
stdout	stderr
use tee for this but you need to play some tricks with the stdout stderr

187730
stdout	stderr
explanation sends stderr to stdout and the regular stdout gets send to file output

187739
ubuntu	mint
i installed ubuntu 12.04.1 lts few days ago i was using mint 10 earlier and i have identical problem

187873
kde	kubuntu
from the tags i assume you re running kubuntu kde 12.04 changing layouts pretty straightforward

187876
cpu	processors
most important performance enhancement is using a cpu with aes-ni capabilities provided by most of the recent core i5 i7 processors and a kernel supporting it most recent versions do

187891
folder	directory
however it does not remove configuration or data files residing in users home directory usually in hidden folder there

187891
bash	zsh
if as is normally the case it finds nothing it returns the glob pattern unaltered supposing bash with default behavior here --- zsh will error out

187902
filesystems	ntfs
windows and ubuntu need to be on separate partitions and they have different filesystems ubuntu uses ext4 while windows uses ntfs ubuntu can read both but windows can only read ntfs

187925
ethernet	wireless
reboot making sure ethernet is plugged in and wireless if any is off

187944

187979
apache	nginx
i am curios to know how can we assign different port to apache and nginx in 10.10

187979
apache	nginx
i installed nginx first then apache so when i start my machine nginx is taking default port 80

187979
apache	nginx
i have to manually close nginx server and start apache server

188000
ubuntu	linux
yes this is normal to ubuntu and every linux distributions

188032
switching	screens
whenever i press alt + tab unity moves the window i m switching to so that the whole window is inside the screens

188032
switching	screens
every time i alt + tab back to the text editor i m getting an unnecessary virtual screens switching and unity is rearranging the windows behind my back

188032
switching	screens
i don t want to have any virtual screens switching when alt + tab especially since alt + tab does not list windows that is completely not in the current virtual screens anyway

188035
versioning	upgrade
i know that you re not meant to upgrade the distro versioning without being prepared for a non-booting system etc but i d still like to know if it s possible to do with landscape and how

188069
folder	directory
for example to see the files and all files within folder in your home directory use

188091

synergy is a program that allows multiple computers and different operating systems to share a mouse and keyboard over the network

189235

like if i add a song on my itunes library on my mac os partition then the ubuntu player i m searching for which will also has the same directory as a library folder will automatically have the song that has been added in the player .

189240
filesystems	btrfs
i ve installed ubuntu 12.04 on a partition with btrfs as its filesystems but it appears that grub2 seems to have some issues with that filesystems

189250
folder	directory
open .popper folder located in your home directory

189253
vmware	virtualbox
one option is using a virtual machine vm you can use oracle s virtualbox or vmware s vmware to create one then you can install back xp in the vm hopefully you still have your licence finally you can install powersim studio 5 on xp as usual

189264
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
on the sony vaio vpcf136fm the following command works to add edge scrolling on the alps touchpad in ubuntu 12.04 and linux mint 11 as an aside if anyone cares

google-chrome	firefox
i m using ubuntu 12.04.1 google-chrome 21 and firefox 15

189297
youtube	vimeo
the problem is that it doesn t matter if it s youtube or vimeo or some other flash player it streams fine on chrome but every 30 seconds or so there is a pause in video playback with audio continuing before it catches up skipping quite a few seconds of video

189297
google-chrome	firefox
it s more a problem of convenience because i don t like the idea of having to switch between google-chrome and firefox just to watch videos

189322
min	max
if you re using an nvidia gpu you could try out nvidiabl or even patch the source in nvidiabl-laptops.h to override default min max values to fit your needs

189335
folder	dir
just create a normal user and set it s home dir to the desired folder

189341
google-chrome	firefox
you can install some firefox or google-chrome plugin for doing that such as video download helper

189361
ubuntu	linux
on an ubuntu 64-bit linux machine to work around this issue install the package ia32-libs

i have found the following answers about html5 and vkontakte in russian from 2010 -- and -- saying that vkontakte encodes the video with h.264 and because of this html5 playback will work only in google-chrome and safari important for ios but not in firefox and opera which don t support h.264

189433
h.264	webm
in january 2011 google announced that they were pulling support for h.264 from their chrome browser and supporting both theora and webm vp8 to use only open formats. 16 however as of september 2012 google has not followed through with this announcement and still supports h.264 in their chrome browser through ffmpeg

189447
debian	linux
like just about every other linux distribution such as red hat debian etc it will look for any other operating system like windows and create a dual boot configuration for all of them

189520
screens	tablet
2 run a second x-server with vnc backend on your computer use xdmx to combine that into one desktop with your computer screens then look at the virtual part with a vnc viewer on the tablet - didn t work for me because xdmx requires all x-servers to have the same color visuals which is not the case for the vncserver and the real display and i wasn t able to convince vncserver to change

189555
opera	firefox

versioning	upgrade
the solution is to either downgrade the bash to the 4.1 versioning or upgrade it to 4.2.29 where this bug has been ironed out

189677
switching	screens
first of all i m aware a similar question for gnome is asked here switching off laptop backlight when locking screens

189677
kde	kubuntu
locking the screen on kubuntu kde inevitably triggers the screensaver as far as i can see

189677
kde	kubuntu
i m using kubuntu 12.04 and willing to upgrade to kde 4.9 or waiting for the 12.10 release

189687
ubuntu	debian
since now lubuntu ubuntu does not have xorg.conf file i generated it 1 and then modify it to look like the one from debian website 2

189706
ubuntu	linux
this is a late edit just to put things right for reference even without nomodeset and without the proprietary driver my machine would still work just that the startup luminosity level was zero and had to put it up manually . i do not currently use ubuntu linux on that machine was just interested for a solution in such cases.

cron jobs seem kind of good but i am not sure whether they would be started

189829
mtu	pppoe
for dsl connections using pppoe pppoa the mtu size is usually smaller than the 1500 bytes at the lan side

189829
post	get
capture the traffic using tcpdump or whireshark and get it analysed post it here for example

189832

at last there is avprobe from the libav-tools package by the libav project who forked ffmpeg

189871
stdout	stderr
simply using | or will only grab stdout and not stderr

189871
stdout	stderr
this will redirect stderr into stdout and then both should appear in less when you are trying to page through the output

189873
stdout	stderr
the errors which most of the programs print are sent to stderr standard error stream whereas the output of the program is sent to stdout standard output stream

189873
stdout	stderr
stderr has file descriptor 2 and the value for stdout is 1

189873
stdout	stderr
and to redirect both stdout and stderr you d either write

189873
stdout	stderr
you can interpret the second command as - send the output of command to file.txt and also merge stderr with stdout

189873
stdout	stderr
similarly for sending errors to less or more first merge stderr to stdout and then send it to the correspoding program

189876
mouse	keyboard
lxinput - program to configure keyboard and mouse settings for lxde

189891
stdout	stderr
however if i understand your question correctly you would like to have a visual separation for stderr and stdout of any programs you are running

189898
stdout	stderr
stderred hooks on write and a family of stream functions fwrite fprintf error... from libc in order to colorize all stderr output that goes to terminal thus making it distinguishable from stdout

189898
freebsd	linux
it s supported on linux with ld_preload freebsd also ld_preload and osx with dyld_insert_libraries

189907

i686 specifies that this software will not run on 486 and 386 cpus but only on pentiums successors and compatible like amd most probably because it was compiled to use cpu flags these older processors lack

opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i regularly do front end development html css js and need to test websites for ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox google-chrome safari opera in windows.i would like to move to ubuntu but am concerned that testing websites might get very difficult.do i have any options besides having windows as virtual machine

190127
google-chrome	firefox
to my knowledge google-chrome and firefox run natively on ubuntu which is what most users use

190127
google-chrome	firefox
firefox even comes preinstalled on ubuntu and you can easily install google-chrome by typing the following on a terminal

190128
google-chrome	firefox
so you can have firefox open a page like ie google-chrome or others

190136
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox	ubuntu	linux
firefox google-chrome or its foss counterpart chromium and opera have native ubuntu or more generaly linux versions

190147
ubuntu	debian
for example if you download the dropbox ubuntu debian file and install it you get dropbox.list in etc apt sources.list.d

190159
opera	firefox
you could do firefox and firefox though or opera and opera if that s your thing

190171
kde	gnome
and this kind of launcher are so cute that they are valid in gnome kde and probably all others

190176
ubuntu	linux
i just got hold of a linux machine running ubuntu from my friend

190197
ubuntu	centos
i tried several ubuntu server version 12.04 64bit 10.10 64bit 11.04 32bit and none has worked i even tried centos 6.3 and the same

190203
chown	chgrp
my best guess is that you needed to use chgrp but instead you used chown

190206
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the first test is to point a webbrowser firefox google-chrome opera ... to your local computer without trying to start xampp and to check if anything answers

190212
sudo	passwd
-s the -s stdin option causes sudo to read the passwd from the standard input instead of the terminal device

190212
sudo	passwd
in your case prompt is empty no message displayed for sudo when asking passwd and -s makes sudo accept root passwd vi stdin so passwd may be supplied using pipes and redirection from other commands instead of being typed

190213
sudo	passwd
as for the sudo -s -p part this will remove the message about asking the passwd in the terminal you still have enter your passwd though

190213
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for

190214
sudo	passwd
the -s switch causes sudo to read the passwd from stdin

190214
sudo	passwd
this allows for example a passwd to be piped to sudo through echo or cat

190217
ubuntu	linux
as far as i know linux including ubuntu should have swap space 2x of ram installed

190228
folder	directory
remove directory and their contents recursively folder inside them will be removed also

190234
children	parent
the two first lines in the script catch the process group id of the script and set a trap which runs on signals passed to the process - this trap executes a kill with a negative process id of the parent that runs all apache2 processes the script itself - killing with a negative pid means to kill all the children of such process aswell so in this case all apache2 processes without that i wasn t able to make supervisor kill the apache2 processes

190253
sudo	passwd
to run your installer with super-user rights you should type sudo bash installerfilename.sh in the terminal hit enter and then enter your passwd when it is asked for

190257
put	get
you have to put the uuid of the correct swap partition in there use to get the uuid

190261
ubuntu	linux
but of course you could try to fix it that windows will start ubuntu from win bootloader or linux grub will start win from grub

190291
rss	feed
i don t know if this will fit your exact needs but i use miro to stay up to date with all my podcasts and rss feed that i like to watch

190306
installation	upgrade
if you believe to be experienced enough you can boot from a live cd and chroot into your installation s root directory and run apt-get upgrade and apt-get upgrade

190311
sudo	passwd
i m noticing that sudo caches the passwd until i issue sudo -k to clear it

190320
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
once a user has been authenticated a time stamp is updated and the user may then use sudo without a passwd for a short period of time 5 minutes unless overridden in sudoers

190320
chown	sudo
on systems that allow non-root users to give away files via chown 2 if the time stamp directory is located in a directory writable by anyone tmp it is possible for a user to create the time stamp directory before sudo is run

190330
vmware	virtualbox
i had a look around and i found contradicting opinions on virtualbox versus vmware free

190337
ubuntu	linux
android is a custom linux built for phones and not necessarily interchangeable with ubuntu

190356
screens	tablet
edit the sync pc button may be somewhere else in a phone screens i have tried it only with a tablet

190374
stdout	stderr
actually you redirect all the stderr to stdout and then grep

190374
stdout	stderr
the reason why the grep works only in some of avconv s output is that this specific output is being given to stdout not to stderr and so it is successfully piped to grep

190374
stdout	stderr
normally stderr is used so as to output error messages and stdout so as to output normal informative messages

190374
stdout	stderr
it is not bad that both stderr and stdout exist because you can filter the output the way you want

190374
stdout	stderr
this will output all the normal output stdout to log.txt and all errors stderr to error_log.txt

190407
google-chrome	firefox
in win xp firefox google-chrome and ie crash very often due to some virus or something else

190425
google-chrome	firefox
i have looked at google-chrome and firefox extensions but if any standalone is available then please give me suggestion

190451
versioning	upgrade
i installed 9.04 from a disc but apparently need to download a new image then burn a cd to get n upgrade to later versioning v12 as there is no supported upgrade from 9.04

190482
versioning	upgrade
do the same for all thunderbird related packages and thunderbird will not get upgrade until you remove the versioning lock flag

190499
ubuntu	debian
and as already pointed out in the comments this was requested via bug reports in both ubuntu and debian circa 2008

190609

kde	gnome
the point is to have shellexecute call xdg-open and if not found look for gnome and kde defaults

196551
ubuntu	linux
ordinarily ubuntu mounts the esp at boot efi so this example would add the linux file boot efi efi ubuntu grub.efi as a boot loader

your boot info script output suggests you ve already got an elilo configuration set up so you could just try copying your ubuntu kernel and initrd file and editing elilo.conf probably in efi debian on your esp dev sda1 to boot ubuntu

203837

if your elilo isn t working though you might try refind which is capable of directly booting a linux 3.3.0 or later kernel which ubuntu 12.10 provides

you have to format your hd back to hfs+ first thats the filesystems os x needs to be installed on you can do this using the installation disk

203924

you need to have either a linux live cd like system rescue cd or ubuntu desktop cd to boot and reformat the hdd gparted is a good gui tool to hfs+ so as to install os x 10.6

navigate to file system - usr - lib usr lib and copy the folder firefox-5.0.1 into this directory

install the basic graphics drivers xorg stuff but not the amd ati or nvidia drivers which can cause problems if you boot on a system without the corresponding graphics card

ubuntu is not on oracle s list of officially-supported linux distributions and the installer is smart enough to figure that out

208152

you mention that it tries to detect the mouse and keyboard but eventually skips them

208211
mouse	keyboard
can you tell if it actually finds the mouse and keyboard sometimes there s a or on the line in question

208217
chown	sudo
when i ve browsed the questions already been answered i find for example chown -r viktor viktor var www or using sudo as well

208229

if you don t see a website on localhost 631 your cups daemons the printing systemd is not running at all

ubuntu	linux
create 3 equal partitions once for your windows install one for your data must be ntfs and then your linux ubuntu partition

208233
x86	64bit
i just installed ia32-libs on ubuntu 12.10 x86 as above for a jdk7u9 and netbeans ide 7.2.1 installation apparently there is no 64bit bundle

208234
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the crucial point altought the implementations are absolutely free i think they are released under a gpl3 is that microsoft doesn t want you to use filesystems apart from fat and ntfs

208264
cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
in our lab we just bought a new machine with two 8-cores intel r xeon r cpu e5-2660 0 2.20ghz processors which also support hyperthreading

208264
processors	hyperthreading
i would expect ubuntu to see 32 processing units however it only detects 8 of them the equivalent of just one processors with hyperthreading disabled

208265
ubuntu	linux
to run linux programs on windows where they appear as separate windows you ll want an older version of ubuntu before unity or a non-unity distro like xubuntu kubuntu or lubuntu and virtualbox

208274
mouse	keyboard
on a graphical desktop you would use mouse and keyboard input

208292

once you have usb-creator.exe run it and follow the same steps as described for linux point it at your .iso file or your ubuntu cd-rom point it at your usb flash drive make sure you have the right device selected then make startup disk

208307
ubuntu	linux
to do this you ll need to boot with an efi-mode linux emergency disc the ubuntu installer in try before installing mode should work but you ll need to do a sudo apt-get install efibootmgr to install the tool

208346
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade to ubuntu 12.10 from a previous nice versioning that always worked

208349
chown	sudo
sudo mount.posixovl directory on ntfs partition directory where i use chown

208365
filesystems	ntfs
the main difference between wubi and a normal installation is that it installs the linux filesystems to a file within your ntfs partition rather than making a separate partition

208365
filesystems	ntfs
the kernel loads normally and loads a ntfs driver from an initrd and then finds the wubi image and mounts it as the root filesystems see pivot_root for how it can mount a root filesystems while it is already running

209475
dpkg	apt
i ve been having the same issue it turns out that with newer versions of apt and dpkg they support a feature called multi-arch

209475
dpkg	apt
your issue specifically is that the wine1.5-i386 is in the 32 bit wine repository but not in the 64 bit repo and your dpkg apt are not configured to deal with this for some reason

209492
disk	ram
instead they use ram disk to cache the streaming videos

209494
mouse	keyboard
with xfce installed the system runs nice and quick so once bluetooth keyboard is working it will be possible to have mouse keyboard and a usable system so i m hoping that professional audio will be an option on this device

visudo locks the sudoers file saves edits to a temporary file and checks that file s grammar before copying it to etc sudoers.

209576

you have to be careful in which drive you will install ubuntu because ubuntu linux not recognize the drives as windows

well known versioncontrol-systems are cvs svn subversion and git

209595
cvs	svn
there is no need to think about ye olde cvs so that leaves us svn and git

folder	directory
the solution is to create a blank file named for instance new inside the templates folder of your home directory

i never developed an application to linux ubuntu mint that is why i like to create something like that and know that you can access functions hardware or system components

209793

note i use linux mint but i think it does not matter because it is based on debian like ubuntu

209836
ssd	sata
the above solution applies only for old ubuntu versions where dmraid was not a part of the os and it helps only installation of the os but you still cannot boot from the revodrive itself not boot sector on the ssd but only if you let ubuntu to install the bootloader onto one of your alternative sata drives hdds..

209837
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade ubuntu from an earlier versioning and everything seems to be pretty great

209867
folder	directory
i accidentally deleted my documents folder in my home directory last sunday

209877
chown	chmod
there is no need to chown or chmod any files as some articles might suggest and adding your user to the mail group is much better practice and avoids any direct changing of the permissions on the root filesystem

209878

my ubuntu install frequently freezes sometimes showing a black screen not very common anymore - in my latest installs some other times the mouse and keyboard just fail to move and respond not even ctrl + alt + f1 works and some other times i m able to move the mouse with a huge delay 2-5 seconds but i m not able to do click anything

209891

this example is from debian but is probably identical to the ubuntu version

209927
ubuntu	debian
my experience stems from debian for which the entire packaging and upgrade system used in ubuntu was originally invented

209927
versioning	upgrade
the updater will always try to install the newest usable versioning of any dependent package during any upgrdade not just release upgrade

209927
versioning	upgrade
programs which cannot function with the new library versioning cannot be started during the time after the library is upgrade and before the program itself is upgrade as well

209927
versioning	upgrade
if those programs should already be running before the library upgrade they will however continue to run because the old library versioning remains in memory as long as it remains in use

209927
google-chrome	firefox
if i removed firefox and installed google-chrome will firefox still get pulled in as part of upgrades

209939
switching	screens
i run ubuntu 10.10 maverick meerkat now and install went fine when trying to boot the screens popped black and i faced this message gpu lockup - switching to software fbcon. when setting the display to onboard vga through bios ubuntu has no problem at all but when i switching back to my agp card which is a nvidia geforce 6600gt i get that message again

209972
versioning	upgrade
for an usb device to be recognized proberly in virtual box we may have to upgrade it to the puel versioning

209976
kde	gnome
either gnome kde or freedesktop provide a network accessible configuration repository and an precedence schema for local an shared configuration data

210005
ubuntu	linux
i ve also thought about replacing ubuntu with lubuntu or puppy linux as the system does run a bit slow but i can t as then i won t be able to access the taskbar and application menu which will be hidden beneath the screen

cinnamon	gnome
cinnamon vs gnome

210018
cinnamon	gnome
cinnamon inherits many of its features from gnome itself

thus in most cases you can use the gnome functionality to achieve capabilities that are not explicitly wrapped up in the main cinnamon desktop

210049
folder	directory
create a mozilla plugins folder in your home directory

210057
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
the way it sounds i think using a version control like git mercurial hg bazaar or svn is not a perfect fit for your needs since they are primarily targeted for source files not binary data

210075
google-chrome	firefox
whenever you try to access the internet either in a browser google-chrome firefox tested apt-get software centre or wget curl it throws up connection refused errors

210110
ubuntu	debian
suppose i installed a debian package using the ubuntu software center and then suppose i wish to install the same program by compiling it from source

210125
sudo	passwd
first of all you don t have to know the root s passwd use your own with sudo command

210154
folder	directory
a significant advantage of this solution is that one can compare files or folder located in different directory home user a b c file.txt and home user d e f otherfile.txt can be opened in different nautilus windows and compared against each other

i m very new to ubuntu and linux in general so please forgive my noobness

210404
versioning	upgrade
when doing a new install instead of an upgrade to an old versioning you need to have a dedicated partition for the new system

210407
versioning	upgrade
update manager should offer you an upgrade to the new versioning

210445
installation	upgrade
the installation utility has an option to upgrade the current installation rather than reinstalling a complete new system

210480
ubuntu	linux
i have some working knowledge about the linux shell but i m new to ubuntu

210481
kubuntu	gnome
the 13.04 ubuntu variants - mythbuntu ubuntu studio kubuntu xubuntu lubuntu ubuntukylin ubuntu gnome - are not commercially supported by canonical

210507
installation	upgrade
i had no problem with 12.04 and already tested both an upgrade and a fresh installation of the os

210531
versioning	upgrade
so the solution is either downgrade xorg versioning to 1.12 and keep ubuntu 12.10 or stick with ubuntu 12.04 and wait until fglrx supports xorg versioning 1.13 and then upgrade to 12.10

210532

chown	sudo
its pretty simple where you want to copy userone s account to usertwo - create a new account usertwo copy over the contents of home userone to home usertwo with sudo cp to handle permissions issues then sudo chown -r usertwo home usertwo to give ownership of the directory to the new user

sudo	passwd
the first command will require your sudo passwd and will also give you a text dump explaining what s going on

212286
versioning	upgrade
if you see 12.04 as the versioning it means that the previous upgrade failed and you should probably continue upgrading

212289
kde	gnome
11.04 and onwards use unity but you can also try gnome or kde

212291
ubuntu	linux	filesystems	ntfs
ext3 is like ntfs for windows it s the linux filesystems so you shouldn t have any problem recovering your data with ubuntu or any other linux distribution

filesystems	btrfs
ecryptfs is flexible and easy to use layering on top of the current filesystems for example ext4 or btrfs

213387
pull	push
instead have each developer work on their own machine and each person just does git pull push to fetch code from the central server branch

213391
pull	push
such repository needs to be created by a super-admin user but after that everyone will be able to push and pull from it

213422
kde	gnome
seems its a quirk of kde gnome doesn t exhibit this issue at all

213556
folder	directory
i d like to have a copy of my .emacs file in my dropbox folder but i d also like to have this copy in an automatic way i mean every time i change my .emacs in the home directory i want it to be instantly updated in the dropbox directory this necessity is because i want the .emacs to be equal in my windows and ubuntu partitions and i think dropbox is a good tool for that

213558
switching	screens
after trying disabling nvidia drivers switching to cinnamon switching to gdm and finally kicking the damn thing that was just for me to feel better i noticed that as i switched to a console tty alt + f1 or f2 ... f6 during some gdm lightdm service restart there were a lot of error messages scrolling down the screens

213578
versioning	upgrade
maybe you should have a look in the settings section it has a drop down box that asked when you want to be notified about distro upgrade set it to for any new versioning it might be set default to for long-term support versioning

213585
folder	directory
the folder names inside these directory look something like

ubuntu	linux
linux distribution maintainers have announced plans to work around this obstacle but i don t know offhand if they were implemented in time for ubuntu 12.10 s release

213675
ubuntu	centos
in my case the windows that came with the machine ubuntu 12.10 and centos 6. i see no options in etc default grub that disable this

213684
ubuntu	debian
you must download the ubuntu debian package and install it with

213688
ubuntu	centos
also if you ve got centos and ubuntu both installed to disk then there is chance they will fight over the grub install to the mbr or wherever your grub is installed to as well

213693
ubuntu	debian
however just making packages of various things you find an interest in or as a point of staging packages you wish to propose for inclusion in the ubuntu or debian archives does not require multiple ppas

213695
versioning	upgrade
the scan reported a vulnerability in apache 2.2.22 apache http server zero-length directory name in ld_library_path vulnerability .the report states to upgrade the versioning to the latest stable release of either 2.2.23 or 2.2.24

213814
ati	nvidia
apart from this i heard that 12.10 will be focusing more on up to date video drivers nvidia and ati specially with all of the gaming steam movement going around

213814
ati	nvidia
so my question is if the x-swat ppa is still needed to be able to have the latest drivers for nvidia ati intel or can the additional drivers in ubuntu 12.10 be used for this

213874
ubuntu	linux
i remember i could set it on my arch linux but i guess my problem now is connected to ubuntu root account not behaving like i expect it

int	boolean
as well the parameter is boolean y or n and not an int 0 or 1

214586
filesystems	ntfs
removable media typically are formatted with a microsoft filesystems such as fat32 or ntfs which do not support symbolic links so you can not place one on the drive

so after the update the screens ends up in low graphics mode and i get a menu which i can t see not wanting to make another uninformed decision i google it and find out that i just have to switching to gdm

214617
udp	tcp
for ufw you should make an inbound rule which will allow you to accept connections via port 5123 probably tcp and udp

214622
ubuntu	linux
so it seems like if ubuntu is unable to see your bios raid configuration then perhaps the raid controller chip is not supported by the linux kernel in at least the version of ubuntu you re using as a live boot image

214646
ubuntu	mint
i recently upgraded from mint 12 to ubuntu 12.10 + cinnamon

214660
ubuntu	mint
i guess mint 12 like ubuntu 12.04 comes with udisks1 which uses just media

filesystems	ntfs
due to the route i came into ubuntu i now have 12.10 upgraded from 12.04 on an ntfs filesystems

well my problem is that everything worked fine till i had to upgrade ubuntu to the last versioning 12.04

214689
kde	gnome
after following this guide to install kde and trying it out for a while i want to remove gnome unity not 3--i m not sure if the distinction is majorly important or not

214689
kde	gnome
the problem is that the remove gnome command linked is actually the remove kde command--and i can t find a way to remove gnome

214705

214805
disk	ram
i have some sensitive data in ram that i prefer not to be on disk

214827
ubuntu	mint
although this guide is for ubuntu mint is based and completely compatible with ubuntu so you are safe to follow that guide

214851
ubuntu	linux
it installed but when i boot the computer it doesn t give me the option of choosing between 7 or ubuntu just booting right to the linux distro

ubuntu	linux
i m having a problem with emacs when i ssh from my ubuntu 12.04 laptop to another linux machine

which should print the height width pairs the camera is capable of - in this case 1280x1024 plus some smaller ones

215007
installation	upgrade
if you upgrade using installation dvd usb grub may get installed

215020
ubuntu	linux
i just went through this myself the problem is that there is a bug in the ubuntu installer that removes the linux headers needed for the nvidia drivers to work

215031
folder	directory
has the same problem with 12.10 tried dragging the directory i wanted to bookmark and it didn t work until i read the help and found out that to add a folder as a book mark all you had to do is to open the folder directory and click on the bookmark menu and then add bookmark

215049
ubuntu	debian
jdstrand debian ubuntu packages contain 038_no_ld_library_path see

sudo	passwd
after upgrading to ubuntu 12.10 i forgot to disable cap-locks and have attempted to use the wronf sudo passwd three times

215156
google-chrome	firefox
use the web uploader inside google-chrome or firefox - it has auto-resuming capability so that you can disconnect your internet connection to pause the upload and then reconnect when you wish to continue the upload

215160
sudo	passwd
if you run sudo with wrong passwd should not happen anything other than the command not being run

215160
sudo	passwd
running sudo 3 times with the wrong passwd could not have changed your su passwd even if you ran sudo on sudo passwd root

215160
sudo	passwd
unless you forgot the passwd which is another question you should try again with the same passwd since it is the same passwd as before running sudo

215170
post	get
i have no idea of how to get any king of diagnostics so if you ask something please explain how to do it or post a link with explanations

215188

linux mint uses nemo file manager fork of nautilus and how can i use it on ubuntu 12.10 unity desktop

215241
ati	nvidia
a more recent ati or nvidia card would probably be a better choice for gaming

215251
kde	kubuntu
there is also kamerka but since it needed to download a lot of kde libraries i tested this one in another pc with kubuntu and works excellent

215261
vmware	virtualbox
your best bet would be to use vmware or virtualbox

215269
versioning	upgrade
if you do not want to upgrade to non-lts versioning follow these steps

215269
versioning	upgrade
now when you run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade it d be upgrade to the next lts versioning and not non-lts versioning

215303
ubuntu	linux
you could possibly argue that the linux kernel when compiled with modules designed for a specific device might comprise the core of a tailored operating system however i don t think that you could argue that ubuntu as an os product fits this definition

215382
installation	upgrade
i also have a dell inspiron mini 10 netbook which i also upgrade to 12.10 slightly smaller installation on a flash hard drive

215394

i had an old intel desktop board d410pt mini-itx with atom processor that i decided to set up with linux and chose ubuntu 12.04

suppose you extracted your backup to a directory called backup in your home folder

215478
xfce	gnome
i had one when using gnome but currently i want to use xfce

215515
ati	nvidia
between this and the enhancements with ati intel and nvidia nvidia and intel with performance boosts you can be sure that performance and stability are #1 with the compiz project

215515
ati	nvidia	ubuntu	linux
apart from this many performance issues are been worked on for ubuntu 13.04 but also for 12.10 and previous active versions that will come from several parts including the linux kernel 3.8 the nvidia drivers the intel stack the new ati drivers the work done by the ubuntu developers in unity and compiz and the testing done by it s users

215517
folder	directory
then create a new folder called .conky in the home directory and

215525
sudo	passwd
i also provide my root passwd on the beginning so it should be able to do everything with sudo privilege

215671
versioning	upgrade
the reason is that after upgrade you have different versioning of mac-os-x themes mixed up

215707
sudo	gnome-terminal
you can add a shortcut that runs gksudo gnome-terminal or simply run sudo -i inside an already running one to become root

215710
ubuntu	debian
i have downloaded and installed python 3.2.3 for ubuntu debian

215720

215815
ubuntu	linux
i am new at linux and ubuntu

215866
int	chars
then there are limits set by hardware such as the size of an int or chars

215866
integer	unsigned
if you have a 32-bit system then there are limits set by the maximum size of an integer 4 294 967 295 if unsigned or half that if signed

215883
daemons	systemd
daemons are also called services especially in a windows context where the term daemons is rarely if ever used but should not be confused with the concepts of online services services in systemd architecture nor though related software as a service

regarding the answer to the question the battery power status is displayed differently in m windows and ubuntu linux

216121

there isn t a gui for read wireless mouse or keyboard battery data

216133
stdout	stderr
try debugging further and log all stdout and stderr output from all commands in your scripts as zakkak explains

216134
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
for a better choice of a server this is what apache is try learning some about lighttpd and nginx

216158
dpkg	apt
you can install an older version of a given package downgrade with apt or dpkg easily

216158
versioning	upgrade
if you install the package from an install cd or an outdated mirror or a cache you will also need to keep it pinned to the old versioning so it won t be upgrade until you allow that

216164
ubuntu	linux
note these instructions need to be run on windows or mac and will not run on ubuntu linux

216193
vim	gedit
in that case the utility is anything that can read txt files vim gedit less more cat etc

216207
rss	feed
it can read both atom and rss feed

216223
ubuntu	opensuse
is there any way to see packages and library lists on ubuntu like opensuse

216247
filesystems	fat
although the fat filesystems used on esps is case-insensitive i ve encountered one badly broken efi with case sensitivity issues

216254
ubuntu	linux
and if you re using 3.3.0 or later kernels as shipped with ubuntu 12.10 but not with ubuntu 12.04 you can boot linux directly with refind bypassing grub entirely

216264
pop-up	dialog
having a space between lines would really mess up text ui based programs like nano mail and that little dialog that pop-up when you run apt from the command line

216288
ubuntu	linux
i am new to the linux world and i wanted to try ubuntu - so i installed it using wubi

216301
ubuntu	linux
try going to the apache site itself and look for packages you can download and open with ubuntu that are for ubuntu or linux

216302
mouse	keyboard
i ve tried typing the password blindly but it does not respond to keyboard or mouse input

216314
ati	nvidia
both nvidia and ati amd have fairly good support for most cards on the market

216314
ati	nvidia
nvidia supplies their own proprietary driver which usually avoids the issue the ati cards have

216334
filesystems	xfs
linux does not provide any mechanism to specify how much metadata and data to cache on a per directory basis for filesystems like ext2 ext3 ext4 xfs etc

216365
zypper	yum
the same goes for yum zypper and the other package managers for the other distributions since they have to comply with certain standards either legal or self-imposed for distributing software bundled with the operating system or turned on by default in the package manager

216390
folder	directory
copy the mac adress and mount it on a folder in your home directory for example on public

gmail	hotmail
i m sure they re stored fully and securely on a remote server either yahoo or gmail or hotmail

216420
ubuntu	linux
you must know the full name of the kernel you want - ubuntu with linux 3.13.0-53-generic - along with the full name of the advanced menu - advanced options for ubuntu

216442
udp	tcp
in order for remote computers those outside of your lan to access your samba machine s you will need to set up port forwarding such that the tcp ports 135 139 445 as well as the udp ports 135-139 are forwarded to your samba machine

216452
ssd	sata
this machine actually has 3 hard drives 2 sata 750gb sda and sdb and a 128gb ssd sdc

216510
versioning	upgrade
however when i try to upgrade it i start the update manager like always and i start the distro upgrade just like i do every time there s a new versioning but at the end of the setting new software channels stage it fails saying

216571
versioning	upgrade
in all cases the process dpkg --config libc6 amd64 stopped working due to too many errors because 13 packages have wrong versioning below than required and such files cannot be configured and thus upgrade

216592
ubuntu	linux
however i was curious if various linux distributions ubuntu is writing some other files other than the syslog or kernel.log where specific information about the crash can be decoded

216621
sudo	passwd
add a local user and passwd for the user then add the user to the adm and sudo groups

216630
stdout	stderr
we are probably looking for values greater than 2 because 0 1 and 2 are just stdin stdout and stderr

216676
versioning	upgrade
for that reason i had to upgrade my kernel versioning

216678
versioning	upgrade
it may be time for you to bite the bullet and upgrade though as that versioning of ubuntu hasn t been supported for quite a while

216682
ubuntu	linux
i need to install google picasa picture viewer on ubuntu 12.04 but there is no such package for ubuntu or any other linux distro

216742
ubuntu	linux
install a linux efi boot loader -- ubuntu uses an efi version of grub 2 for this in the grub-efi package

216742
ubuntu	linux
if you installed ubuntu 12.10 or if you re comfortable compiling your own kernel you can use refind to boot linux in efi mode too

216743

217833

one containing gcc g++ 4.7 can be found here

217833

using a ppa to install gcc g++ might allow apt-get to realise that gcc g++ 4.7 satisfies the dependency

217853

217999
ubuntu	debian
this applies both to debian and ubuntu but more specific instructions for ubuntu follow

218015
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs in ubuntu is implemented using fuse filesystems in userspace see

218015
filesystems	ntfs
some anecdotal evidence shows that ntfs using fuse is similar in performance to other fuse based filesystems such as zfs and there are reports that fuse based ntfs consumes more cpu than the windows equivalent

the bluetooth apple keyboard and mouse as well are causing a huge headache

218139
mouse	keyboard
can i use my usb keyboard and mouse while running ubuntu on the nexus 7

218140
mouse	keyboard
using this cable you can attach a usb hub to the nexus 7 and attach a mouse and keyboard to that

218149
vagrant	juju
in fact i d like to see a vagrant provider written for juju so juju can drive virtualbox containers on a local environment with the same ease that it drives cloud and lxc images

218149
vagrant	juju
also juju really derives a lot of its value from the set of charms services that can be spun up straight out-of-the-box whereas vagrant s essentially a lower-level local container provider

218149
vagrant	juju
in fact we provide a vagrant box with juju so that users can test the local provider from within a vm

218149
vagrant	juju
these appear to be mostly one-off asides from vagrant proper and frankly just highlight the need for a tool like juju

218152
sudo	passwd
ctrl-alt-t works thankfully and the terminal stays responsive long enough for me to get in a sudo reboot now and type my passwd

my mouse is a saitek cyborg r.a.t.5 mouse and my keyboard is a stock acer one that came with a pc i bought a few years ago

else if they are so many either employ a person or give them sudo passwd

maybe you can run sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade from terminal to see if a newer versioning of software center is available thats working again .

218233

when i click the trackpad it is always registered as a small mouse movement as well as a click so it drags whatever i click on

i want to see a kernel that first allows installing on disk and allowing to run load from ram once the os is installed at the users behest and handling errors and saving changes...obviously and without guarantee

converting between package formats intended for different distributions is not a perfect process and never will be you really should try to use ubuntu or at least debian packages

218466
ubuntu	debian
sometimes if you need a newer version than exists in the ubuntu repositories you can find it in debian testing unstable or even experimental series

218467

as for your specific request i doubt that it will be an easy endeavor at least for any one individual since it not only requires knowledge of gnome and gnome-shell but also of every application and how it handles the menu system some standards may be found amount gtk qt and kde applications but you still have the outliers to deal with as well and that s assuming that gnome shell supports such an extension

where xx is the number of seconds until the computer hibernates does xx indicate the number of seconds until the computer writes the state of the ram to the disk or until the computer actually goes into hibernation mode or both

disk	ram
i would like to use a hybrid suspend in which when i close the lid of my laptop the state of the ram is both written to the disk and kept in the ram at the time that i close the lid of the laptop and then after the xx seconds the computer actually goes into hibernate drops the contents of the ram from the ram

219633
disk	ram
therefore it can be concluded that the system does not write the state of the ram to the disk as soon as it suspends

if i am i would like to know how to make hybrid suspend write the state of the ram to the disk when the computer suspends not after the timer expires

unity of course puts the window buttons and menus at the top left for maximized windows and removes the titlebar

221154
sudo	passwd
it sounds like the real problem is that the account you normally log in as is not a member of the sudo group - the root account on ubuntu normally does not have a passwd and is not allowed to log in directly

a typical ubuntu or any linux installation is not just a kernel it s a bunch of things- a file system a windows manager a set of tools and other frameworks

i would like to know what ubuntu or any other linux distro for that matter is assembled from

221167
ubuntu	linux
os linux ubuntu 12.10

221217
filesystems	fat
fat also works but most linux installers won t let you use fat on boot . the reason is that there are efi drivers for these filesystems so using them to store your kernel can increase your options for boot loader configuration even if the default installation doesn t make use of these options

221249
ssd	sata
with my sata ii system the new intel ssd should probably be 1.3-1.5 times faster on buffer read and at least twice faster on cached read

filesystems	ntfs
what it does is that it creates and installs ubuntu files within the windows partition and the ntfs filesystems used by windows

221295
ubuntu	linux
it s not showing any of the linux kernels that ubuntu is running on

221301

however linux and in particular ubuntu does not need lots of new drivers

instead ubuntu and other linux variants provides the usb mode switch function complete with a large and growing list of brands devices and the data needed to control them

ubuntu	linux
afaik there is currently no built-in driver for the wn111v2 which makes it an extreme pain to deal with in linux ubuntu or otherwise

221452
filesystems	fat
usb sticks are usually fat filesystems i m not sure what tools there are that might repair fat filesystems but you might find that you can read most all of the files just from ubuntu ignoring the i o errors then recreate the filesystems to copy them back

in addition to making sure libxml2 is installed and depending on which versioning of ubuntu you are running -- i upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04 -- you also might need to have ia32-libs installed as noted here

debconf	apt
i have already manually made apt and apache2 and debconf in cache directoy but i do not know if i miss more important directory which needed to be created there

221532

it depends on the installed packages which folder and files you need in this directory

221532
debconf	apt
for example apache apt cups debconf flashplugin-installer git samba lightdm pm-utls man software-center .

221532

maybe you can take a look on the ubuntu live cd which files and folder are the standard files in this directory

221712
ubuntu	linux
my advice is to use a pendrive with at least 30 gb of memory and use the lili linux live usb installer and as for the system it requires about 4 4 gb of memory u will rest with 25 6 gb and all of that u should make it persistent mode so that u could install drivers and make updates to your ubuntu pendrive and using it as another system just by simply conecting it to your pc but remember if u don t use the persistant mode u will not be able to use ubuntu as u would like to

i would also recommend sagemath as it includes gnu octave if its already installed on your system scilab if you already have it installed numpy numpy and the rest mentioned unless otherwise specified come with sage and therefore no installation is necessary scipy matplotlib maxima fortran among many others

although it not a very nice solution you could move the window by pressing alt and drag the window to show the hidden part of it

221864
versioning	upgrade
now 12.04 is a long-term support lts release and therefore by default it will offer you to upgrade only for the next lts versioning

you can use the xrandr utility from command line to switching back and forth between single and dual screens

221963
subnet	packets
it sounds like packets that should go out directly on eth0 to the 192.168.20.0 24 subnet are instead going to the default gateway on presumably 192.168.10.x which then doesn t understand how to route them

221970

you can do all this via the do something else option in the ubuntu installer or in advance with gparted live stick it on a usb - it s a mini debian with gparted on it

222041
dpkg	aptitude
the summary is that hold at apt-get aptitude level is not triggering hold status in dpkg see bug 72806 especially and update-manager reads status from dpkg

222050
versioning	upgrade
note that security updates means fixes and paches for software malfunction but it will not update a package to a new versioning for example if a new versioning of apache comes out you will not get that installed unless you upgrade your ubuntu versioning

222050
versioning	upgrade
this is actually good for servers because if for example you make a web app that works great with a certain versioning of php and a certain versioning of apache and mysql you dont want those to be upgrade at anytime and possibly break something and give you a hard time trying to find the problem

222050
versioning	upgrade
from what i can say of the other side of the coin is that the upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 is normally seamless except if for example some of your apps are not compatible with new versioning of software as mentioned above

222068
kde	kubuntu
if you want to be more secure you can install kubuntu instead of ubuntu that make the difference by using kde that in my opinion consumes less graphic resources than the last interfaces of ubuntu

222092
ubuntu	linux
so the question is is it possible to allow multiple passwords to log on to ubuntu linux for the same user

apt-get upgrade will fetch new versioning of packages existing on the machine if apt knows about these new versioning by way of apt-get update

222352
versioning	upgrade
packages currently installed with new versioning available are retrieved and upgrade

222352
versioning	upgrade
new versioning of currently installed packages that cannot be upgrade without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current versioning

222352
versioning	upgrade
in addition to performing the function of upgrade this option also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versioning of packages

222352
sudo	passwd
you need sudo both times but since sudo by default doesn t prompt you within 5 or so minutes since the last sudo operation you will be prompted for your passwd only once or not at all

222353
folder	directory
if you want to back up the configuration files and settings those are stored in folder and files in your home directory that start with a

222355

ubuntu	linuxmint
i have tried it using linuxmint and it is fairly attractive there and stable too but i d like to stick to ubuntu

222368
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
but basically installing mate in ubuntu is the same as installing it in linux mint

222368
ubuntu	mint
but the differences in ubuntu and mint are there even if you don t install mate

222368
ubuntu	linuxmint
for example shortcuts and packages in ubuntu are different from linuxmint as you said it is more ubuntu style-like mate difference

222368
ubuntu	linuxmint
as for the glitches linuxmint is based on ubuntu so it works fine on both

222832
ubuntu	linux
in the recent past it would have been fairly easy to create a pptp vpn on ubuntu linux

222849
gedit	nano
you will need to use sudo for vi nano etc. or gksudo for gedit etc.

222958
daemons	systemd
upstart is the init daemons to initialize and boot the systemd after your kernel and initramfs are finished

222959
ubuntu	linux
i ve created a virtual machine under xubuntu linux 12.10 x86_64 and installed ubuntu server 12.10 x86_64 on it then i configured it for my use case - no problems here everything works great

223023
sudo	passwd
run sudo gnome-ppp after installing it and give it ur provider dial number username and passwd

223036
bazaar	svn
however note if you re not familiar with launchpad that the code mirrors that it uses don t use svn everything is periodically imported into a bazaar repo and that recipes don t allow internet access

223045
afp	smb
to make that work i have to disable avahi s dbus api or else netatalk tends to take over all the services osx prefers afp over smb

223045
daemons	launchd
maybe something like enabling but ignoring the dbus in avahi or launchd a duplicate avahi daemons with a different config file

223077
cpu	processors
processors genuine intel cpu t2500 2.00ghz x 2

223084
mouse	keyboard
i have a usb mouse and keyboard but it is not being recognized

223089
mouse	keyboard
technically running a hard drive keyboard and mouse should all be possible

223089
mouse	keyboard
however with the root file system on the usb hard drive it is conceivable that there is to much traffic across the bus and the mouse and keyboard are not being detected properly

223093
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
also to make life easier modify your sudoers so sudo should not timeout and you do not have to enter your passwd each time you are disconnected

223095
doc	odf
alternatively i need an app which able to properly convert pdf to doc odf and back to pdf

223098
dpkg	apt
it will make apt and dpkg processes take longer but will make it so your cache directory is always clean

223098
dpkg	apt
if space is really that large of an issue then you can disable apt all together and revert to manually installing via dpkg

223103
width	height
set your width and height

223107
doc	odf
first of all properly convert pdf to doc odf and back to pdf - convertion is nearly always a loss operation

223125
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu uses different runlevels than other linux distros

223142
matlab	freemat
let s say for example you installed freemat a version of matlab i am not sure if this is what you installed or not though you would type this in

223189
versioning	upgrade
in the early versioning of ubuntu there were two options to upgrade

223189
installation	upgrade
a upgrade directly from the existing installation

223189
versioning	upgrade
though it is not essential as new versioning of ubuntu gives the option to preserve home even when it is not a separate partition during upgrade reinstall from live usb dvd

223224
ubuntu	linux
but it looks like the update came from 7 24 2012 and that is a general linux driver so there could be a number of specific ubuntu issues

223238
versioning	upgrade
an upgrade of ubuntu should leave any third-party applications installed and functional with the caveat that if they depend on specific versioning of libraries upgrade to them could cause problems

223250
ubuntu	linux
i am a completely new user to linux ubuntu

223286
jobs	cron
basically it shouldn t hurt anything if you miss a few cron jobs but leaving it off all the time will cause problems

223345
ati	nvidia
note to speed up your desktop you could install the propriatary driver if you are using nvidia or ati graphics which would help.

223351
ubuntu	mint
since i ve installed ubuntu 12.04 i have this problem on mint 13 i also had this problem now i have ubuntu 12.10 updated and windows 7 with it

i would like to suggest you to upgrade your bios to latest versioning sometimes hardware is ready to work but due to old bios there may be problem in data input output

223395

the keyboard and mouse are connected to the host pc windows 7

223395
mouse	keyboard
when the mouse cursor leaves the host pc with russian layout the keyboard doesn t respond in the secondary pc

223395
mouse	keyboard
the only way is to return the mouse cursor to the host pc switch keyboard layout to english and go back to the secondary pc

223407
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu 12.04 my linux-image is 3.2.0-33-generic-pae recovery mode goes into the same error kernel panic - not syncing attempted to kill init and ubuntu upgrade my previous linux versioning as well and they all go into that same error

223439
sysv	systemd
for example on my systemd i have files for the following services either in sysv and upstart

223492
sudo	passwd
when using sudo you will be prompted for your passwd

223497
ubuntu	linux
so my question is why does it appear as though there is no standard on linux ubuntu

223500
ubuntu	linux
why is there no standard on linux ubuntu

223519
ubuntu	linux
so if you want to use outlook on ubuntu you will have to use a windows emulator like wine to make outlook run on your linux

223545
ubuntu	linux
i found my mistake ubuntu 12.10 or any linux needs a efi partition also if the bios has uefi booting technology

223569
switching	screens
screens can do a lot more than that you can have multiple consoles open switching between them copy and paste data and even use split views and fancy stuff like that

223578
folder	directory
when i try to open text editor write some script and save it in www folder it gives me an error something that i cant save files in this directory

223602

223633
ubuntu	linux
partition 4 - ntfs formatted for linux distro say ubuntu i reformatted it to ext4 during ubuntu installation 25gb

223637
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my versioning of virtualbox as suggested by dwurf

223667
ubuntu	linux
these worked out of the box with linux ubuntu -- no problems

223667
mouse	keyboard
this is especially nice because you can assuming you use your right hand for the mouse get your mouse in closer to the keyboard

223697
bash	zsh
the default is bash but if you are interested there are others such as zsh ksh dash perl python etc

223716
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for metta

223716
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for metta

223723
installation	upgrade
to upgrade your cacti installation from 8.7i to 8.8a perform the following commands from a terminal

223813
ubuntu	linux
i currently have a server installed with ubuntu server 12.04.1 first time using linux which i would like to configure as a media server

223817
folder	directory
i think everytime you are selecting the photo from folder directory in the partition other than in which ubuntu is installed

223827
ubuntu	linux
you can try to compare the amount of space ubuntu more accurate linux takes in the hard-drive versus other systems as mac or windows

223829
switching	screens
the screens freezes and i can t even switching to other terminals by pressing ctrl+alt+f

223829
cpu	processors
processors core i7-3520m cpu 2.90ghz

after login i can do switching user and see login screens but script will be able to run since desktop exists

223904

ctrl + alt + f2 to switching to terminal console 2 tty2 login and try killing gnome-screensaver and or restarting a replacement gnome-shell with pkill gnome-screensaver switching back to tty7 ctrl + alt + f7 to check your gnome screens if not go back to tty2 and which was suggested before by steve and msdin respectively

223906
ubuntu	debian
it s for debian and ubuntu

223951
ubuntu	linux
these solutions are typically android-based and allow some form of linux ubuntu to be installed

223978
ubuntu	debian
i have ubuntu with grub2 installed in an apple macbook pro with dual boot using refit and i would like to use grub2 to boot the livecd iso image of a system based in debian too crunchbang

223998
folder	directory
if it doesn t try giving the files in the tools directory in the android sdk folder execute permissions given that they don t have these permissions already

224001
google-chrome	firefox
i d like to find the files that a not-yet-installed software application google-chrome or firefox can open

224008
ubuntu	linux
the problem is whenever i search something along the lines of ubuntu + linux proxy sites assume that i want to set up a proxy server rather than use one

224011
stdout	stderr
most likely a buggy program started spamming error messages to stdout stderr

224015
google-chrome	firefox
i switched a long time ago to the offical version of google-chrome instead of chromium or firefox because it comes bundled with its own version of adobe flash

224018
kate	kde
if you re unable to get it to work you could use a different editor that lets you edit shortcuts such as kde s kate

224036
ffmpeg	handbrake
all tutorials refer to handbrake ffmpeg compiling but i am more comfortable with x264 syntax

224058
xfce	gnome
i only seleced ubuntu base server and openssh server without any desktop environment gnome xfce etc.

224058
debian-based	linux
ps if you are looking for a less radical solution try crunchbang linux it s a pretty lightweight debian-based distro that runs well on an eee

224087
kde	gnome
shotwell gnome gwenview and digikam kde available in the repos and xnview has a beta multiplatform version than can be downloaded here

224097
ubuntu	linux
in the future versions of gnu linux including ubuntu will have workarounds for this feature

224106
ethernet	wireless
although i wasn t able to connect to the wireless network i was able to connect to the internet once i plugged in the ethernet cable

224115
versioning	upgrade
do you know how can i upgrade to a new versioning to use it

224126
filesystems	fat
for anything but fat you ll need filesystems drivers that ship with refind. you can install one of these programs from windows and configure it to boot your linux kernel in efi mode which can simplify the process of converting from a bios legacy-mode boot to an efi-mode boot

224127
gedit	nano
then edit fstab with for example sudo nano or gksu gedit and add this line

224127
folder	directory
repeat for all the folder you want to appear in your home directory

224290
ubuntu	debian
installing on ubuntu and debian

224335
pop-up	dialog
tested this works with firefox as well. granted it does pop-up a dialog box asking me to confirm installation but .

224352
ubuntu	linux
further more it seems like ubuntu linux is not listed as one of the partitions

224359
yacc	bison
bison will provide yacc to wireshark via update-alternatives using usr bin bison.yacc to provide usr bin yacc yacc in auto mode

224388
folder	directory
after you download that folder change to the directory that your download is in home

224404

translation	localization
note i m running a german localization of xubuntu - i hope i translation run command and program finder correctly.

224502
net-snmp	cacti
the default net-snmp version that shipped with ubuntu has been 5.4.3 and does work as expected with other snmp-dependant applications cacti but not with tkmib

224512
kde	kubuntu
i have recently installed kubuntu alongside arch with kde and decided to use firefox as my default browser because i m not very fond of rekonq

224525
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu will then be able to access it for that session

224546
folder	directory
you can solve this copying the 48px icons in the 32 24 22 and 16 folder in the theme directory this works fine for me

224549
versioning	upgrade
i ve been reading on the news forums and different websites that the new versioning in 12.10 which i ll eventually have to upgrade to if i plan on using ubuntu has a lens amazon function on the dash that sends queries to amazon

224554
mouse	keyboard
the command xprintidle you may have to install this prints the number of milliseconds for which there has been no keyboard or mouse activity

224554
sudo	passwd
to pm-suspend without giving passwd checkout how do i run specific sudo commands without a passwd

224554
sudo	passwd
alternatively you may run this script in sudo mode and make this script sudoable without passwd not a problem if you running script as root

224568
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu unix linux does not have a c en d drives these are just windows names for chunks of memory mapped directly on hard drives or partitions

224591
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
yes it s possible to create a live usb with the ntfs filesystems to install ubuntu according to this article at ubuntu documentation you can also use a fat32 fat 16 filesystems

224591
filesystems	ntfs
be sure to carefully read the article and follow the instructions step-by-step because i tried the same with usb stick with the ntfs filesystems and it worked correctly

224596
mouse	keyboard
just bind the keyboard mediapad mouse once

224596
mouse	keyboard
very sad as the dinovo is not the cheapest keyboard mouse combo around at usd 180

224596

so everytime you switch enjoy the hen and egg problem try to add keybard and mouse in ubuntu without having keyboard nor mouse

224610

ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 12.04 installation option provides simultaneous with other systems installed at the beginning of the installation when asked if erases all the disk and install ubuntu answer no other options after that presents external disk is in the disk itself windows dividing the space and formatting the partition to use linux you can install another internal drive to the notebook

224617
ubuntu	linux
reliability it may not be as reliable as other methods because the software will have gone through less testing and may not even have been tested at all for ubuntu just other linux distros

224617
ubuntu	debian
if the authors have provided a .deb package that implies that they probably have done some minimal testing on debian or ubuntu

224617
ubuntu	debian
on the whole this is better security than installing directly from source because the program has been reviewed to some extent by debian and or ubuntu maintainers

224617
ubuntu	debian
debian and or ubuntu maintainers can patch the program to fix security flaws too if the program is open source

224617
ubuntu	debian
frequency of updates debian and or ubuntu maintainers only select some releases of the software

224617
ubuntu	debian
there is a delay between the release of a program and its inclusion in the debian and or ubuntu repos

224656
sudo	passwd
or you could try adding your user to the list of users that aren t required to enter a passwd when using sudo

224680
ati	nvidia
i am thinking of upgrading my old ati amd radeon 4870 to nvidia 610 or 620 maybe 630

224680
ati	nvidia
i think i have to remove proprietary drivers first ati legacy 12.06 restart and install nvidia proprietary drivers then

224683
ati	nvidia
close you pc replace the ati card with nvidia and power on

224694
sudo	passwd
the -s stdin option causes sudo to read the passwd from the standard input instead of the terminal device

224694
stdout	stderr
and will redirect append the stdout and the stderr to a log file in your home named myaptupd.log just in case you can check if everything is allright with the apt-get update command

224698
ubuntu	linux
it should be fine for ubuntu or any other linux

224707
truecrypt	umount
it currently contains a gui written in pygtk for decrypting mounting umount and encrypting partitions or container files and it supports partitions created with truecrypt see for details and luks

224740
hash	md5
checked all package file md5 hash using debsums

224750
xfce	gnome
xfce developers closed the bug report so i assume that according to xfce developers you are not supposed to have gnome and xfce installed on the same system

224761
move	drag
i use an apple magic trackpad and it is pretty good for that though it has one annoying glitch in that double-tap and drag for example to move a window is erratic

i installed linux ubuntu 12.10 on it

224820
cpu	processors
other system information that may be relevant the processors is intel core2 duo cpu e4500 2.20ghz ã 2 and the system has 994.9mb of memory

224838
disk	ram
the data in tmpfs is stored in ram backed up by the swap space so it is likely the data had never been written to disk in the first place so there s basically nothing to recover

224844
chown	mkdir
remove all desktop configuration such as mv home user home user.old mkdir home user chown user home user reboot

224858
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
if you wish to skip a versioning you can backup your data and do a fresh installation or progressively upgrade to each

224858
versioning	upgrade
however it does seem that liveusbs can upgrade multiple versioning

224881
cifs	smb

i did finally get it to work and wrote a blog post titled facebook youtube linkedin and other css and javascript files from cdns not loading on ubuntu that explains the process i went through and things i tried

224958

if you installed linux-headers matching your running kernel versioning only for example linux-headers-3.5.0-18 then they will not be upgrade

ubuntu	linux
one of the things that make linux ubuntu more secure is the requirement to have a username and password by default so that not just any rogue trojan or user on the other side of the world can install programs on your computer

225107
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu i can run this exact same program it s not a linux version of the program it s really the same program located on my windows partition that i can run from ubuntu

225143

i consider myself fairly avid with ubuntu and linux but this one has me stumped

225157
debian	linux	debian	mint
i had the same problem running mate desktop on a linux mint debian edition 201204

225177
ubuntu	debian
if the .iso is a hybrid mode image like most ubuntu and debian images these days have no idea about arch then you can just write it directly to the usb just as if it was a cd-rom drive

225177
ubuntu	linux
if the .iso is not a hybrid mode image then you can use unetbootin available from ubuntu s repositories which is an easy way to burn an iso for a linux distro to a usb key converting its filesystem to be compatible

225193

another option native to ubuntu is to install adobe reader for linux

225221
geany	gedit
gedit is simple and lightweight yes but does it have any actual advantages over geany

225221
geany	gedit
gedit can bundle a python interpreter but geany bundles an entire virtual terminal

225342
google-chrome	firefox
i m using google-chrome as default web-browser because i need flash ang i ve installed firefox back to use with webapps because chromium that i tried to use before launched through script taking pepper flash from google-chrome isn t working correctly webapps are crashing clicking on their icons in launcher or in messaging menu does nothing and by clicking on web-links from the other applications opens new clean chromium window

225342
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried to fix it and got only half-result as i m telling here so chromium was purged google-chrome became default browser again and firefox was installed for webapps purposes

225357
versioning	upgrade
open a terminal ctrl + alt + t and apply the commands below to upgrade the intel driver to the latest versioning

225374
xfce	gnome
xubuntu is based on the xfce window manager which is lighter than gnome unity

225376
sudo	passwd
so if i disable my root account with sudo passwd -dl root i still have access to or conceptually how are the elavated rights different from the root account

225394
sudo	passwd
sudo changes your user id to root without regard for whether or not the root account has a passwd

225399
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
however sudo works in a different way roughly it has a list of users that are allowed to run sudo the users in this list are called sudoers and by default asks for the passwd of the user has launched sudo

225399
sudo	passwd
this is why using sudo you can log in into root even if root doesn t have a passwd

225433
ati	nvidia
for nvidia and ati use the proprietary drivers

225433
ubuntu	linux
if you download the game from the ubuntu software center or from the official site for linux there is no need to do some of the following steps mentioned here since they will be done for you

225433
ati	nvidia
when playing minecraft my video card nvidia or ati starts heating up and the fan speed goes up cpu usage goes to 100

225433
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse are not responding while playing minecraft

225433
ati	nvidia
remember to install the proprietary drivers for your ati or nvidia video card

225433
ati	nvidia
i have left the option for sun as the last alternative not because of the open source closed source issue but because the fact that i have installed minecraft in over 50 pcs ranging from nvidia ati or intel video cards to pentium 2 athlon xp and core i7 using only openjdk from the 1.2.5 up to the 1.4.5 version

225445

i am trying to play various formats on smplayer but none of them have sound mp4 mp3 flash videos after download from youtube wav

225448
versioning	upgrade
if your system has not already asked if you would like to upgrade you can run software sources switch to updates tab and make sure that notify me of a new ubuntu versioning is followed by for any versioning

225448
versioning	upgrade
using a live cd usb for this purpose for such an upgrade might be the second option while a fresh install can also be considered as a third option to replace the current ubuntu versioning for example

225473
folder	directory
for example i always create in my home folder the directory mc and put inside of it the minecraft_server.jar file

225484
mouse	joystick
qjoypad takes input from a gamepad or joystick and translates it into key strokes or mouse actions letting you control any xwindows program with your game controller

225484
joystick	keyboard
very often in your game itself the setting should be set to keyboard and not joystick

225519
cinnamon	gnome
i just installed gnome and cinnamon but i am still using unity

225574
installation	upgrade
follow the installation instructions as written on the bios upgrade page

225593

copying everything on your directory is easily done if you have an external hard-drive large enough though it may be slow depending on the amount you have to copy i m not familiar with software which does it automatically but from my experience i ve found copying and pasting the contents onto a hard-drive into folder named c and d was usually enough for me

225700

i have set firefox as the default browser and disabled that in google-chrome but the latter keeps opening the links in office writer for example

225731

there is no way to say when the driver will be available but it will need xserver 1.13 and linux kernel 3.5 which are included since ubuntu 12.10

225744

my laptop specs is 8gb of ram i5-acer aspire-5750-6684 1tb harddrive 700gb for c windows7homepremium and another d 300 is for backups installer etc. this is the disk part where i cut the 42.50gb that became free space

225766
disk	ram
also it s recommended that the swap space is twice the amount of physical memory ram depending upon the amount of hard disk space available for the system although this recommendation dates back from a time when physical ram was very expensive and most unix systems ran with many processes in swap space - a situation that hardly applies in most situations these days but ancient unix linux myths like this recommendation tend to survive well past their use by dates

225766
disk	ram
low ram and low disk space with 512 mib ram and 30 gb hard disk use 512 mib for swap since ram is very low

225766
disk	ram
low ram and high disk space with 512 mib ram and 100 gb hard disk use 1 gib for swap since ram is very low and hard disk space is plentiful

having numbers and upper-case characters or any other ascii character for that matter has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not sudo will be able to handle your passwd

in brief if you copy your linux kernel and initial ram disk file to the root directory of the esp or a subdirectory of efi on the esp and place a refind_linux.conf file with your kernel options in the same directory refind will be able to launch the kernel directly

the above command will open nautilus in the folder home myuser some long path to a directory the period is the current directory

and then you can add more directory to the stack so you get a directory listing as below which includes 3 designated folder and your home folder

226771
folder	directory
if you have exactly the stack arrangement as the above directory listing shows pushd +3 switches you to the specific pictures folder and places that on top of the stack it is +3 and not +4 as you do not count your in the directory stack

226771
folder	directory
you can keep on doing this without removing them from the stack although any folder you cd to other than those added to the directory stack with pushd will alter your directory stack

226771

once you have the directory stack arranged in the order you want you can use popd to quickly cycle through the directory and then return to the home folder

sudo	passwd
i haven t tried this before so its just a guess but you would type either sudo passwd guest or passwd guest

227310
chmod	sudoers
then again chmod 440 etc sudoers to set proper permissions for sudoers file

227310
sudoers	visudo
i will not recommend this if you dont have enough experience with linux but you always have an option to re-install the sudo package with apt-get install --reinstall sudo while logged in as root in recovery mode and then configure the sudoers file with visudo editor only

227310
sudoers	visudo
as a final note and warning you have to edit the file with only visudo etc sudoers as root and after you are finished editing the file set proper permissions for it 440

227378
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
technically a system which has been upgrade from a beta to a final release should be identical to a system on which the final versioning was installed from installation medium so any bugs should affect both systems equally

227378

at least this worked fine for me during the 12.10 development cycle - maybe one trick is to make sure you upgrade your system often so there s no large gap between packages versioning

if you are using sudo for some gui programs you can try gksudo which gives you a gui to enter passwd which atleast shows how much characters you have typed just like any other passwd field

228069
ubuntu	linux
you are only disabling the part that creates the most problem between windows and linux which is the one that prevents ubuntu from booting correctly

228094

this is ascribed to the lack of driver support for x server 1.13 that comes with the ubuntu upgrade forcing people to use open source drivers or downgrade to previous versioning of x server

usually the password is hash with a salt making very difficult to brute force it

sudo	passwd
another thing to notice is that root does not have passwd but instead your username has sudo privileges meaning that you can become root by executing sudo su command from terminal

228283
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade versioning using ubuntu 12.04

228287
wan	lan
i would suggest that you set up your squid proxy machine to have multiple ip addresses on the wan facing side - one corresponding to each of your 5 client machines on the lan say 192.168.0.3 192.168.0.4 192.168.0.5 192.168.0.6 and 192.168.0.7

228287
wan	lan
you then set up a squid acl and tcp_outgoing_address rule as described here to map your internal client lan addreses to one of the wan facing ip addresses on squid 10.10.10.1 maps to 192.168.0.3 10.10.10.2 maps 192.168.0.4 etc

228295
bash	zsh
i m using zsh but bash behaves the same way

228296
sudo	passwd
for example will allow me to run sudo for the kill and killall commands as root without asking for a passwd

228309

that is a firefox clone would be to firefox what google-chrome and srware iron are to chromium - almost identical but able to run separately in parallel .

228314
folder	directory
you have to do ctrl + h while in the home directory to be able to see .mozilla folder

228320

228564
kde	kubuntu
the developer kmix for kde 4.8 - so it should work with the kubuntu 12.10

steam for linux and steambox might change that and i sincerely hope they will but for now you ll be much better of with ubuntu and windows dualboot

228572

you should now have a â œrtl8192ce_ â folder in your home directory

228629
ubuntu	linux
will ubuntu 12.04.1 include the new linux kernel

228646
ubuntu	linux
what differentiates the ubuntu kernel from the upstream linux kernel

228646
ubuntu	linux
with every ubuntu kernel release we attempt to remain as true to the upstream linux kernel as possible

228646
ubuntu	linux
however there are inevitable patches which we carry on top of the upstream linux kernel which differentiates the ubuntu kernel from the upstream linux kernel

228646
versioning	upgrade
moreover as it can be observed you ll stay on 3.2.0 unless you upgrade - you ll get updates and backports for this versioning only

228669
sudo	passwd
how can sudo command autofill the passwd from echo command or a file

228675
sudo	passwd
suppose we want to execute the command sudo shutdown -h 1 but we do not want to type in the passwd

228675
sudo	passwd
echo passwd | sudo -s shutdown -h1

228675
sudo	passwd
the first sudo the one with the -s parameter will grab the passwd from the standard input in this case the keyboard in the terminal

228675
sudo	passwd
so the rest of the sudo commands will not need to be provided another passwd until the session closes until you close the terminal or script using the passwd ends

228676
sudo	passwd
it s better to change sudo rules instead storing clear passwd in a text file

228699
folder	directory
make an empty folder in his home directory of laptop 1 perhaps called copies. br

228699
folder	directory
this mounts the home directory of joebloggs on laptop 2 inside the folder called copies on laptop 1 using ssh over the internet. br

228706
kde	gnome
gnome open file dialog used in ubuntu doesn t support this feature however the file open dialog used in kde is able to open http urls

if either are missing you need to look for them as chkdsk will often recover corrupted files directory to hidden folder named found.000 found.001 etc

228747
kde	kubuntu
i m using kde 4.9.4 on kubuntu 12.04

228749

228818

the best office suite on ubuntu and other linux distributions too is libreoffice

228849
pull	push
i also assuming that it is best for the indicator to check the state of something rather than for something to tell the indicator the state push vs pull

228863
pull	push
regarding push vs pull - it is definitely better when your application receives a notification when something happens push instead of checking if something happened every second pull - are we there yet

228876

229074
ubuntu	linux
antivirus applications are unnecessary for ubuntu or linux in general

229074

i do not personally know anyone who runs ubuntu linux and uses an antivirus program and know no one who has ever had an issue

229083

folder	directory
i gave the folder in var www necessary permissions 770 for the mentioned folder since www-data is added to root group and apache has to write to this directory that is upload directory

229232
disk	ram
check if var www isn t on a tmpfs that s like a ram disk files are not saved to disk but kept in memory and so will disappear on reboot

yeah its possible to run android apps in ubuntu .there are many implementation plans from folks across the globe as to how it can be done.according to my research to make android apps run on a tablet pc having debian linux ubuntu knoppix fedora etc as baseline system we need to first get the dvm source code compile run on the machine using gnu c compiler then the libraries has to be compiled into the machine

229427
chgrp	chmod
i haven t tried this and it may not be the best way to do it but if it doesn t work you should be able to go back using chgrp and chmod

229463

229469
versioning	upgrade
1 reinstall system aka upgrade to the same versioning

it s a good idea to use a hex editor as this is a binary file

229656
ubuntu	linux
if you are a basic user of linux ubuntu then i suggest you to choose software centre not synaptic

229663

if you need to check on why and what version it will be downgrade to check this with apt-cache policy packagename to see what versions are available and what apt decides is the candidate for installation

although debian s policies are not mandatory for an ubuntu ppa it s a good idea to follow them they illustrate best practice for working with debian packaging tools

229758
debian	linux
the sophisticated maturation of a computing system environment debian gnu linux ... requires a high degree of comparable rigorous discipline to retain and modify functionality consistently

229770

you don t want to upgrade to the latest release versioning upstream

there are tools like lvm and mdadm that should let you do something similar use two partitions as the same mountpoint either mirrored or stripped

xfce	gnome
this is a good question as xubuntu and lubuntu don t have the same system settings color menu that the standard ubuntu has and installing gnome-color-manager does not allow you to set the profiles in a xubuntu or xfce session as you you can only use that utility properly when running a gnome session as it depends on gnome-settings-daemon and gnome-control-center

236516
kde	gnome
in a gnome or kde session which you could be running on xubuntu you should be able to use colormgr to enter colormgr get-devices-by-kind display and set the icc profile for the display manually so for completeness i present this method

on 12.04 precise however there are dependency problems with installing the opus codecs and tools so i have found by far the best solution is the one that has become available very recently compile the opus audio encoder and decoder as noted here and build ffmpeg with opus support by adding --enable-opus to the configure options of ffmpeg as listed on the compilation guide

239356
ffmpeg	libav	decoder	encoder
i know that ffmpeg is deprecated in ubuntu in favour of libav but compiling is a good way to get a fully functioning opus encoder decoder integrated into ffmpeg itself

239356

it is necessary to remove any existing libav ffmpeg x264 libvpx or fdk-aac packages before you start compiling

239356
ffmpeg	libvpx
it is critical that you compile and install x264 fdk-aac libvpx and opus before you build ffmpeg as those libraries will be used in the build

if for any reason you have compiled ffmpeg or libav as i have done and now the key encoders decoders are in the usr local hierarchy you will need to run the program with a wrapper script or it will not find the libraries

make sure you re comparing against the right md5 hash

239868
hash	md5
the first thing to do when your md5 sum is wrong-- especially if it s wrong after you download the file again--is to make sure you re comparing it against the md5 hash for the correct file

239868
hash	md5
you have an 12.04 lts image and you re using an md5 hash for a 12.04.1 lts image

cpu	hyperthreading
my understanding so far has been that different cores within the same physical cpu would have different core id and if core id s are identical this is due to hyperthreading

so one should interpret this proc cpuinfo entry as a 4-core cpu with hyperthreading

ubuntu doesn t have an equivalent but many ubuntu developers are also debian developers and all our developer s pgp keys are available on their profiles in launchpad

240313
ethernet	wireless
edit ethernet works now wireless driver installed but not functioning

240353
ethernet	wireless
so there is no need to use a ethernet wired connection except in the case that the wireless card needs proprietary drivers not detected or installed during installation in which case you need a wired cable connection to download all updates and drivers for your wireless card and anything missing for it before disconnecting the cable and using the wireless card

240386
cpu	processors
taking a look at system monitor i can see that all four cpu threads talking about a i5-3210m dual-core processors are nearly equally stressed so the above mentioned 16 and 80 cpu usage is distributed among the threads

folder	directory
you should keep all your own files within the tree of your home directory that makes backups easier - there you will have full permissions to create folder documents etc

240548
folder	directory
you have default permissions to write and create folder in your home directory

240548

if you are having problems writing to your home directory or creating folder in them then it might indicate that there is a permissions problem which needs to be addressed

240564
ethernet	wireless
typically for a machine with a single ethernet card and or a single wireless card the ethernet is eth0 and the wireless is wlan0

240564
wan	lan
if you re using a machine on the lan to do this just connecting from the lan to your router s wan ip this is only supported for some routers

240564
wan	lan
after all a router s job is to route traffic between the wan and lan sides not to route traffic from one side to itself

240564
wan	lan
support for connecting to forwarded ports on the wan ip from inside the lan is actually the exception rather than the rule though many home office routers do have this feature

240564
wan	subnet
if it doesn t go to your router s setup page and check its wan ip and wan subnet mask then statically assign an ip address to the switch-connected machine that is within the same subnet

240564
wan	lan
and don t use this if the wan side of your router is an office lan without consulting your network administrator first

240564
wan	subnet
your router probably gets its connection information--ip address subnet mask the ip address of the gateway router on the wan that it uses when it doesn t know where to send something and information about dns servers--from your isp via dhcp through the cable dsl isdn modem

240564
wan	lan
since inserting a test machine between your router s wan interface and the internet above is highly involved--and since it will show a port as accessible even if it s inaccessible due to being blocked by your isp which is also true of connecting to the router s wan ip from the lan side --it s usually better to use a web-based port scanning service

240564
wan	lan
forwarding port 55757 on the wan to port 22 on the lan machine should make things work out fine but perhaps somewhere the server the client something is assuming the port number is the same from the server and client s perspective

i am trying to upgrade my ubuntu 12.04 to linux kernel 3.6.9 as described here

240646
ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu is based on debian could i the debian testing repo to my software sources and make my ubuntu a rolling release

240651
ubuntu	debian
regular ubuntu releases are based on debian unstable and some vanilla debian packages are incompatible with ubuntu and vise-versa

240654
ubuntu	debian
you can add debian s software sources in ubuntu the same way you add them in debian

240654
ubuntu	debian
this will not give you the same software that will appear in ubuntu 13.04 in the future because ubuntu s packages are specially built for ubuntu incorporate some changes compared to the debian versions and because your package versions would almost always be ahead of the ones in ubuntu especially on ubuntu 13.04 s release date which would take place well after a freeze on the introduction of new features

240654
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu s packages are not identical to the packages in debian and you cannot get the same exact packages through an official debian software source that you get through an official ubuntu software source

240654
ubuntu	debian
if you added debian s experimental software sources to your ubuntu system they would almost always have higher-versioned packages than provided by the ubuntu software sources since most ubuntu packages come from debian

240654
versioning	upgrade
consequently all the software in your system would be upgrade to the debian experimental versioning

240654
ubuntu	debian
however if it succeeded the result would be a debian experimental system that happens to have some ubuntu repositories enabled but providing almost no software

240654
ubuntu	debian
you mentioned that you don t need unity and stuff. by and stuff i presume you mean other packages present in ubuntu but not debian

240654
ubuntu	debian
since you don t need any ubuntu packages and you re interested in using a system where all the packages are provided by debian s official software sources it sounds like what you really want to do is use debian

240654
ubuntu	debian
debian like ubuntu is an excellent operating system

240654
ubuntu	debian
but please don t try to upgrade an ubuntu system to debian

240654
ubuntu	debian
in contrast there s not much value to making a broken debian system out of an ubuntu system

240654
ubuntu	debian
if you want to use the latest development packages for ubuntu 13.04 before it comes out then instead of using debian s experimental software sources you should test 13.04

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
windows can read and write to ntfs and fat with some support for other filesystems if you install the appropriate software

243990

so that means that out-of-the-box windows and ubuntu only have ntfs and fat as filesystems in common

244055
bluetooth	usb
first the bluetooth radio on the mbp is a usb device

244055
hid	keyboard
for example when your using your bluetooth keyboard in the grub menu that is hid mode

244055
hid	keyboard
also in hid mode i had a hard time with function keys and media keys on this keyboard they are the same key and it can be toggled by software

244055
ubuntu	linux
finally linux ubuntu bluez or someone seems to think that all bluetooth controllers should act in hci mode

244055
hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
this is probably a very sane default given that even this keyboard is very limited in hid mode and that anything beyond a simple mouse and keyboard for example a cell phone or head set would require hci mode

244055
hid	keyboard
if you shutdown and wait for the connection to time out the keyboard will work again in hid mode

244055
hid	keyboard
at this point your keyboard should work just fine in linux and even sends signals to a hid controller when the laptop is asleep

244055
hid	keyboard
so the keyboard starts in hid mode

244055
hid	keyboard
when rebooting the keyboard will still be trying to communicate in hci mode but the laptop will only be looking for hid devices

244075
sudo	passwd
ctrl+alt+f1 -- sudo passwd changed my passwd --

244099
titlebar	window
there is a setting that allows it to use native window titlebars but this isn t the most elegant solution to the problem because you lose the benefit when windowed of chrome not having extra space for the titlebar

244119
folder	directory
i tried to open this file in each of the process id directory inside the proc folder

244128
ubuntu	linux
i ve switched back to ubuntu linux full time from windows and coming from fireworks cs 6 macromedia fireworks 8 has all the things i need

244134
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
i have edited my etc sudoers to successfully stop myself from having to enter a passwd for sudo but i still have to enter a passwd to do gui-based things like opening synaptic or clicking unlock in the user accounts app

244149
sudo	passwd
on my system this also means that gksu will not prompt for passwd as it is using sudo for the root privilege escalation

244165
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux and just installed ubuntu last night as a dual boot with windows 7

244168
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m running linux mint so i was unsure whether to post this in ask ubuntu or the general unix stackexchange

244169
kde	cinnamon
i think you were looking at a very old or mixed up sources as cinnamon is quite new thing while this has been obsoleted since the release of kde 4 in 2008

244191
mouse	trackpad
a normal laptop trackpad acts more like a mouse only providing direction speed and acceleration information

244250
geany	gedit
but you could replace gedit with any other texteditor or even a bit more of a ide like geany or eclipse among many others

244329
ubuntu	linux
if i boot into uefi mode i can t boot into any os whether it is the installed windows 7 or ubuntu or any other linux dvd

244343
ubuntu	linux
do the job manually from linux back up boot efi efi microsoft boot bootmgfw.efi i recommend moving it down one level to boot efi efi microsoft bootmgfw.efi rather than renaming it to bootmgfw.efi.bkp since the latter is non-standard and makes tools other than boot repair and ubuntu s grub unable to locate it

244343
debian	linux
disable secure boot then boot to linux and install my refind boot manager by using the debian package

244361
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu and many other distributions try to setup software according to the filesystem hierarchy standard fhs

244385
post	get
at least try following a tutorial until you get stuck and then post here to tell us which tutorial you were following and where you got stuck

244387
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 11.04 2.6.38-15-generic #66-ubuntu smp x86_64 gnu linux

244403
sudo	passwd
this will trigger a passwd prompt and after you ve correctly entered your passwd the command following sudo in this case apt-get install python-tk will be run under administrative privileges

244410
folder	directory
this also depends on the umask settings of both your user account and the webserver you need to make sure that files created in folder have group rw access and directory created within need group rwx

244414
width	height
sure now i can drag a window to the left or right and it will occupy the full vertical height and half the horizontal width but what about sideways maximisation or vertical max

244434
folder	directory
however it only renames files in the root directory of the folder

244434
folder	directory
how do i make it rename the files with underscores to spaces recursively on all of the files and folder within that directory

244438
kde	gnome
i have option to choose unity gnome kde unity-2d all of them restarts x11

244449
vmware	virtualbox
you could also shrink your osx partition and use refit but if this is your first time with ubuntu and you want to just try it i would stick with virtualbox or if you have it vmware

244504
ubuntu	linux
now the update-grub script will automatically add all the linux installations it can find to the grub menu - in your case it would be ubuntu and xubuntu

244504
sudo	passwd
type in sudo gedit etc default grub press enter type your passwd and press enter again

244507
hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
i think i screwed something up in a hid library when trying to install a ps3 controller not long ago as the ps3 controller never worked right and now when i try to connect an xbox 360 controller the mouse cursor jumps to the top-left corner of the screen and neither it nor the keyboard will respond

244557
kde	gnome
normally i use gnome not unity but after installation of kde i see that the rendering was changed

244560
ubuntu	mint
i ve tried downloading ubuntu direct to a partition and the live usb trial from ubuntu and ubuntu mint but get the same result

244575
hide	show
regx for multiple line is not supported bust you can use - and + to hide show portion of text such as functions ...

244593
ubuntu	linux
not low profile windows did not suspend reconnect properly but the driver is now in the kernel it worked flawlessly with ubuntu linux

244597
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs directory junctions are a lot like symbolic links in ext4 and other unix-style filesystems

244597
folder	directory
if a directory c foo contains a directory qux which contains a junction bar pointing to d baz and you recursively delete foo or qux for example by shift + delete ing the folder in windows explorer d baz and everything contained within it gets deleted

244597
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs-3g ubuntu s ntfs filesystems driver is compatible with them though they re treated like unix-style symbolic links which means they behave a bit differently than on windows

244601
folder	directory
did you set your directory as shared folder

244604
jobs	cron
that will add the line to your cron jobs but typically i call the script by adding it in a line to etc init.d rc.local though i like riccardo s suggestion of adding it to .gnomerc

244640
sudo	passwd
i created my user with sudo useradd rashmi then set its passwd using sudo passwd rashmi

244657
sudo	passwd
instead run the sudo adduser username command which will prompt for extra information including passwd full name etc

244659
ubuntu	linux
i am having numerous problems with linux os and ubuntu recognizing printers

244781
ubuntu	linux
i have a ssd 80 gigs disk which i want to use for ubuntu 12.10 installation and some programs like libre office and firefox but the new steam linux and games would fill up my ssd quickly

244793
filesystems	ntfs
i m currently storing the sub-folders of my home documents music on an ntfs filesystems and it appears to be working fine a few months in

244793
folder	directory
now delete the documents directory and create a link to that ntfs folder in its place named documents ln -s mnt winblows users username documents documents

244805
ubuntu	linux
edit looks like there s a documented bug in ubuntu linux the driver

244811
chown	sudo
sudo chown .xauthority

244822
ubuntu	linux
i have done these tasks many times on ubuntu linux instances running in the aws ec2 without any problems

244824
mouse	keyboard
2.4g keyboard mouse id 10 slave pointer 2

244824
mouse	keyboard
2.4g keyboard mouse id 9 slave keyboard 3

244902
ubuntu	linux
see the refind documentation and my web page on efi-mode linux installations on macs for more details -- but be aware that the latter page hasn t been updated for ubuntu 12.10 and some details are actually simpler with 12.10

244918
spaces	delimiter
a spaces character is the default delimiter for input into lists

244924
filesystems	ntfs
my filesystems now has a ntfs partition with all my data which i now would like to convert to ext4 a ext4 partition with lubuntu on it and a swap partition

244934
filesystems	ntfs
i have a primary 80gb hdd which is partitioned into 3 drives core data extended with windows xp installed in the c drive core - with ntfs filesystems

244934
ubuntu	linux
i have a secondary 500gb hdd which is partitioned by ubuntu 12.10 into 2 drives seen in linux only ext4 file system

244973
kde	gnome
if you happened to have kde installed too and it happened there as well even when no gnome login had taken place since reboot then xserver-xorg-input-mouse which provides mouse input functionality to the gui might potentially make more sense

244987
ubuntu	linux
i am new to ubuntu and linux and i want to install and use the newest version of the screenwriting software celtx on ubuntu 12.04 lts

244993
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
ok did this using linux mint so should also work with ubuntu

245002
folder	directory
if you add the to the end of the directory rsync will start to copy put files from this point on but if you omit the then rsync will copy the folder itself and onward

245035
ubuntu	linux
my linux os is ubuntu 12.10 64 bits

245059
ubuntu	linux
i was wondering if anyone has experience running ubuntu or any other linux on intel s nuc computers

245059
ubuntu	linux
and what about thunderbolt support in ubuntu linux

245067
ubuntu	linux
since intel s nuc devices basically uses intel core i3 processors which are well supported by linux and ubuntu ubuntu should be ok on these devices

245067
ubuntu	linux
microsoft s windows 7 and windows 8 is supported as is the ubuntu linux distribution meaning most users are catered for

245077
sudo	passwd
have a look at your etc passwd file with more etc passwd|grep varun and at your etc shadow file with sudo more etc shadow|grep varun

245083
ubuntu	linux
linux and thus ubuntu is a complete other ballgame

245083
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu will install the native driver and after installing show you drivers it has in its arsenal that are provided by 3rd party manufacturers

245103
ubuntu	mint
i ve been using ubuntu and mint for almost two years since ubuntu 11.04 to be exact and yesterday i decided to try some compiz effects for a first time never actually bothered about that

245115
folder	directory
the files in the new home directory are copied from the etc skel folder

245127
ubuntu	mint
my case is this those combinations just don t exist under ubuntu or mint tried both instead all other fn combinations work properly or at least they generate a code for the combination in easystroke when adding new action selecting key then pressing desired fn combination you get for example xf86webcam

245128
ubuntu	linux
still new with linux and running ubuntu 12.10

245138
ubuntu	debian
in ubuntu and debian this is configured in the file etc network interfaces assuming you re not running networkmanager

245138
bonjour	avahi
mdns is implemented using avahi in linux and is called bonjour on apple devices

245153
put	get
to get a file to execute at start up you essentially want to put the .desktop in

245174
daemons	systemd
daemons ideal for servers embedded systemd and headless use

245178
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	debian	centos
this is debian ubuntu specific as most other distributions like centos redhat fedora suse build the kernel with these modules built-in

245178
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu you ll always have to load these modules yourself unfortunately

245199
cpu	processors
i m using an acer aspire running ubuntu 12.10 64-bit with 8gb of ram and an intelâ coreâ i5-2450m cpu 2.50ghz ã 4 processors

245216
installation	upgrade
during the upgrade process all of the accounts except the one i created on installation were lost and had to be recovered

245226
sudo	passwd
if you are logged into an administrator type account you can become this root user with the sudo command in a terminal and you are able to type in your passwd in order to install software make system changes etc

245240
ubuntu	linux
that means until someone makes it possible to change alsa sample format and sample frequency on recent 2012 2013 ubuntu distros as you can change pulse s audio on linux just sucks like hell

245243
ubuntu	linux
is ubuntu for phone a pure linux device like the desktop distribution or will it run on java like android

245247
ubuntu	linux
i ve just installed ubuntu and am new to linux

245262
sudo	passwd
pkexec prompts for a passwd graphically even if it is run from a terminal this is one of the ways its behavior is more similar to gksudo than to running straight sudo

245262
sudo	passwd
but when you run a command as username with sudo you enter your passwd

245262
sudo	passwd
this is ok though as they need the administrator s passwd to run commands as the administrator. that is a limited user can use su to run sudo to run a command as root

245262
sudo	passwd
unless you have reconfigured sudo to let it succeed without a passwd it will fail

245262
sudo	passwd
can t a program that shouldn t be run as root piggyback on a recent sudo command so no passwd is required

245262
sudo	passwd
in one terminal tab and authenticate successfully sudo in another tab or run by an unrelated gui program or that i run from a virtual console or ssh session will still prompt for a passwd

245262
sudo	passwd
also just as potentially a malicious program could watch what someone types when they run sudo or su or create a fake sudo su passwd prompt potentially a malicious program could create a fake login screen too

245265
installation	upgrade
all other upgrade are basically a new installation but without erasing our home directory

245272
ubuntu	linux
while installing the office 2010 on linux ubuntu i received the error message that

245274
filesystems	ntfs
i m unable to mount one of ntfs filesystems drive since the system got turned of while copying few files to this drive

245277
filesystems	ntfs
because ntfs is basically a windows filesystems many of the tools assume a windows system is available

245311
cpu	processors
i just upgraded my cpu mobo to an asrock 880gm-lefx and amd fx tm -8350 eight-core processors

245335
ubuntu	linux
ps my suggestion for you install ubuntu 12.10 server comes with no gui and then install the gui separately if you know even a little linux this should be sufficient.

245342
ubuntu	linux
i m still beginner and wanna learn more for linux especially ubuntu

245349
ubuntu	linux
it s not supported in the stable ubuntu linux kernels at the time of writing

245349
ubuntu	linux
please also open a bug on the ubuntu bugtracker against the linux package to get support for this backported in the quantal release kernel

245350
ubuntu	linux
there seems to be a number of different ways in a linux os such as ubuntu 11.10 server edition to make something like this happen

245367
hide	show
previous versions of ubuntu hide the menu where you can select your interface in a little square icon which show the gui s logo which by default is an ubuntu logo for unity

245410
mouse	keyboard
upon rebooting the system including the mouse and keyboard freezes after the ubuntu logo

245423
post	get
to get the grub menu to show up just short-press the shift key several times after your bios post messages you might be able to see the loading grub.

245439
versioning	upgrade
nothing worked except upgrade the kernel to the 3.7.2 versioning

245483
ubuntu	debian
so the problem is only in the release from ubuntu debian repository not from mozillas own release of firefox

245499
ubuntu	linux
i made a tutorial where i describe the installation of canon pixma mx715 in linux ubuntu scanner + printer

245503
vmware	virtualbox
i think the best option is to install with vmware or virtualbox in windows

245507
children	parent
ideally it d allow for nested subtasks have a percent complete with parent items showing their percent based on the percents of their children have a bargraph beside all tasks subtask or not .

245518
switching	screens
every time i boot i am met with a low resolution login screens which is fine but when i enter my password to boot into the desktop environment i m met with a no signal message on the screens and i have to physically switching the connector port

245519

should i wire the pc to the router on the wan port or the lan port

245525
ethernet	wireless
as mentioned on the net for extending ethernet through an ap on an existing wireless network

245557
ubuntu	openbsd
also since i migrated from a openbsd bind9 to ubuntu bind9 my files structure is a slightly different as i only have a single named configuration file

245562
ethernet	wireless
alternatively the wireless access point could use an ethernet cable attached to the notebook s wired ethernet but it s not necessary

245565
put	get
to recover the grub i have done is to use a recovery disk windows without making any kind of handle on the machine just put my disc i say start my machine continue to windows 8 and went directly to grub but if i happen to get linux sometime i lose the boot

245569
post	get
to get bukkit latest beta version as of post date

245654
uptime	reboot
the first field of the output is the time in seconds since the system was last reboot which is much easier to parse than the output of uptime

245656
kde	kubuntu
the kubuntu kde kde 4.8 or later default mixer is supporting per-application volume control with the applications that support the mpris2

245670
ubuntu	linux
i dual-booted my mac with ubuntu and it was running fine i wen t out the office but continued to use it via vnc just to set up my environment this obviously caused a lot of updates that wanted me to restart my computer something i couldn t do as it would boot straight into mac unless someone selected linux on refit

245808
installation	upgrade
when i am using the ubuntu software updater to install or upgrade packages i can see a progress bar that shows how much of the installation is complete

245826
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i installed ubuntu 12.10 and my wireless card seem to have a lower performance compared to linux mint any edition - i mean it worked fine there

245843
gedit	nano
here s a quick walkthrough if you are not familiar with vi use nano or gedit

245844
for-loop	loops
i guess i should use the for-loop to both print to the files and count from 1 to 10 as it loops but i don t know how

245865
for-loop	loops
to do this with a for-loop you use loops counter to write the number

245912
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and ubuntu and wish to create a system that can boot both windows 7 for windows specific applications and ubuntu i wish to become familiar with linux and ubuntu for work

i want the dropbox folder to be automatically mirrored to a directory in the local machine as a backup to the backup

you don t want to open it up like that though so if it does fix it then chown the file to the user who is running jetty and chmod it back to 644

ubuntu	linux
keyboard backlighting works up until ubuntu linux is loaded aka it works in bios and grub

247216
versioning	upgrade
if you run the upgrade you will lose the option called unity 2d. ubuntu made some architectural changes from 12.04 to 12.10 one of which was consolidating the two versioning of unity into one codebase

247216
versioning	upgrade
you might want to try a livecd versioning of 12.10 to see how unity behaves before you run the upgrade because once you do upgrade there is no easy way to downgrade again

if i understand symbolic links basically you should see every file in var backup in your newly created folder in ubuntuone shared directory and also ubuntuone should see those files aand sync them yes

248029
folder	directory
remember once you have mounted the shared folder on ubuntu machine into your windows file system you can treat it as a local directory so all you need is software that keeps two local directory in sync

it is far more likely that you will get a clean working installation if you don t try to upgrade instead choose the option for a fresh installation that erases the hard disk

248306
filesystems	ntfs
if you prefer the more hacky way and want to run it only from your ntfs filesystems you should read on the following threads

248378
cinnamon	gnome
i ve also experienced when playing around with different flavors of gnome gnome 2 gnome 3 unity gnome shell cinnamon etc. that sometimes changes in one of them will have no effect on the others -- sometimes they will mess them up completely or cause a revert to the default upon next login

if you can t install ubuntu 10.04 in efi mode you can do it in bios mode and then switch to efi mode by setting up an efi boot loader for linux

i am new to ubuntu and confused about whether to use matlab windows version which i had a copy using wine or to install the linux version

248549
ubuntu	linux
i realize my system is pretty obscure but then again ubuntu desktop is pretty obscure in the grand scheme of things and i feel like many other linux users probably have purchased similar computers as they allow for customization and don t make you pay for a windows version that you will immediately uninstall

trying the linux utility multisystem might work better in creating ubuntu live usb with persistence

this is by design of the cifs smb protocol

248589

if you prefer to stick with cifs smb access then the only option i see is to make them one share

248600
filesystems	ntfs
you don t format a hard disk to a filesystems like ext4 or ntfs or fat32 you format partitions to those filesystems

248617
filesystems	hfs+
i don t know if hfs+ even has filesystems labels or how to change them if it does but that s the route i d try to follow

248628

i would suggest removing the nautilus extension and deleting all traces of dropbox in your home directory such as the .dropbox hidden folder

try one of the official derivatives of ubuntu with a different desktop environment lubuntu lxde powered kubuntu kde powered xubuntu xfce powered

248955
xfce	kde
while kde isn t as lightweight as xfce and lxde i think it runs pretty well on older hardware with 2gb memory by installing the kubuntu-low-fat-settings package

248960
filesystems	ntfs
4 among of them are of ntfs filesystems and partially occupied with data

ubuntu being a debian derivative is solidy built on apt

kde	gnome
what are these other things i see mentioned in the descriptions of programs such as kde gtk qt gnome gnome shell etc.

249154
kde	gnome
gnome and kde are desktop environments

249154
kde	gnome
gnome primarily uses the gtk+ toolkit while kde primarily uses the qt toolkit

249154
kde	gnome
there are applications designed for gnome or kde such as a settings menu or a default music player usually in the appropriate toolkit

249154
kde	gnome
unity uses many of the gnome utilities nautilus rhythmbox etc. so unity is more gnome than kde

249158

for example in my home directory the pictures downloads documents folder would all point to the ntfs parition

249209
sudo	passwd
most of the time when people report they cannot effectively enter their passwd for sudo in a terminal but can authenticate with it graphically at least some of the time it is because they don t realize that no placeholder characters like are supposed to appear

249209
sudo	passwd
here are some possible causes of sudo not accepting the passwd in the terminal even though you can enter it graphically to install software

249209
sudo	passwd
like when running sudo it s normal for you not to see anything happening as you enter your passwd

249209
sudo	passwd
you ll be prompted graphically for your passwd but sudo will be used under the hood.

249209
sudo	passwd
this could occur if there is a common problem preventing sudo and other different ways of asking for passwd on the command line from working right

249209
sudoers	passwd
for misconfigurations relating to unexplained passwd authentication failures check the defaults lines in etc sudoers by running

249209
sudo	passwd
if you see rootpw runaspw or targetpw this means sudo is not necessarily asking for your passwd

249209
sudoers	visudo
you can use pkexec less etc sudoers or open the file in an editor with pkexec visudo

249209
sudoers	visudo
if you find a problem in etc sudoers and know what has to be changed you can edit it using pkexec visudo

this problem occurs in firefox opera and chromium

249254

right click on a folder you want to use as your main public directory go to sharing options. a popup dialogue will appear that instructs you with install prompts for additional packages needed to properly run a home server install reboot repeat and allow folder sharing

249402
ubuntu	linux
some commands in ubuntu linux are not intended to be used by normal users only administrators

249408
folder	directory
depending on whether there might be folder in you downloads directory you might want to add -r to the chmod -command to make changes recurse into those directory for example

249447
versioning	upgrade	dpkg	apt
the next closest thing i can think of is to put a hold on foo at its current versioning which prevents foo from being upgrade unless dpkg is given the --force-hold option or unless apt overrides the hold

for the time being there is up to now no way to install ubuntu or any linux system for that matter on the ipad as easily as rooting an android

249462
ubuntu	linux
since a year and half ago in an article about linux running on ipad august 2011 there has been only small changes and steps to provide a final way of installing ubuntu to an ipad or any other mac hardware for that matter

249462
ubuntu	linux
since mac focuses on a specific type of hardware and works only on a small group of devices compared to linux on how open it is with hardware types it makes it even tougher to guarantee that the new system be it ubuntu or any other linux will actually work correctly with all the hardware every time

249496
mp3	flv
opening a terminal in a folder that contains a flv file called one one.flv and running this command ffmpeg -i one.flv one.mp3 the flv file is converted to mp3 with the same name and in the same location

it s strange that grub in ubuntu has failed to detect arch linux

249598
sudo	passwd
however by using sudo passwd root i can easily reset the root passwd by current user passwd

249614
sudo	passwd
first of all sudo executes commands as root so resetting the actual root passwd while accessing as root to begin with usually isn t a problem

249614
sudo	passwd
this assumes you don t have a setup that restricts user commands but allows them to sudo passwd .

249614
sudo	passwd
secondly in order to remotely infiltrate a pc through the use of sudo passwd you would have to a trick the user into giving you the user passwd one way or another which again gives sudo access just as well or b have physical access to the machine in which case remote probably isn t so true anymore

249629
ubuntu	linux
even if you did uninstall ubuntu from within ubuntu you would have no way to restore your windows boot without the windows repair cd which you could probably use right now to restore the windows bootloader or some other form of live linux os

google-chrome	firefox
on ubuntu this occurs in both firefox and google-chrome with and without extensions disabled

so the first thing you should do is to see in your cd if there are any folders named linux or ubuntu or even debian

249793
ubuntu	linux
now assuming that you don t have a cd for linux ubuntu the best way to install all drivers is to first install the os with a network cable connected to your computer so that it detects that networking internet devices automatically

249793
ubuntu	linux
of course you can install all this later on and configure your wireless connection later but as a person new to ubuntu or linux in general that would mean a very lot of work

if you re trying to upgrade to a different ubuntu versioning aka a release upgrade and usually the next release in the line of releases relative to your versioning of ubuntu you have to activate that manually

just get a flash drive or cd and put ubuntu which you can download here and insert teh flash drive etc into your laptop and you should be able to downlod it
