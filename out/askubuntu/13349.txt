dpkg	apt
so how can i tell whether the package was installed by dpkg or apt

887154
dpkg	apt
any package installed with apt is also installed with dpkg

887154
dpkg	apt
apt calculates dependencies and fetches the packages which are then unpacked and installed by dpkg

887160
dpkg	apt
compare the log of var log apt term.log which is the log file generated by apt and var log dpkg.log which is the log file generated by dpkg

887160
dpkg	apt
if you note a package name which can be found in var log dpkg.log but not in var log apt term.log it is very likely that you installed the package by dpkg that time

887160
dpkg	apt
please remember apt is a frontend for dpkg

887160
dpkg	apt
thus it is recommended to remove any package by apt rather than dpkg because apt will handle the dependency to remove those packages which will not be used by any other packages or mark them as not use anymore to let you remove them later

887162
dpkg	apt
when you run apt remove it starts dpkg to remove the package

because libraries used in ubuntu are upgrade each versioning you can t just install programs compiled for 16.04 to 14.04

889459

you must either upgrade to 16.04 upgrade all libraries at once or compile newer versioning of the programs in your 14.04 system manually

889459

this way the programs you wan t will be compiled against your old versioning libraries so you hopefully will not need to upgrade them unless programs do not compile because they do not support those old versioning anymore

folder	directory
instead of my normal carefree attitude of just having everything self contained and run inside a folder in my home directory this time i would like to broaden my horizon and actually try to utilize the linux directory structure as it was intended at least somewhat

891041
temp	tmp
depending on the purpose of those persistent files you might store temp data in user s .local share narf directory if that data is user-specific or use var cache narf or var tmp since it s supposed to be persistent according to wikipedia s breakdown for persistent data

891076
children	parent
children s child processes will have different parent pid thus if you have more than one level of function calls it will be difficult to trace all processes

891131
sudo	passwd
i also suspect your first code block didn t return anything because it got stuck at an interactive sudo passwd prompt

891131
sudo	passwd
i don t know anything about php or mininet but when i see your snippet above i wonder if the user account running the script has the ability to sudo without passwd

without nopasswd your service gets stuck waiting for myuser s passwd at a sudo attempt

ubuntu	linux
most of them are fine if you are using only ubuntu or any other linux system ecryptfs seems good but things become difficult if you require interoperability with other oses and mobile devices as most of us is expecting nowadays

891205
ubuntu	linux
ecryptfs works only on gnu linux systems like ubuntu but also chromeos and it s nice if you won t need to access your files from non-linux oses but people say there may be some problems with cloud sync tools

891276
versioning	upgrade
since most users hove no idea how to apply the patch they also release a new upstream versioning foo 1.2 and suggest everybody upgrade

891305
disk	ram
today that s normally overkill unless you want to suspend to disk in which case it should be at least as big as your ram

891305
disk	ram
if you don t want to suspend to disk half your ram size is probably adequate

891305
disk	ram
some people favor using no swap space at all but it does have its advantages even if you don t use all your ram for programs since the kernel can swap out less-used temporary data in favor of caches that can speed up disk access

891310
ubuntu	linux
i m brand new to linux in general and i m using ubuntu for context - i m assuming that matters for context

891311
versioning	upgrade
since ubuntu 16.04 and 16.04.1 use an older kernel you may need to upgrade to a newer kernel by using ubuntu 16.04.2 ubuntu 16.10 or even a pre-release versioning of ubuntu 17.04

891311
ubuntu	opensuse
if none of these versions work then you could try another distribution something unrelated to ubuntu -- fedora opensuse or arch might work

891311
ubuntu	mint
but don t bother with the likes of mint or elementaryos since they re based on ubuntu

891311
vmware	virtualbox
you could run ubuntu in a virtual machine virtualbox vmware etc. running under windows

now i m not sure if you ll be able to repair your system but booting an older versioning will probably work however you ll most likely will not be able to update your system anymore but if selecting an earlyer versioning works then you can try removing kali source running sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get check sudo apt-get upgrade and that could be able to repair your system however you should back up your data before attempting to fix it.

additional reference how to install kali linux tools in ubuntu 15.10

895547
ubuntu	linux
adding only the kali linux tools that you need manually is good training that teaches you how to use the other package management tools that are provided by the default ubuntu repositories and which are safer than katoolin because they don t add a long list of additional repositories to your software sources

895547
ubuntu	linux
if you have done what looks like irreparable damage to your system with katoolin i recommend that you remove all the kali linux repositories that you added from your software sources and with the help of the terminal history command remove all the packages that you installed with katoolin and start over again with vanilla ubuntu

i usually install gcc and g++ of the same version for inter-operability

897777

at this stage one will have two set of compilers oen each for g++ and gcc

the most likely cause is that the upgrade of chromium-browser failed for some reason and indeed apt-cache policy chromium-browser confirms that the installed versioning is not the newest one available

the simplest way to do this is to download the usb flash drive or cd-r image boot with it and then install the debian package or ppa once ubuntu has started

902966
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
first of all linux is just a kernel and an operating system like ubuntu debian etc is something more than that

902973
versioning	upgrade
most likely the existing versioning installed depends on something not available in 16.10 but if it can find the upgrade package from getdeb for yakkety hopefully it will be ok

902980
icmp	dhcp
if the subnets differs on the print server there would be a 24 255.255.255.0 netwok mask configured and on the clients there would be a 16 255.255.0.0 network mask - perhaps provided by the dhcp server this might cause a problem that clients won t be able to detect any shared printer on the server even if other communications between print server and clients would be possible icmp ssh and successful

902981
ubuntu	linux
both putty and linux terminal state that the ubuntu box is now using keyboard-interactive authentication and even with the correct username and password i am unable to login

902997
bash	tcsh
i don t know if this works in tcsh but it works in bash so might help other ubuntu users who mainly use bash

903002
ubuntu	debian
for example in ubuntu software packages end in .deb because ubuntu is a descendant of debian and uses debian s package format

i.e physical volume using the live versioning of ubuntu i get an error when i run e2fsck that says something along the lines of the selected parition is using an unknown meta-chsum upgrade your e2fsck

903270
wan	vlan	wan	lan
you do not need internet to ssh into another computer however both machines must be on the same lan vlan or at least connected to the same switch router even if that switch router has no wan internet connection

903284
hide	show
now i m planning to add a show hide desktop feature for swipe down similar to how some windows 10 touchpad drivers do it

903301
ubuntu	linux
go to your ubuntu linux installation plugin the usb flash drive

903331
ftp	telnet
you can verify that the machine s ip is blocked by testing specific services and ports such as ssh for port 22 ftp for port 21 or telnet 66.85.48.9 80 to test the default web page port

903336
switching	screens
the only solution i found out reading your answers is that if you unplug your hdmi logout login plug in the hdmi and switching to extended screens it will display correctly instead of streching one resolution on dual screens

903338
filesystems	btrfs
filesystems is btrfs

it only gives a message if it can not find a way to put the file impossible to get a hole or a different warning if it needs t fragment another file asking if authorised by user etc

i m reusing a usb keyboard mouse that were working on my previous computer so i doubt that they are the problem although it could still be some other hardware problem

903600
ethernet	wireless
then i installed ubuntu 16.04 and now i can connect via the wireless but not over ethernet

903623
disk	ram
i m used to wait less than one minute for this kind of hardware core 2 duo 2 1ghz 4gb ram 500gb plates disk

903624
sysv	systemd
you are at least one and likely two steps behind the curve sysv init was replaced by upstart and then by systemd

903674

this is one area where grub will work better than refind since ubuntu s grub and shim a program that most linux distributions use to cope with secure boot can work without modification with secure boot

kate	nano	kate	gedit	gedit	nano
use nano or kate or leafpad if you don t have the text editor gedit

next i d set ipv6 to ignore in network manager this example is for ethernet but you want wireless

if you dont want to install the linux which is what i am assuming you mean by how to run ubuntu on a flash stick

903820
mouse	keyboard
generally when you take your mouse pointer to the top left corner of the screen in gnome shell is triggers the activity view where we can manage open windows and work-spaces and it s a great way to multitask only using mouse while alt + tab requires you to use keyboard but the limitation is that it only works with non full screen apps

903820

this works in kde kubuntu that makes it possible to do

this should switch back gcc and g++ back to gcc5

for me on a default aws linux image amazon linux ami 2017.03.0 hvm i had to create the folder in the root dir as i could not assign the permissions if created under the default ec2-user

903885
ubuntu	linux
i m currently running ubuntu 16.04 but would like to install another linux distro by dual-boot

903923
filesystems	ntfs
to the second part of your question the answer is yes it will affect your files since modern linux distributions are using different filesystems apart from windows ntfs

903925
ubuntu	linux
i am a newbie in ubuntu linux system

903952
postfix	dovecot
i am creating one e-mail server in ubuntu 16.04 with postfix and dovecot

903957
disk	ram
what i ended up doing was i put as many of etc var usr and home into ramdisk as i could fit i had about 12 gb ram for that and rsynced back to disk with a cron-job each of the mounted parts so i would have a backup in case of power-failure

903957
disk	ram
i also created an unload to disk before shutdown reboot and a return copy to ram at boot using etc rc.local so the machine would always be able to reboot and lose nothing

clang	llvm
clang s runtime is the llvm openmp runtime which in turn is based on the intel openmp runtime which is open source

904022
folder	directory
that will show for all folder within the directory you are

904042
ubuntu	debian
it is based on the equivalent page on debian from which the ubuntu apache packaging is derived

904066
ubuntu	linux
once you have a supported os installed you ll still need additional software to run .exe files because those are dos windows executables and aren t directly compatible with ubuntu or any other flavor of linux

904112
ubuntu	linux
i have no problem compiling my code using the 64bit ubuntu 14.04 host linux on intel

904119
filesystems	ntfs
given that the filesystems that you installed with ubuntu likely ext3 ext4 is completely different to the exfat or ntfs filesystems that windows would have used you will be writing all over that data

904131
ubuntu	linux
so to sum it up i m having trouble connecting ubuntu to a network created by a linux machine

904140
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
reinstalling everything is rather extreme but it could actually be faster depending on whether you can get to at least a text-only terminal and how familiar you are with terminal-only tools like apt dpkg and aptitude it s a nicer gui-like terminal package manager

904140
dpkg	apt	dpkg	aptitude
if you can log into just a text terminal you could search with apt and or dpkg and or aptitude to see what s installed now and remove install again

dpkg	aptitude
aptitude is only a layer abstraction on top of dpkg that makes it more user-friendly or easier to use or safer or less powerful or patronizingly child-proofed depending on your relationship with your system and your outlook on life

904302
ubuntu	debian
because seriously let s face it that ubuntu makes the entire gnome setup dependent on a gui interface to an abstraction-layer of the debian package manager is ridiculous.

904312
ubuntu	linux
i have also tried a windows version of it instead of the native one for linux with wine 1.6.2 wine 2.4 and in a virtual machine of ubuntu 16.04 64-bit with the same results

904473
filesystems	ntfs
since the allocation unit on both ntfs and ext3 filesystems is 4096 bytes you will therefore get slightly better performance typically a few if you make your vdis 1024n â 128 mbyte long

ubuntu recovery tools -- if you can boot an ubuntu or other linux emergency system you may be able to write an mbr that bypasses grub and boots windows directly

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
ntfs fat exfat ext3 ext4 are all fine and will work when sharing files over the network because the network client your ubuntu server being the network server will never see that filesystems

where a driver might be riskier in general is in the fact that you re giving every program on windows access to the linux filesystem so if randomprogram decides it really wants to delete every file called etc fstab on every disk then the ubuntu etc fstab file will disappear and you ll have problems booting to name just one of many improbable problem-causing scenarios

if you re annoyed by it you can edit the mount options in etc fstab using separate dmask and fmask options which set directory and file permissions separately rather than a single umask option that applies to both directories and files

908782
ubuntu	linux
thus refind looks for common linux kernel filenames in the case of ubuntu and if a cursory check makes them look like they re executable efi programs adds them to its menu

908782
disk	ram
refind can also locate matching initial ram disk initrd files and can pass options the kernel needs to boot either by extracting the data from files like linux s etc fstab or by using a dedicated configuration file refind_linux.conf that refind s installation script generates to go alongside the kernels

908782
filesystems	fat	filesystems	btrfs	fat	btrfs
most efis can read only fat filesystems but linux kernels normally go on ext2 3 4fs btrfs or some other linux-native filesystems

908782
filesystems	fat
thus you ll see linux kernel boot options in refind s menu only if you copy the kernels to a fat filesystems or if you add efi filesystems drivers to the refind installation

if my suspicion that you re using a usb enclosure is correct you can either get one that does the sector-size translation i ve just described to boost the capacity to 16 tib or you can switch to an enclosure with a different type of interface like esata or a true nas that partitions the disk itself and communicates over ethernet using nfs smb cifs or some other higher-level protocol

910018
tunnel	vpn
note unless you really need to restrict things like forwarding traffic to the internet via a tunnel or vpn to your server as a proxy to the net you really don t need to mess with the forward rulesets so i would suggest not doing this because nothing else is really going to use this function or ever land in this rule set table

the one thing you never do is mix debian and ubuntu repositories system libraries programs etc

here s a modified version of willie wheeler s answer that transfers the file s via tar but also supports passing a passwd to sudo on the remote host

now we actually want the output of tar to be piped into ssh and that redirects the stdin of ssh to the stdout of tar removing any way to pass the passwd into sudo from the interactive terminal

912442
sudo	passwd
we could use sudo s askpass feature on the remote end but that is another story. we can get the passwd into sudo though by capturing it in advance and prepending it to the tar output by performing those operations in a subshell and piping the output of the subshell into ssh

given my choice i d like to now reinstall xubuntu onto the 2nd hd where regular ubuntu is now i had been told to manual edit the partitions and do somthing called alongside this time the next time however i sort of doubt that i d do that correctly my other thought is to remove the ssd from the sata header and install xubuntu onto sdb and let it auto partition then reattach the ssd onto sda and hopefully i could boot either the sda or the sdb and not have any issues ......but again i am fearful of breaking linux mint again to which i ve spend many hours again configuring to my needs .

unfortunately because mint is derived from ubuntu but the mint developers did not see fit to differentiate their version of grub the ubuntu mint boot loader the boot loaders from the two distributions try to live in the same place

912849
ubuntu	mint
although each of your disks has its own esp the ubuntu and therefore the mint installer has a bug that makes it use the first esp it finds even if it s not on the distribution s main disk or if you try to force it to use something else

912849
ubuntu	mint
as a result of all of this you have one grub installed in dev sda1 and it s currently controlled through mint -- but if and when a grub update comes down through ubuntu the control is likely to switch to ubuntu

912849
ubuntu	mint
there s also the question of boot coups which can be controlled see my page on the subject but it s easy to get confused about what s in control because the ubuntu and mint versions of grub look pretty much identical

i run a mirror of mint ubuntu and debian simply to provide much quicker access in the computer lab i teach in

913220

the ideas behind the repos for ubuntu actually all start with debian which ubuntu is heavily based on and debian s package management system which includes the apt utilities in various versions and incarnations apt apt-get aptitude etc

when it comes to any linux operating system including ubuntu people tend to distinguish terms kernel and operating system

913356
versioning	upgrade
to upgrade only your kernel to a newer versioning use something like

913385
versioning	upgrade
it only upgrade already installed packages automatically and replaces their previous versioning in the process

913390
mouse	keyboard
exactly same problem with upgrade from 16.04lts to 16.10 on an intel 64bit cpu usb keyboard and mouse not working from startup

913396
versioning	upgrade
in such case you obviously would not want it automatically replaced with factory versioning every time you upgrade

913400
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	debian	centos
today there are three different package managers in place apt for debian and derived systems like ubuntu rpm for redhat and derived systems like fedora centos and more pacman for archlinux but all these just manage packages of software which is essentially the same what is called when you issue ls or df etc. on a debian-system or a rhel-system comes from different packages but essentially it is the gnu-version of the ls - df - program just differently packaged

913430
sudo	passwd
whenever i need to run an application as sudo through terminal i type sudo and it prompts for admin passwd which is different than pass1

913430
sudo	passwd
i would like to be prompted for passwd different if i run a command with sudo just like i do in the opensuse

913466
versioning	upgrade
that means that your kernel versioning will not be upgrade in

913466

linux-image-generic-lts-raring will the kernel versioning get upgrade

i m using two bluetooth adaptors with bluez both are the same device but with different types of antenna is there any method to find out which usb port the identifier on bluez hci0 hci1 is referring to

913596
xfce	gnome
note that if you are prepared to live with the non-lts releases there are very big advances in optimus support available in ubuntu 17.04 and it seems to work well with gnome and unity unlike 16.04 where i recommend xfce it has an older compositor which handles optimus better when using the xserver we are stuck with until 16.04.3

913596
kde	gnome
people who try to get gnome kde or unity working on anything with xserver 1.19 will have grief if they want two external monitors and optimus

this is happening only on firefox not in google-chrome chromium

913662
google-chrome	firefox
off the bat i must say there are many differences in browsers and may handle js differently due to the fact that firefox and google-chrome are entirely different builds by different company s they are not created equally

913662

check internet speed in both firefox and google-chrome is it the same

913940

ubuntu maas is working great for every supported system except centos 7

913940

so ubuntu maas deployment works great until it boots into centos then cloud-init stalls out trying to pull data from the ubuntu maas server without a functional network

913940

because centos 7 is supported by ubuntu maas i m assuming that this worked at one point but centos changed something that broke it or i am using hardware that uses an unsupported ethernet interface i m using a stack of hp proliant dl360 g7 s to get ubuntu maas working before my new servers arrive

spaces	delimiter
what i can see is that your columns are delimiter by two spaces

915656
vmware	virtualbox
many of the virtualization programs out there virtualbox vmware allow you to image an actual disk so you can actually switch between different approaches which can be great for prototyping servers that are to run on bare metal eventually

915679

versioning	upgrade
if you have a retail copy of a different windows versioning that is not being used you might be able to install that first and then upgrade it cheaper

915715
versioning	upgrade
but i m not sure what versioning you can directly upgrade from

915722
ubuntu	linux
if you already have an old iso and are running an ubuntu or other gnu linux distribution you can convert it to your desired version useing zsync

915741
folder	directory
it s the same whether i set a target folder on an usb drive preferably or in a folder in the home directory

915789
skype	hangout
the issue also happens if i try to share my screen on skype google hangout or any other application that allows screen sharing

915793
versioning	upgrade
upgrading to 16.04 also upgrade most currently installed packages to the versioning they are in the 16.04 repositories thus meaning that they will work fine on 16.04 and non of them will be broken as long as you installed them all from the official repositories and not manually or from a ppa

915793
versioning	upgrade
running sudo apt-get dist-upgrade will upgrade all the packages to the latest versioning in the repositories for that specific ubuntu versioning sudo do-release-upgrade upgrade to new ubuntu versioning releases

my issue had to do with the tp link ue300 usb to ethernet 3.0 adapter which was recognized by ubuntu linux but it did not function

916002
mouse	keyboard
sometimes keyboard works but the mouse does not and sometimes nothing works no keyboard no mouse

916109
ubuntu	debian
the issue here as i see it is you re trying to use python 2.7 to run virtualenv when the whole point of virtualenv from the point of view of us post-10.10 ubuntu debian branch users is to be able to compile python 2.7 programs in our python 3 preinstalled and part of the system environment without installing python 2.7 locally which messes up the system beyond repair almost always

916109
versioning	upgrade
looks like it worked here but again this feature almost always doesn t and will mess up your system but you should use the live usb install method to upgrade to new versioning

916142

916252
udp	tcp
simply it s the type of socket which can be udp or tcp too let s create a udp socket

916287
ubuntu	linux
i believe i read somewhere that ubuntu linux has this functionality built in somehow where it could monitor my downloads folder and anytime a file has completed it could extract the file and move it to a folder monitored by sonarr

916296

for direct access to directory aka folder from your desktop you can make new symlinks and put them in home your-user-name desktop

so before you can push you have to pull it first

916467
ssd	sata
my ssd does shows up when booting the liveusb with sata operations in ahci mode but than my windows doesn t work with ahci what is not an option in my case

916467
opensuse	linux
use another linux distribution -- fedora opensuse arch and other linux distributions all compile their kernels independently of one another

916467
ubuntu	mint
note that ubuntu derivatives such as mint are unlikely to do any better than ubuntu since these ubuntu derivatives generally use unaltered kernels from ubuntu

916467
ubuntu	linux
of course if even ubuntu 17.04 doesn t work then switching windows boot mode may be your best choice unless you re willing to try another linux distribution

916468
ubuntu	linux
there has been ransomware which runs natively under linux but its effects were very minor as it required very special conditions which you won t find on a normal ubuntu installation on a laptop or desktop computer

916468

your hard disk failing seems like a much bigger risk to your data than crypto trojans if you use an up-to-date maintained linux system like ubuntu 16.04

916610
ubuntu	debian
if grub was last installed from ubuntu reinstall grub from the debian side

916610
ubuntu	debian
you may then remove the files from the ubuntu partition and mount it on the debian side a home data partition for instance

916610
ubuntu	debian
if the ubuntu partition is after the debian partition so the debian partition will be expanded by moving its end you may use gparted to delete the ubuntu partiton and increase the debian one

916691
ubuntu	linux
grow extend linux root and home partition using gparted on live ubuntu

916712
bash	zsh
cleared zsh and went back to bash - restart - login - loop

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
you should not mount an ntfs or fat volume at home because ubuntu relies on features not provided by these filesystems for some files in your home directory

917528

if you use windows filesystem drivers for linux filesystems you could also give windows access to your ubuntu home partition.

if not then the only suspicion i have that remains is that the circuitry in the wireless card or in the airplane mode switching has become damaged by the spilled water

mouse	keyboard
i have managed to fix myself using the bluetooth dongle which was given with mk850 keyboard + mouse logitech unifying receiver and using the software called

918137
mouse	keyboard
synergy allows you to use one keyboard and mouse across multiple computers almost like a virtual kvm but instead of hitting switches you just roll your mouse right onto the next screen as if they were all attached to one graphics card

918137
mouse	keyboard
my safest assumption is that the program is being run just fine the problem is that rc.local is run prior to the x session starting so any hooks to the keyboard and mouse are never established which is also likely only done at the beginning of execution of synergyc and not attempted again beyond that point

918151
kde	kubuntu
after returning to a kde session the one with gui - no idea how do you call it session by ctrl + alt + f7 key in kubuntu after few minutes of using it the login screen appears and requires logging again

918154
vmware	esx
the issue was on the network configuration of vmware esx corrected that the deploy of openstack has completed all tasks

918162
switching	screens
you can verify this by waiting for the screensaver timeout while you stay in the kde screens instead of switching to a virtual terminal which should result in the same behaviour

918180
folder	directory
to do this first navigate to your templates directory templates folder

versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade kubuntu on my lenovo t440s laptop to the current versioning using do-release-upgrade

918200
ubuntu	linux
if so it s very inadvisable to continue using those partitions as-is in ubuntu the reason being that there are no good ntfs maintenance tools for ubuntu or any other linux distribution

918207
wan	lan
the idea is to have a server computer with ubuntu installed as virtual machine and both nics bridged wan and lan

918231

918250
ubuntu	debian
well i m feeling a bit dumb right now ubuntu installer takes care of everything the installer detects the debian installation and simply asks how much space should ubuntu take

918283
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu installed on one and debian on the other

918283
ubuntu	debian
how can i make the computer fail over to the debian drive if the ubuntu drive is not found

918283
ubuntu	debian
if the ubuntu drive is found then grub shows both debian and ubuntu options at boot

918283
ubuntu	debian
i would like to copy my grub installation to the second hard drive so it can boot to debian if the ubuntu drive was down

ctime	posix
only last access time atime last modification time mtime and the inode change time ctime are mandated by posix

918339
filesystems	ntfs
in your case you should first install ntfs-3g package for your system to be able to read ntfs filesystems

918362
ubuntu	linux
i might have done this wrong as i m very new to linux and ubuntu and in the middle of transitioning from windows 10 but i ve also tried using the sudo apt-get install all the library names in the terminal and it did nothing to get rid of this error

918379
chown	chmod
in some examples i saw that some used chown instead of chmod

918379
chown	chmod
i do not know where to use chmod and chown

918382
chown	chmod
chown is used to change the ownership of a file while chmod is for changing the file mode bits

918382
chown	sudo
i can use sudo chown dave sudo file to change the owner of the file to dave and the group to sudo

918388
chown	chmod
since the permission bits are set separately for owner group and others you can control file permissions for different users by combining chown and chmod

918446
ubuntu	linux
when i clicked on erase everything and install when i first installed linux the installer did not make additional partitions for ubuntu this because i indeed booted the installation drive in legacy mode

sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
if you want to be able to run this and only this script as a normal user without any other sudo rights or you want to run it with sudo without passwd typing you can add them to your sudoers

918602
sudo	passwd
however this is kinda meh in safety since if someone can edit this script as your user they can run any command as sudo without knowing your passwd so take care in using it

918602
sudo	passwd
after all that just run sudo myscript and it should run it with root rights without asking for a passwd

i am trying to access my resources in my lan remotely using the openvpn service i have setup in an office that is set behind another lan which is the gateway to the wan

filesystems	ntfs
according to this microsoft page these can be 512 bytes to 64 kib for ntfs depending on what os version created the filesystems and what the filesystems s size is

kde	gnome
i personally use gnome lxde openbox and kde depending on my mood and they are all insalled without problems

919203
kde	gnome
in addition you can use kde apps in gnome and gnome apps in kde etc

919203
disk	ram
installing multiple desktops will take up disk space perhaps use a little more ram and there will be a few duplicated applications such as text editors terminals etc and your menus will be a little more cluttered but they will not harm your system

919203
kde	gnome
results of removing can be mixed and there can be residual kde apps and or unwanted gnome apps removed

919206
google-chrome	firefox
sometimes my computer freezes up so badly i can t move the mouse pointer and eventually it unfreezes and i see that one of the browsers used to always be firefox lately its been google-chrome there will be a popup saying that a javascript script is not responding

919206
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are the two main culprits occasionally sublime-text-3 maybe this is due to having too many tabs open

919206
google-chrome	firefox
i tend to keep loads of tabs open is that why i see so many instances of google-chrome and firefox when i run top

on x11 the host part of display could be a remote server and you would use your ubuntu computer as a graphical terminal to access files and programs on that remote server in which case your computer is the server which serves a keyboard a mouse and one or more display devices to client programs running on the remote .

to accomplish changing ubuntu gnome into kubuntu you could upgrade to ubuntu 17.04 then after the upgrade has gone through successfully you can run some commands to install kde then remove gnome

920528

after you have done this you should reboot and then at the login menu you would click the ubuntu icon next to your username and change it to kde kubuntu i am unsure what the exact name of it is as seen in this picture

ubuntu	linux
mkusb works in ubuntu and many other linux distros in order to create live-only usb pendrives and memory cards for booting live sesisons and install linux distros that provide hybrid iso files most modern linux distros provide hybrid iso files

i know that my installation has reached its end of life and i was wondering if i could upgrade from 12.04.5 lts to 14.04.5 lts but with some modifications

921621

could this be an issue with my computer s graphics or might this be a problem with ubuntu linux itself

chown	sudo
just run something like sudo chown -r youruser youruser media youruser yourusbdrive to fix it

921628
putty	winscp
tried running putty through winscp and could not connect

921628

none of this makes sense because yesterday after doing the update from 12 to 14 i had rebooted the server from the hosting companies control panel and i had connected into the system using the winscp side and connected in via putty using the winscp side

921631

according to the question there are two approaches to allow tcp and udp simultaneously

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
format the external drive with a filesystems that windows can see for example ntfs fat 32 or exfat

921778
ubuntu	linux
i currently have windows 10 and i want to have ubuntu as second os but i plan on using it more than windows to get better at using the cli and linux in general

921804
filesystems	fat
in the long term you might consider setting up a small virtualized disk with a fat filesystems and install refind to it

921804
ubuntu	linux
under linux at least virtualbox frequently unmounts cd images without being asked -- or maybe that s ubuntu itself.

921811
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
thus if you install another os -- and especially if that os is windows -- you may run into problems because the other os may try to interpret the filesystems as fat or ntfs and when that fails may offer to prepare or format the partitions

921811
ubuntu	linux
although doing so is not critical for an ubuntu-only installation it will be a useful safeguard in case you boot a non-linux emergency tool or if some obscure linux utility run in ubuntu makes bad assumptions based on the type code

921814
filesystems	fat	filesystems	btrfs	fat	btrfs
journaled filesystems like all modern linux filesystems including both ext4fs and btrfs recover rapidly after a power outage whereas non-journaled filesystems like ext2fs and fat take a long time to repair after a power outage

921814
lvm	btrfs
btrfs has advanced features that are similar to those provided by raid or lvm configurations such as striping and snapshotting

921814
filesystems	btrfs
i haven t studied recent filesystems benchmark data and in particular i don t know how ext4fs and btrfs compare -- what types of usage scenarios would be best for each filesystems

921814
filesystems	btrfs
btrfs is certainly a more advanced filesystems and if you need features like snapshots it might be a good choice on partition s that need those features

both upstart and systemd support these so you can write sysv init scripts and have them work everywhere

922868

some very old or very obscure oses don t support efi but they can often be run in a virtualized environment via virtualbox vmware etc. just as well as on the bare metal. the most common path to csm-related problems results from bad internet advice to enable it and or people poking around in their firmware setup utilities to get around boot problems with an os installer

when in twin-duck mode the rubber ducky acts as both a hid in our case a keyboard and a usb mass storage device

as such it s better for a linux-only installation including a dual-boot between ubuntu and another linux distribution

if this works and enables you to boot to ubuntu you can then either run boot repair or install refind using its ppa or debian package which will bypass grub and use refind as the default boot manager

over 1 gb would be overkill though. if there s any chance you ll ever install multiple linux distributions including future ubuntu versions installed side-by-side with your current installation be sure you set aside at least one to-be- boot partition for each installation

versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux based systems i installed ubuntu ubuntu-17.04-desktop-amd64 using flash drive created using latest versioning of rufus later for dual booting with windows 10 upgrade from windows 8.1 on my hp 15 notebook pc model 15-r119tu

931069
ubuntu	linux
the strange is that i have others linux installation like ubuntu 14.04 and fedora 25 in other partitions and it only occurs on the 17.04 installation

931089
ubuntu	linux
so i added kali linux repositories to my sources list and after i ran apt get dist-upgrade the computer would no longer boot i am however able to go into recovery mode but when i do where it would normally say welcome to ubuntu 17.04 it says welcome to kali linux rolling this must be the problem so how do i change it

931091
ubuntu	linux
your ubuntu is not what is was anymore it s kali linux now a broken one

931091
ubuntu	debian
kali is based on debian testing and a rolling release distribution means packages get updated to their last version as soon as possible which is completely against how ubuntu works

ubuntu and other linux unix system use a drive partition for swap space

it s not ubuntu but at that stage of the boot process it s just grub and a linux kernel 4.x so they re equivalent for the intents and purposes of this fix

bash	zsh
zsh is a bourne-style shell same family as bash that does directly support floating point computations

931216
bash	zsh
so if you re willing to make it a zsh script instead of a bash script you can do that by changing the first line of your script from #

931216
bash	zsh
sometimes a bash feature and the corresponding zsh feature work differently so translating a script from bash to zsh requires you to make changes

931216
bash	zsh
though sometimes a bash script with mistakes in it can actually become correct when treated as a zsh script due to different design decisions in zsh about what expansions should be performed automatically.

931216
bash	zsh
not all shells support this non-expansion form but bash and zsh and some others do

as lubuntu is based on ubuntu it uses the same linux kernel which handles all the operating system related tasks like drivers file system management and networking

the only ntfs repair tool for linux ntfsfix is very basic -- it does some extremely simple checks repairs one or two trivial things and flags the filesystems for repair in windows

i m hoping that my virtual server can be configured to connect to my subscription vpn service provider thus funneling all client traffic through the subscription vpn tunnel

931361
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	wan
as for the wan traffic their access would be encrypted by my own open vpn access server tunnel separate from the subscription vpn service that clients get funneled through

931361
wan	lan
however i would rather wan client use what ever internet service their connected to handle non domain traffic so they re not consuming internet bandwidth from my lan s isp

931367
kubuntu	gnome
i m using the gnome backups program in kubuntu 17.04 and it appears that the list view is not properly sized to the screen

931370

yes you can do it by type sudo gedit if your style gedit or sudo nano if your style is nano

931394
disk	ram
below that are displayed the amount of ram used 26 and amount of disk space really an ssd used 73

931430
kde	gnome
most of the additional resource consumption of the gnome and kde desktops comes from cool looking things like animations and alpha blends which look great depending on how the theme appeals to you

931430
kde	gnome
there are some things like the screen magnifier onscreen keyboard screen reader braille interfaces macro recording and the like that some prefer are standard in gnome kde but have to be setup manually in a lightweight environment

931439
titlebar	window
right click on the titlebar and the drop menu will provide options to maximize and minimize the window a double-click will also maximize the window

931439

run the gnome tweak tool gnome-tweak-tool go to windows titlebar button and you ll see checkbox to show both the maximize and minimize button

931487
vim	emacs
can it be set separately for each document eg like using something similar to the file variables or modes used by emacs and vim

931510
google-chrome	firefox
in my experience firefox and google-chrome use more ram than my first 7 computers combined

931522

my eclipse directory is in my desktop folder

931530
sudo	passwd
no in sudo you enter your own passwd in su it is root s passwd which normally is disabled in ubuntu

931531
sudo	passwd
however with sudo you can use your own passwd

931531
sudo	passwd
so with su we are giving away a single passwd to all users who needs to switch into the target user what sudo does is to overcome this problem

931531
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
we setup a file named sudoers and within it we will define who can do what so everybody using sudo and his own passwd can prove that it s really him and run some specific commands

931550

also suspending your system and waking it up usually fixes some problems with regard to acpi and uefi - by extension functions keys

for regular-sized projects when your code can be reasonably edited with regular text editors i am tempted to say that debian ubuntu linux as a whole is already a completely free as in speech and beer integrated development environment the yosys pipeline was packaged so you truly get from the verilog source code to a flashed lattice fpga see

931768
bash	zsh
before running your resource consuming commands you could also use the setrlimit 2 system call probably with the ulimit builtin of your bash shell or the limit builtin in zsh notably with -v for rlimit_as

931817
debian	linux	debian	mint
by the way this problem also exists in linux mint since they are both based on debian and that means this is an issue which exists in debian

grub installation failure -- grub is a boot loader -- a program that loads the os kernel linux in the case of ubuntu into memory and starts it running

931930
filesystems	ntfs
as others have suggested you should back up the files from the ntfs partition use linux-native filesystems exclusively on the computer and restore the files once everything is up and running

931945
ubuntu	linux
i had this problem since i switched to linux ubuntu

931958

yes i already tried every thing in askubuntu and ubuntu forums and have no idea .please help me or at least suggest me a linux distro which supports wifi driver in acer aspire f15

931961
sudoers	passwd	sudo	passwd
pkexec launches a dialog to ask for your passwd but instead of just reading etc sudoers like sudo it uses policykit which uses an authentication agent that needs to be running in the background

932025
mouse	keyboard
the android studio was working fine while writing code but when i launched the emulator nexus 5 the os froze completely not even keyboard and mouse were working

932026
filesystems	ntfs
if the ntfs drives are mounting as read-only its probably because ubuntu thinks their filesystems are unclean probably due to hibernation or a damaged filesystems

932059
ubuntu	debian
the apache2 service in ubuntu debian uses the environment file etc apache2 envvars during its startup via apache2ctl restart or service apache2 restart

932127
post	get
if you still can t get your problem resolved post detailed information about what you ve done to isolate and troubleshoot this as well as relevant firewall .htaccess file protection masks error log file information and so on

932132

you can apt-get install the package cde-desktop from the sparky linux repository sparky linux is a derivative of debian so it should work with some tweaking

in wsl sudo passwd will change the passwd of the wsl root user

932151
sudo	passwd
in wsl sudo generally asks for the passwd of the current wsl user

932151
sudo	passwd
you probably want to change the passwd of the sudo -capable non-root user

932151
sudo	passwd
you probably do not want to change the root users passwd because in ubuntu the root user generally should not have a passwd sudo should be used instead

932221
apache	nginx
if you need to parse files other than .html php files or need to access them from another computer you need to run an http server like apache nginx or python simplehttpserver on your local machine

932222
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd

folder	directory
if you re using apache server your default root directory will probably be var www html and the apache server will look at a file or a folder named index like index.html or index.php to access immediately

932242
folder	directory
last important step is to make sure that apache has the proper permissions to access the files needed i.e the link we created and named index and the home user folder directory and the files needed to be accessed within that directory

932266
ubuntu	linux
i think there is no more linux servers online serving a website with ubuntu 8.04

versioning	upgrade
the updater s automatic attempt to restore to the previous versioning failed as well but left me at the terminal where i was able to complete the upgrade as follows

932392
sudo	passwd
or maybe remotely but in that case they should know my login passwd to connect to the computer and this is usually the same as my sudo password... so someone is in front of my pc and she cannot delete certain important files or dirs or install harmful software without knowing my sudo passwd but she can do a lot of other harmful and privacy-violating things without sudo

932402

sudo chown ivan media a upload which would leave the group status unchanged or more generically

octal	binary
with chmod 755 you re using octal numbers the binary representation of which is used to set specific bits of permissions

932715
octal	binary
octal number 7 is 111 in binary so you re setting all read write and execute bits for owner

932715
octal	binary
octal number 5 is 101 in binary so you re setting read and execute but disable write bits and since it s 5 for group and other users those two categories will have the same permissions

and switch over the mouse keyboard over the network like okvm ica rdp and vnc

933120

i know this is an ubuntu forum but i could really use your help since i have received 0 help from deepin forums and after all we are all a big linux family

934402
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu 16.04.2 elementary os i found that after installing deja dup i was unable to backup to my onsite linux server this server running a vanilla samba version and a very vanilla smb.config file so i actually used some knowledge i gained from having to mount an smb file share in the dreaded mac terminal for some reason it wouldn t mount in finder on a job site and so after using a modified form of the uri on the custom location storage selection i was able to get it to work

934408
ubuntu	linux
using e to edit the grub ubuntu boot command i added the command nomodeset to the line starting with linux just before other commands quiet splash

934412
switching	screens
in the newer vmware versions goto guest and in older versions go to view and press switching to scale mode which will adjust the virtual screens when you adjust the application

934421
versioning	upgrade
i recommend the following commands before doing the upgrade to be sure you have the newest packages for your current versioning

934421
versioning	upgrade
then upgrade to the newest versioning

934446

i am new to linux and stuff but i had a old pc which no one uses so installed ubuntu on it to do some web design projects

934449
debian	linux
there are various tools that interact with advanced packaging tool apt and allow you to install remove and manage packages in debian based linux distributions

934479
chown	sudo
if it is root root instead of your username then do sudo chown username username .xauthority with username being your real username

934504
filesystems	fat
anyway the filesystems used by your sd card is probably extended fat which i think is not supported by default

934624
ubuntu	debian
a previously-working etc exports file running perfectly on debian fails to work as expected on ubuntu

934643
sudoers	passwd
to change the passwd i need to edit the sudoers file and to edit the file i need the passwd

934653
folder	directory
the folder i want to change permissions on is opt lampp what would be the correct replacement for directory to change permissions on opt lampp - if the following was my command to recursively replace ownership on the parent directory all subfolders and all files for the lampp directory and i am a sudo user the command would be

934662
chown	sudo
i would suggest you first cd opt and then run sudo chown -r username group . lammp

934662
chown	sudo
the reason for that is simple if you by accident add space between and opt when running sudo chown -r username group opt lammp that ll be bad

934681
ubuntu	linux
congratulations your ubuntu linux kernel now has working realtek wireless drivers

934713
sudo	passwd
su switches to root and therefore requires knowing the root passwd and adduser ana sudo adds ana to the sudo group

934727
put	get
when the screen comes up in term to put in secure boot grub password i get the following error

934775
bash	zsh
it works both in zsh and bash

934775

while it always works fine in bash the non-root user which is in the sudo group can not tab complete in zsh

934803
filesystems	ntfs
if you intend to share data with windows use the filesystems ntfs and let it be partition number one

934804
ubuntu	debian
you have dirty installation media containing a mix of debian and ubuntu

934808
ubuntu	debian
when opening a root shell in ubuntu or any other debian based distribution use the following command

934817
g++	gcc
since g++ and gcc have already been installed and are at their latest version leave them alone

934832

935019
ubuntu	linux
this hack work-around is very gnu linux specific assumes pstree lsb_release exist but afaik this problem exists only on a subset of linux distros so far just ubuntu

935035
folder	directory
this sets the setgid special file permission which would cause all files created in my folder to be owned by the www-data group which has then has rx 5 permission because of the parent directory

in a terminal window give yourself administrative access by entering sudo -s and putting in your passwd

935243
versioning	upgrade
there actually may be two versioning the initial one and an upgrade one

935243
versioning	upgrade
but it is very unlikely that a package will be upgrade to some new major versioning in an lts repository

935243
versioning	upgrade
even if the package is upgrade in xenial-updates the command will install this versioning

i got rid of ubuntu and installed centos 7 because i heard that centos kernels are not so heavy than the ubuntu ones

935446

versioning	upgrade
when i was running versioning 14.04 everything was good after some fun tweaking i upgrade to 16.04

935763
filesystems	ntfs
i think that is because the partition is ntfs but i m not for sure because i can t try different filesystems

935765
folder	directory
i m trying to upload a folder to the root directory at my server

935769
mouse	keyboard

935769
mouse	keyboard
with ubuntu live the mouse works but the keyboard does not register any keystrokes

935769

so basically it appears that the ubuntu or any linux flavour does not have a builtin driver for this primax kbd mouse dongle

on 14.04 lts i ve had no problem playing sound over my headphones audio jack output except after suspends i ve had to wait untill next reboot

935828
ubuntu	debian
but because the libstdc++6 is already installed along with ubuntu 14.04 by default we therefore didn t specify it in debian package s control file

935828
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
my theory is that the depends section of the control file works more like checking the existence but not versioning and because ubuntu 14.04 had installed libstdc++6 the debian package didn t install upgrade it because it could be found in the system already

935828
versioning	upgrade
however apt-get install checked the most recent versioning and installed it if missing or upgrade it if existing

ubuntu	linux
i find that ubuntu tweak will still get some things bleachbit doesn t plus ubuntu tweak will remove old linux kernels and re-do grub for you

936518
g++	gcc
if you re running make-install commands you re ubuntu must have a gcc g++ compiler installed and the executables gcc available on the exectuable path

936518

to get started you will either need to reinstall ubuntu onto the ssd and selecting btrfs as your root filesystems or to convert your existing installations filesystems to btrfs

939067
filesystems	btrfs
one way to do it is to mount your btrfs root subvolid 0 or 5 somewhere and use that to manage your subvolumes and snapshot and furthermore store all of the data in appropriate subvolumes which you mount to convenient locations in your filesystems

939067
filesystems	btrfs
i would recommend to mount them by their uuid which you can retrieve by running sudo btrfs filesystems show

both dev sda and dev sdc are sata iii ssd s but sda is on a 6 gbps bus ata1 and sdc is on a 3 gbps bus

if you want to use openvz i highly advise you use a .rpm system as the kernel patch is written for a rhel fedora kernel and may or may not have issues on debian ubuntu kernels

940160

to some extent openvz is depreciated on debian ubuntu hosts

940175
sudo	passwd
so the problem is that the default user ubuntu does not have a passwd and has sudo capability directly from etc sudoers.d casper -- making sudo capability available to anyone because they can switch to the ubuntu user

i was thinking i could probably find a way to automatically log stdout stderr and the commands to a file perhaps a clever tweak on bash history that logs everything

940492
folder	directory
it can handle all files and folder placed into the current directory

940492

in all other cases the script will automatically move all files and folder into a backup directory be careful where you run it

if you have a lot of server you should consider using a tool like ansible or puppet

as far as i know you can upgrade from older to newer versioning of ubuntu but not from 32 to 64 bit

940624
mouse	keyboard
so a temporary solution not recommended by me see below why is to boot an ubuntu iso with the mainline unstable 4.12 or above kernel or boot ubuntu with acpi off use a separate mouse and keyboard install the mainline kernels and remove that acpi off from the grub boot commands

940624
ubuntu	linux
that is why i will use linux on my acer swift 3 only once ubuntu 18.04 releases for stability but 17.10 will also work but you are free to go ahead and use risky software and kernels

sudo	passwd
first ubuntu doesn t by default allow root logins via passwd but uses sudo instead

941001

941233
sudo	passwd
using does not require the passwd of the user you are changing to but only your own passwd for sudo

941233
sudo	passwd
with sudo you effectively run su as root who is allowed to change the user without knowing the passwd of the user

941255
mouse	keyboard
i know that there is many gui automation applications scripts for robotjs for nodejs pyautogui for python but they only provide basic control over the system keyboard mouse control and screenshots so i think that this approach is not very convenient for me because you should precisely calculate mouse cursor position for every action ñ onsidering application frame size and position which may vary from time to time

you just center-click and drag the file to where you want it to go and when you release the center-button wheel a menu will pop up asking you if you want to move copy or link the file

941711

if not and if you want to use grub customizer you should reconfigure your system so that ubuntu s grub is the primary one relegating opensuse s grub to secondary status

some time back in slackware i d formatted a 2tb with two ext2 partitions but when i install either mint or ubuntu gparted sees this as a single fat32 formatted drive

944371

ubuntu must be either dev sda2 or dev sda4 since they are the biggest partitions but neither of them is recognized as a linux system

versioning	upgrade
i will now have to upgrade to a newer versioning that is only available as package.deb from the vendor s web site

944495
ubuntu	linux
after years of only using linux systems for servers i m not an expert i decided to give ubuntu kubuntu another chance to replace windows

944495
ubuntu	linux
i don t want to be rude because most people are improving linux and ubuntu in their free time it s just that i can t understand it

944496
versioning	upgrade
steam should then work properly.but make sure not to install the proprietary amd drivers as they are very bad for the stability of the os compared to the open source drivers.if you are getting low performance with the open source drivers then simply upgrade the mesa versioning by adding the xorg edgers ppa

944496
versioning	upgrade
after that type this in order to upgrade the mesa versioning

944508
installation	upgrade
the installation went without a hitch this is a brand new install not an upgrade

944514
dpkg	apt
as far as i know high-level package management utilities like apt and synaptic simply call dpkg as a subprocess to remove or install files

944514
dpkg	apt
in my answer to a somewhat related question i discussed how apt dpkg and other package managers installed on an ubuntu system store information about the files provided by a package in a human-readable form

944541
stdout	stderr
what you tried didn t work because the access denied output are errors and sent on stderr instead of stdout which is piped to grep

944542
stdout	stderr
the access denied is probably being printed on stderr rather than stdout

944542
stdout	stderr
the redirects the output from stderr to stdout so that grep -v can do its job

944542
stdout	stderr
by default | only pipes stdout and not stderr .

944609

itâ s entirely possible that thereâ s something i donâ t understand about linux ubuntu and i missed some kind of setting or understanding of how the os works but iâ m assuming it is in fact a bad hard drive as i have unifi-video recording to the laptopâ s internal 250gb hard drive temporarily until i can figure out this issue and itâ s been running perfectly for over 3 weeks now in this setup

944610
versioning	upgrade
though we are largely satisfied with the official packages provided by ubuntu some times we d like to make a change like adding a patch or upgrade versioning to an existing package or even add a package of our own

944610

i come from the freebsd world where this is handled by ports -- is there anything like it for ubuntu

stdout	stderr
stack overflow confused about stdin stdout and stderr

944792

mouse	keyboard
is it possible to get somehow the usb device type mouse keyboard drive and it s id or serial number and then register this device so that no other devices will have access except this one

944858

the recommended minimum system requirements here should allow even someone fairly new to installing ubuntu or gnu linux to easily install a usable system with enough room to be comfortable

944858
x86	64bit
all 64bit x86-64 cpus should be fast enough to run ubuntu and can run the 32-bit x86 version as well

944903
versioning	upgrade
so no it won t affect upgrade but you ll need to be re-apply the changes when upgrading if the new versioning doesn t fix the problem

944941
folder	directory
i had to go into the game folder right click and go open applications directory then navigate to steamapps common age2hd

944990
stdout	stderr
the two typical approaches are to throw away stderr as in zanna s answer or to redirect stderr to stdout and filter stdout as in android dev s answer

944990
stdout	stderr
combining stdout and stderr together into stdout and piping it to grep or some other command to filter itâ as with or â runs the risk of unintentionally filtering out a file whose name contains the message being filtered

944990
ubuntu	linux
the above discussion of unusual filenames pertains to gnu find which is the find implementation in gnu linux systems including ubuntu

944990
stdout	stderr
what you really want here is to leave stdout intact while piping stderr to grep

944990
stdout	stderr
| pipes stdout and some shells including bash support to pipe both streamsâ or you can redirect stderr to stdout first with which has the same effect

944990
stdout	stderr
one way is to swap stdout with stderr so that search results are on stderr and errors are on stdout then pipe stdout to grep for filtering

944990
stdout	stderr
file descriptor 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr and the unredirected 0 is stdin

944990
stdout	stderr
redirects stdout to stderr

944990
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to file descriptor 3 which is the original stdout

944990
stdout	stderr
for more information see how to pipe stderr and not stdout

944990
stdout	stderr
and io redirection - swapping stdout and stderr advanced and especially pipe only stderr through a filter

944990
stdout	stderr
however this method has the disadvantage that search results are sent to stderr and errors are sent to stdout

944990
stdout	stderr
applying the same redirections shown above on the right side of the pipeline won t achieve this because | only pipes stdout so that side of the pipeline only receives output that was originally sent to stderr because the streams were swapped and not the original stdout output

944990
ubuntu	linux
some shells including bash on systems that can support it including gnu linux systems like ubuntu let you perform process substitution which allows you to run a command and redirect to from one of its streams

944990
stdout	stderr
you can redirect the find command s stderr to a grep command that filters it and redirect that grep command s stdout to stderr

944990
stdout	stderr
see also pinko s answer to how to pipe stderr and not stdout

944990
stdout	stderr
it will give you syntax error redirection unexpected if you try to use this method whereas the method of swapping stdout and stderr will still work

944990
stdout	stderr
piping both stdout and stderr to grep and filtering out lines that contain permission denied makes the error message go away but also hides the search result for the file with that phrase in its name

944990
stdout	stderr
for example here s the method where stdout and stderr are swapped

944990
stdout	stderr
swapping stdout and stderr and piping stdout does not cause the problemâ find s stdout becomes stderr which is not piped

945009
filesystems	ntfs
if the ntfs drives are mounting as read-only its probably because ubuntu thinks their filesystems are unclean probably due to hibernation or a damaged filesystems

945011
versioning	upgrade
if the ppa later supports your ubuntu release and provides a later versioning of code blocks and you decide you want to upgrade to that versioning then it will be sufficient to enable the ppa again and upgrade the packages on your system such as with the software updater or by running

945011
versioning	upgrade
if the ppa is enabled has a package for your system and the package has a newer versioning than your currently have installed then you upgrade to it automatically

945660
ubuntu	linux
i like the plug and play quality of ubuntu live and considering this type of hardware is not very widely supported for linux 99 of them have only drivers for windows

945660
ubuntu	linux
i would like to ask if ubuntu live usb has the drivers and capability to boot autonomously from an add on pcie usb port without any unsual troubleshooting and device not recognized issues reason i ask is i have seen in numerous product reviews and on numerous chat boards and forums users having problems booting or using ubuntu linux even to automount usb devices when plugged into such a card - even if the user boots from a regular install of ubuntu

945660
ubuntu	linux
so i posted a question on another thread asking for pointers as to what hardware is best supported for ubuntu linux and some moderatores immediately put the thread on hold saying it was off topic because its asking for hardware suggestions

945660
ubuntu	linux
at the very least it would be nice if someone explained to me where to look for a list of hardware and chipsets and devices supported by ubuntu linux

945669
versioning	upgrade
the only solutions are either to wait until an upgrade versioning is available in your repository or use the linux package provided on the filezilla website

945677

i know that ram is volatile and all the data disappears when it looses power but i m wondering if there is a way that as soon as you turn on the server it copies the ramdisk contents from some sort of backup file on my regular hard drive onto the ram disk and then continues to boot from ram giving my server superhuman r w speeds

if one of these packages say bar depends on package foo but foo itself is already not listed this should not happen as long as you use only official stable debian ubuntu repos dpkg -l tor will mention them

the most general way which works with almost every other library as well is to use apt s multiarch support -- multiarch is enabled by default on all recent debian and ubuntu systems--by running dpkg --add-architecture i386 and using apt or apt-get to install the libc6 i386 and libc6-dev i386 packages

note fat32 is a good choice for usb installation media and ntfs is a good choice in a dual boot with windows scenario for partitions where you want to use to store personal stuff like your media library for example that should be accessible to both ubuntu or any other linux system and windows

btrfs for example uses a copy-on-write method of preserving filesystems integrity instead of a journal

957810
versioning	upgrade
though as this will then get upgrade either via apt-get updgrade or unattended-upgrades it may become unstable when a new versioning of xenserver is released so it may be good to pin it to versioning 6

957815
dpkg	apt
in theory apt or dpkg could rely on it directly and be unable to reinstall it

957817
kubuntu	gnome
goal dual boot windows 10 kubuntu 16.04 or ubuntu with option to replace gnome with plasma

958018
folder	directory
in your home directory for the anaconda folder delete that

958019
dpkg	apt
dpkg -i suggested by cynplytholowazy also installs the same chrome .deb file but it doesn t do any automatic dependency resolution as the above command which uses apt instead of dpkg does

958025
freebsd	linux
on unix systems such as freebsd or linux traceroute is available as a command line tool

958191
ubuntu	linux
i know that these laptops and not very friendly with linux and i was told that i could use pycharm and python 3.5 in os x in the beginning but i will most probably be required to use ubuntu later into semester

958196
ubuntu	linux
i want to uninstall windows 8 from my pc and install linux instead i ve already got the ubuntu 16.04 iso file but the only detail is that i want to keep my 200 gb worth of music videos pictures and various documents

i want to install ubuntu and learn linux

958208
google-chrome	firefox
as of sept 2017 you can use true key on ubuntu with either firefox or google-chrome

958226
apache	nginx
this can be achieved using apache nginx varnish and a multitude of other servers

958226
apache	nginx
i d suggest sticking with nginx or apache

958231
jobs	cron
while usr local bin is not listed in the crontab s 1 4 6 the cron jobs should use the full path

958231
jobs	cron
probably the reboot cron jobs will not work with the current version of the script 7

958260
versioning	upgrade
currently my versioning is xenial xerus if i upgrade to zesty zapus may i have to make some changes xenial.xml

958275
min	max
replace n with max number you want to generate or 1 min number

958278
ethernet	wireless
hopefully it was booting the linux works great just some wireless and graphic drivers were missing used xorg instead but after plugging it via ethernet cable to my modem i made all updates and installed the drivers

958296
virtualbox	parallels
solved the issue with virtual machine by using parallels desktop lite instead of virtualbox

958298
virtualbox	parallels
i solved the issue by using parallels desktop lite from app store instead of virtualbox

958325
geany	sublimetext	geany	gedit	gedit	sublimetext
in fact if sublimetext or any text editor like gedit geany had a plugin that displayed columns aligned that would be enough perfect for me

958337
ubuntu	mint
then download and extract the proper 32 or 64 bit file m64py for all types of ubuntu mint in my case xenial 16.04lts and it contains a auto deb installer

958338
jobs	cron
instead of writing cron jobs to manually change your display s brightness you might want to have a look at redshift a program that can do exactly this

958366
mouse	keyboard
also i first need to be able to interact with my vm via mouse or keyboard before i can install guest additions

958374
post	get
judging by post refind seems to be a little more reliable with the caveat that if secure boot is active you ll have to jump through extra hoops to get it working

958377
versioning	upgrade
i wanted to upgrade my ubuntu versioning and i did the following steps

958389
filesystems	ntfs
note i believe this solution will also work for ntfs filesystems which have the same quirk

958397
mouse	keyboard
the mouse is not useful here but it is possible to use the keyboard to launch arandr and choose video settings

958407
ubuntu	linux
im new to ubuntu and the general linux environment and i need some help

958414
sudo	passwd
bring up a terminal window and using sudo or su to become root if you have set a root passwd and try networking restart enter

958424
vim	emacs
if you are a user of or at least familiar with emacs or vim there is org-mode which contain a simple integrated editor for tables

958424
vim	emacs
you can also do simple calculations and the integration into the editor allows you to use the sophisticated editing facilities of emacs vim

958426
versioning	upgrade
i ve duplicated the etc apt sources.list from my staging-back server to my alpha-front server and did the apt-get update apt-get upgrade apt-get dist-upgrade cycle and yet i still have kernel release 3.13.0-132-generic with kernel versioning #181-ubuntu smp wed sep 13 13 25 03 utc 2017 no apparent changes

958426
disk	ram
there are slight differences in the virtual hardware between systems 128mb ram vs 64mb ram 16 cores vs 8 cores 500gb root disk vs 2.3tb root disk

958436
ubuntu	debian
does it have anything to do with that it was meant for debian and i m using ubuntu

958468
google-chrome	firefox
this also happens to files nautilus terminal gnome terminal videos totem and photos eye of gnome system settings and many other windows but not all of them so for example rhythmbox google-chrome firefox and blender are fine

958477
ubuntu	linux
i ve been using linux for eight years and i don t run in root -- in fact my last ubuntu install i didn t even enable a specific root account i had done so previously because i was used to having one from earlier linux versions but i m now convinced it s unnecessary

958477
sudo	passwd
sudo can do anything necessary and the need to enter a passwd from time to time reminds you that you have the power to completely hose your system -- and so need to double check what you ve typed before you hit enter

958483
ubuntu	debian
once in ubuntu install the refind ppa or debian package

958484
ubuntu	linux
again i am very new to linux ubuntu 14.04 .

958492
screens	tablet
how can i make the screens on my dell inspiron 11 3000 series rotate automatically when i put it into tablet mode

958499
mouse	keyboard
basically the mouse is listed twice in the xinput list once as a mouse once as a keyboard

958499
mouse	keyboard
i also checked the button mapping for both the mouse and keyboard device and the mouse has a 1 to 24 mapping whereas the keyboard has nothing

958513
cinnamon	gnome
spotifyâ s rep also says the company do â want to fixâ some minor issues like incorrect mpris data being passed to sound applets in gnome unity cinnamon etc but when this may happen is as-yet unknown

958535
dpkg	apt
you have to remove some packages with sudo dpkg -r xxxxx to get some free space then you can have apt remove more

958536
folder	directory
mkdir mount - this will create a temporary directory for us to mount our partition in your home folder

958540
mouse	keyboard
to stop the behaviour i guess i would have to right-click the mouse or double-click or keyboard across to the terminal and run something else

958556
ubuntu	linux
i am an infrequent ubuntu linux user only use it in case of major disaster in this case ransom-ware nuclear but that s another story

958569
ethernet	wireless
the camera is on a patch ethernet cord to the ethernet port and the pc is on the internet via a wireless device

958583
versioning	upgrade
now i want to upgrade mongodb to latest versioning 3.4

958604
filesystems	ntfs
different causes of your problem to mount the ntfs filesystems

958604
filesystems	ntfs
there could be different causes why you cannot mount the ntfs filesystems

958604
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems needs repair and that for ntfs should be done in windows as suggested by michaelbay

958604
filesystems	ntfs
the same syntax is used to mount ntfs and fat32 filesystems in linux so instructions for fat32 can be used for ntfs

958678
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu for last month i tried almost everything possible to fix wifi issue with my ubuntu but it keeps dropping every now and then

958679

958736
ubuntu	mint
back when i used mint i couldn t use earphone on my pc and now on ubuntu it s the same

958764
sudo	passwd
ssh to remote machine with .pem file and set passwd sudo passwd ubuntu rdp wants passwd

958785
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
mint and ubuntu are 2 completely different distributions although mint is based off ubuntu and there is no real way of installing linux within linux like you can windows within windows

958789
kubuntu	gnome
it came with kubuntu and gnome shell and unity

958795
sudoers	visudo
i tried adding to etc sudoers via sudo visudo but it didn t help either

958807
ethernet	wireless
i want to set up a laptop to access it as seamlessly as possible from different locations at home via wired or wireless ethernet on networks away from home accessing the home server securely via ssh vpn and when no network is available using a local copy of a subset of the server s contents which can then be synced back to the server when the laptop re-connects

958807
vpn	lan
how to detect when the machine is away from home and switch from direct connection to the home lan to remote connection via ssh or a vpn

958822
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux but just loaded and installed ubuntu 16.04.2 on my nephew s hp pavilion laptop 15-n037ncl

958826
kde	kubuntu
for example if you remove the unity dm and desktop then install kdm and plasma kde desktop you would now have kubuntu

958848
google-chrome	firefox
i installed the nvidia driver for my graphic card and everything seemed to be fine but videos in google-chrome look really bad now this issue doesn t seem to exist in firefox

958861
installation	upgrade
it s enough to add the official skypeforlinux source and upgrade your current installation with these commands

958863
ubuntu	linux
will using the ubuntu graphical interface grub 2 boot fixer with a view to loading ubuntu or either windows system affect the security of the windows 7 10 systems as in can the linux part be used to place root kits etc

958869
folder	directory
i had to clone the directory here then navigate to the folder in that directory in the terminal with the vagrantfile and run vagrant up

958871
versioning	upgrade
instead of handbrake the default versioning in ubuntu s repositories so obviously it could not upgrade using

958884
ubuntu	linux
yes but windows will the entry point for malware not ubuntu linux

958884
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu linux there are a few simple rules

958884
ubuntu	linux
you can reboot ubuntu linux and you can use an live session to install software onto the system

958884
ubuntu	linux
the entry points into ubuntu linux are wine samba shares connection software into your system remote desktop software installed from unofficial sites

958902
google-chrome	firefox
why does this affect google-chrome and not firefox

958906
put	get
that is in cell q67 i put i do not get the value only true

958913
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and installing ubuntu

958929
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and installing ubuntu

958935
versioning	upgrade
both versioning of windows are happy with either partition table type so the windows upgrade does not necessitate a partition table change

958940
afp	smb
any time machine share points must be shared over smb instead of afp

958948
mouse	keyboard
with the software from asus while working in windows i can assign a keyboard or mouse functions to the extra mouse buttons but i cannot simply say this extra key needs to be an extra mouse button so that i can use it in ubuntu

958956
versioning	upgrade
i follow the steps in upgrade git versioning on ubuntu 14.04 but when i enter the first step command sudo add-apt-repository ppa git-core ppa i receive the following error

958956
versioning	upgrade
with this error when i continue to enter the remaining 2 commands i failed to upgrade my git versioning

958979
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have replaced my linux mint with ubuntu 17.04 earlier today

958983
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse weren t working.

958985
apache	nginx
by installing apache it messes with the nginx config and renders the clone useless

959007
ubuntu	debian
it simply means that someone in debian or ubuntu volunteered to maintain a package in the archive

959017
mouse	keyboard
i have a logitech mx revolution mouse that has a xf86search keyboard key on it

959017
ubuntu	mint
this time this solution is not the answer as it happened again when updating mint 18.2 and again on a fresh install of ubuntu

959018
versioning	upgrade
you need to download ubuntu again but make sure it s the 64bit amd64 versioning mount it to usb or dvd and when i m the installer you might be able to upgrade it

959041
ssd	sata
when after 5 years hdd started failing with bad blocks i added ssd to sata port 2

959044
stdout	stderr
this is why exchanges stderr and stderr so that you can filter some common stderr lines out but still see all the stdout

959049
disk	ram
i recently installed ubuntu 17.04 on my laptop that has 4 gb ram 1 tb disk space and 64 bit processor

959053
mouse	keyboard
i have mapped a mouse button that reads as a keyboard key xf86search into the mouse button 2 using xbindkeys

959060
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your kernel to versioning at least 4.8

959071
stdout	stderr
if you write instead which is normally not what you want it will first redirect the command s stdout to the file and after that redirect the command s stderr to its now unused stdout so it will show up in the terminal and you could pipe it or redirect it again but it will not be written to the file

959073
h.264	h.265
batch conversion of h.265 to h.264

959080
move	drag
when i move files to a dvd window it says drag or copy files to write them to disk i can only do it once

959107
udp	tcp
as you can see here and in man resolv.conf there is an option named use-vc for resolv.conf to force ubuntu to use tcp for dns queries instead of udp

959121
ubuntu	debian
this works on debian as well but instead of adding the ubuntu repo you can add

959139
wan	subnet
i see a lot of questions for multiple nics but even using one nic per wan with separate subnet only one responds

959144
chown	chmod
the people using these computers are not savvy enough to know how to log into the server therefore my smb.conf is set to and i have chmod 777 and chown nobody.nogroup

959167
folder	directory
then i add folder subd in root directory so now i have var www html subd and then into that directory i placed file some.php

959199
spaces	delimiter
it reads arguments as being delimiter by spaces or newlines

959199
spaces	delimiter
this causes find to append the null character to each filename instead of a spaces and xargs to treat only the null character as delimiter

959225
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t reply on mouse interaction or some keyboard shortcuts like alt + f4

959267
google-chrome	firefox
all fonts looks smaller mainly on firefox and google-chrome

959271
versioning	upgrade
how do i upgrade to a newer versioning of ubuntu

959312

debian	linux
i m on debian derived bunsen labs linux 8.6 bunsen-hydrogen

959367
ubuntu	linux
however i downloaded linux ubuntu and formated the flash drive following the page using cmd

959375
mouse	keyboard
even though i strongly doubted it would help i ve decided to also try replacing the mouse and keyboard with same make and model

959386
fish	bash
since you don t explicitly ask for bash a little plug for the fish shell where this can be solved beautifully imo

959392
bash	zsh
in case you re only familiar with one of zsh and bash here are the equivalent key bindings you may need

959402
kde	kubuntu
i m using kubuntu 17.04 kde frameworks 5.37.0. kernel 4.10.0-35-generic

959421
disk	ram
i set 4 gb ram for the guest win 7 a disk of 30 gb

959427
ethernet	wireless
i have a lenovo ideapad yoga 13 no ethernet jack so wireless is important

959430
google-chrome	firefox
3 install google-chrome browser and use an extension call user agent swticher this addon forces google-chrome and firefox to use ur browser as a mobile browser and youtube loads pretty fast

959433
sudo	gnome-terminal
sudo -h gnome-terminal

959448
ubuntu	linux
i am very very new to ubuntu and linux as a whole

959570
kde	cinnamon
i m guessing here and also the desktop env used 80 is running unity 7 kde 4 cinnamon etc

959591
ubuntu	centos
why does ubuntu need reboot after upgrade but centos doesn t

959601
hide	show
when you create the artwork you should put your graphics and text on layers above layer 1 which show the disc outline and then before printing hide layer 1 otherwise it will print the circles of the outline as well as your artwork

959609
folder	directory
inside this directory let s say there is a folder named images var www html images

959609
folder	directory
now i want to add a new user and give this user permission to access the images folder only and also i want to jail the user in that directory

959610
folder	directory
now all the folder in my directory lost all their files and i don t know how because i didn t run any command like rm

959617
filesystems	ntfs
in the fat32 filesystems the maximum file size 4 gb but in ntfs and udf the size is limited by the size of the partition

959620
installation	upgrade
i usually update through software updater utility and occasionally used sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade as recommended by some software installation tutorials - anything that i think is required

959680
ubuntu	linux
i ve recently started using ubuntu and linux for the first time

959680
switching	screens
switching however did reveal to me what this message window is it s a notification which in gnome appears at the top centre of the screens when you have emails change songs etc.

959709
ubuntu	debian
i ve tried various desktops on both ubuntu and debian and the problem is ubiquitous

959721
versioning	upgrade
even if i explicitly request the new versioning no upgrade will take place

959763
sudo	passwd
after changing it i started to experience weird things with my sudo command such as my passwd failing multiple times

959770
ubuntu	centos
firewalld is a front end for iptables and is the default firewall used in rhel centos and fedora so my guess is you are reading rhel fedora documentation rather than ubuntu documentation

959782
bluetooth	usb
you need to enable usb autosuspend mode for the bluetooth device

959804
centos	linux	freebsd	linux	freebsd	debian	freebsd	centos	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos	debian	centos	debian	linux
although printenv is not posix gnu linux systems like debian ubuntu fedora and centos support it because gnu coreutils provides it and it works on many other nix systems like freebsd

959855
os.walk	enumerate
this is simpler to write and easier to understand than most other methods because python has an os.walk function that enumerate directories in a way that makes it easy to see which ones have subdirectories and more generally because python is a language many users find clean and intuitive

959855
bash	zsh
the foregoing assumes you re using a bourne-style shell like bash dash sh ksh zsh posh etc

959884
ubuntu	linux
the point is not only about ubuntu but if the linux kernel is aware of uefi and my answer is yes ubuntu as well the kernel supports this

959900
kde	kubuntu
after kubuntu i tried kde neon and it gives the same result like on screenshot

959933
ubuntu	linux
i was running kali linux for a while but since that started to crash on me after every update a student told me to switch to the more stable ubuntu distro

959947
ubuntu	linux
i am a newbie in ubuntu linux

959949
ubuntu	linux
being quite new to ubuntu or linux in general i would really appreciate some feedback from someone who has got a similar device working or some tips on how to find out what might be the problem

959953
post	get
any help would be greatly appreciated i am borrowing my dad s laptop to post this question and i have no other way to get online

960015
ubuntu	mint
i had the same troubles with ubuntu and mint and the solution worked there too

960018
jobs	cron
i want to control when backups are done through my own cron jobs is it possible

960027
versioning	upgrade
running sudo apt upgrade will install the new installer which will then in turn install the new versioning of java

960027
versioning	upgrade
it is important to note however that this will not increase your major versioning so java 8 will never upgrade to java 9 unless you install java 9 s installer

960045
switching	screens
next time the problem returned i tried using the function key for switching between external and laptop screens

960080
versioning	upgrade
i ve tried sudo apt-get -f install to repair ubuntu and fsck -v -y dev sda# to repair each filesystem when not mount while booting from a live dvd but it doesn t help and the last time i tried boot-repair it still hadn t been upgrade to a newer versioning and still doesn t seem as though it has

960091
ubuntu	linux
i am new to ubuntu using 14.04 and linux in general

960091
ubuntu	linux
can i use c# for development in ubuntu linux and if yes then how

960133
ubuntu	linux
as any linux distribution ubuntu comes with dd included

960145
mouse	keyboard
i would like to use my unbranded chinease air mouse + keyboard that i normally use at home connected to an android tv on a ubuntu 16.04 laptop at work for making presentation annotations

960170
gedit	nano
you can use any other editor instead of nano like gedit vi etc...

960173
filesystems	ntfs
if a partition has the ntfs or fat32 filesystems you may want to add mount options to give the regular user write access as described at the following link

960190
folder	directory
then make a symlink from each project folder to the appropriate user s home directory

960226
filesystems	ntfs
it is still recommended to use windows tools to fix ntfs filesystems problems even though almost all linux systems can read and write ntfs without issues

960258
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu and some other oses rename is the perl renaming utility prename

960258
int	chars
04d consumes the first argument and formats it as an int 4 chars wide

960310
folder	directory
create a mountpoint this a directory in ubuntu that will share files with the shared folder from windows

960310
folder	directory
try adding any file in windows host os ubuntu share folder now check ubuntu guest os windowsshare directory the file will be reflected

960322
integer	fractions
the arithmetic here is the same as i used from rename except that division in bash is automatically integer division--it automatically truncates the fractions portion--so it is not necessary to use anything corresponding to perl s int function

960338
sudoers	passwd
the etc sudoers file controls who can run what commands as what users on what machines and can also control special things such as whether you need a passwd for particular commands

960362
mouse	keyboard
so i switched to an older nvidia driver and now after booting the keyboard nor mouse work no mouse pointer etc

960362
switching	screens
but the display of the switching to ethernet connection and the time all still happen on screens

960366
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for user

960391
folder	directory
even better what i would really like to do is add project folder from the directory i m currently in on the terminal console

960403
ubuntu	linux
hi i am new to linux and ubuntu

961375

sudo only requires our own passwd so in theory there s nothing stopping anyone from doing this

961377
sudo	passwd
it s not setting a root passwd that s a bad idea it s logging in or running as root without the built-in protections that sudo provides requiring reentering your passwd every few minutes the requirement to prepend sudo on each command etc. which serve as a reminder of the power of an error

if the ntfs drives are mounting as read-only it s probably because ubuntu thinks their filesystems are unclean probably due to hibernation or a damaged filesystems

the same is true of your old de when you settle on a new one -- there s no good way to get rid of for instance kde if you switch to mate or xfce

versioning	upgrade
the main drawback in my opinion is that you ll have only a nine month support window instead of the five years provided for lts versioning and as a result you ll both have to reinstall upgrade frequently and be presented with significant interface changes with similar frequency

folder	directory
since this isn t a command-line-only system and a graphical desktop environment is installed you should know about another way to use files and directory from the terminal whose names require quoting or are otherwise cumbrersome to type drag the folder icon from your file browser into the terminal window

961777

i d really like to have the windows file and folder shortcut functionality in linux instead of using linux symlinks since the windows way actually changes my directory when i click the link instead of traveling down the link in a c pointer-like fashion as though the link was the directory

i frequently use windows folder shortcuts in windows for instance to cross-reference different directory of related content so i can quickly jump around and find things i m looking for that are related

bash	subshell
unlike other subprocesses such as those created when you run an external command like printenv or bash a subshell inherits most of its parent shell s state

961781
bash	subshell
the shell created by running bash is not a subshell and it does not inherit unexported variables

961781
bash	subshell
for example when you have commands separated by | in a pipeline bash runs each of them in a subshell unless the lastpipe shell option is set

961781

they don t really have significant initialization behavior. note that when you run bash --with or without arguments--inside a bash shell that creates a subprocess that is a shell but it is not a subshell

although you should always be mindful of what commands you or someone else might run while you have an active sudo timestamp using an interactive root shell elevates this need because any command run in it until you exit the shell will be run as root without prompting you for a passwd

you had better copy the data in the form of files to a safe place call it backup if you wish but in this case also a temporary location because i think you have to accept that you cannot shrink the fat filesystems with linux tools

in this instance you might want to avoid using sudo since it can only ask you for your passwd from the terminal which you don t seem to be using

btw sudo and by extension gksudo and gksu which both use the same configurations as sudo and policykit which can execute program as root using pkexec can both be programmed to run a program without the need to enter a passwd

963694
sudo	passwd
the reason the word new is in bold is because sudo gksudo might not ask you for a passwd if you ve already executed a sudo gksudo command in an existing terminal even if you haven t actually configured sudo to avoid asking you for a password. if you were able to do this in a new terminal you ve successfully made it possible to execute airvpn without a passwd

using the command efibootmgr -v i could see that the entry named ubuntu points to the ubuntu 17.10 efi disk and the one named linuxmint points to a non-existent disk

966646
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
from this article i learned that linux mint uses an efi boot directory named ubuntu which obviously conflicts with what ubuntu itself uses

966646
ubuntu	linuxmint	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
so the entry named linuxmint was a red herring both ubuntu and linux mint use the entry named ubuntu and since this list is stored in the computer itself ubuntu overwrote the entry for linux mint even though the linux mint boot drive was removed during install

i bought a intel compute stick with linux ubuntu 14 on it

after a reboot i got to the login screen and my keyboard and mouse were not working

967425
xfce	gnome
second the workrave package in the official repo is badly packaged it brings down some xfce dependencies that mess up your gnome session so you ll have to install the workrave-gnome package from rob caeler s ppa

967852
octal	hex
octal was popular with ancient computer systems but hex which uses 0-f to represent values 0000 through 1111 in each digit is more compact and used more frequently today

uninstall	upgrade
performing an upgrade tries to remove something from an old kernel i did uninstall last time - maybe it got stuck last time as well i had just not bothered on the console as i was in hurry

967930
versioning	upgrade
i installed 17.10 over my old 16 versioning through a live boot usb and selected the upgrade that keeps your documents

967931
filesystems	ntfs
it is a good idea to create a separate data partition with the label data and with the filesystems ntfs

967931
filesystems	ntfs
when i was dual booting with windows i used the filesystems ntfs but now that i use only linux i use the filesystems ext4 in the data partition. another advantage with a data partition is that it is easy to backup the personal files

967939
ubuntu	debian

968085
opera	google-chrome
the issue with software center has been since 16.04 and the installation of google-chrome opera on 17.10 is the same as it was on 17.04

968085
opera	google-chrome	ubuntu	linux
and finally neither google-chrome or opera are in the ubuntu repositories so you need to express your frustration with their linux support or lack of it directly to them not ubuntu

968085
opera	google-chrome
that decision is compounded by your failure to follow instructions for installing software in general and these 2 apps google-chrome and opera specifically have repositories you should be aware of since you used 17.04 should be using rather than downloading .deb and installing with software center

968095
versioning	upgrade
that said if an ubuntu live cd is failing to boot i d be reluctant to upgrade the machine to that versioning -- it sounds like there might be a bug that would cause the entire system to become useless

968251
chown	sudo
change ownership sudo chown mysql mysql var run mysqld

968282
disk	ram
your issue is caused by fast start up which causes windows to always put the system into a suspend to disk state so when the computer turns back on it loads out of ram skipping any os selections

968282
filesystems	ntfs
windows filesystems will be left in a hibernated state which linux ntfs driver doesn t handle

969653
xfce	kde
for instance kde takes more space and ram and requires more cpu cycles for routine functions than xfce

969653
xfce	kde
this makes xfce lighter than kde

969653
kde	kubuntu
this is what makes this flavor lightweight compared to say kubuntu which uses kde and has lots of eye candy the user can turn on especially in 14.04 which uses kde 4

969744
chown	sudo
so now i can t make any changes as the chown command i could use to fix it needs sudo

969748
chown	sudo
if you really just changed the ownership of the sudo command--that is the file usr bin sudo --then you can fix this by using pkexec instead of sudo to run chown and change the ownership back

969748
sudo	passwd
pkexec will prompt you for your passwd as would sudo if you were able to run it

969748
chown	sudo
if you have changed the ownership of many more files besides usr bin sudo and in particular if you have changed the ownership of all files in usr bin which would also happen if you changed permissions on or usr but passed the -r flag to chown specifying recursive operation then that will not be sufficient

969762

there are similar named themes on kde look and xfce look as well again all for emerald

it is certainly possible to remove the need to type sudo passwd for specific commands or even whole scripts

if you are really inclined to get rid of a package uninstalling it and installing it as needed is possible for non-essential applications but as with other linux distributions packages on ubuntu depend on other packages and have other packages that depend on them so when you install or remove a package other packages may be automatically installed as dependencies or replacements or removed because they depend on the package you remove

none of the scripts in your bin directory will respond to tab completion like they would if you were under your own profile and the command passwd clearly shows you are in the root directory as sudo rather than the home you directory where you is your username

982728
ubuntu	linux
the suggested solution to your problem as stated in bugs.launchpad.net ubuntu +source linux +bug 1710390 is to do the following

982729
folder	directory
i use a .hidden file to hide these folder in nemo as submitted here but the .hidden file will not hide files and directory from a command line listing such as the output of ls

982750
versioning	upgrade
in general you can t upgrade everything on an old versioning of ubuntu to the same versioning as a new ubuntu

982753

also you need to upgrade your installed software to latest versioning

982804

i found a tutorial indicating that mkpasswd -m sha-512 my password here would produce a salt and hash password that can be used in combination with useradd -m -p hash and salt passwd -s bin bash username however when i tried this on a test user i keep receiving incorrect login

982804
hash	salt
i also tried to make the user without the -p flag meaning don t add a password and manually copied the salt hash password into etc shadow which produces the same results as above login incorrect

982862

by lagging i mean going in and out of grey screens mouse keyboard become unresponsive

having no 16.04 or 14.04 installation disks i reinstalled 12.04 and tried going through the same process again but was unable to upgrade to even 14.04

982989

it works when i have focus on other application for instance google-chrome firefox browser etc

983005

perl is upgrade on artful and the old ack versioning isn t supported by the new perl

983020

move	drag
with the nvidia driver v 387 in use ubuntu detects my second monitor but it remains black even though i can move the mouse cursor onto it drag windows on it etc

983091
ubuntu	linux
it s important to note that the above steps will not work if you have installed the latest linux kernel 4.14 or higher i believe so it is highly likely that this workaround to get l2tp ipsec working with the 3des cipher will not work when the up and coming ubuntu 18.04 lts is released

983137
post	get
i can t post the whole output as i get an error message that i can t post more than eight links unless i have reputation of 10 or more

983169

this won t put back random other things that were removed like teamviewer but will at least get you back to a working state

983172
folder	directory
i cannot access test file as another user from my home folder but i can do it as another user when i m in directory test

983192
google-chrome	firefox
here s the solution that worked for me in google-chrome and firefox

983194
sudo	passwd
i can not get my sudo passwd to work in the ubuntu 16.04 64 bit

983244
udp	tcp
tried that with both tcp and udp

983264
folder	directory	dpkg	apt
when a package is installed via apt-get or apt there will be a .list file in var lib dpkg info folder with list of all directory and files that were used by the package

983278
kubuntu	gnome
my problem is that 1 the lock screen is no longer the new gnome one that came with the 17.01 upgrade 2 it still says kubuntu on reboot and startup and 3 my trackpad scrolling is now inverted with no way of changing this

983297
sudo	passwd
i suppose if multiple passwd are remembered then a different function key could be allocated for local host sudo but that s not essential because sudo is not as inconvenient because ubuntu does not prompt if the passwd was entered recently within a timeout period

983302
antivirus	rootkit
i was just wondering is there any good app for ubuntu that you could burn on a dvd from an .iso file choose it from the boot menu before ubuntu even starts and then scan the system externally for the kind of threats that are good at hiding from antivirus rootkit

983318
macbook	bootcamp
how can i install ubuntu 17.10 on my mid-2010 macbook pro 15 macbookpro6 2 that has a windows 7 x64 bootcamp partition already on it

983322
hide	show
after logging into my session it show the main window which i would like to automatically hide and minimize it to its tray icon

983333

next change the directory to rtlwifi_new-master folder

ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m using linux mint 18.2 but it is based on ubuntu 16.04 and i have many of the same problems pop up including this one

983363

i want to know if it is possible do something like this by the shell i have no desktop environment can i create an iso of the entire system that can be run into a virtual machine environment on my local pc for example using vmware or virtualbox

983371
ubuntu	linux
i found that linux_version_code defined in usr include linux version.h on my ubuntu 16.04.3 lts machine is equivalent to 4.4.90 whereas it is expected to be 4.10.0

983381
cpu	processors
processors - intelâ coreâ i5-7400 cpu 3.00ghz ã 4

983428
installation	upgrade
it can t be due to new software installation or upgrade since i didn t do any yesterday when it worked last

983435
filesystems	ntfs
is windows broken because i didn t find any partitions with ntfs filesystems

983441
ethernet	wireless
connection.autoconnect is yes for both wireless and ethernet connections

983442
ubuntu	debian
decades of debian and ubuntu developers have worked very hard to prevent data loss

983468
wav	flac	wav	ogg	flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg	mp3	wav
supported formats mp3 ogg aac wav flac

983475
versioning	upgrade
i would say you should not even use upgrade rather rebuild the image with --no-cache and execute the usual update and install pair which will fetch the latest versioning of a package

983499
gentoo	ubuntu
reboot gentoo and run sudo update-grub to pick up the ubuntu installation in the grub menu

983503
sudo	passwd
but when i comment out that entry and the install prompts me for the initial user the passwd for this initial user is locked and the user is not in the sudo group

983508
bluetooth	usb
i m using plugalbe usb bluetooth adaptor and ran into a similar problem

983529

983540
kde	gnome
so i had ubuntu 17.04 and had installed gnome budgie and kde plasma on it side by side - i like a change of gui scenery once in a while

983552
gentoo	ubuntu
some of them are based on ubuntu or gentoo

983566
filesystems	fat
some other tools may not show the sector size of the fat filesystems

983580
dpkg	apt
this is different from the question about how to remove an application in ubuntu because i want know the most exact equivalent in terms of actions performed of the rpm -e command and not just generally how to remove an application even if apt or apt-get remove packagename is the recommended or preferred way and not dpkg -r packagename or dpkg --remove packagename

983581
dpkg	apt
while dpkg performs actions on individual packages apt tools manage

983581
dpkg	apt
a major feature in apt is the way it calls dpkg â it does topological

983581
dpkg	apt
apt is like a front-end to dpkg but it keeps track of dependencies and won t silently let you remove a package another package still depends on

983592
cinnamon	gnome
i previously had ubuntu installed once with gnome 3 and once with the cinnamon desktop

983612

989695
dpkg	apt	ubuntu	debian
this is however advised against by debian on which ubuntu is based because you then canâ t uninstall the software with dpkg apt and because of the risk of package conflicts

989695
ubuntu	debian
as to your question of why packages become outdated packaging for debian ubuntu is hard

989695
ubuntu	debian
to get a package accepted you have to be able to build the package from source in controlled conditions using only libraries that have previously been packaged for debian ubuntu under these conditions

990454
folder	directory
you will notice that all it does is call out the location directory isolinux isolinux.cfg for the beginning of the boot preboot in a way to redirect linux to the real boot file since it is stored outside of the default locations that linux looks for the boot file but since it is in the uui folder and not in one of the three places linux looks while booting it gets overlooked like it doesnâ t exist

virtualbox for ubuntu requires a linux kernel and wsl does not have a linux kernel

while using part of your ram as ram disk might work it will consume that part of your ram allocated as disk and your programs won t be able to use it as ram anymore

you ll need to make sure that there is enough ram left for your tasks processing after you allocate that ram disk

995500
ubuntu	debian
now apt-get provides a way to perform that same task by itself without you having to install tasksel first and all you have to do is to give that same package name to apt-get but just append a caret at the end to tell apt-get that it is a tasksel package task identifier and not a regular package name in debian ubuntu repositories

if i create the two folder in mnt while the first drive is mounted the volume1 and volume2 directory are actually created into the original share drive

996043
sudo	passwd
likely it is a created user account and so this may not apply but for other people who come across this thread i mention this when using the current ubuntu 16.04 ami on aws the ubuntu user by default does not require a passwd for sudo so that cloud-init can use it to execute

from what i can guess the ubuntu partition has been quite damaged if i remeber well it was on dev sda7 but there is no such partition any more and on line 236 of the boot-info file is written that there is no linux os but i hope that i am wrong

which detects the wrapped-passphrase file in home sirah18 .ecryptfs asks for the old login passphrase and uses that to unwrap the mount passphrase and mount the .private folder at a directory in tmp

996247

if you have one or more free usb flash drives you could use them to test different os ubuntu 16.04 lubuntu 16.04 mint etc. without installing them on your machine just to see if the problems you experience persist

modifying the values do not have any affect - the only resolution is upgrade 5.0.x to a versioning that re-connects this functionality

996795
bluetooth	usb
plug in a secondary keyboard to usb do not disconnect bluetooth

996807
chgrp	mount
i have some ideas to make it work like adding both users to the same group and using chgrp fiddling with mount points although one relevant question saw little activity using access control lists acl although i had just read about it for the first time and have no clue yet

996808
filesystems	ntfs
thus if you are going to copy data from an ext partition and paste it into an ntfs partition you will end up with a bunch or garbage since the two filesystems are radically different

996820

i found a help message somewhere that said to go to system administration hardware drivers but as far as i can tell i have no such folder or directory on my system

mouse	keyboard
in fact it appears as if the mouse and keyboard freezer up completely

996871
ubuntu	linux
i don t think i can use the normal ubuntu software update program for this because it looks on standard linux repositories and i want my software to look on web pages for the updates

the reason is one of the programs is code editpor for which i need quite a lot of room but not whole screen and the other is google-chrome or firefox developer tools for which i don t need so much space

997039
ethernet	wireless
after making the suggested changes detaching the ethernet cable and rebooting the wireless is now working as expected

assuming you have a microsoft filesystems ntfs fat32 or exfat in the sd card i suggest the following modifications

997077
umask	mount
add the mount option umask to provide the desired permissions for all users

997107

the two jobs are complimentary and the relationship is described in the cron job 16.04 and newer

997108
umask	sudo	umask	chmod

filesystems	btrfs
after a routine btrfs scrub of the filesystems an uncorrectable error came up

recently on one of the reboots to switching between ubuntu server and win 10 the screens did not wanted to wake up happened often and just blindly typing sudo reboot and passwd like most of the times didn t work i had to reboot by reset button on the computer after that windows 10 works fine grub works fine but when i choose ubuntu to reboot it just goes to a blank screens which wouldn t be so bad except for the fact that it seems to be stuck or frozen as well can t access the server via ssh or ping the static ip i set it up on and of course plex ftp etc is down

997180
jobs	cron
there s no message no sounds just a black screen after selecting on the grub ubuntu server at reboot and each os is installed on a separate ssd hd what s the best way to approach it and try to solve it without loosing the configuration already done and the programs it ll be a pain to setup again 3 odoo environments git vsftp samba sendmail plex static ip all the cron jobs i had to backup stuff i can t access now and remount the third disc that ubuntu and windows shared

997182

so i select ubuntu with linux 4.10.0-42-generic recovery mode

disk	ram
the 2443 mb mem used is the total amount of ram that your system is using but including disk caches and other things which can immediately be dropped in favour of applications if needed

997461
disk	ram
these kinds of caches speed things like disk access up without having an impact on how much ram is available for your applications

997463
cpu	processors
speed of processors is also kinda irrelevant here and all benefits of having multi-core processors can go to nill if program that you use to read a file with is written as sequential program not as parallel program hence can t make any use of multiple cores or there s memory wall problem where width of memory bus speed of memory can t support cpu s speed

997479

there is no need for the other machines on the 192.168.0.x lan to reach the vpn clients in other words my machine does not have to be a bridge

sudo	passwd
run sudo your-command and enter your own passwd when asked for passwd

1002372
daemons	systemd

this persists on both debian and flavors of ubuntu

i ve tried adding nomodeset at the end of the kernel boot line in the grub config as well as tried changing some of the gfxmode grub variables but nothing seems to prevent that initial mode switching and resulting blank screens

1002520
folder	directory
the other solution is to copy the compiled executable into creating the folder first if it doesn t exist and then add that directory to your with either directly on the command line yourself or as part of your .bashrc file so the changes are persistent

1002527
post	get
found some post saying similar things like can t get 2560x1080 out of an amd card using radeon driver

1002640
dpkg	apt
i m also forced to use dpkg because both apt and gdebi don t work for some reason possibly because the version i want to install was meant for ubuntu 16.10 and it s possible virtualbox at version 5.1.14 won t work for me at all on ubuntu 17.10 but i wish to try it anyway

cpu	processors
my conclusion so far is that a controller is part of the cpu not a graphics card and that i do not have a dedicated graphic accelerator that this is referring to a graphics card with its own processors separate from the cpu and likewise that this graphics card should have 64 mb of its own memory

quote mp3fs is a read-only fuse filesystem which transcodes between audio formats currently flac and ogg vorbis to mp3 on the fly when opened and read

1006059

this can let you use a flac or ogg vorbis collection with software and or hardware which only understands the mp3 format or transcode files through simple drag-and-drop in a file browser

in brief on debian ubuntu run sensible-editor

on ubuntu and other debian-based systems you should use sensible-editor instead of editor vi or nano since it allows a per-user setting of the default editor unlike editor which depends on the system-wide symlink set by update-alternatives

you will get a list search for any cinnamon package and then try this if that didn t help you can otherwise just reinstall gnome with sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-shell hope this helps

this is the normal behaviour being in the sudoers list only means that you can use the sudo command but you ll be asked for your passwd

1008838
ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	mint	debian	mint
since both ubuntu and mint are based on debian the package files in the repo are .deb type and your installer whether using apt directly the built-in software center or something like synaptic will attempt to install them -- but where you re likely to run into trouble is with dependencies

1008838
ubuntu	mint
if a program like whatsapp is offered in mint but not in ubuntu that likely implies that it depends on something not included in stock ubuntu

1008838
ubuntu	mint
start chasing dependencies or downloading bunches of them from foreign repositories and you ll pretty rapidly wind up with a system that no one can support because when something doesn t work there ll be no way to know if it s an ubuntu component or a mint import

then i read that it could be the ntfs filesystems of the story mounted with cifs

1011337

as i learned apparently linux can usually only read from ntfs filesystems and ntfs-3g is required

i am installing systemd units from a debian package that i am making myself onto an ubuntu 16.04 box and even though i have overridden dh_systemd_enable dh_systemd_start and dh_installinit my systemd services only start on reboot or if i manually start them

1011359

because debian flavored linux automatically enables and starts systemd units they should be started on install right away

other locations usually inlude windows shares smb cifs protocol which does not provide remote command execution

1011851

udp is not guaranteed-delivery though and overall throughput is faster these days so the developers switched to tcp and introduced an authentication mechanism to prevent undesired traffic from overloading the servers

1012608
