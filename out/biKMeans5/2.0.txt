it will scale your bitmap but not greater than the width and height that is because it can cause blurriness to your bitmap
edit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize that

the precision of the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors is much greater than the precision of the compass and gps
the vertical spacing in firefox between the real estate search h2 tag and the form input field for san francisco ca #city-field input tag is perfect but in google-chrome google-chrome is applying more extra vertical spacing than desired
the logic is that the default orientation for a device who s width is greater than it s height is most likely a tablet and not a mobile phone device
the problem is that when i move to an android device whose orientation is landscape by default the device s hardware is arranged in such a way that it is clear it is intended to be used mainly in landscape orientation the x and y coordinates are reversed and the fact that the window s height is greater than its width can t be used to determine whether the user is holding the device with it s top up and its bottom down

from there on the width slowly increases again as the part of the string still on line 1 linearly gets wider as the font-size increases
the problem is that when there is some fixed height opera generates more columns than specified in column-count instead of adding scroll
but in safari browser the table cell height is bigger than the width i did not set the whole table dimensions
somethinghere s solution isn t bad but when the screen s width is greater than its height the image will leave 20 of white space on top and bottom

in other words when the image s width is more than it s height then there will be an space in between the bottom border of the uiimageview and the image itself
when the height gets dramatically larger while width stays the same we throw a hide keyboard event
first one margin auto is better if you can know width of container list and you don t want centre content of this container
for height it just meant the height needed to fit the contents but for width auto is actually more complicated
i can t find a way to stop non-flex divs to become larger than their parent when their combined children s height gets too tall

i know emacs tries to be intellectual and opens its helper buffers depending on which dimension of the window is bigger so it may appear in vertical split window if current width is bigger than height and in horizontal split otherwise
this is weird cause i would figure that the width should have a bigger value than the height right now
i have tried following code but it distorts the image if height is more than width but looks perfectly if it is vice versa
if you set the width and height of the element and set the offset to any size the same size for both left and right or top and bottom it will be centered because the element cannot get any larger than its width and height attributes
yes there is add containerdiv img inside block add the width and height if the image this should give it a fixed size if the image is smaller width and height is smaller than the properties in the div the image will be stretched and if larger the image will be shrunk

i just re-sized the image if the image s width and height is greater than the frame size and displayed the re-sized image on it and if the image dimension is smaller than the frame i displayed as it is
i m sure if we did these same calculations with an image which had a greater height than width we d have the same problem with it having black space at the bottom of the image instead
i tried changing the screen resolution in a virtual machine orientation change is really just a screen resolution change that results in width being larger than height or vice versa and could not trigger any layout events
the images can be of any resolution size and the height sometimes is bigger than the width and vice versa for both images
you could use the tga format which is more common than ppm and allows true grayscale images
if this app can rotate you might need two sets of constraints one for when the width is less than the height the other for when the height is less than the width
right now i scale by height which works to some degree however as the width gets smaller the image gallery will be cut off as the container has overflow hidden on some smaller widths as it is adjusting by the height of the container to stay in proportion but doesn t consider the width of the container too essentially the width is longer than the container width
the immediate children children .box that are display table-cell will take the height of the parent that is display table
however nowhere in the code have you checked that the width of the view added to the top of the view is not greater than the height of bitmaptosave
the orientation media feature is portrait when the value of the height is greater than or equal to the value of the width mdash
the action icons are centered in portrait mode whereas the toolbar in landscape mode is higher and the icons are not centered
right now what this code is producing is the right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the height
it s because you re using and orientation portrait so once the width of the window has a higher value than the height none of your css will be taken into account because it s considered landscape orientation at that point
the draggable div is 3 times bigger than one droppable
it will also automatically apply a 90 degree rotation transformation if the width is bigger than the height before applying any scaling
