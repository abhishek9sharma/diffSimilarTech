it creates getter and setter by default for all of your properties

23040888
getter	setter
if you implement both setter and getter or in case if read-only property the getter the compiler will not generate the instance variable and you have to do it yourself

23040888

getter	setter
return getter setter deleter

23044311

i believe the getter setter and deleter of the same field should be grouped together inside some block of code in my case i chose a function definition and not be spread around all over the class in up to 3 seperate methods even if they have the same name they re still separated syntactically .

look in the documentation for flockfile and note the mention that all stdio functions that operate on of which printf does on stdout should behave as if they invoke flockfile and funlockfile to acquire access to the stream. there is no specification on the atomicity of the locking it could be down to the character for all you know in which case interleaving runs amok but it should still be none-the-less safe

then as the browser width is changed no matter how narrow the width will continue to be 33 and the height will change automatically to maintain aspect ratio but there will never be space below the images

23049938
background-image	background-position
then you set background-image and background-position in div#target by x y position

23049938

2 - you capture with html2canvas then using canvas javascript api you crop image by x y position and width height from div#target see example #242 comment

23049938

23050047
int	double
at the end of the makedeductions int age double amount method you have this

23050047
int	double
in what now would be part of the makedeductions int age double amount method body you now have references to variable accountnumber which is declared in the method and thus doesn t exist in this context

23050047
int	double
and yet the same for makedeductions with only makedeductions int age double amount having been declared

23050047
int	double
careful here though remember that i m asuming you deleted those likes i specified at the beginning so this code is inside the makedeductions int age double amount body meaning that if you call makedeductions with int and double parameters you are in fact calling this very method which can cause an infinite loop if you don t have a stopping condition to avoid the method to call itself infinitely causing a stack overflow

23050075
int	chars
the type you use to pass the value around almost don t matter you shoud use a byte-aligned type chars is fine for this although it will likely be upcast to int after almost any numeric operation so int might be easier

setinterval	settimeout
i have tried this on setinterval but using setinterval is a badnews for my application which is why i switch to settimeout

what i m attempting to do here is fairly simple when the user hovers over an element from #feature1 i show and then hide on mouseout the corresponding element in #feature2

23050189
hide	show
i could write functions for each .items element and it s corresponding .post element but i m thinking it should be possible with the right naming scheme to write this as a single function by first getting the id of the hovered on .items element then applying the show hide or adding class whatever by looking for the right .post element with the saved id variable + -post

23050205
post	get
and i can t figure out what your loop is supposed to be doing but based on your post this is how you could get the mean of the duplicated columns

23050787
int	chars
many systems require more and slower code to perform arithmetic on chars values than on int values -- and chars values are implicitly promoted to int in most cases anyway

23050787
int	chars
if you need to store a large array of small int values an array of some chars type makes sense

23050787
int	chars

23066142

23066900
for-loop	loops
when i debug it in netbeans the variable for the first for-loop just increments itself and then moves onto the arraylist creation loops which works great

23066902
installation	upgrade
this code mutates the installation directory on first install if a value wasn t passed at the command line and if the product wasn t previously installed in which case directories are immutable i also use to get a random productcode and pass in an upgradecode value since the project template uses majorupgrades out of the box and each instance is a unique product family for upgrade purposes

23067305
calloc	malloc
the operator makes it clear that you are passing the address of the pointer you got back from malloc calloc

23067305
calloc	malloc
getline allows you to allocate storage and pass getline a pointer to the pointer that malloc calloc returns to you which you assign to your pointer

23067305
calloc	malloc
it is possible to pass it foo null in which case it will do a blind allocation of storage for you by quietly calling malloc calloc hidden from view

23067305
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
blind allocations are very bad and an invitation to problematic memory leaks because nowhere in your code are you calling malloc calloc so you or someone who later is tasked with maintaining your code won t know to free the pointer to that storage because some function you called allocates memory without you knowing it except for reading the function description and understanding that it s doing a blind allocation

23067305
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
since getline will realloc the memory your call to malloc calloc provided if it s too small it s best to just allocate your best guess as to the required storage with a call to calloc and make it clear what the pointer char foo is doing

23067305
realloc	calloc
this isn t an arguement against doing your own call to calloc because if you set foo null you re guaranteed that getline will have to call realloc

23067305
free	calloc
in summary make a call to calloc with some good guess as to size which will make it obvious to anyone reading your code that memory is being allocated which must be free d no matter what getline does or doesn t do later

23067313
post	put
sorry but i don t have enough reputation to post images so i put them as links.

23067344

int	boolean
there is a simple workaround for that restriction which does not require a wrapper procedure simply wrap the boolean parameter in pl sql in a case statement and use an int for binding

23088049

alternatively by getting the dimensions width and height of the player and the collision object you could put the player in a position so that it is only just touching the collision object

23088072
subtract	add
note 1 biginteger s are immutable and 2 you have to use the methods add subtract etc

23088073

23089011
put	get
ps currently i have no idea on how you will sync the scrollbar of the list when you change the view i just know that if that is possible than you ll be needed to put a lot of effort or you can try to mew around with dom selector to get the list as element and then access the scrollbar

i m currently using dbcontext .database.sqlquery to pull these values but i have a mix of int and double values that are returned depending on which field in the table is pulled

23089144
int	double
i keep getting type cast exceptions because i m trying to force the int to be a another type like float or double through the sqlquery call

23089161
superclass	subclassing
when making the instance variables visible to subclassing and someone would have to change the superclass and maybe remove the field in a new version it would make that library version incompatible with older versions

23089161
getter	setter
using another variable and calling the getter in the constructor like above however would be problematic because you d also have to override the setter in order to get notifications on changes which adds complexity and code with little to no benefit

23089205
google-chrome	firefox
i m running google-chrome so i checked firefox

23089209

when eth0 of hostb receives a packet from hosta maybe a icmpv6 ns echo request etc. or a udp tcp packet encapsulated with ipv6 header i want to forward this packet from eth0 to tap0

23089618
scrypt	salt
the security of the salt lies in its uniqueness not its secrecy and if you use a hashing algorithm that is slow to run bcrypt and scrypt are recommended for this it will make bulk password-guessing less feasible if users choose long passwords

23089636
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven put this in the pom.xml file

23089660
phpmyadmin	softaculous

23089803
width	height
i don t know if this is the right to obtain the width and height of an uploaded image

23089844
debian	linux
the same bundle under linux debian is produced without any problems

23089855
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to mavericks this might be why you have an old versioning of libcurl

23089876
sum	floor
the result of the sum is floor col + row + 1 is never an integer and i don t know why

23089911
google-chrome	firefox
the placeholder attribute can be used on inputs but some browsers handle it s functionality in different ways for example while google-chrome and firefox keeps the placeholder text visible until a user hits a character internet explorer makes it disappear as soon as the input filed is in focus state

23089929
jar	war
imho the best approach for those two cases would be to provide two artifacts a fat jar for easier standalone setup and an application-only war ear for those who want to deploy the application in their own container

23089997
punctuation	words
this would not be found because there is punctuation after the words bus

23089997
vbscript	vb6
vb6 does not have regular expressions built in but you can use the microsoft vbscript regular expressions functionality to accomplish this

23090024
portrait	landscape
i created two background images for portrait and landscape i want browser change background image automatically when client rotate their screen

23090034
hide	show
i assumed it worked the same way as above since the documentation show the same hide method as well as the explanation

23090050
prepare	execute
i can t see your whole code but i m guessing that it is returning an empty array because you have not actually execute the prepare sql statement yet

23090063
getter	setter
getter and setter inserting is not the same also because a class property should be declared initially

23090075
put	get
you put it on the server side and have your ios or android app call it from the application to get the json

23090082
int	double
if you document contains fields with types other than string and you index null value to a double or int field you will get the same error

23090099
versioning	upgrade
this is one time thing that happens when you upgrade from versioning 1.0 to 2.0

23090143
hide	show
although you can programmatically add column fields to the columns collection it is easier to list the column fields declaratively in the gridview control and then use the visible property of each column field to show or hide each column field

23090173
min	max
something that is less predictable than a min or max

23090178
put	get
this is what we ve managed to put together and hope this helps anyone else looking to get instagram information

23090182
button	checkbox
when i un-check any of checkbox and click button it will hide all of columns using toggle slideup

23090182
hide	show	slideup	slidedown	button	checkbox
to use toggle slideup to hide or slidedown to show base on checkbox and not need done button

23090182
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
is works fine but what i want is under toggle slideup to hide and slidedown to show not just hide or show

23090215
std	ostream
so the parameter to this print method is a reference to an instance of ostream actually std ostream

23090220

c2678 binary no operator found which takes a left-hand operand of type std ostream or there is no acceptable conversion

23090254
post	get
its web interface for big softswitch based on custom asterisk where in one place i need to get data from post message from website

23090333
required	placeholder
the key point here is that both string.format and stringbuilder.appendformat required a format string with placeholder embedded in curly braces where the arguments following the format specifier will be inserted

23090350
versioning	upgrade
after doing a spring hibernate upgrade to the latest versioning i hit problems running my tests under maven

23090379
fgets	strtol
in general i find it better to use fgets alternatively if you are using c99 gets_s -- although i still prefer fgets for maximum portability to older compiler environments for all user-based input then if necessary use sscanf strtol and the like to convert the string into other data types as this will read data by line in a way that is buffer-safe and you won t have to worry about things left in the input buffer

23090441
median	percentile
what i would like to do is plotting the median but also displaying the two quartiles as well as the 90th percentile at each timepoint

23090443
build.gradle	gradlew
the chromahashview project is a standalone gradlew project with a build.gradle settings.gradle and gradlew wrapper at its project root and two modules demo and library

23090472
comparator	comparable
per the documentation of comparable comparator returns

23090572
subtract	addition
if you want to enhance your trigger to handle updates to sales in addition to inserts you would want to compute the difference between the old.qty and the new.qty and subtract that from the stock of the product

23090582
innodb	myisam
innodb is more scalable and myisam doesn t support any of the properties of acid

23090584
post	get
i thought that directly calling a method inside a model wouldn t respect mvc pattern but calling a method of a controller through a new get post request to the server would be kind of a waste because on more complex pages i should make too many calls

23090667
cdr	cons
checking if cdr x is nil is a nice way to check that the list length is at least two because nil is special and even if it s not a cons cell it s guaranteed that cdr nil is nil

23090668
int	double
decimal is a floating point type in that it has a significand and an exponent both int - it s just that unlike float and double the point that gets shifted by the exponent is a decimal point rather than a binary point

23090668
floating-point	fractions
a decimal number is a floating-point value that consists of a sign a numeric value where each digit in the value ranges from 0 to 9 and a scaling factor that indicates the position of a floating decimal point that separates the integral and fractions parts of the numeric value

23090668
integer	fractions
the binary representation of a decimal value consists of a 1-bit sign a 96-bit integer number and a scaling factor used to divide the 96-bit integer and specify what portion of it is a decimal fractions

but then i thought to make it work as a proper photo viewer if anyone click on its image file eg png jpg gif

23090745
gtk	cairo
i first installed gtk and cairo as per the instructions here chart instructions and here gtk cairo and have the newest versions as of this post cairo-0.12.5.3 and gtk-0.12.5.7

23090745
gtk	cairo
after removing those path elements and attempting a reinstall of all of cairo and gtk

23090745
gtk	cairo
i tried a clean install of the haskell gtk and cairo packages the whole process and ensured all the dlls loaded this time and verified the gtk directory with process explorer

23090789
folder	directory
since dlls are not loaded until run-time actually load time and since dlls that are not in the same directory as the .exe and since path shows the search order for those two folder as c appname bin64

23090801
put	get
after each time the player makes a guess where he put up what he thinks might be the correct colour order he will get to know how many of his pins which were right colour on the right place and right colour but on the wrong place

23090811
uilabel	uibutton
for example instead of uibutton uitextbox uilabel etc we could have uiframe be the base class for all components that require the ability to move

23090826
folder	directory	chmod	mkdir
then in your upload server-side script use an mkdir command and chmod to create and set permissions to the directory accordingly then move the uploaded file to that folder

23090832
width	height
i also noticed you set height and width dynamically and i m sure there is a way to let the script calculate these parameters as it uses a polyfill for getcomputedstyle

23090858
jlist	jtable
in the top theres 3 buttons i assume its either jlist or jtable items

23090858
jlist	jtable
firstly that the three jlist playlistlist applist and yourmusiclist i assume its jlist share the same jscrollpane and therefor the jlist jtable or whatever it is have to change size height depended on the amount of items it contains

23090858
jlist	jtable
i think that i use wrong layoutmanager for the jpanel the items should be contained in and i use the wrong kind of component jlist jtable

23090892
ubuntu	debian
in debian ubuntu

23090937
goto	break
using a flag variable which is checked after each loop which could set it for early bailout using successive break -statements is a classic of those fearing goto or being condemned by lack of it

23090940
width	height
you need to set explicite width and height to wrap text inside another container that you rotate and translate back down

23090943
goto	break
technically to answer the how to break out multiple loops you can use a goto statement with an appropriately placed label although it may not be the best solution

23090952
hide	show
i am using js to show hide div when user clicks on tag .

23090954
linefeed	delimiter
to delimiter brand engine description and remarks i could use cr linefeed cr linefeed but since description is containing cr linefeed cr linefeed aswell and it could be any number of rows in description

23090962
width	height
well when you rotate your items your height is actually your width declaration

23090962
width	height
unfortunately from the way you ve architected your height widths using percentages you cannot really achieve what you want as there is now way to tell a child element to be a certain percent of it s parent s height which is what you re aiming for a s width should be 100 of the #menu s height

23090962
width	height
you can hardcode the height of menu and give that same height to the width of your children

23090962
box-sizing	border-box
if you additionally want padding you can subtract hardcoded values or change our box-sizing to a border-box depending on your accessibility reqs

23091030
free	malloc
there are c-style ways to deal with this but they generally rely on the assumption that mycustomfunction will malloc the memory internally and you will free it or that you will call some custom function to release the memory

23091045
spaces	delimiter
instead the delimiter is 13 spaces

23091095
windows	wow64
developer edition on windows nt 6.2 build 9200 wow64

23091096
ostringstream	std
in c++03 you can use std ostringstream class to format a string using

23091118
hash	salt
this isn t a problem however because the passwordencoder interface has both the string encodepassword string rawpass object salt method to generate hash but also the boolean ispasswordvalid string encpass string rawpass object salt method to validate them

23091118
hash	md5
with simpler hash like md5 sha-1 etc

23091162
zoo	chron
try the zoo and chron packages

23091184
bash	zsh
keep in mind however that zsh is not bash so just cause you have to source your .bash_profile every time you open a terminal does not mean that you have to do that with zsh

23091256
for-loop	arrays
generate n random numbers in a for-loop using the built in function random and index the arrays

23091361
ssl	https
if i add ssl redirect to https via

23091385
free	malloc
alternatively you could allocate space on the heap using malloc and return a pointer but that means the user needs to free memory he never allocated counter intuitive and might result in memory leaks if he forgets to do so

23091420
hide	show
the code is used to show and hide a div using one button when i run it locally it does not work

23091425
int	chars
argv is supposed to be a chars array you have to read the chars and then convert them into an int

23091461
google-chrome	safari
this works just fine in safari can t figure out why google-chrome won t load the stuff

23091515
gruntjs	yeoman
a frequent contributor to yeoman also made this task grunt-build-control which will let you simply run something like gruntjs deploy

spaces	delimiter
i copied the string input to another array words and used strtok with spaces delimiter to store individual words into an array of pointers to string

first i used python 3.3 qt 4.8 and pyqt 4.10.4 on linux ubuntu 13.10 after upgrading to ubuntu 14.04 i tried python 3.4 qt 5.2.1 and pyqt 5.2.1 because of the changes from qt 4.8 to 5.2 are several modifications in the code of the application necessary but not in the xml-code in the svg-files the behavior of qgraphicsview is in both versions the same

23095800
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am trying to use the jquery.load function and it works on firefox but not on safari and google-chrome

i am using your charts but i am not being able to see them on google-chrome and on firefox i have to unblock

23095842
google-chrome	firefox
browser google-chrome 34.0.1847.116 m and firefox 25

23095854
minimum	max
with this it is pretty easy to see that the p we need to obtain minimum dist to the cuboid is euclidean closest to the target with respect to x and y and with the max represented radius

23095858
width	height
i d like to be able to change the dpi and possibly alter the width height

23095862
free	malloc
in case of tcmalloc it seems that system alloc is about 10 faster in malloc and free operations when running 8 threads

23095863
scrollable	panels
i am using this code to draw a scrollable panels on win form

23095876
width	height
i set the width and height of the .orbit-next class to be equal to that of the image i m adding

23095876
next	except
for .orbit-previous the rules are basically the same as above except margin-right becomes margin-left and you use the prev arrow path instead of the next

23095878
min	max	range	min	range	max
assuming that you don t care about the exact output and are looking for the min and max of each range you can use diff cumsum range as follows

23095890
ng-show	ng-hide
that said i m not sure if i have to use ng-show or ng-hide in the fields to be shown hidden and then use ng-click on the advanced link to make change their status

23095932
children	parent
to convert your tree to a flat structure you should give each node in your tree a uid an array of its children and if need be a reference to its parent

23095932
children	parent
as you send your flattened tree to the server you then serialize the objects so that each node you send to the server is just an untyped object containing its uid and the uids of its children and parent

23095965
x86	mips
many processors do have 128-bit simd registers x86 sse registers arm neon registers mips simd architecture registers

23095965
sse	avx
x86 avx extends sse registers to 256 bits and avx-512 doubles the size again

23095982
superclass	subclassing
extending a class as a general rule only makes sense when the superclass and the subclassing have an is-a relationship

23095982
superclass	subclassing
in other words when the subclassing you are creating by extension really is-a version of the superclass

23095982
superclass	subclassing
the problem with extension and i m sure you realize this is that changes in either the superclass or the subclassing are not carried through in the other related instances

23095987
icmp	snmp	snmp	mib
there are mib options to ask a device to ping or trace route something -- which seem to be asking a device to icmp to a third party and indicate success failure -- but the colloquial use of snmp ping is to check responsiveness by asking a simple snmp question of a static data point and get a response

23095989
getter	setter
and departmentposition with all setter and getter of course

23095999
post	get
the problem is to post or get request or response from database and i don t have idea how to start

23096007
openssl	crypto++
or you could get a library such as openssl or crypto++

23096024
ng-show	ng-hide
ng-show and ng-hide are used for manipulating the view as you would like

23096024
hide	show
the error most people do when starting angular is that they directly try to target content to show hide instead of creating states of the form

23096025
getter	setter
in most cases all automatically generated getter and setter of java classes need to use this to distinguish parameter name from actual object attribute

23096026
junit	jmockit
below is my private method in my datatap class and i am trying to junit test this private method using jmockit -

implements	extends
however your savingsaccount extends or implements bankaccount so you can store reference to savingsaccount in b which is of type bankaccount because savingsaccount is also a bankaccount

23096199
integer	unsigned
as 200_success alluded to there are two things going on here that are combining to produce the correct output despite the obvious problems of mixing unsigned and signed integer values

23096206
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the for-loop that removes the this entry from the arrays should not be inside the read write loops

23096373
decltype	auto
it was a quick fix for code that didn t compile properly to begin with nevermind the auto decltype problem

23096381
public	protected
if c1 contains a protected method then an overriding method in c2 may be protected or public

23096381
public	protected
so i think the reason is so that classes which all inherit from object can declare their own overriding clone and finalize methods and make them protected if they choose instead of public

23096394
post	put
i haven t tested put or post

23096400
sudo	passwd
when prompted the user running the script must enter the sudo passwd in terminal to allow the script to bind the laptop to active directory

23096420
getter	setter
since you have a setter function a plain solution is to also define a getter and only access member x through this function

23096421
width	height
i ve set the width height via data attributes - currently i have a scaling variable set to adjust the size of the orbs depending on the width of the chart

23096459
client-side	server-side
if you re need to redraw resize the chart client-side i really don t see any performance benefit in trying to draw the graphs server-side

23096501
width	height
in 1 the projection-on-earth is computed using ogr2ogr but you still need to set the width and height with topojson to adjust the viewport see for an example

23096501
width	height
to do this you need to set which projection you want to use as well as some parameters width and height

23096510
chown	chgrp
the reason is i want users to be able to create a group then chgrp chown the files they own and give read access to specified groups of users

23096522
put	get
i wonder if it is really needed to put the number of times that the tag was used to get a better performance

23096551
listboxitem	textbox
for example let s say we have a crude listbox with a textbox for each listboxitem

23096600
punctuation	words
the only completely thorough way of doing this is to use the instr function and then check that the next character is a punctuation character a newline or the words is at the end of the string

23096696
profiling	instrumentation
use time profiling or file activity instrumentation to find offending method calls

23096711

when clicked it should trigger a function that adds the class show to another div like some sort of popup so it is visible and when clicked again it should hide it

23096793
hide	show
this a jquery function in another file that i need to call using the link because it fetches the data that will be inside the div thus why i wanted to just add a hide show

23096866

however when the view is pushed it expands in both width and height even though i have specifically set the dimensions of the view in interface builder

23096919

23097225
wildfly	jboss
you can also use red hat s cape dwarf project to run gae apps on top of the wildfly appserver previously jboss without modification

23097233
width	height
in order to be able to draw the circle around the center point if 230x300 you will need to subtract the radius from each point and then generate a width and height diameter of double that.

23097233
width	height
so this example basic draws a rectangle around the point of 230x300 with a width height of 200 radius 100 and draws lines through this point to illustrate the center point the oval then drawn about.

23097302
accelerometer	gyroscope

that get s put in place for the chart.as_html

23097369
performselector	delegation
i m actually kind of at a loss for why the tutorial wants you to call performselector here respondstoselector seems a lot more appropriate and performselector will raise an exception if your delegation object isn t of the right class anyway so there s no point in guarding the actual message with an if statement

23097382
post	get
i have read a few forum post before on angular promises but can t get it to work in my instance

i created a functioning encode of sintel.2010.720p.mkv as webm vp8 vorbis using a modification of the transcoding.c example in the ffmpeg source

23098080
vp8	ffprobe
i noticed ffprobe produces a tbc of double the fps for this and other h.264 videos while the tbc of the resulting vp8 stream produced by the ffmpeg command is the default 1000

23098080
decoder	encoder
the stock transcoding.c example copies the time base of the decoder to the encoder avcodeccontext which is 1 48

if you are trying to make your images responsive always 100 width of it s container element you can just specify width 100 and leave out the height specification

23098180
inherited	subclassing
to call the other constructors of the inherited class a super call needs to be made inside the constructors of the subclassing

23098196
superclass	subclassing
use super from subclassing to call the superclass argument constructor s

23098216
junit	testng
you can set up either junit or testng to handle parallel tests

23098216
junit	testng
personally i would recommend testng although if you re just starting junit is slightly less of a learning curve

23098216
junit	testng
don t be satisfied using your test runner junit testng etc. for the output

hash	salt
it is hash and salt and i know security is a whole other topic but the point is - some fields i don t want them to be able to see at all

23098445

methods are inherited only if they are public or protected or has no access modifier

23098457

memory mapping means that there is a representation of all the on disk files available but only a portion of these files may be present in ram

23098512
disk	ram
when a given page is needed and it is not in ram it can be read from disk into ram to be accessed

23098526

probably you should save at the top of the for-loop then use the saved value any time you re currently examining later in the code the if inside the while loops and the final assignment after it ends

23098556
getter	setter
both a and b are ivars but a does not have implicitly created setter getter by default

after all values have been assigned to the arrays in theory it should run the next test which is right below that for-loop

23100460
hide	show
probably use should use show and hide function of jquery

23100488
stdout	stderr
however this separation of stdout an and stderr allow these two streams to be redirected in various ways

23100488
stdout	stderr
hence normal program output is generally sent to the stdout stream while error messages warnings etc. are generally sent to stderr

23100488
stdout	stderr
while one could just use printf and send the message to stdout stream the convention is to send such error messages to the stderr stream

for-loop	loops
use a standard for-loop where you control the order of the properties instead of a for in loops which gets the properties in no particular order

23110254

clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
in your case i would suggest using setinterval instead of settimeout and call clearinterval to interrupt the function calls

23111155
setinterval	settimeout
and im not shure about this statement javascript likes settimeout more than setinterval which gives a little performance boost

23111166

23112129
tunnel	packets
routeres inside a tunnel can make use of the extra ip headers to route packets to tunnel endpoints

23112129
tunnel	packets
since we already have a outer ip header which sufficies to route the whole packets through the tunnel to its endpoints

23112129
tunnel	packets
and how would this packets be processed in the tunnel

23112996
preorder	postorder
if we have two lists preorder 1 2 4 5 3 and postorder 4 5 2 3 1 we know that 1 is the root of the tree because it is the first number of the preorder list and the last number of the postorder list

23115091
chown	sudo
some of the apps that i use such as ssh maven dropbox and dbeaver have their config conveniently and cleanly stored in the home directory .ssh .m2 .dropbox .dbeaver respectively so migrating those was a cakewalk just copying the directory from the old home to the new using sudo and then chown

23115836
stdout	fflush
to fflush the buffered data in stdout you can use this function

23115838
stdout	fflush
that may be because the program uses a library for writing output that contains a buffer as is typically the case for c s stdout file stream and the output isn t actually written to the device until that buffer is fflush which doesn t happen when you kill the program

23115919
multiplying	modulo

hash	salt
edit this question is not about what adding salt to a hash is how to do it nor how it increases security

23116576
hash	salt
people say blowfish is the most secure encryption there is but hash encryption like sha-256 doesn t display what salt was used or not in the hash itself which would seem to be more secure

23116576
hash	salt
as with the hash above acefghikl.oprtuwyyz is the salt plain as day right there in the hash itself

23116576
hash	salt
all someone would have to do is add this salt to the values they already have in their rainbow table hash database or what have them and there you go the purpose of the salt is defeated

23116581

when i set the smaller values for width and height it works fine

23116595

23116610
jax-ws	jax-rs
i have a xjc jaxb-backed which is consumed by a common service repository and exposed through jax-ws and now hopefully through jax-rs

23116621
overwrite	preserve
this also smells terrible - it potentially overwrite fields that were fetched from the api server and since i cache data models to save on api roundtrips and handle realtime updates it also means that view state gets preserve when the user navigates away and then back to the same place in the spa or that the view state would be linked in the event the same data is displayed twice on the screen say the same profile is showing in three places on the screen as three replies to a post

23116628
hash	salt
if you don t add a salt one can easily lookup your hash in a rainbow table and hack it in seconds

23116648

use pow function from math.h

23116653
sorting	filtering

you should use the pow function declared in the math.h header

23116760
opera	google-chrome
look this site please â try to open it in it opera google-chrome or ie 9+

23116765
hash	salt
if you are salting the password for hashing you add security because what ever technique is used to reverse calculate the hash all possible results will be the original password + salt

23116818
express	node.js
so express and actually node.js http server will call the request call whenever a http request header have been received and not the body of the request

23116839
cos	sin
the same with y but using sin instead of cos

23116854

23117578
width	height
you just have to give your list items a width and height andâ hey presto

23117578
width	height
okay now you still have to adjust the padding and the width and height accordingly but you get the idea

23117610
int	double
the conditional in the while loop uses the t that is declared in the scope surrounding the while loop the int t which is never modified because the loop hides t and modifies the double t and so it never reaches 0

23117623
int	double
one is an int at the scope of main and one is a double in the scope of the while loop

23117623
int	double
inside the while loop the double t is hiding the int t and your scanf is setting the double t

23117633
children	parent
the visibility of the children in a panel is controlled by their parent panel so when you turn panel 1 s visibility off it also turns off panel 2 if it s a child

23117643
int	double
when the statement t-- is executed it refers to the double t variable declared earlier in the same block so your int t in the outer block scope which is shadowed by the double t never gets decremented

23117659
hide	show
rendercontroller allows you to hide and show different renderable items with a transition of your choice

23117682

width	height
so the first task would be to resize the iframe in the iframes source with the width and height and such + the part i just entered here as well dont know how to figure that out

23117790
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
any exception that extends runtimeexception is an unchecked-exception

23117796
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
you create an unchecked-exception by inheriting from runtimeexception as opposed to exception

23117805
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
all unchecked-exception are subclasses of runtimeexception

23117821
division	modulo
if you use a long representation you can use the modulo and the integer division as follows

this hierarchical memory structure lends itself nicely to rejecting large groups of fragments at a time because the min max depth for an entire tile worth of pixels can be determined in a single specialized memory operation

23118996
min	max
given the fact that all primitives are planar if the rasterizer can be guaranteed that a fragment shader is not going to alter the depth it can perform a coarse-grained 1 test per-tile in the compressed depth buffer depth test using a min max depth value and kill multiple fragments before shading blending

23126220
realloc	malloc
the amount of memory requested may be rounded up to some size the malloc system prefers to deal with - such as 16 so you may or may not own those extra 8 bytes in the sense that a realloc would always give you them rather than shift you to some other memory area but regardless it s undefined behaviour if you try to read modify them before such a realloc

although itâ s best practice for an object to access its own properties using accessor methods or dot syntax itâ s possible to access the instance variable directly from any of the instance methods in a class implementation

23127728
accessor	properties
in general you should use accessor methods or dot syntax for properties access even if youâ re accessing an objectâ s properties from within its own implementation in which case you should use self

23127798
prng	random
so you seed you prng with some known value when you want its result to be predictable - for example for testing purposes or to ensure that each time you run level 1 in your game the enemies are always placed in the same pseudo random places - otherwise you don t need to explicitely pass a seed

either it runs inside a process of the web server itself - as with mod_wsgi on apache - or it runs in a completely separate process and receives requests via reverse proxy from the server as with uwsgi gunicorn

23143100
google-chrome	firefox
this is why when i originally posted the question i said it was working in google-chrome but not firefox or ie

23143104
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i have written a websocket++ server on ubuntu 13.10 and am trying to execute it on linux mint 16

23143104
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
the only difference are the distros but linux mint 16 is based upon ubuntu 13.10 and all commands to setup were identical

23143149
post	get
but when i post a new user i get a 404 not found error

23143195
portrait	landscape
i am using jquery mobile and have a webpage with two elements one page for portrait orientation and one page for landscape orientation

23143206
put	get
each entity has a type a b c etc. that should determine what sheet it gets put into and all of them get put into my all sheet

23143208
int	chars
another common method besides int is to send 4 ascii chars since they re easy to read when you are looking at raw data wireshark hexdump bytes in a debugger etc

23143238
gif	png
in an windows phone 8 app my scope is generate an animated gif starting from a list of png images stored in isolated storage of app and then save it and share it

23143263
int	double
i would never use var as substitution for simple types like int string double etc

23143300
jlist	jlabel
i suggest that you don t use a jlabel but instead use a jlist

23143300
joptionpane	jdialog
it also appears that you re trying to use a jframe in a dialog capacity and if so don t -- use a jdialog instead or even a joptionpane

23143301
folder	dir
of course once i figured this out i immediately deprecated it in favor of new tasks to install gulp in the release dir on the target compiling there and linking the site root to the pub folder generated by the gulp process

23143320
google-chrome	firefox
this problem is in the latest google-chrome and firefox browser versions .

23143328
width	height
set width not max-width to 100 and use height auto in order to scale with different sizes

23143377
children	parent
it ended that the children viewstate was not really usable without this resulting in an exception in the page init event before they were fully initializated and this happened only when the controls were added to the parent

23143380
button	checkbox
i ve found that if i toggle the scope from a button i can trigger the input checkbox remotely and the button behaves the same with or without an expanded dropdown nearby

23143397
post	get
i try to set post buffer size but get same error

23143426
int	double
if you wish to store 2-digit decimal int packed together as a single numeric value you would be better of using uint64_t - unsigned long 64 bit int rather than double

23143426
bitwise-or	bitwise-and
now adding and extracting values becomes bit-shifts operators by 8 and bitwise-or | and bitwise-and

23143485
openssl	libcrypto
before anyone suggests openssl s libcrypto i ve looked at it looked as in spent the last week trying to understand how the structures work how the asn.1 representation works how i can recover the bytes i m interested in from openssl s structures.

23143485
ecdsa	rsa
i could use openssl to create cms blank structures compute the future envelopeddata content ie stuff encrypted with a symmetric key + symmetric key wrapped with rsa oaep and stuff this content into the structures bypassing cms_encrypt completely before encapsulating into a signeddata i m assuming cms_sign will handle ecdsa sha1

23143485
openssl	cryptlib
i ve looked at libksba and cryptlib and while i guess they could work i cannot see how to use them yet might have something to do with my eyes bleeding from staring at openssl s code so much - i do not mean to say that openssl s code is bad or anything just that i ve been looking at it hard and the doc is slightly lacking

23143487
hide	show
it will hide the status bar and show the image picker

23143501
ggplot2	ggmap
as an alternative to rgooglemaps you can also use the combination ggplot2 with ggmap

23143547
width	height
i though they should ve at least had the x y width height of the winform i was working in

23143570
sorting	filtering
does this have to be done with sorting or can you filtering through some how

23143673
lapack	fftw
see some packages like fftw or lapack require this feature for optimization

23143698
post	get
what this means is that it actually uses two http connections- one post request to upload the content as a â œliveâ chunked stream and a second get request to access the results which makes much more sense for longer audio samples or for streaming audio.

23143698
post	put
if someone needs more information about it let me know cause i m not able to put more than 2 links in this post

23143706
put	get
i had allowed put and get requests hence uploading and retrieval worked but not delete

23143747

23143791
udp	tcp
this of course only makes much sense if you are using tls over a non-reliable protocol like udp instead of tcp

23143835
lxml	elementtree
python comes with elementtree built in library but lxml extends it in terms of speed and functionality schema validation sax parsing xpath various sorts of iterators and many other features

23143869
width	height
another pure css solution is to change your html code a little bit you have to add a table height 100 width 100 and set a vertical-align middle on the and inside it you should put the paragraph

23143900
apache	nginx
personally i d do it with nginx as it s faster and easier to set up than apache

23143905
maven	pom.xml
i added to my pom.xml because maven was some how deciding to use source and target of 1.5 rather than 1.7

23143906
width	height
test for yourself with the provided link the higher the scale or map width height is increased the more it lags while walking

23143909
vb.net	vb6
if you re looking for visual basic use vb.net or vb6

23143952
maven	pom.xml
i have a multi-module maven project with a master pom.xml and numerous sub-directories each containing projects and pom.xml files which refer to the master pom.xml

23143952
maven	pom.xml
clearly this is happening because the classpath when i run maven for projectb does not include the directories in projecta even though the pom.xml has a dependency on projecta actually it depends on projecta.1 which in turn depends on projecta

23143995
versioning	upgrade
i verified that the url for the store used by the upgrade app is exactly the same as the one used in the previous versioning

23143997
debian	linux
moreover it allows you to upgrade all installed packages at once as apt-get upgrade does on debian based linux

23144169
post	get
as per another post i am trying to get the scrolling to work correctly and i believe these two options are meant to help with that

23144194
couchbase	couchdb
however one easy way to solve your problem is to sync pouchdb to a couchdb then sync that to couchbase sync gateway

23144194
couchbase	couchdb
the reason you will need couchdb as an intermediary is that there are a few issues with direct pouchdb - couchbase sync gateway syncing although hopefully they should be resolved soon see this and this

23144221
width	height
height width css percentages are based off the closest parent with a defined height or width excluding elements

23144338
min	max
s.b. answer is correct but you might still look at the fact that you have to add the min and max attributes to the input

23144349
post	get
i m trying to send multiple binary files to a web service in a single multipart mixed post but can t seem to get it to work.

23144409
min	max
akxe is correct about the max and min values acceptable

23144528
hide	show
for that kind of show hide logic on specific row you will need to use gridview.rowdatabound event

23144587
for-loop	loops
i would also like to note that instead of a for-loop i have tried a foreach loops that followed this syntax

23144619
getter	setter
it works great the first time to create the getter and setter but if i make changes to an entity and generate again it gives an error like this

23144646
stdout	stderr
you can either log or output the stdout and stderr from your process

23144647
for-loop	arrays
to convert my file to an hex arrays i scan each character of the file via a for-loop file and then use the bin2hex function to obtain the hex value

i would like to use the dequeue model from uitableview and uicollectionview in my own class which i will call customcontrol here

23144903

so for each label i want to find the min value of the pixel the max value of the pixel and the average of the intensities the area of each label i can count for img and merge

23145136
subtract	add
now in the jsfiddle you ll see that we add or subtract one to slider after we animate the slide to keep track of where we are

23145141
submit	submission
but the reason your submit isn t doing anything is that you gave your form no action so its submission back to the servlet that prints out the form

23145172
put	get
if you put 5 or 8 first you will get an indexerror

23145181
post	get
however now i get a 404 when i post the form

23145309
versioning	upgrade
the versioning of microsoft.aspnet.identity.entityframework i m referencing in every project is 2.0.0.0 i upgrade it at some point with nuget

23145335
int	chars
because printf is a variadic function default promotions apply meaning your chars is promoted to an int conserving the value

23145335
int	chars
unless you tell printf you passed an unsigned chars it will think it is an int or unsigned int and cannot reverse those promotions meaning 192 as chars is -64 as int is -64 interpreted as unsigned is 4294967195

23145344
jar	war
the above jar file is present in the web-inf lib folder of the war file

23145344
jar	war
both the projects have the jar file and the war file contain an empty beans.xml

23145371
folder	directory
following this tutorial i got the system working enough to upload acceptable file types to an uploads folder in my root directory but i m stuck on how to make the photos instead upload to a unique directory for each user

23145387
min	max
in general if you are looking for something that transform shape size aesthetically it s easier to work with min max width in pixels rather then

23145395
width	text-align
instead of using padding to space the items apart one solution is to use width and text-align center

23145534
hide	show
i am using .toggle to show hide a div

23145537
int	boolean	int	double
example string to int to zero double to 0.0 boolean to false an so on

23145584
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
embed the uiviewcontroller in a uinavigationcontroller select the uiviewcontroller in the storyboard choose editor embed in navigation controller

23145661

i have placed the plugin inside a folder called lib meta-box which is inside my plugin directory

eclipse egit always asks for credentials when contacting bitbucket https repo

23145704
versioning	upgrade
but before you do that you might want to upgrade your versioning of perl

23145721
distance	polygons
however be aware that since you are not using perspective projection you really are not going to see any visual difference in this polygons as it moves away from you or closer size will not change with distance

23145780
range	minimum
it sorta works but if i enter 0 for price the model comes back as valid which is wrong because i have a range annotation which says that the minimum price is 1

23145786
for-loop	loops
adding the rest of the code the for-loop reduce it to 18 loops

23145799
for-loop	loops
if you have a for-loop within a for-loop you need to use a variable to keep track of if the inner condition has been matched or play with loops condition

23145799
lodash	underscore.js
another good idea is to try underscore.js or lodash as both provide functions that make common things in javascript easier

23145801
post	get
i figured out how to use my web service to post to the database but now i cannot figure out how to get the data from the database with my php web service

23145850

23145926
allocator	stl
i d like to have an allocator class that can be constructed via its default constructor as a lot of stl containers attempt to create allocator like this

23145945
int	chars
void confirmdimension int dim chars what

23145963
int	chars
the problem is that the function void confirmdimension int dimension chars what takes a chars as its second parameter but you are passing for example ht which is two bytes and is losing data when being converted to a chars causing the code to never evaluate to true

23145976
calloc	malloc
using calloc instead of malloc means that you don t need to loop through setting everything to 0

23145982
for-loop	loops
i have a map and i am using a for-loop to loops through it but it only gives me the first value .in ascending order

23145988
folder	directory
note i assumed that catalog folder is in the root directory of your site

23146013
hash	md5
i have thought about doing an md5 hash but a skilled hacker would understand that and just regenerate the hash

23146025
folder	directory
you should commit everything in the project directory without the user data folder found under

23146061
children	parent
when i attempt to update for a parent with two children - no actual changes have been made in the form it s just been loaded and then saved straight away again - the update is not successful i have a validation error and the children in the newly render edit form look incorrect

23146072
stanford-nlp	brat
brat provides ways of converting from conll2000 and stanford-nlp so if i could get the phrase structure into either of those forms it would be acceptable too.

23146083
put	get
what i want to do is to be able to put up some songs on the backend and be able to get those files as a request in my android app

23146100

memcached	apc
generate that html once and then save it in memory if you can apc memcached or a flat file

23146300
button	checkbox
the goal would be to toggle the selection of the checkbox via the check all button

23146320
subtract	add
it seems like you need to subtract this.speed from this.x because your if statement saying the this.x is more than 650 then add this.speed to this.x but if you re going to add speed you would never reach else because your this.x would be always greater

23146324
cout	cin
use cout instead of printf and cin instead of scanf

23146367
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i ve been trying to use touchesbegan and touchesmoved

23146422

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this css works in safari google-chrome firefox but it refuses to work even in the latest ie 11

23146511
button	checkbox
related to that i wouldn t be surprised if the other button checkbox etc you re defining are not showing up on the form either for the same reason

23146522
typedef	struct
typedef and struct

23146542
getter	setter
generally in pl sql you d want to use a function whenever you want to write some sort of getter that reads data from the database and a procedure whenever you want to write some sort of setter that writes data to the database

23146590
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i make this web and when try to access with email abc and password abc have success in google-chrome or firefox but don t work with ie or safari

temp	tmp
i have a simple program to create file named test12345678.bin under java temp directroy tmp and perform the chmod using file.setexecutable

23146721
for-loop	loops
and use a for-loop in place of the while loops

23146763
uiview	calayer
after fiddling with the code for a couple hours to change the uiview s to calayer s i have it working at absolutely no performance gain

23146791
for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop to load specified quantity of random numbers into the arrays

23146791
for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop to print the sorted arrays from first item to last

23146831
uiview	calayer
instead have a single uiview that takes up the whole screen with a bunch of calayer objects inside the one view

23146831
uiview	calayer
uiview is using calayer internally so they both behave approximately the same

23146879
google-chrome	firefox
it works nicely in google-chrome and firefox

23146915
daemons	systemd
software polling - this means there is always a daemons to check these file systemd to see if there is anything changed

23146977
g++	gcc
do the same thing for gcc c compiler set the command to the full path opt local bin g++ the gcc c++ linker opt local bin g++ and the gcc assembler opt local bin as

23147093
versioning	upgrade
so your best option is to follow their recommendation and upgrade to the latest ie versioning if you have to stick to ie

23147149
width	height
then after that you would cut a 1px width x-value px height and use that as a repeating background behind your header div

23147165
jedi-vim	python-mode
i prefer the autocompletion of python with jedi-vim instead of rope completion that comes with python-mode

23147167
portrait	landscape
i want to disable the orientation changes from portrait to landscape change while camera and photo gallery running in android

23147185
put	get
the reason you get gibberish when you put in the img tag is because it returns binary data representing the image not data that can be passed to an img tag

23147230
range	minimum
you didn t subtract the minimum of the range so you re assuming far too many pixels and dividing by a value that s too large

23147251
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box

23147298
for-loop	loops
if you want to create an animation from a for-loop there must be high-level plotting commands in loops

23147306
google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome and firefox

23147405
folder	directory
if you have a uploads folder in the same directory and it s writable it will download the file and call it temp.pdf

23147440
int	double
in java there are two kinds of types primitives int float double etc and references

23147461
implements	extends
specifically one thing that would be helpful is a minimal list of classes interfaces to extends implements to get going

23147464
getter	setter
i removed the getter and setter for col1a in class tableb and then again sent the json object by using libcurl only to receive the following errors

23147464
getter	setter
the getter and setter functions for the col1a field in class tableb are defined as

23147510
folder	directory
i assume i can t just do a git init on the mytheme directory a new history will be created and i ve never seen anything about moving just the .git folder

23147564
children	parent
i have an entity in the scene which have almost 24 children sprites attached to it in different positions.i have made a function which moves the entity from one position to another.whenever i try to get position of children it returns me the same position as it was in the beginning because it returns the position according to the parent entity .as you can see in the example below

23147625
getter	setter
computed properties can be used as a getter setter for a variable and also as a way to alias other properties

23147627
int	chars
if so it will remove all and chars convert the string to an int and make the value negative

23147627
int	chars
otherwise it removes the chars and parses the int thus being positive

23147632
int	chars
when you use instead of the address pointed to by a is interpreted as an address to an int not a chars

23147637
children	parent
now i like to fetch all the children while fetching parent entity in one go

23147642
int	chars
assuming and you are effectively comparing chars 0-3 as an int to chars 1-4 as an int

23147712
filtering	grouping
i tried in this way if i use only domain in grouping it works but i want to use auth filtering

23147745
switching	screens
i would like to know how can i navigate to the native setting screens of the phone from my web app for the user to switching on the gps feature

23147761
geocoding	geocode
by creating another after_validation after my geocode i am able to check if the appropriate values changed and if they changed in a certain way than i know there was an issue in the geocoding

23147761
put	get
if the address changed but the latitude didnt change than you know that when the address got put through geocoder that it didn t get a returned lat long

23147769
int	chars
so the expression in the return statement is comparing the sizeof int number of bytes from the address in a with the sizeof int number of bytes from the address in b instead of comparing the chars at the addresses contained in the pointers a and b

23147775
for-loop	arrays
lets say i have two two-dimensional arrays and and i want to add them element-wise with a double for-loop so my results are stored in z

23147789
mkmapview	mkoverlay
mkmapviewdelegate s mapview rendererforoverlay fires when an mkoverlay s boundingmaprect enters the visible bounds of the mkmapview

23147836
.htaccess	httpd.conf
when using tomcat i ve always treated web.xml as a kind of .htaccess or httpd.conf equivalent

23147887
width	height
as a side note if you want to open an actual pop-up window instead of a new tab pass a small width and height in the 3rd parameter of window.open

23147887
pop-up	dialog
to avoid issues with pop-up blockers and some cross-browser inconsistencies you can use one of the many dialog modal plugins available

23147897
jobs	cron
i m in need of a way to create dynamic one-off cron jobs to execute tasks at different times

23147897
jobs	cron
at any one time there could be multiple cron jobs scheduled at once for different times

23147897
jobs	cron
these cron jobs also need to be deleted upon completion

23147917
xively	arduino
arduino uploads to xively and then i m hoping to download to a mobile site i m toying around with

23147944
width	height
here you are defining the size as cv size len len where len is max of height and width

23147965
for-loop	loops
i just re-wrote print_grid to use a for-loop that loops over the grid directly rather than using range

23148008
onresume	onpause
i ve also tried to use onpause and onresume for each fragment but they only get called when i move to the 2rd tab from it

23148011
daemons	launchd
to achieve this functionality you need to have a daemons that is running all the time that checks for these dynamic jobs and launchd them

pull	push
my assembly is atrociously rusty but it looks like you push esi and push ecx at the start of your bubblesort routine and never pop them so your ret instruction would be trying to pull the caller s address off the stack and end up jumping to what had been ecx that is the length of your array

put	get
the definitions of get put state in the class declaration are the default implementations which are meant to be overridden in actual instances of the class

23149670
put	get
in this way the dead loop is broken if an instance defines only state then get and put are defined in terms of it using the default implementation in the class

23149670
put	get
similarly if an instance defines get and put then state is defaulted

23149850
portrait	landscape
for example when change orientation from portrait to landscape viewpager now shows 2 fragments a b instead of a and c

23149850
portrait	landscape
my current workaround is to use different ids for viewpager eg id viewpager_portrait for portrait and id viewpager_landscape for landscape layout to prevent from reusing fragments but this cause me a memory leak because old fragment will not be destroyed and still be kept in memory

in matlab it seemed obvious to me to implement my time evolution function so that it returns a 4 x 4 x nsteps arrays but then the only way that came to my mind for applying the function to each 4 x 4 matrix was a for-loop like

button	checkbox
i want not a specific one checkbox but if a checkbox or multiple checkbox are checked the button which is a delete button will be enabled

if post from two table and get from two table is not showing second table data

23150831
int	double
you pass a float which gets promoted to a double and takes 8 bytes of stack and a int which takes 4 bytes

23150831
int	double
this is different as you first pass the int which gets printed correctly and then you only print the first 4 bytes of the double

23150832
int	chars
if i try to print lets say 160 as a chars u0160 everything works fine but if i cast int to chars i get white space

stdout	stderr
this is because strace writes all its output to stderr not stdout

23151227
stdout	stderr
and a pipe redirects stdout not stderr

23151227
stdout	stderr
so you need to redirect stderr of strace to stdout before piping to grep

23151252

once i read the answer on internet could be in stack overflow as well i can t remember showing all memory usage for each variable type in libgdx such as int float boolean and etc

23151574
jobs	cron
every time cronjobmanager.php runs that is every second loads the cron jobs

23151574
jobs	cron
then comparing now s time with each cron job s run_time you ll get which cron jobs to run

23151574
jobs	cron
notice that if cron jobs executing time needs a lot of time they ll get delayed and eventually a second or two will get lost

23151574
jobs	cron
in order to delete cron jobs you would implement this feature in the cron job object

23151574

if what you need is several cron jobs to run at once in a specific second with 0 delay then you need a cron job per task out of php that runs a specific file

23151614

23152114
width	height
i stupidly tried to create an array based on screens height and width which i would then use to replace the trees in an element of the array with the game object

23152116
nsnull	nsstring
if you can guarantee that the height value will always be an nsstring or nsnumber and not a nsnull if we re dealing with json the following sort descriptor would also work

23152116
put	get
while the first sort descriptor is a bit longer its also far more robust in case any other objects are put inside of the height value as then you would get a class is not key value coding-compliant for the key length error

23152150
width	height
i have 5-6 images with various sizes like width from 1000px to 1048px and height from 593px to 1736px

interesting thing here is that it corrupts background by height but not by width

23152560
onclick	onfocus
first of all most events that you might use like onclick onfocus etc

23152560
onclick	onfocus
of course you can still use client-side like onfocus or onclick but that would mean writing client-side handler that triggers the postback manually

for example i inherited various properties from my parents but i can be completely ignorant of all of this information

23153373

change the type of method post to get and try hope this will help you

23154577

hide	show
however the need is that on 1st click it show extra rows and on second click the extra rows should hide

23156284
google-chrome	firefox
also the jerky behaviour is observed in google-chrome but not firefox

23156284
google-chrome	firefox
edit reframed the question to make it clearer it s a google-chrome firefox difference

23156304
lxml	beautifulsoup
lev already mentionned beautifulsoup you could also look at lxml

23156305

23156559

i change the event type from keyup to keydown

keystore	jks
also tested different store types jks pkcs12 or simpler passphrase nothing seems to be working and keystore read fails when attempting to start the server with encrypted keystore password

23156697
profiling	benchmarking
instead i would set up profiling in your project.clj to disable the benchmarking tests by default and set up a separate profiling for running benchmarking

23156697
profiling	benchmarking
assuming that you have your resource-paths set up to include a debug-level log4j.properties file your benchmarking profiling could then set up the classpath or system profiling as appropriate to use a different file

23156711

for example from the docs if actions -blueprints are enabled which they are by default get post put and delete routes will be generated for every one of a controller s actions

23156944
puts	gets
that s clearly not compatible with this automagic wiring since these methods would be exposed on gets and puts and deletes as well which would leave a huge security footprint imho

23156946
put	get
in a case like this with an interaction between continuous and categorical variables you can remove the intercept and put the continuous variable in with the interaction only to get the intercept and slope for each group in the output instead of a reference group and differences from the reference group

23156948
websphere	ibm
there is also a side-by-side comparison on page 9 of the ibm websphere application server v8.5.5 packaging highlights document

that chars is an unsigned 16 bit int and contains a numerical value used to map to a chars set

the problem could be either a bug in your equals or in your gethashcode but in the later case is that it doesn t correctly match your equals gethashcode must return the same hash for two objects for which equals returns true but can of course also return the same for two different objects which makes it a bug in the pair of methods

qthread	qobject
i m triying to convert an ordinary class in a qobject so i can use this as a worker to connect with other qthread

23186242
for-loop	arrays
so in your case you should probably use a standard for-loop and fill the arrays with or with other animals as appropriate

23186258
client-side	server-side
there are many add-on javascript validation frameworks you can use and most of the common ones work by having you generate a list of class names a special attribute or a javascript array in the server-side code which is used by the client-side validation code

to return a variable item height while the width is fixed

23186467
submit	submission
when i try to submit a form either via an input type submit or by calling form.submit parsley validates the form and cancels the submission if invalid

23186507
inherited	subclassing
in segment 2 the subclassing subtype does call the constructor of supertype so the statement gets executed but the prototype is not set appropriately so any prototype items that supertype might have had are not inherited

23186507
inherited	properties
the most general purpose way also passes any constructor arguments to the inherited object using .apply this arguments like this and initializes its own prototype and sets it s constructor properties

23186518
width	height
from that the total height total width effective height and effective width the height width of the imageview respectively the distance between the top left bounds of two consecutive views

23186518
width	height
the onmeasure functions just calculates the total width and height of the view and calls setmeasureddimension with those values

23186534
fontfamily	font-size
then you would have to deal with its special rules for whitespace can be overridden with white-space normal font size can be overridden with font-size 100 fontfamily etc

23186538
width	height
you can then inherit the width and height of the #about css styling if that s the size of hover.png or specify your own size based on the actual size of hover.png if its different than that stated in #about it sounds like 38px for hover.png is what you want as opposed to the 51px height of the #about parent

23186568
inherited	properties
note this approach will cause child instances to inherited an undefined a properties but since you will create an own properties using parent.call this a it doesn t matter very much

23186579
cpython	pypy
in cpython the reference implementation and pypy the gil only allows one thread at a time to execute python bytecode

23186593
post	get
when i update a post i get this strange error

23186608
post	get
below is my code that will take the post_id and randomly get 3 post from the same category and store them as custom field

23186608
post	get
the code is clearly working because when i click new post i see the custom field being populated but when i clicked publish or save the code below didn t get executed from what i understand save_post will be called once when creating new post and one more time when you actually save the post

23186658
post	get
for a start i just want to create a few pages in rails that will get from facebook s api and display something like username likes post

23186662

also i also suggest always using the method post or method get use post in here

23186713
websphere	ibm
another gem is one of jcamanagedconnectionfactory s constructors which has text about ibm websphere

23186721
outputstream	inputstream
you should open output stream and schedule it in netservice didacceptconnectionwithinputstream outputstream or when you receive nsstreameventopencompleted of inputstream

23186743
comparator	comparable
for more information read about comparator comparable interface

23186775
g++	gcc
i don t understand why g++ is not able to resolve my call to this operator i m using gcc 4.6

23186791
inherited	properties
if you do that like this the prototype of subtype would also inherited the properties color as own properties of the subtype prototype because the constructor is worked through

23186791
inherited	properties
every new instance of subtype has then a reference to the color properties in the prototype and is not an own properties of the instance itself this is finally not what you want because you only want to inherited the prototype

23186798
for-loop	arrays
you have not incremented index in the for-loop of getscores method instead you are decreasing the size so it wont read the elements into scores arrays properly always score 0 only gets the value and hence your reading values is not proerly added to arrays

23186816
put	get
suppose i want to put the following 6 stocks into this strategy and tun each stock one time and get several results

23186850
children	parent
this gets triggered when you close a child window manually but not if you close the parent window which then automatically closes the children

my win32 window is only a video window so it has no keyboard or mouse active parts

23186897
button	checkbox
this button is disabled if the checkbox is not checked and enable if the checkbox is checked

23186911
width	height
what could work is that you create a class such as rectshape that could store relative information such as height width a vector2 position etc and then have a method on your main class that would specifically render your rectshape as follows

23186960
sudo	passwd
please note that this will sometimes work depending on whether sudo requires you to re-enter a passwd

23186997
inherited	properties
the individual linecharts can be pretty simple because they ll inherited many properties from the compositechart they re contained in

23187015
post	put
search engines including google crawl through the first introductory paragraph of the page or a post and takes that excerpt to put in the description when search results are shown

23187022

it works fine on safari but not on firefox and internet explorer

23187063
width	height
the left inner div should adjust its size both width and height to its content

23187063
width	height
the right inner div which contains a google map should have the same height as the left one while filling up the remaining width of the container

23187134

23187356
post	get
select the last option post name to get only post names in the urls

23187362
noexcept	throw
the caveat here is that the process will exit if an exception is throw and not caught inside a method with noexcept

23187397
width	margin
one thing which just came to my mind - you could simply display the text in a container - let s say a grid - which has set the cliptobounds property to true and animate the margin from something lower than the text s negative width to 0

23187401
cube	skybox
the idea of scaling the cube bigger is to make a skybox

23187465
submit	submission
you should send the files in the change event of the hide_selector input and not when submission the form - or just triggering the submit of the form when the value has changed

23187466
int	double
i ve tried using floor i ve tried multiplying by 100 then casting to an int then casting back to double nothing seems to work

23187492
min	max
i think you always have min and max time for any instruction and may use the max time for your time calculations

23187567
preorder	postorder
i have left the preorder and postorder traversal methods in the file for reference

23187570
factors	mean
however a more informative approach for graphing would be to plot the conditional mean outcome for each factors level with their standard errors

23187578
int	chars
for the datatype you need something that resembles a chars much like you would send mpi_int to transport int arrays

23187600
implements	extends
public class main extends jframe implements actionlistener

23187607
margin	height

23187660
put	get
but for empty lines you need to put a whitespace after the pipe otherwise you get an error

23187666
hide	show
you can add some logic to reset to the blank option when you hide show the divs so only one of the lane_names will have any data in it

23187680
hide	show
this is much shorter in code than using show and hide methods

23187682
hide	show
just add the document ready function this way it waits until the dom has been loaded also by using the visible pseudo you can write a simple show and hide function

23187689
post	put
i ran this in jfiddle in order to post this question and it still makes me put the column name in twice but only gives me one set of results

profiler of a query on phpmyadmin heidisql show that is is done in less than two seconds when not being hit in cahce so its not the actual query causing this as fair as i comprehend this

23188126
subtract	add
so you need only subtract 3 values and add 3

23188171

23188596
uiview	subviews
what you refer to subviews are not subviews the methods you listed are not uiview methods and instead are uiviewcontroller methods

23188622
width	height
i think you are going about this the wrong way when everything is based on the width percentages there is no way to know the height unless you use js so you need to change the width to something more appropriate to achieve your goal

23188634
16-bit	64bit
the address range of a 64bit system even when the upper 16-bit are cropped off like that of x86_64 allows for a huge amount of memory the 48-bit address space of x86_64 is 256tb of memory address space

23188634
16-bit	64bit
this presentation shows that arm the latest entrant into the 64bit processor sapce is also using 48-bit virtual address space and enforces canonical addresses top 16-bit need to all be the same value so it can be expanded in the future

23188639

23188645
multiplying	addition
the boilerplate code would multiplying rapidly when the express get more complex than addition of two terms

23188696
width	height
in your function when you do you allocate a width x height block of memory in the stack

23188696
width	height
since the width and height of the array won t be known if it s in the heap you ll have to instead provide an offset from array which should give you a clue how arrays work in c to begin with

23188697
mtu	icmp
this appears to be a known issue with the rds instances not responding to icmp which is needed to auto-discover the mtu settings

23188697

pascal	delphi
i m not even sure if bitwise operators and or not shl shr used in other languages to implement enums and sets are available for 8-byte integers either in delphi or in free pascal so the option 1 might also be misleading and the winner is option 2

23188969
debian	linux

23189147
int	double
the double has the same value as the int but they are different types

23189147
int	double
the size of the int is 4 bytes and the size of the double is 8 bytes on your architecture

23189147
int	double
basically what your textbooks means when it says the compiler will force arguments to the appropriate types specified by the parameter declaration is that it will look at your int a and find what it would be as a double it would be 4 in both cases

23189147
int	double
the compiler does this because it sees that the function foo requires a double but foo is getting an int

23189147
int	double
a in main is always an int and a in your foo function is always a double

23189157
int	double
what actually happens here is that the compiler realizes that foo takes a double argument and converts the int argument to double

23189157
int	double
the output shows that double is 8 bytes in this particular system and int is 4 bytes - both of which is pretty ordinary

23189159
int	double
the function foo instantiates a new temporary value also happens to be called a which is of type double using the int you passed to it

23189285
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
should each instance of a repository have its own version of nspersistentstorecoordinator nsmanagedobjectmodel and nsmanagedobjectcontext or should a single instance of these objects be shared among all repository instances passed in by the appdelegate

layoutparams	viewgroup	inherited	subclassing
each subclassing of viewgroup has its own layoutparams descending from viewgroup.marginlayoutparams which is descendent from viewgroup.layoutparams there are no marginlayoutparams for each of the subclassing as the margin setting functionality is available through inherited because they support different qualities

23190262
layoutparams	viewgroup
so depending on whatever type of viewgroup your imageview is held in your layoutparams will have to be that same type or at least cast to that same type

getter	setter
what you re doing in your example is not getter setter in javascript you re setting a function on an object that creates a closure over two private members of that object and you re leaking a reference for the array

23190353
getter	setter
you could refer to helper functions as getter and setter as you would in another language but this could lead to confusion

23190353
getter	setter
there are quite a few different ways to define getter and setter i recommend you check out mdn

23190390
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r user library caches cocoapods

23190558
getter	setter
source generate getter and setter

23190565
put	get
but my problem is while doing this all data is visible publicly means any application can put that uri and get full data

23190572
udp	tcp
port numbers as we know them are part of the tcp or udp protocols both of which are above the level at which we work with raw sockets

23190578
inherited	properties
i should probably preface this answer with a note that it s usually not necessary â and not a good idea â to apply a font-family style to every descendant of body because font properties are inherited by default by most elements anyway except form elements and tables if i m not wrong

23190579
udp	tcp
port numbers are part of the tcp and udp protocols and some other transport layer protocols

23190583
perl	tcl
scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

23190609
width	height
it s fine to add the height and width constraints to popupview but since popupview is a subview of the window the centering constraints should be added to the window not the popupview and you need to add the popupview as a subview first before you add the constraints

23190649
getter	setter
there s nothing built-in to the language but you could always use project lombok s annotation set to generate getter and setter for you at compile-time

23190649
tostring	getter	getter	setter
in particular data is quite powerful - it generates your getter setter and a tostring method

23190649
getter	setter
you may have to install a plugin for your ide to recognize that this is being generated at compile-time but this takes care of all of your setter and getter boilerplate code

23191354
getter	setter
but property getter and setter are ordinary blocks of code that you can use as you want

23191354
getter	setter
in this case the compiler automatically creates a private backing field that the property retrieves in the getter and assigns in the setter so the code is equivalent to the following but less to type

23191394
integer	unsigned
because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is

23191394
integer	unsigned
with the multiplication of evaluated as an unsigned integer expression there is no possibility of undefined behaviour

23191394
integer	unsigned
the usual assumption is that size_t is the same as unsigned int or perhaps larger and that size_max is an unsigned integer literal but these are not actually requirements

23202880
opera	google-chrome
dom objects in google-chrome and opera are actually reload-transient

qtextedit apparently has a textcursor method that returns a qtextcursor but this is a cursor to modify the document

23203139

the reason is encapsulation is far more than getter and setter

for functions with a fixed number and types of parameters arguments of arithmetic type signed integer unsigned integer or floating-point are implicitly converted to the correct type

23204459
unsigned	short
some warning is warranted since passing an unsigned short with a d format is not portable but the promoted argument must be specifically of type int

23204492
opengl-es	glreadpixels
since i m a beginner with opengl-es 2 and more importantly since the buffers are on the gpu s memory over which i have no control nor access i first thought of mapping a shared memory object an uint8_t array of length using posix shm_open etc. between the two processes and periodically calling glreadpixels on app a for filling it then uploading it in app b as for instance a 2d texture

23204935
int	double
this allows you to use the methods from the inputstream class such as read and write which are methods that only read bytes.to read any other types of data we must use the datainputstream and dataoutput stream classes which are a type of filter class that allow reading primitive types such as int double etc using methods such as readint and writeint

it means that your servlet will handle every single request in your application note that requests to the resources css js images etc are get requests you can easily verify this by opening a browser like firefox with firebug or google-chrome press f12 and check for the network tab to see all the requests done to the server so your servlet will handle them as well

width	height
just override the setters for each height and width and change the other s value

23205714
width	height
in other words if both height and width are properties of the same object have setheight call setwidth etc

23205714
width	height
the easiest way to do that would be if you have a third property that reflects the relationship you wish height and width to have such as aspectratio

23205714
width	height
alternately to overriding the setters if you want to do the calculation based on the previous value of height or width you could register for kvo changes in both keypaths with options nskeyvalueobservingoptionnew | nskeyvalueobservingoptionold and in observevalueforkeypath you d get a change dictionary with both the old and new values from which you could calculate how much the user scaled the value and scale the other value accordingly while careful to avoid triggering kvo when doing so

comparable is an interface that any class may choose to implement in order to indicate that instances of the class may be compared using the class comparator method

23206327
comparator	comparable
if there is a built-in or third-party class that does not implement comparable you need to create a comparator instead in order to compare them

clang	llvm
i expect you could load the entire source code for a fairly large project into memory all at once for example all of the files in llvm + clang is around 450mb so could easily fit in memory on a modern desktop laptop

23207293
interpreted-language	compiled-language
edit it should be noted that interpreted-language such as php javascript and basic typically don t have this requirement but other compiled-language typically do - for example pascal has a special keyword forward to tell the compiler that this function exists but i m telling you what it contains later

23207949
try-catch	exception-handling
if you want your function to be called just like how visual studio would break on a first chance exception-handling breaks on a throw even inside a try-catch block then you need to subscribe to the firstchanceexecption event in the appdomain you are running in

23207949
try-catch	exception-handling
be aware you may get more exception-handling than you realize some .net framework code throws exception-handling internally and just have the code in try-catch blocks so it never comes up to the surface 1 or if the library code has the pattern

for example an account page that should allow employee admins employee call center or the owning client to get post put or delete account information

23226801

scheme	racket
so racket is like a ide with support for lots of programming languages but they are mainly scheme dialects

before it was called racket it was called drscheme and the language was called plt scheme with #lang scheme as the default language

23226938

it works fine in google-chrome and firefox

23227239
int	double
the double literal 99.9999999999999 can be represented as a double which is less than 100 so the cast to int truncates the decimal part and 99 is the result

23227239
int	double
the double literal 99.999999999999999999999999999999999999999 has the closest actual value of 100 and casting to int is simply 100 here

this happens due to interplay between the animation code applied for both the ng-class and ng-hide directives

23227641

alternatively you could forego the use of ng-hide ng-show entirely and use ng-class exclusively

23228263
elasticsearch	kibana
as a general rule speaking from experience i suggest that you don t index different types of data not different elasticsearch types into fields with the same name as it then becomes extremely hard to analyze in kibana when trying to use number string based queries you won t be able to sort or display histograms or piecharts on that specific field.

23228491
int	chars
this int is a chars from the stream or eof if you reach the end of the file

23228491
int	chars
you re implicitly casting the int to a interpreting it as an address turn your warnings on. when you call printf it reads that address and continues to read a chars at a time looking for the null terminator which ends the string but that address is almost certainly invalid

23228550
capitalize	uppercase
my coding standard is first letter of each word is capitalize uppercase

23228562

23229359
yacc	bison
as you will soon discover in the normal usage of the lexer in combination with yacc bison you need to copy any lexical string into a temporary buffer anyway because yacc bison needs to read one token ahead in the input and -- as above -- lex flex doesn t guarantee to preserve the string pointed to by yytext once it starts recognizing the next token

23229359
yacc	bison
is probably the most frequently asked yacc lex question and according to the bison manual the most common invalid bug report

23242292
post	get
have a look at this request module - it can fetch you a complete page and you can get post anything you want

23242314
children	parent
i think you have to call save on the parent and the children are saved once the parent id is known

23242314
children	parent
if the parent must exist for your app to work create a dummy one and have all the children you don t want to have a specific parent belonging to it then you can easily find them again

23242315
min	max
i ve seen some min max trickery in the past to help with similar problems and am unsure if i can write optimal code

23242344
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
tvdpi resources for screens somewhere between mdpi and hdpi

23242344
mdpi	hdpi
it is mostly intended for televisions and most apps shouldn t need itâ providing mdpi and hdpi resources is sufficient for most apps and the system will scale them as appropriate

23242344
screens	mdpi
for example a 100px x 100px image for mdpi screens should be 133px x 133px for tvdpi

onclick	onchange
i know that using onmusedown the problem is solved but i want to understand the reason for such behavior in chrome with the onchange and onclick event

23242674
put	get
for example you can use the put message to persist an entity and use the get operation to retrieve it and make sure all properties are equal

23242679
nsexception	nserror
a good practice is to raise your own nsexception or preferably just pass an nserror encapsulating the original one which could be using userinfo

23242725
onclick	onchange
because onchange is triggered due to onclick

23242762
hide	show
i have a banner and on click i need to toggle some text and a class on a p that hide and show

23242763
onclick	onmousedown
one dirty solution might be to use onmousedown instead of onclick

unchecking would do the same thing except un-check children and un-gray the parent if needed

23243095
google-chrome	firefox
my suggestion would be to use some browser debugger google-chrome s dev tools firefox s firebug ie s dev tools to see what is being sent and the exact response http error code you are getting back

23243126
put	get
we get it back as a byte array to put in the dataset

23243162
setinterval	settimeout
as settimeout would function after 1000ms 1 second so it is not going to check your time ever forth again but using setinterval would run every 1 second and check for the time and the code is executed

23243329
gruntjs	browserify
gruntjs browserify now works as expected by calling browserify but allowing it to handle browserify-shim by itself

23243346
popover	tooltip
i think you d be better using the bootstrap popover plugin - tooltip are mainly for converting the title attribute of links to javascript-powered tooltip

23243346
popover	tooltip
tooltip are for text only and as popover support html you should be able to include links in each one of them

23243352
ienumerable	ilist
surely i do not need a user defined conversion as list t is an ilist t and hashset t is an ienumerable t

23243592
ant	maven
the newer version builds via maven instead of ant so it s simpler and should work better

23243631
onclick	onchange
in chrome the onclick event fires after onchange and also we revert the events in input type the problem remains

23243631
onclick	onmousedown
the only answer that i can give you is that your problem could be solved by using onclick instead of onmousedown

23243644
min	max	range	min	range	max
your seek bar have a range from min to max

23243644
min	max	range	min	range	max
so you need range bar with min 0 and max 24 4

23243646
implements	extends
i can t offer you a solution because i m having a similar problem but i can tell you from the second link that unknownpacket extends packet and implements packetextension that s why you had to cast your streamhandlingpacket to packetextension in the return statement of your parseextension method

23246774
put	get
i don t want to just put it in the url because the guidedata could get pretty long

23246864
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade my wampserver from versioning 2.3 to 2.4 seem there is alot error after i upgrade my versioning

23246920
overwrite	preserve
the workaround i ve suggested works because instead of outputting the final css into a directory that gets overwrite when you push to github pages it will instead write it to a directory that is preserve even with a fresh build of the _site directory

23246929
int	double
the method add int linkedlist in the type arraylist is not applicable for the arguments int double

23246983
int	double	ceil	floor
i know i can use math.java functions to get the floor ceil or round value for a double or float but my question is -- is it possible to always get the higher int value if a decimal point comes in my value

23246983
ceil	floor
if i apply floor ceil or round to this number it will return 11 i want 12

23246987
getter	setter
you only have to implement the â œobjectmanagerawareinterfaceâ in the form class as well as the required getter + setter and you will have access via this- getobjetmanager

23247011
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome and ie 11 but it isn t working in ie 10

23247012
int	double	ceil	floor
now even if you assign this to the float chunksize it will still be an int missing the double part and ceil round and floor will all return the same value

23247043
getter	setter
often a setter is accompanied by a getter also known as an accessor which returns the value of the private member variable

23247049
post	get
if your response is the full one you can add a regular expression extractor post processor to get request configured as follows

23247058
put	get
one can put raw material in mould and get the product and start using it

23247093
width	height
also i noticed that the width of the individual containers td would go funny when resizing the page so as i want the grid to have 4 containers on each line i set the width to 25 and because i only want 2 lines i changed the height to 50

23247124
integer	fractions
in that case you re doing integer division which truncates any fractions portion

23247127
google-chrome	firefox
that doesn t work for me on google-chrome firefox or ie either

23247127
google-chrome	firefox
this works on google-chrome firefox ie and my iphone 5 updated version of your fiddle on jsbin jsfiddle doesn t work properly on my iphone 5

23247138
ienumerable	iqueryable
in stead of ienumerable use iqueryable .

23247157
uiview	subviews
bottom a uiview that you add the middle and top subviews to in that order

23247175
superclass	subclassing
one such case would be calling a method in the superclass constructor which is being overridden in the subclassing and which accesses not yet initialized fields of the subclassing

23247189
put	get
i did put some garbage in htaccess file to see if it working at all it did work and i got server error on the main domain but i didn t get anything on the direct image url

23247223
webkit	blink
note that the standard syntax is used unprefixed as well as prefixed for webkit blink and ie

23247244
uiview	subviews
bottom a uiview that you add the middle and top subviews to in that order

23247251
min	max
and then calculating the min and max of v8 for every element of the list but it take too much memory and is really slow

23247259
post	get
i have heard .load uses get and my form sends post

23247291
unsigned	short
i m getting compile errors from the boost date_time format_date_parser.hpp stating there is an error converting from int to unsigned short

23247294
puts	fflush
like the good lads puts in the comment you should use a fflush to force send the payload to destination of the stream

23247300
rss	feed
the first option i recommend is to use the rss feed block you can pull an rss feed from your youtube channel thus your latest video updates will be present on one page

23247310
range	percentile
that said i tried creating a function in mysql that assigns an index for a range of values based on percentile of groups within the table

23247335
hide	show
basically i ve defined show and hide as functions which create anonymous functions that do the actual showing and hiding and then run them after a 200ms delay using settimeout

23247347
uiview	subviews
bottom a uiview that you add the middle and top subviews to in that order

23247390
folder	directory
browse for xlsx file in the folder in its directory

23247504
button	checkbox
i ll show you how to do it on every check of checkbox but you should rather do it on button click or something like that it would be more efficient way

23247505
super	abstract
i am trying to make some of the usual database methods abstract so i can shift all these functions into a database super object

23247510
put	get
thus you get the error call to a member function put on a non-object the file because is not an object for this particular id

23247547
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
in windows database table names are case-insensitive and in linux they are case-sensitive probably because of file system difference

23247624
uilabel	uitapgesturerecognizer
make a custom uilabel or uiview with uitapgesturerecognizer if you really want to get rid of it

23247654
debian	linux
i am getting a django 1.6 set up started on a linux debian whiskey server on google compute engine

23247682
for-loop	loops
then the for-loop will just loops over read and print out the lines

23247693
int	chars
now the problem is the compressed file would have a bigger size than the original file because it counts each chars of the codes as a single chars rather than counting each code as a single int

23247710
accelerometer	gyroscope
there is no support in ios simulator for accelerometer or gyroscope data

23247714
submit	submission
i am working on creating a single page php application and trying to submit the form via ajax .post rather than the typical form submission that navigates away

23247778
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but firefox and most versions of safari and google-chrome have a __ proto__ â œpseudoâ property an alternative way that allows you to access an objectâ s prototype property

23247778
inherited	properties
the prototype properties is used primarily for inherited you add methods and properties on a functionâ s prototype properties to make those methods and properties available to instances of that function

23247778
inherited	properties
in simple terms an objectâ s prototype attribute points to the objectâ s â œparentâ â the object it inherited its properties from

23247778
inherited	properties
the prototype attribute is normally referred to as the prototype object and it is set automatically when you create a new object.to expound on this every object inherited properties from some other object and it is this other object that is the objectâ s prototype attribute or â œparent.â you can think of the prototype attribute as the lineage or the parent

23247787
for-loop	arrays
but your for-loop keeps moving even after the arrays ends that is until the memory location arr 3 +4 is reached

23247807
int	chars
after you convert some text into series of int like 66|65|256 you should not write it to a file as a series of 9 chars in text mode

23247862
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome act as soon as this function is triggered and make the browser window to default zoom but safari is not changing the zoom unless orientation changed

23247981
google-chrome	firefox
nothing on google-chrome firefox etc

23247993
int	boolean
this works because in python boolean are subclasses of int

23248003
slideup	slidedown
in the first collapsible animation works but in the second only the animations slideup and slidedown work with offset nothing happens

23248084
int	double
your second example above fails as you are aggregating a double with an int

23248133
button	checkbox
if you want to enable disable checkbox when you click on an apply button you can follow anonymous advice and put the test on an actionlistener

23248159
harfbuzz	freetype
after installation of harfbuzz we have access to freetype

23248159
freetype	cairo	fontconfig	freetype	fontconfig	cairo
build and install cairo after . configure please make sure freetype and fontconfig are found

23248162

if your data is numeric use an appropriate numeric type int for int values float or double for floating-point values decimal for decimal values etc.

23248218
integer	unsigned
select fields convert y unsigned integer as ynum

23248294
post	get
i have tried many solutions on other post but i just can t get it right

23248398

2.2.2 json library for the class a but i m stuck because i don t know how to implements that using a companion object i couldn t annotate type parameters in the companion object and even if i extends i don t know how to implements

23248441
width	height
set width and height 100 this doesn t do anything 4 3 remains

23248441
width	height
using javascript to get the parent divs height and width then setting it for the video no effect 4 3 ratio remains no size change

23248465

supports a splash screen icon for the exe you can enforce single instance of the exe min max jre versions graceful error message if jre not supplied etc etc

23248466

if you mean to multiplying the bracketed subtraction values you should put a between the end and start brackets of each pair ie

23248479
min	max
i d like to print on the graph also values of min and max value

23248508
children	parent
its type in the list of children of its parent element

23248514
jobs	cron
for automated manipulation of cron jobs you are highly encouraged to make usage of the folder etc cron.d and friends

23248558
implements	extends
to avoid this behavior you must implements your own adapter extends arrayadapter for example and overrid getitemid method

23248567
convertview	spinner
if you don t like the header approach and go your way there s an additional caveat you will have to consider the fact that when the spinner row 0 exits the screen that row view will be passed to you in convertview to render a normal item aka view recycling

23248588
margin	height
i tried different solutions and setting the margin to negative margin on a textblock simply works and preserves the line height as you requested

23248651
put	get
positions start at 0 just fyi and while jpblanc s answer is correct and honestly better from a technical standpoint you should be able to add this to your parameter list for the user name to get the same results without having to put them in quotes

i have a build-from source linux system on another computer gentoo linux that has all of the debug symbols from all installed applications automatically saved in usr lib debug and that entire directory is only 600mb

23248780
dictionary	map
on the other hand if you have a variable named name1 somewhere else in your code and you are trying to display its value by calling you might need to store a map of variable names and values in a dictionary or use locals or globals

23248789
portrait	landscape
if i rotate the screen landscape portrait the oncreateview of the fragment is called instead of calling its attached activity s oncreate method

23248839

you will need obviously a folder somewhere in the website s directory

23248884
gif	bmp
you will need to store the new file path somewhere database xml file flat text etc. so when the user requests to see the image you will open this file and return it in the response stream as its proper type jpg gif bmp etc. so the user is prompted to open it or save it

23248895
put	get
i m trying to load a map from a image i get the hex codes for every pixel on my image which is put into map

23248896
put	get
i figure i may have to look into using some kind of queue to put the print requests into when the trigger fires so that it doesn t block a bunch of other queries while things are printing or something but i m trying to figure out how to get the document printed as close as i can to when the record is created or updated in the database

23248917
put	get
when you use property_map via get put functions it is only doing a bit of template meta-programming magic to create a thin wrapper that will just read write the correct individual property for a vertex or edge

23248924
inherited	properties
i thought i could use a poco as a base object and create entities that inherited from this and implement extra ef properties such as their id key but ef6 doesn t seem to allow this

serializable	deserialization
the mapping plugin is a great idea for automating both the serializable and deserialization of data with knockout...it s just not always necessary if you have the option of initializing your data sets manually...it s good practice anyways

23249529
tabcontrol	tabitem
the simplest way to achieve this is to have one view model for the whole tabcontrol which shares its properties over the various tabitem s

23249542

23249661
width	margin
the answer with the plain css has the right css but if you want to add margin to the images to separate them you will need to lower the max-width width elements

23249721
int	double
instead it was standardised that everything passed as a parameter would either be the size of an int this included all pointers or it would be a double

23249721
int	double
this meant that when you were writing the function all the parameters that weren t double were stored on the stack as int no matter how you declared them and the compiler put code in the function to handle this for you

23249721
int	chars
this made things somewhat inconsistent so when k r wrote their famous book they put in the rule that a chars literal would always be promoted to an int in any expression not just a function parameter

23249721
int	chars
when the ansi committee first standardised c they changed this rule so that a chars literal would simply be an int since this seemed a simpler way of achieving the same thing

23249721
int	chars
the advantage of this in c++ is that a function with a chars parameter and a function with an int parameter have different signatures

it s a partialfunction and can be use here in your flatmap

23249939
partialfunction	flatmap
this means that the function block i m passing to flatmap is a partialfunction that is only invoked for items that match the case statement

23249973
width	margin
to get full width take the margin off your body

23249973
pull	push
in order to make the contents push pull with top margin we also need to give it a bit of top padding

23250005
width	height
for instance if the picture was taken in portrait mode i would like the width of the image in the div to be the same as the width of the div and scale the height proportionately centering the image vertically within the div

23250472
public	protected
if so the answer is yes public and protected methods and variables from a parent class are available in an extended class

23250492
free	malloc
the difference is that with malloc you must somewhere explicitly use free itemstock

23250507
int	chars
this is confusing as i thought that the array itself would be changed as the value is a pointer to the memory address in contrast with using the method on a chars int variable which would not affect the value of the variable

width	column-count
causes the element to affect the position of other elements instead of simply overlapping and the width expansion is limited by the column-count 5

23251588

how can we make it so when the element expands it simply covers over any overlapping elements instead of pushing them and properly expand the width even with column-count 5

23254345
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
in this particular case i also had a contextmenu on my shellview bound using the caliburn.micro conventions to a series of commands which instantiated and activated various other viewmodel usually with a corresponding usercontrol using the activateitem method on the conductor

23254345
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
at other times when i ve needed to trigger viewmodel from elsewhere in the application i ve used the caliburn.micro eventaggregator to publish custom events opennewbrowser which can be handled by classes implementing the corresponding interface so your main viewmodel could have a simple handle method responsible for opening the required view

switching	screens
i sometimes use a generic method along these lines ensure that if i have an existing instance of a screens of a particular type switching to it or create a new instance if not

jmenubar	jmenuitem
sure here is a simple jmenubar that holds an edit jmenu that holds jmenuitem for copy cut and paste with just that code borrowed from my example

23254552
switching	screens
the problem is that when the user fills out the login form and logs in the view does change to the main view but it does not receive events clicking the logout button does nothing. i know this is not a problem with the view itself because if the main view is loaded without switching to the login screens it will detect clicking the logout button

23255651
screens	tablet
they changed that paradigm in bootstrap 3 now you do not need to include an additional css file for the responsive features it is all included so i wouldn t call this a mobile first approach but an approach that is flexible for different screens sizes regardless of the device weather it be desktop tablet mobile projector etc i would say more its more device agnostic approach

23255651
screens	tablet
ultimately the css simply rendered based on the screens size i wouldn t call it a mobile first then desktop then tablet approach at all simply responsive to the screens size

min	max
to calculate this it looks at the min and max round-trip delay from the presumably perfect root clock as well as its own error in its system clock

getter	setter
if you are happy with the variable being public it s accessible though getter and setter anyway then just add a to the interface

23256092
getter	setter
the compiler will add a getter and a setter getcid and cid automatically

23256092
getter	setter
you could add much more customization again declaring the ivar yourself providing custom getter and setter but there is no need for that when all you need from the property is what you have shown in your question and its code examples

23256163
ubuntu	linux
some hints of how doing that in linux can be found at change read write access of a folder in ubuntu linux

23256169
try-catch	exception-handling
since the error is happening in onclick of the button and then try to capture everything inside onlick in exception-handling using try - catch also surrond the whole button click inside try-catch

23256178
ubuntu	debian
the differences between the servers are intovps was running ubuntu 10.10 and digital ocean is running debian

23256188
interpolation	splines
of course you could do fancier interpolation with a splines being the next step

23256188
interpolation	splines
for comparison see the uncropped version with linear vs splines interpolation

23256226
opencv	emgucv
i m trying to convert a small opencv python script to emgucv with c#

23256262
for-loop	loops
change your while loops to use iterators or make it a for-loop with length

23256276
for-loop	arrays
i tried to handle it like an arrays in c using a for-loop like so

23256360
super	extends
i m pretty sure i can t use super cause i m not extends a class

23256370
width	height
you will also need to set the x and y for each block as well as the width and height

23256407
children	parent
the reason is that we cannot update the parent s completed unit count while any member of a group of children those attached to it as child progresses while a progress is current is unfinished

23256407
children	parent
if you want to track the completion of these children more closely then you can have the parent become current more frequently with a smaller unit count

23256407
children	parent
then when the children are completed the parent will update its completed unit count more frequently

23256458
width	height
you can get bottom height left right top width by calling

23256470
disk	ram
i have used a variation of this algorithm before where only a sample of the top-matching docs were analysed for significant terms and this approach requires less ram as only the top n docs are read from disk and tokenised using termvectors or an analyzer

23256474
bmp	png	gif	png	gif	bmp
i have tried most formats jpeg gif png bmp

23256501
viewdidload	viewwillappear
so far i ve tried putting and in all the locations i could think of including the viewdidload method the unwindtosegue method that s coming from the add grocery item list view controller and also implementing a viewwillappear method as well

23256554
clang	llvm
clang can in principle be used as a cross compiler unlike most compilers clang llvm includes components such as the codegen assembler and linker for different platforms in the same binary

23256554
clang	llvm
the llvm project includes the lld linker which is apparently far enough along that it can self host on x86 windows and so might work for you as a cross-platform linker however lld is not yet a standard part of clang distributions

23256576
post	get
to solve issues with malformed post requests and at the same time to get better support for errors etc i d suggest you to use more advanced libraries like afnetworking

23256576
post	put
using post requests instead of put ones in your code you re basically doing a put request even if you declare it as post has the advantage of allowing you to pass more parameters without using headers and better support server-side

23256607
post	get
however the end routes must use an http verb like get post etc.

23256632
spaces	delimiter
the gotcha here is that len ignores trailing spaces as you have in both of these delimiter

23256654
getter	setter
changing your arraylist declarations to list in both beans and regenerate getter and setter

23256655
post	get
i have tried using distinct on but also get multiple results back which i will also post below

23256663
preorder	inorder
i am trying to build a tree using the preorder and inorder traversals list of ints

23256703
division	modulo
euclid s modulo algorithm shown below uses division but the worst case number of loops n is n 5 log10 smaller number or n 1.50515 log2 smaller number

23256715
prawn	gruff
eggie5 regarding using gruff with prawn to insert an image without saving it to disk it s pretty simple

23256741
onfocus	onblur
do i have to reference onblur and also onfocus somewhere in my code because it breaks when i try and click on the textbox in question

23256819
aggregate-functions	sum
or wrapped in an aggregate-functions here sum because you want to roll it up according to some rule

23256840
int	chars
when using an input stream to read a chars it is not read as an int hex or otherwise but as a text chars

23256871
punctuation	words
this function checks that it is actually a text node before doing a replace the replace only does words characters a-za-z0-9_ that are 1 or more characters so will not replace spaces or symbols punctuation etc will stay put

23256988
versioning	upgrade
upgrade angulardart from versioning 0.9.x to 0.10.0 with the following changes

23257000
textview	imageview
there is a workaround do not use checkbox but instead of it you can use for example drawable imageview or textview with parameter setclickable true or xml

23257012
png	ico
i have found this tool www.nongnu.org icoutils but it seems to me that you can only extract .ico file from the executable then convert it into png or do the opposite it takes pngs and it creates an .ico but it can t write the new ico into the executable

23257013
3des	aes
tea and xtea are just block ciphers so they can be used like any other block cipher such as 3des aes or cameilla

23257026
for-loop	loops
the for-loop that would be equivalent to your while loops would have math.pow as the second expression so that that value will be tested against datalength + bits each time

23257090
folder	dir
as is as i add new docs to the dir folder the date associated with each file is ultimately rendering the same.

23257116
google-chrome	firefox
perhaps there are google-chrome firefox extensions that allow you to embed things into google docs presentations which are html5 svg based but other than that this is not possible

23257142
width	height
i finally used the vh unit and applied it to height and width of all the squares

23257195
subtraction	addition
it makes it a bit easier to convert between formats and do date time addition and subtraction imho

23257216
printf	strncpy	printf	strstr	strstr	strncpy	strstr	substr
i ve created a program in c which uses the strstr strncpy and printf functions to replace all substr with a replacement string

23257225
accessor	properties
trivial properties accessor are a waste of time imo

23257235
integer	unsigned
s_addr the in_addr record is a variant type that can be interpreted as either a uint32 4-byte unsigned integer or as an array of 4 individual bytes

23257235
integer	unsigned
assign this ulong 4-byte unsigned integer to the former interpretation

23257293
exif	xmp
this chunk of code gets xmp metadata and cleans out the jpeg exif headers using regex

23257318
super	implements
in case of interfaces it returns true if the class or a super class of the object reference implements this interface

23257384
x86	mips
i was told that the implementation for c inline functions in different platforms mips vs x86 is a little different

23257384
x86	mips
for example inline function for one of them mips or x86 still allocates stack and thus not so efficient

23257387
put	get
to test this correctly you have to put data into the repository let the repository run the expression over the data which can itself be mocked or in-memory and assert that you get the expected data in return

23257409
portrait	landscape
this is by design having your app in landscape and login flow in portrait settings cause some problems with rendering - but it looks like you want to use landscape orientation for login as well

23257412
versioning	upgrade
i d also check to see what versioning of mongodb you are running and possibly upgrade to a recent stable release as a way to fix any known bugs

23257419
width	height
for example i have the following css code that resizes images to 100 height of the space available and auto s the width

23257419
width	height
the height will resize the width will not like below

23257432
inline	inlining
consider all functions for inlining even if they are not declared inline

23257433
apache	nginx
it works perfect in apache but nginx does not work me

23257466
hide	show
after reading some articles i figured out that java swing applications use one jframe and panels to hide or show content some thing like single page application

23257466
super	extends	hide	show
do i need to create 4 main classes log in normal user admin super and each one extends one jframe because they are particularly different applications and this jframes have their own classes panles with them i hide show content on them

23257466
hide	show
or log in is my main jframe and after log in i show a different panel normal user admin or super in a different window or dialog and they have their panels to hide show content

23257481
strcpy	strncpy
note that you should generally use strncpy instead of strcpy everywhere in the code below but i am trying to preserve as much of your original code as possible so i have made simplifying assumptions

23257489
dictionary	map
or depending on your taste you can use map and dictionary

23257511
preorder	inorder
i need to make a function that builds a tree from a preorder and inorder traversal but i m not sure where i should put the makenode and recursive calls to construct the tree properly

23257580
google-chrome	firefox
this is my code it works in firefox but not ie or google-chrome

23257591
super	extends	hide	show
do i need to create 4 main classes log in normal user admin super and each one extends one jframe because they are particularly different applications and this jframes have their own classes panles with them i hide show content on them

if you want guaranteed iteration from 0 and to ignore inherited enumerable properties replace for..in with a for while or do loop

23257622
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

23257656
google-chrome	firefox
this is a simple fix that works for all the cases i ve tested in both firefox and google-chrome

23257657
stdout	stderr
because it does not go through stdout or stderr

23257678
min	max
with that table joined in you could add an appropriate aggregate expression in the select list sum min max avg

23257774
metaclass	subclassing
below is a complete running example showing how to use a metaclass to make sure that subclassing methods have the same signatures as their base classes

23257824
google-chrome	firefox
edit 2 more specifically this is for a browser-based webgl game hence the performance requirement so whatever features are in the current javascript interpreters of google-chrome and firefox are available

23257872
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
it s fine until step 3 configure amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk

octal	hex	octal	decimal	octal	binary	hex	binary
i m trying to make a desktop calculator with different options hex binary octal decimal and if a value is entered that is not of that mode an error will appear saying for example binaryinteger expected the user entered 909382 and prompt again

23257919
width	height
the width and height are edittext objects

23257919
width	height
after i have entered the width and height the values for perimeter and area should be shown in real-time based on the calcarea and calcperimeter methods

23257941

google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine in google-chrome but in ie and firefox the whole element is stuck to the top of the page

23258046
velocity	thymeleaf
you can also leverage other template engines such as velocity and thymeleaf to have better and more fluid html5 pages

23258080
prepare	execute
it s effectively a different protocol mode in postgresql and it doesn t make much sense to use the usual jdbc interfaces with prepare statements execute etc for it

23258083
qlineedit	qlabel
you could create a qlineedit subclass instead tweaked to look and act like a qlabel

23258169
apache	nginx
so in the above case the webserver ex apache nginx does not care what is inside the opening and closing tags and sends the entire code to the php interpreter and php would compute that script according the way it understands it and sends only the computed result back to the server as plain html

23258239
post	get
i ve read dozens of post still can t get a clear idea to achieve this function

23258270

when i analyzed the sample code in the debugger the sdl_mixer function mix_freechunk used free from msvcrt.dll while the calling code called malloc from one of the modern visual c runtime libraries like msvcr110.dll or static version

23258369
int	chars
in this program we want to encode the string by increasing each chars by the int offset in alphabetical order

23258380
inherited	properties
i m incorrectly thinking that the child would inherited the pid properties and could be referred to by this.pid but it cannot

23258421
express	node.js
you build node.js app with express v4.x then start your app by npm start

23258422

i would get an error because it would try to put pan in for mpaa and rating 1 would be pg and so on

23258541
distance	polygons
so the real question now is to find the distance from your starting point to any other point in the enclosing polygons graph

23258553
for-loop	arrays
or just like an arrays in c c++ we can direct access memory using without for-loop

23258638
range	minimum
the solution is to reduce the copied range to the minimum number of rows to capture all of your data which will also speed up your code

23258646
width	height
the user inputs a list of words width and height settings word placement settings etc

23258681
udp	rtp
here s the problem we have an application that uses the gstreamer avdec_h264 plugin for displaying an rtp over udp stream

23258681
ffmpeg	libav
the problem is that the internal version of libav seems to disable all the protocols that ffmpeg supplies

23258681
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
2 built the internal libav to allow for rtp udp and tcp protocols or written a custom avio callback using the ffpipe protocol

23258699
typedef	struct
maybe i had to use inside the struct player or maybe i had to use because i really hate using typedef s

23258699
typedef	struct
those typedef s eliminate the use for a type which in this case is a struct so my structure was very screwed up

those same calculations will also be needed for keyboard events mouse clicks text marking text cut copy and paste etc etc

23258795
antivirus	norton
this happened some time yesterday and i finally figured out that norton antivirus was installed blocking that port

23258802
int	double
this is the warning you should get with any decent compiler warning format specifies type unsigned int but the argument has type double

23258807
int	chars
i think you meant which means to print the chars whose chars code is that int which is ok because you read this earlier with scanf

23258849
g++	gcc
the gcc option line is g++ -fnon-call-exceptions -o2 -i include main.cpp if i remove fnon-call-exception option this problem goes

23258900
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
the header file for the view controller should declare the class as implementing the uipickerviewdatasource and uipickerviewdelegate protocols

23258942
getter	setter
or better still make the fields private and access them via getter setter calls on the reference

23258946
mousemove	mousedown
i found that it is possible to simulate a click with queryselector #myelement .click but i would like to be able to trigger more complex events like mousedown in a particular place of the document mousemove touchstart and touchend etc

23258985
flask	django
oddly enough i can install some packages like flask django and few others

23258999
button	checkbox
when save button i clicked all the checkbox that has been checked and all the value of the textboxes can be save progress then he she can continue it when he log in again

23259037

the point is that for determining boolean all we care about is whether the next int value is even or odd

23259073
bluetooth	usb
all of the tutorials i have found are based on bluetooth communication and the information i have found about usb is always like better change to bluetooth or think about it as a com port

23259073
bluetooth	usb
i had previously sent those commands via bluetooth but the connection fails too often to be useful and is slower than usb

23259108
post	get
there must be a way to get back the __viewstate that asp.net uses and capture this while resending back the post request with the proper form data

23259121
box-sizing	border-box
according to a post on the janrain community forum this is due to bootstrap s use of box-sizing border-box

23259121
box-sizing	border-box
i tried disabling box-sizing border-box

23259195
integer	unsigned
were it an unsigned integer it would just be another value-bit

23259195
integer	unsigned
in java se 8 and later you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 232-1

23259195
integer	unsigned
use the integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer

23259195
integer	unsigned
static methods like compareunsigned divideunsigned etc have been added to the integer class to support the arithmetic operations for unsigned integers

23259242
qabstractitemmodel	qabstracttablemodel	qtableview	qabstractitemmodel	qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
if you are inside a custom data model perhaps inheriting from qabstracttablemodel since we re discussing qtableview s you can inform the view that a change of data has occurred by emitting the qabstractitemmodel datachanged signal

23259261
screens	tablet
but now i have to move my application to 10inch screens tablet which means my application does not fit

23259267

23259385
daemons	launchd
is there way to connect to gradle daemons launchd by gradle tooling apis from command line

23259398
width	height
what i was thinking is that i will add one linearlayout with weightsum as 100 then inside that i will have one view with 0dp as width and 20dp as height and i will set the view s weight as per the percentage and fill it with some beautiful nice color

23259429
versioning	upgrade
this link suggests you need to upgrade to a newer cmake versioning

23259448

otherwise you can pull merge commit and push again

23259573
folder	directory
i edited the sonar-project.properties file to give the full path instead of a relative current directory path of . to my project s source code replacing backslashes with forward slashes and ran the sonar-runner command again from the command line while the working directory was the path of my source folder

23259614

if yes then the problem is on the folder permission or you might have opened the wrong directory if not you might wanna try to clear the browser cache or use another platform to open it

23259730
super	self
super as the receiver of a message is the same object as self

23259756
button	checkbox
presumably you have some kind of actionlistener attached to each jbutton so you know when the user clicks on one if you don t take a look at how to use button checkbox and radio button and how to write an action listener

23259778
width	height
when i give specific px for width and height in #sitemenu i can see the icon

23259778

23259951
super	implements
super can be used on any method that your superclass implements

23259952
put	get	post	get	post	put
since you mentioned that the external users are allowed access to readonly pages i presume all the requests from external requests will be only get requests and a few put post requests when users choose to use filters

23259952
filtering	grouping
exceptions should be made for the pages that allow applying filtering and grouping

23259955

23260026
x86	64bit	ia-32	x86
the purpose of the _m_ix86 macro is really just an indicator that you re targeting the intel ia-32 processor familyâ more commonly known as good old 32-bit x86â in contrast to one of the other supported target architectures like _m_amd64 for 64bit x86

23260031
int	chars	put	get
else you can add an int to the function call and if the chars is null put the needed size on that int in this way you can call the function one time without the stringbuilder get the size initialize it with such size and call again the function with the stringbuilder

23260062
post	get
if you wish to get taxonomy associated with particular post

for-loop	arrays
finally the last thing you have to do is alter the actual json output to make sure your extra column is accounted for in the for-loop at the end right before the json_encode because it inserts items into the row arrays which is what becomes aadata the returned row data based on how many columns you ve specified in the acolumns arrays and because you left out any you ve aliased the count will be wrong and you will get an error that looks something like requested unknown parameter from data source row

23261863

you can keep the changed state in hidden field and use those hidden field no server side to show or hide div

23262359
width	height
but values from vectors are bigger than pagesize width and height

23262359
width	height
there are two major causes why the vector values can be beyond width and height of the latter

23262359
width	height
in that case height and width would both be 100 but all coordinates of points in that rectangle would be higher

23262359
width	height
thus do not look at width and height but instead at left bottom right and top

23262388
int	boolean
if the property is basic data type int boolean date etc - show

and finally in restful web services convention crud create retrieve update delete operations are mapped to http methods post get put delete

23262441
subobject	instances
if you really want a subobject like this then you will need to intialize that subobject in the engine constructor so that each tile object is set up uniquely and then you will need to add its engine pointer to the tile instances data so that when engine.tile.draw is called you can get the appropriate engine instances from the this pointer that points to the tile object

23262464
post	get
like others suggested use post method but if you want to stick with get and javascript solution is enough values can be seen in request same as with post but furthermore users with disabled js will see the values you can use approach described here

23262617
stdout	stderr
the temporary files aren t written to stdout or stderr

23262617

like you did it s like a quirk behave for me because i don t know .element selector and if you look inside the consolle could you see that no margin is applied in the styles tab but only a computed height is calculated perhaps for some strange behavior it isn t suppouse to work right

23279905
width	height
till i know only height width and padding are considerate for real element dimensions

i v a nested for-loop but it slows a little bit processing how can i make the nested loops an efficient

23280016
min	max
that will give you a random number between max and min + 1

23280026
groovy	gsp
the reason for this is that javascript .js and other non gsp .gsp files aren t parsed through the groovy server pages engine

23280092
stdout	stderr
see this answer if you want to get both stdout stderr separately in the unlimited case

23280146

23280226
inherited	properties
i have several styles that use sass extend or include to inherited properties from selectors imported from bootstrap scss files

23280249
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
also although a for-loop wasn t ideal in this case in other cases where you find yourself needing to loops through sparse arrays one where not every number is set you can use a foreach loops

23280251
toupper	ctype
based on my current understanding but can someone confirm this this function has to call both ctype toupper and collate compare for the given locale extracted as always using use_facet

23280251
toupper	ctype
however because collate compare in particular requires 4 pointer args you either need to pass these 4 args for every char you need to compare after first calling ctype toupper or alternatively convert both strings to upppercase first and then make a single call to collate compare

23280269
int	chars
problem is when i change variable from int to chars somevalue like this

cos	sin
when position equals click position you will have atan of a very small value toggling due to the adding of cos sin later

23280666
cos	sin
however you need a conditional check to stop animating as now you just add the values from cos sin and nothing is stopping it here is one way of doing it

23280666
atan2	sin	cos	atan2	cos	sin
tip 2 cache the angle value and calculation once then you don t have to calculate atan2 cos sin each time as they are relative expensive operation

23280668
implements	extends
i don t want to extends each class as i cannot do that for a second time so instead i m trying to implements an interface

cpu	affinity
i found that there a few combinations of batch file trickery that can yield a memory leak how fast or slow depends on what is put in the batch file not how many carets but sequences of pipes and interestingly line length more later and regardless of crash or memory leak the parser code is in a tight loop on a single thread so cpu usage increases significantly single core cpu or pushed to a single affinity yields an average of 98+ cpu usage

23284136
getter	setter
to accomplish what you want and keep it as a struct and not have to pass a dummy parameter when instantiating the struct the workaround is to use a good old-fashioned property with an explicit getter and setter

the reason this not working is that all the parameters on the right hand side are of type int thus the calculations are being done in int not double as you think

23293956
int	double
int division will not have decimal values just because you are assigning their values to a double variable

23293962
int	double
this means that your result is rounded down to the next int before it s ever converted to a double

23293962
int	double
you need to make sure c# treats the division as a division of double s not int s for example

23293984
int	double
when the compiler analyses a b it has no idea that the result will later on be converted to double so it just compiles the computation as an int division

since the overlay has a height and width of 100 you are causing the #scroll element to become inaccessible due to the .overlay element covering it entirely

23297584
submit	submission
how can i submit the form below without submission the page

23297585

google-chrome and firefox just keep waiting for myapp.dev

23298149
put	get
if you want to say create a new paginator or call facebook from your controller to get info and there s no definite place to put that users can have facebook info but if you have another controller named friends you might have to put some facebook functions there too

23298684
keydown	keyup
i know that i can use the keydown keyup and keypress events to handle keyboard input but the input uses ascii input meaning that it s not smooth when i hold down a key the events are repeated as if i was typing something triggering it once waiting half a second and only then repeating

23298909
client-side	server-side
first i m assuming you re using this as a client-side script and not server-side

23298917
int	boolean	keyevent	onkeydown
alternatively try implementing the view.onkeylistener interface in your activity or overriding public boolean dispatchkeyevent keyevent e or overriding public boolean onkeydown int keycode keyevent event

23298922
int	chars
note that getchar returns the chars read as an unsigned chars cast to an int

23298934
screens	tablet
it s to be viewed on phones and tablet so i can t just ignore some screens sizes

23298936

23299040
keydown	keyup
to keep track of keys that are pressed you use the keydown and keyup events

23299040
keydown	keyup
note that the keydown event is not always followed by a keyup event for the same key but the events can overlap

23299040
keydown	keyup
typing an uppercase a for example typically produces these keydown and keyup events

23299096
scrollmagic	superscrollorama
i previously used superscrollorama and i started to use scrollmagic but i cant manage to get some divs properly animated

23299097

i have a remote branch where i pushed up changes from my local then realize there was changes to master so i checkin to master run git pull then go back to my local branch and run git rebase master however i cant push to my remote branch now because my local is ahead of it

23299116
ansible	puppet
i can personally recommend puppet and ansible

23299135
client-side	server-side
because javascript is client-side and php is server-side which means that essentially the two don t see each other so you actually have an empty function

23299146
debian	linux
compiling and running on a debian linux system gives identical results

23299159

23299227
debian	linux
note that these tests are currently only tested on debian linux

if you want to maintain the startdate through the process you need to put it in a for helper on the view except display and it will post back to the controller

23299232
post	get
the value form the get will come back to the post

23299256
move	drag
i d also like to make it so when the object is dragged to an invisible coordinate on the screen it immediately move to the direction i flick it towards within z seconds like what happens when we drag from one screen to another screen on our ios home screen

23299279
hide	show
imo the easiest way to handle this is to place an iframe wrapper around the swf - then it won t shut down reload when you show hide the div container

23299282
hide	show
onle one is show the others are hide

23299295
put	get
if you have a list of 1000 items and try to put 600 in the test set when you have 550 items in the test set you be trying to get a random int that is greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to

23299339
versioning	upgrade
you can either upgrade to django development versioning or use use_natural_keys keyword

23299419
width	height
there are many ways for doing this my first approach is to first check you are getting file in is its okay then there is functions available in php to check file size means this will give you files size in bytes and height and width as well

23299452
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox removed support for this type of response when used with xmlhttprequest but afaik they are still allowed for image elements

23299476
post	get
if you also want to see which boxes were unchecked then things get a little more complicated because post and get will only pass the values of checked check-boxes

23299494
hide	show
anyways is there a way to hide a select menu and on click of a button open the select menu and since mobile devices show a popup box id want this for my navigation for mobiles responsive

the power of karma is that it can spawn real browsers - such google-chrome or firefox - to effectively test your code with them

23299613
mouseover	mouseout
so when mouseover the element rotates but on mouseout it doesn t rotate the other way back to the initial state

23299628
width	height
it appears that you aren t passing the width and height correctly to gltexsubimage2d

23299692
width	height
the problem is you have an infinite loop due to bigcircle width and height being adjusted based on its size width height

23299720
boost	stl
i am using c++ but not c++0x and i am forced to avoid stl and boost

23299721
int	chars
however note that if the sequence of numeric chars in the buffer is too long to fit into an int then the behaviour is undefined because of signed int overflow

23299727
nstextstorage	nstextattachment
i noticed using the - void textstorage nstextstorage textstorage willprocessediting nstextstorageeditactions editedmask range nsrange editedrange changeinlength nsinteger delta and enumerating the text storage for attachments and replacing them with custom nstextattachment subclass is not productive and is slowing down the rendering a lot

google-chrome	firefox
or fancier still dashcast a linux windows streaming service which encodes live streams in the html5 mpeg-dash format currently supported by ie and google-chrome firefox support is on the way

23299781
put	get
if you want to get fancy you could put a parameter on the constructor in class1 to allow you to set naming when the object is created

23299796
iequalitycomparer	iqueryable
i ve seen many articles saying that you cannot do that but when i look at the signatures for the distinct extension method i see this this iqueryable source iequalitycomparer comparer

hash	md5
generate your password md5 hash

23299797
hash	md5

23299917
versioning	upgrade
as i ve gone back and forth between new and old versioning of the source scrapping and snapping and growling like a mama bear whose cubs have been cornered by a cougar and finally got it to actually compile and build again i don t want to upgrade the project to 3.5

23299926
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
all my uiviewcontroller start with uinavigationcontroller

23300036
hide	show	zfcuser	bjyauthorize
i have recently installed zfcuser and bjyauthorize and would like to use them to show or hide various parts of the layout.phtml file

23300036
hide	show
i understand that bjyauthorize is a firewall of sorts and the flowchart from git hub suggests it should be possible to get current permission status and to use that to hide or show a particular section of code

23300079
action-filter	onactionexecuting
i don t believe there is a way to actually wrap a method in a using statement with an attribute but you could essentially do the same thing by using the onactionexecuting and onresultexecuted methods in a custom action-filter

23300103
nexus	artifactory
if you don t use a repository manager such as nexus or artifactory look into it

23300222
jar	war
the second thing needs to be done is signing your jar war ear file

23300305
width	height
you can t instead just create a div with fixed width height and overflow auto put your table inside of it apply some styling and it will look just the same as it would in textearea

23300308
children	parent
parent span should have display to block and float to left and it must have the width size manually to handle children width sizes

23300317
int	chars
now i want to do the reverse process ie given an int return its corresponding ascii chars

23300405
ienumerable	iqueryable
in general i believe that everything that can be done to an ienumerable through linq can be done to an iqueryable

you might need to define classes with stream overloading and getter and setter

23303853
cout	cin
you don t overload std cin and std cout but operator and operator of your class on a specific stream

23303853
cout	cin	getter	setter
in most cases you use getter and setter for manipulate your data but operators overload is useful when you want to manipulate your object as a whole and not only in simple cin cout cases

each call to malloc shall match exactly one call to free

23322052
free	malloc
please note that exactly the values as returned by malloc need to be passed to free

23322060
mouseup	mousedown
use mousedown and mouseup events to change the background image of the button

23322062
free	malloc
thus when the return value of malloc is passed to free it frees the entire memory block allocated

23322079
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
also firefox isn t really preferred browser - html5 standard that works on google-chrome and opera perfectly doesn t really works on firefox

23322121
coalesce	isnull
the biggest difference is that isnull is proprietary while coalesce is part of sql standard

23322121
coalesce	isnull
isnull uses the type of the first argument while coalesce follows the same rules as case and picks the type with higher precedence

23322121
coalesce	isnull
validations for isnull and coalesce is different because null value for isnull is converted to int but triggers an error with coalesce

23322121
coalesce	isnull
isnull takes only two parameters whereas coalesce takes variable number of parameters

23322255
multiplication	modulo
native codegen doesn t do much strength reduction in contrast to llvm which readily converts the modulo into multiplication shift and magic numbers

23322266
superclass	subclassing
i believe that you mean when you have to explicitly invoke superclass constructor from subclassing

23322318
post	get
authorization pass get token and launch a dialogue posting it appears i can post

23322345
filtering	grouping
i am trying to put two rs filtering in a script grouping

23322363
put	get
since http is stateless you cannot get these information by an ajax call without storing them somewhere so you will need to put the following code in www.mysite.com index.html and get rid of the ajax call

23322373
post	get
when i try to retrieve the list of users who likes an item ex a post a picture i get only a partial list

in case that didn t work very well with the height get the width you just got from the preivous method and use in the next method to get the appropriate height you need

23322543
int	chars
but i am not able to understand how to add an int value to a chars

23322555
client-side	server-side
i know this may draw some heat as not good question etc. but i haven t found anywhere describing the process in particular all the resources i ve found describe the client-side requesting not the server-side responses

23322575
ember.js	backbone.js
to do so you can implement it from scratch or use one of the existing spa frameworks such as angularjs jquery mobile ember.js backbone.js etc

23322581

parent views listening to click events on a class which is present in some or all children views

23322589

add a rectange object to a list consists of x y width and height

23322736
subtraction	addition
additionexpression subtractionexpression - two classes that extends compoundexpression and will represent addition subtraction expression e.g 5+3 9-2...

23322776
width	height
you can try small width and height type image replace of that

23322777
inherited	properties
third there is inherited in logger but you can cut it with additivity properties see log4j.properties file - multiple loggers in same class

23322780
width	height
this property will include padding and border to the width height of inputs so they won t overflow anymore

23322792
unsigned	short
there can be 2 reasons for such error different number of channels or different type of data for example if first matrix contain unsigned char and second matrix contain unsigned short

23322822
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox is show correctly but sadly in google-chrome it doesn t

23322826
debian	linux
on a linux system like debian you can compile this program with

23322827
sudo	passwd
first you could configure sudo to avoid asking you the passwd

23322827
pthreads	fork
to answer your question about qt remember that bash 1 like all pthreads shells hence bin sh accept the -c argument with a string actually system 3 is fork a bin sh -c

23322843
post	get
you are concatenating your datastring like a get - string which is used for passing it via urls but doesn t work in post - requests like this

23322886
.htaccess	httpd.conf
there is a setting for the apache mime module where it misses adding the type for javascript to resolve it simply open the .htaccess or httpd.conf file add the following lines

23322902
subclass	abstract-class
but compoundexpression once again is an abstract-class the way the two operands are combined depends on the actual subclass

23322922
for-loop	loops
or you can do this with a good old fashioned for-loop and some if loops

23322925
rss	feed
the difference is that except for very simplistic logging if your needs ever expand to configurability filtering errors generating rss feed or building a browsing ui around logged errors then you ll pretty much end up writing the same code in your application_error as elmah gives you

23323013
google-chrome	firefox
i tried ie firefox and google-chrome browsers

23323046
children	parent
the additivity flag is the exception to this rule - setting a logger s additivity to false essentially disconnects the arrow from a logger up to its parent so messages generated by that logger or flowing into it from one of its children will not go any further up the tree they will only go to appenders attached directly to the logger in question

23323102
button	checkbox
but if i press the select all most above button in the selectcheckboxmenu the ajax call is not working muti function won t run and the listaa list about the pressed checkbox is not changing

23323167
width	height
edit i managed to do it using two javafx property in my griddisplay class corresponding to the fixed height and width of my grid

23323167
width	height
the size of the children inside the grid correspond to a fraction of the height and width of the grid depending on the number of rows and columns

23323188
hide	show
uses classes to do the show hide so we can set css animations on the .active class if we like

23323189
children	parent
you can accomplish this by using a combination of vertical-align on the children with line-height set on the parent for the vertical aligning and setting display table

23323202
google-chrome	firefox
i would check that the action url you are echoing in to the form is actually correct and then try manually browsing to it using a post simulator many plugins for firefox and google-chrome can do this

23323252
put	get
i want to make the page get to the top if that message appears i ve put a comment there in the code

23323338
width	height	listview	gridview
you cannot use a scrollview or a listview or a gridview here perfectly as you have not specified the width and height in a fixed manner by applying dp and dip

23323428
implements	extends
you can create baseactivity which will extends activity and implements your listener

23323482
pull	push
git operations like push pull clone and log

23323497
width	height
in case that didn t work very well with the height get the width you just got from the preivous method and use in the next method to get the appropriate height you need

23323502

23323525
qcombobox	qcompleter
you can use qcompleter to provide auto completions in any qt widget such as qlineedit and qcombobox

23323584
coalesce	isnull
in this case coalesce executed the inner select statement twice as opposed to isnull which executed it only once

23323585
int	chars
your way will not force the compiler to use chars instead if int

23323617
qdatastream	qbytearray
not sure if this can help but 1 file- close should be inside the if file- open otherwise it has no sense in closing it also 2 readall may return an empty qbytearray so i would test for contents before sending it to the stream and also avoid a qdatastream but just use qbytearray data reply- readall

23323738
repo	egit
i m working under windows and synchronize local and github repo through eclipse egit

23323742
opensuse	centos
the problem seems to be something to do with opensuse 12.3 and 13.1 but the issue is no longer a problem running subversion on centos 6.5

23323817
g++	gcc
2.the second thought i had was there are lot more open source tools to get code coverage for cpp compiled using gcc or g++

23323821
width	height
say like the viewport height width where you might need to deal with cross-browser issues depending on how far back you need ie support and whether you include another library to help you

23323862
int	double
double sigmax double sigmay 0 int bordertype border_default

23323876
serializable	deserialization
this comes with very high overhead though due to the request processing and serializable deserialization to from json xml which can be significant if you have to make lots of calls

23323889
switching	screens
but when i insert the switching statement they do not convert to letters and nothing appears on the screens

23323896
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it s the same on opera firefox and google-chrome

23323904
dokuwiki	foswiki
if you don t have to stick with foswiki you can try dokuwiki instead which has package support on openbsd and installs easily in very much the same way you tried already

23323926
width	height
if you want a container to have a fixed width but have the height of the container vary with the amount of text within it you can do something simple as

23323936

you can use the standard dom org.w3c.dom api or a more java-like api such as jdom or dom4j

23325586
jdom	dom4j
they are org.w3c.dom.nodelist so you have to use .item 0 and not if you use other dom apis such as jdom or dom4j it will seem more intuitive

and i m trying to write a simple spock test for it actually without any logic first just to check mocking capabilities of grails

23325964
public	protected
however if you create an object as toyota you do have access to the public or protected methods inside car

23325983
superclass	subclassing
but the point is that if you want to call a method of an object this method must be defined and implemented in the class or some superclass of that object while you can not call a method on a object where this method is only implemented in some of its subclassing because in this case that method is not present in that object but only on object of its subclassing

23326041
setinterval	settimeout
in other words just calling drawprimitive in settimeout or setinterval will not work

23326041
setinterval	settimeout
all of that is wrong when drawprimitive is finally called from settimeout setinterval

23326041
setinterval	settimeout
in other words you d need to include every gl call between calls to drawprimitive in your setinterval settimeout functions as well

23326045
portrait	landscape
so i believe it is still applying the portrait layer mask and not the landscape one

23326053

as jb nizet noted in his comments server-side and client-side validation should be separate layers and you should do both

23326119
multiplying	add
you cannot do this with eval as has been suggested because you would not be able to use your custom add and multiplying functions that way

23326119
multiplying	add
define your add and multiplying functions

23326119
multiplying	add
1 + 7 or 5 3 with regular expressions that can be passed to your add and multiplying functions

23326119
multiplying	add
this would have to be done recursively following your desired order of operations for your custom math in other words if you get 5 + 3 2 you will have parse out 3 2 and evaluate that before using its result to add to 5 assuming your order would be multiplying first

23326163
printf	fgets
we can use fgets but one of the problem of it is that it will even read n into array which will always print the output of next printf operation on one extra new line.this can cause problem when you want your output to be in tabular form

23326327
width	height
i m interested in the width and height marked in blue

23326368

i have some other files in these folder specific to the type of request and it would be easier if i can set the current working directory for each request

23326902
int	double
when i run the program it says cannot convert from double to int

23326946
int	double
as you can see in the documentation math.pow returns a double by design but if you need an int then an explicit cast must be performed

23326959
int	double
math.pow return double and you assigning double value to int this is why it is giving error

23326975
int	double
because of that for a general power it s actually faster to do math.power with a double and then convert it back to an int

23326992
put	get
i put into the content_controller but i get the error couldn t find user without an id

23327008

if you are ubuntu linux os you can install library

23327196
int	boolean
and the easiest way to make your point is to mention that other typed languages like visual basic have logical operators that can act on both boolean and int expressions

23327203
background-color	transparency
it goes through each child of an element recursively and if it isn t a text node sets the background-color to transparency effectively removing it

23327237

sample code it s working perfectly fine in firefox google-chrome as well as ie9

23327333
operands	scalar
use the direction you need to invert it just swap the operands in vector multiply or multiply vector by -1 scalar

23327344
lan	localhost
but when you will hit the same from some other machine over lan then just replace localhost with your ip

23327352

dpkg is the low level package tool of the debian distribution and derived distributions such as ubuntu linux mint and others

23327401
debian	centos
it does not work on centos because centos uses a different package format rpm and cannot work with packages that were made for the debian distribution

23327401
debian	centos
also you can not install packages without root access neither centos nor debian packages

23327412
division	modulo
use a modulo and a division operation to find the x and y coordinates

so i decided i want a feature test for that with rspec and capybara

23327437
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
yes i ve tried mytimer fire in the viewwillappear instead of viewdidappear as well but this causes other issues like the uiviewcontroller s elements show up rather abruptly when user switches to that view from other views or from background mode

23327442
int	chars
for example an int value of 42 with a size of 4 would result in a string __42 padded with a given chars space by default

23327448
public	protected
first i assume you mean your method is protected internal instead of public internal which isn t a valid method signature

23327450
javassist	cglib
otherwise you will have to use an external library like cglib javassist or asm or learn how java bytecode works

23327493
subclass	abstract-class
i guess i can do it the other way round where i run the main from the abstract-class and instantiate the subclass in there but then each time i want to change which subclass is instantiated i d obviously need to change the class name after new

23327493
subclass	abstract-class
i suppose what i m looking for is a way to define the main method in the abstract-class in such a way that when i run the subclass it instantiates a copy of the subclass and not the abstract-class

23327538
sum	coalesce
select new list s.id s.name s.servicegroup.id s.servicegroup.name count t.id sum coalesce t.dealerfeeactual 0 + t.sum from grouptransaction gt join gt.transaction t join t.service s where 1 1 and t.date date_1 and t.date date_2 and t.status in status_list and gt.node.id node group by s.id s.name s.servicegroup s.servicegroup.name order by s.servicegroup.id

23327662
drools	optaplanner
i am currently working on a java project that uses optaplanner and drools for a constraint satisfaction problem

23327685
hide	show
instead of grouping the other tabs in a list we can add a class name to the li s then we can hide and show the elements with that class only

23327695
children	parent
add the parent hover and apply css added their children

23327703
int	chars
in addition simply using a chars may avoid silent implicit conversions in the future such as when dealing with drivers which may incorrectly convert a bigint to an int or float php value and thus like this issue result in loss of range or precision

23327706
width	height
is it a purely presentational concern like adjusting the width or height properties of certain elements to appropriate proportions of the window size

23327706
width	height
performance of width height operators - i m assuming that there is box-model logic here given that the global event is the browser resize

23327745

23327833
mamp	wamp
install wamp mamp lamp on your computer

23327838
post	get
since you re already grouping by post you could just use a group_concat to get all the categories comma separated something like the untested

23327885
folder	directory
and this method again would have a switch case like check based on the folder requested and finally invoke the system directory logic

23327886

i can t figure out how to get the indexing to work right with the loops so i haven t put the display function in yet as i can t get the output right

23327923
int	double
where int is type we use as key - account number and double is value which will be connected with key in reality double is not best type to store informations about amount of money you would probably use something like bigdecimal but for now lets leave double

23327923
put	get
to update amount stored in account with number 1 and lets say add 3 dollars just get current amount from account number you are interested in calculate new value and put it in map like

i want to write a method which detects the orientation of uploaded image then use a thumb with certain landscape or portrait dimensions using django-imagekit

23328011
width	height
however changing the width height values above seem to have no effect whatsoever on my app

23328020
width	height
you can do this by checking the width and height attributes of the model s image spec field

23328020
width	height
if width is greater than height it is landscape

23328020
width	height
if the height is bigger than the width it is portrait

23328025
mp4	h.264	google-chrome	firefox
if you convert your mp4 file to h.264 encoding it will work on google-chrome and ie9 and above but apparently due to patent issues firefox does not support it but will play it if the os can play it

23328099
trie	tree
you can use a binary tree or a trie dependeing on what your id is whether it is a string or an int

folder	directory
your static assets should live in the web root and trying to serve them from the application folder will be fraught with problems - if you allow access to the application directory from outside it could cause some serious security issues

23328302
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
with firefox and safari it works but not with google-chrome ie and oopera.

23328302
firefox	safari
what happens in all browsers after a click in a row it will scroll to the id #ma so the functions work in a toggle way but only firefox and safari will load the file

23328320
decoder	encoder
depending on how you implement your encoder decoder methods the object might be exactly the same as the other one content wise

simply one is 2d chars array and the other two are unsigned int arrays

23328398
textview	imageview
i have a custom linearlayout with some textview and imageview and a swipe gesture on that customview with rotation

post	get
you can get a never expiring page access token that you can use while creating the post

23328493
typedef	typename
you re also missing a typename in the typedef

so some tricks like spawning a new thread to press ok button in qmessagebox will be unsuccessful with error like this object can not be accessed from other thread somewhere in qwidget sources

23328923
for-loop	arrays
to initialize the arrays i again assume your code does something like a for-loop where you ask the user for the various arrays elements

23328923
strdup	malloc
the strdup function calles malloc internally allocating just enough memory to store the specified string tmpstr

23328938
for-loop	loops
second use a for-loop to read the lines of the file rather than calling readline on each cycle of a while loops

23328938
for-loop	loops
if you need to react differently to the file ending than to some other termination conditions you can use break for the special termination cases and put an else clause on loops which will only run if the for-loop complets without breaking

23328948
firefox	safari
and firefox and safari just ignore it

23328962
post	get
you re sending data from form via post so you need to get them in your result.php file from post superglobal like so

23328984
superclass	subclassing
indeed one of the answers at this so question says that the subclassing delegate must be compatible with the superclass but it doesn t say how i can do that

23328992
for-loop	arrays
from comment in your code outer arrays size - value key index it looks like you wants to allocate memory for 2 hash_table_size size 2d arrays whereas from your code in for-loop breaking condition i hash_table_size

23329010
spaces	delimiter
i m currently trying to concatenate 3 integers to a spaces delimiter string

23329010
int	chars
test 50 error initializing argument 1 of int snprintf chars

23329012
for-loop	arrays
of course you donâ t need to actually reverse the arrays you can also simply use a for-loop to go through it backwards assuming it is simply numerically indexed starting at 0 and no â œholesâ in the index

23329038
joptionpane	jdialog
displaying the the changing color field jpanel in a modal jdialog or joptionpane

23329046

min	max
the problem i have is about the normalization process where a and b are the min and max of the sample respectively

23329333
daemons	systemd
this is where it gets slightly dicey in that you have to devise a way to do this with a daemons in your preferred operating systemd using any number of languages -- python java applescript shell batch etc

23329348
client-side	server-side
php is executed server-side and then generally returns a generated html page to the user while javascript is executed client-side and can for example change the html code that the user got

post	get
i am trying to accomplish following get appointments of a user through post request as i need to post other calendar ids to get appointments of other users as well

23329401
client-side	server-side
that said you do still need to observe the differences between server-side php and client-side js jquery in order to make things work consistently

23329413
integer	unsigned
for conversion from a signed integer type to an unsigned integer type the result is implementation-defined or it can raise an implementation-defined signal but i don t know of any compiler that does that

23329413
integer	unsigned
or perhaps more simply you can convert it to the widest unsigned integer type and use ju

23329419
spaces	delimiter
so when i load the corresponding property file the first white spaces is used as the key-value delimiter instead of the sign

23329429
hash	md5
consider a function index of an md5 hash of the value or use full text indexing

23329442

rss	feed
i did a quick google search for a plugin since that would be a simple way to implement what you need and i came across this plugin called flipboard rss feed + shortcode

23329594
int	double
there is no operator overloading in java as in c c++ world so the + operator is used let s say only for primitive numbers byte short int long float and double incremental operations

23329647
google-chrome	firefox
this is a somewhat recent change as it used to work fine in google-chrome and still works fine in firefox

23329703
min	max
either min or max of the name would work and you only need to group by the id

23329801
for-loop	loops
i can t use nested loops for-loop because number of loops may change by changing gamma value

23329806
copying	overwrite
ultimately i will be copying files from usr local bin into home build emacs date + y m d- r before they get overwrite by emacs being rebuilt

23329866
int	double
my problem is at the moment javascript internally only stores its number s as 32bit int or 64bit double and i m lost on how to convert or write those to a buffer

23329890
put	get
what i did do was in my model project i had to flip the copy local reference settings for entityframework.sqlserver and the entityframework reference to be safe to false and save all to get the project to put the node into the .csproj file and then set it back to true and save again so that true ends up as the final value

23329902
int	double
works only for int double float

23330017

23330107
put	get
i found it quite easy to find the format of a get request put cannot find the format of a put

23330119
dividebyzeroexception	arithmeticexception
the other guess - if you want a class that represents an exception and comes with jdk not your own consider replacing dividebyzeroexception with arithmeticexception

23330120
prepare	bindparam
i have one parameter in the prepare statement which is taken from the form data and set using the pdo bindparam method

23330128
getter	setter
and finally the class where getter and setter are being used

23330150
int	double
primitives such as int long double etc declared within void or function are allocated in stack and not a subject for garbage collection - they re destroyed together with return address and arguments

23330150
metaspace	permgen
in java 8 permgen was replaced with metaspace so static fields and .class objects are now there

23330153
put	get
in short format is the same it has put instead of get and it is usually used to add or update entities in the server so after the header you would get an empty line r n r n and then a body whose content type would correspond to the header content-type like say text html or application json an example of what a put request would look like

23330229
cpython	pypy
there is no way to make it faster other than rewriting in a language such as c or java or using pypy or cpython

23330321
clang	llvm
and if that s what you want to do looking at .net or llvm clang can be a good option but you can also fairly easily bootstrap yourself with something like this

23330343

23330548
hide	show
the above script automatically hide sidebar on a slightest screen size change function updates and continuosly monitors user s screen size and when i browse the page and toggle to show sidebar the smallest scroll on page triggers jquery function which thinks the screen resolution has changed and revisits the function - effectivle hiding again sidebar that was just toggled activated

23330570
addition	multiplication

23330593
rss	feed
i am using the zrssfeed plugin with jquery to display latest news from an rss feed

23330593
rss	feed
if an rss url fails to return a success i can invoke both showerror and errormessage which is great only if the feed doesn t load for whatever reason

23330593
rss	feed
however i have found a problem where if an rss feed is empty - because the news page has removed all articles from the feed for whatever reason - the showerror errormessage is not used

23330593
rss	feed
this fails the page where the rss feed should appear is left blank with the exception of the list elements the plugin creates note the ul element is empty -

i have written a method to take an integer and convert it to either decimal hex or binary depending on what you choose using commenting

23330692
hex	binary
hex and binary are not much better

23330702
getter	setter
there are getter and setter methods and a function which returns a list of recommended items

i have write a simple program using socket in c that create a connect between x86 running windows and arm running embedded linux consist of only busybox and libc .suddenly this small program could not connect the windows and linux then i running netsta -a found 3 socket s state is close_wait and pid is null.so i try to modify â œ net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_ã â but because busybox has only the basic functions that i could not using etc rc.d init.d network restart makes the modify take effect

23331027
projectile	particle
instead i ve just set it to instantiate the particle system whenever an enemy detects that it has collided with a projectile

23331038
width	margin
since your image is floated that means any inline content will float around it â but the block elements like p and h2 still go over the full width underneath your image â and thatâ s why you donâ t see any effect of that margin because it is â œunderâ the image

23331063
free	malloc
if you allocate with malloc you can only deallocate using free

23331110
ubuntu	debian
under debian ubuntu it would be something like this

23331136
range	max
look at the pretty function and possibly range or max

23331148
stdout	fflush
the easiest way to change that is to set which will make the current output filehandle usually stdout unbuffered so it will fflush after every print

23331151
min	max
given an integer array calculate the max value the min value and the average value

23331213
width	height
calling exchange swaps the image area defined by a rectangle with width 180 and height 130 starting at row index 50 and column index 60 for a rectangle of the same size starting at row index 50 and column index 260

23331223
google-chrome	firefox
like google-chrome or firefox as it is more likely that the user will have these programs pre-installed

23331239
width	text-align
finally remove the width in #reply-text and add text-align center in .forum-post-heading-container

23331280
for-loop	loops
i used for-loop for the looping process i wonder if there are any efficient and faster practice for the program to loops much faster than that

23331280
for-loop	loops
from my research from here while loops and iterator loops will not result any significant performance compare to for-loop

23331308
jtextfield	jlabel
i am using 3 panels title panel display panel and button panel inside of my displaypanel i have a jtextfield 3 jlabel and the next thing i want to have happen is for the rest of my jlabel which happen to be imageicons to be in a set location inside of my panel which is in boxlayout

23331409
portrait	landscape	switching	screens
i took a screens that was working fine and my plan was to grab the current layout move it to a template then use a contentcontrol to display it and a datatemplateselector to switching between the original portrait layout and a new landscape layout

23331478
google-chrome	firefox
support for this is google-chrome sf firefox and ie10

23331485
post	get
on each post back the instance of page books is re-created so you will not get the value of book_categoryname after button click

23331581
uiview	subviews
in the final block of code the uiview instance you are using as the loop iterator and calling subviews is not actually representative of the subviews of view

23331607
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you want the filtering in database side should replace ienumerable with iqueryable

23331609
ienumerable	iqueryable
another thing i don t know how you call and get the context i recommend to use iqueryable rather than ienumerable because iqueryable handle in database and ienumerable handle on your server memory

23331627
portrait	landscape
if you want the labels to be visible in both portrait and landscape it would be best to use the multiplier rather than the constant values of the constraints so the position is relative to the size of the view not a constant distance from some edge

23331627
width	height
i am also making the height and width of the label relative to the size of the view so the labels are shorter but wider in landscape

23331646
post	put
i want exactly what i have in my webpage but to be honest i don t understand the forms of bootstrap i am new with webpages mainly how to say that it is by post and how to put the variable names

23331696
int	chars
the return type of fgetc is int not chars

23331696
int	chars
you get strange behavior when you convert int to chars in some platforms

23331700

try to use a better text editor notepad++ sublimetext textwrangler etc to play with different line endings

23331786
int	chars
the trouble is that fgetc and its relatives return an int not a chars

23331786
int	chars
next chars is present the fgetc function obtains that chars as an unsigned chars converted to an int and advances the associated file position indicator for the

23331786
int	chars
when you read the value into a chars instead of an int one of two undesirable things happens

23331805
min	max
i have a map reduce program for finding the min max for 2 separate properties for each year

23331805

23332308
restrict	shared
i m restrict to file shared or sharepoint

23332312
mongodb	rethinkdb
or if your want is to make sure that the mongodb value comes before the rethinkdb value then you will need to evaluate in javascript with mapreduce or something equally not nice like the operator

23332454
children	parent
2 to be able to delete all children when the parent is deleted

23332454
next	except
next the easiest way to allow children to be deleted except for the last one is to use nested forms as covered in railscasts #196

23332454
children	parent
basically you would have one form with fields for both the parent and the children

23332454
children	parent
any updates to the location as well as the children including the deletion of children would be processed by the update action in the parent controller

23332517

with these you can do long addition and multiplication just like you are used to with base 10 and pen and paper

division	multiplication
but if the divisor is known then you may get away with doing a division by constant using multiplication instead

23342626
division	modulo
as long as the modulo in your rsa setup is known as long as the key pair remains the same you can use this approach to do integer division and can also use that to compute the remainder

23342626
addition	multiplication
how often that is depends on n so for fixed n you can precompute that and for large n i d expect it to be two reduction steps after addition but hree steps after multiplication but please double-check that whereas for variable n you ll have to check at runtime

23342626
multiplication	exponent
that way you ll need only about 1024 multiplication max if your exponent has 512 bits

23342626
multiplication	modulo
every single multiplication in all of this should be immediately followed by a modulo reduction to keep memory requirements low

although your example of a bulleted list is harmless there would be serious implementation difficulties from supporting arbitrary copies of any and all html especially when you factor in the way style properties are supposed to be inherited from the element

public	protected
but if you want to use system.buffer.blockcopy anyway instead skip and take because maybe it is better in performance as steven robbins answered but system.buffer.blockcopy system.array.copy are probably more efficient or your parse function cannot deal with or you are more used to system.buffer.block in your posted question then i would recommend to simply just make tcpbuffer not local variable but private or protected or public or internal and static or not field in other words it should be defined and created outside method where your posted code is executed

unaligned access on some cpu architectures the processors imposes constraints on the addresses you can use when you access multibyte values especially if you cross word boundaries

you ll need to adjust your image size to the desired width and height on your own

23346585
background-image	background-size
instead of using with different sizes in the thumb gallery use a div with a fixe dimensions so they will float perfectly than set the image as a background-image and add background-size cover

23348230

this puts a bunch of nulls on the end of your serializable which can be spotted as a bunch of a s after base 64 ing the array and these are what are screwing up the deserialization with the very confusing the data at the root level is invalid

versioning	upgrade
as there is not a serialversionuid in the class cookie of the api htmlunit that i am using this exception occurs as the class cookie is changed because we upgrade the versioning of htmlunit that we are using so what idea comes to my mind is to avoid the matching of serialversionuid while deserialing so i have tried the below solution

23359042
children	parent
i m not sure if you want to do this with all of the children or just the parent view in your case but usually you just need to do this to a single parent view and it will work properly for the children of that view

23359042
children	parent
related to this i didn t quite understand why you re passing the scaling factor down to each child when scaling the parent view will scale all of its children too

qlist	qmap
this will give you a qlist on which you can iterate through and for the given value you can get the key using qmap key to get the key for the given value

23359215
qobject	qwidget
like object name property comes from qobject and geomentry property comes from qwidget

23359217
queue	fifo
although queue is fifo type mq implementation provides message delivery on a priority basis where messages with high priority are delivered first or fifo basis where message on top of the queue is delivered first

queue	fifo
i m trying to ensure that all methods queue from the worker thread to run in the vcl thread run in strict fifo order and that they all complete before the worker thread is destroyed

23359554
ienumerable	iqueryable
the first important point to remember is iqueryable interface inherits from ienumerable so whatever ienumerable can do iqueryable can also do

23359554
ienumerable	iqueryable
but now see the below code we have changed ienumerable to iqueryable

23359554
ienumerable	iqueryable
so the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable is about where the filter logic is executed

23359554
ienumerable	iqueryable
so if you working with only in-memory data collection ienumerable is a good choice but if you want to query data collection which is connected with database iqueryable is a better choice as it reduces network traffic and uses the power of sql language

23359582
x86	64bit
i need to build some application in two configurations x86 and x64 each config has reference on some dll which is in 32 and 64bit versions

to solve this i can mark the dist directory as excluded but then the folder isn t visible at all in the ide not even for the version control system so i can t easily commit changes to github

23359871
post	put
a workaround if that s acceptable would be to first create using a post with no parameters a folder with an autogenerated name and then put your file in that folder

23359871
post	put
if the extra path component is not ok i m afraid you ll have to create your own custom post or put servlet for that...and maybe contribute that feature to apache sling

23359878
int	double
the code that saves and updates length fields is generic and always provide int not floats or double

23359878
int	double
values of length fields have been always 32-bit int until yesterday when i failed to convert one of them to int32 because it s actually double

23359878
int	double	mongodb	bson
according to mongodb bson types internal types are double and int it s only in mongodb shell they look like number s

23359902
portrait	landscape
so probably if you do that in landscape your new view controller will appear as portrait and then turns to landscape

23359934
jobs	cron
then fire cron jobs to check if id is missing

23359973
g++	gcc
i have g++ gcc 4.7.3

23359979
folder	directory
choose the font arial if not there add it to the jasper fonts folder in the installation directory

23359984

23360227
post	get
measurement protocol allows to send direct http requests but both get and post versions of registers only single event per request

23360248
folder	directory
due to a lack of knowledge about variables available to determine certain directory such as the location of the devel folder there is still much stuff inside that is hardcoded and the whole workaround seems like overkill and is ugly so if you know a better strategy please tell me

23360253
google-chrome	firefox
for the given code both firefox and google-chrome 34.0.1847.131 win 7 increase the height of the li element when it is activated

23360330

before i click the download button certain fields have to filled and some checkbox need to be checked

23360449
min	max
like min max size etc

23360478
google-chrome	firefox
this is probably a bad explanation of the issue but it seemed that when the browser - google-chrome or firefox - detected an http url being referenced from a secure url it abandoned the session so the next time i hit refresh or clicked another link i d be taken to the login page as my cookie would no longer be valid

23360585
folder	directory
it does create the directory but it doesn t execute the if part by saying folder exists already

23360637
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome and mozilla firefox this works well but ie only detect onclick event when i m using element inspector

23360709
exif	jfif
actually most files referred to as a jpeg file are either jfif or exif

23360709
exif	jfif
exif uses the structure of jfif so you can parse them just the same

23360709
exif	jfif
but because jfif specifies that the first app segment must be app0 jfjf and exif says that for exif the first app segment must be app1 exif they are not really compatible

23360709
exif	jfif
some jpeg s contains neither exif or jfif app segment but still contain valid jpeg code streams

23360709
exif	jfif
most jpeg reading software needs to be aware of at least app0 jfif app1 exif app2 icc_profile app14 adobe to properly interpret and convert color from the compressed data

23360722
put	get	post	get	post	put

23360781
traceroute	packets

now i would like to dump the hive table from hive to hdfs

23360961
hive	hdfs
i tried to copy the file from hive to hdfs

23360968
oncreate	getwritabledatabase
yes you just need to instantiate it and pass the context as argument and your oncreate or onupgrade method whichever is necessary will be called explicitly wherever you call getwritabledatabase

23360997
serializable	deserialization
for serializable and deserialization i use java beans xmlencoder and xmldecoder

google-chrome	firefox
a small tweak to the previous answers seemed to work in both firefox and google-chrome on linux

23361083
spaces	delimiter

23361096
csv	tsv
the output would be tsv csv with the following column names startposition endposition value end-start

23361097

23361201
folder	directory
being in sample folder create as many directory as environment you have

23361205
textchanged	keyup	keydown	keyup
note - 1 always use textchanged event..with using text_changed event or similar event which implemented with your component you can block unwanted results..as an example if someone try to copy-paste an unwanted string then your keyup or keydown events won t work because of their listening characteristics..but text_changed always work when the text is changed

23361228
perforce	svn
with the file size and the operations which would be a better option like perforce vs git vs svn

23361337
direct3d	directx
the directx version number such as 9.0c refers only to the version of the core components such as direct3d directinput or directsound

23361354
pull	push
also notice that the recent versions of git make it significantly easy to recursively push and update submodules so there should be little concern for the complexity of creating pull requests for the frameworks

23361383
post	get
to get a list of post and their comment counts - you need first to understand the sort of query required -

23361383
aggregate-functions	sum
the group query in the question isn t the right structure unless there s an aggregate-functions used count sum etc.

23361383
post	get
to get all comments grouped by post id - you can however use find list

23361385
width	margin
instead float column 2 to the right and depending on how you define the widths of the columns either float column 1 left or give it a right margin the same as the width of column 2

23361410
post	get
i first do a get request to get an example dto and then post it back to the service

23361410
post	get
but when i specify content-type application xml i get an example testdto fine but nothing i ve tried allows the post to work

23361510
verilog	hdl
the verilog hdl uses the bit length of the operands to determine how manybits to use while evaluating an expression

23361543
getter	setter
in general you should not access object s attributes directly it should be done through setter and getter methods

23361543
getter	setter
so you should define the class you want with the attributes needed and their setter and getter methods

23361578
width	height
this logic worked for the big rectangles when width height

23361597
pyramid	cherrypy
i have a python web-app that uses pyramid cherrypy for the webserver

23361685
strsplit	do.call
you could leave it as do.call rbind strsplit d if you re happy to leave the object as character data

23361722
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
while the solution i used works great on google-chrome and firefox i just discovered doing some test that safari does not render border radius on a clipping container allowing the underneath google map content to overlap the rounded corners

23361722
google-chrome	safari
you can check it out your self opening this fiddle in safari and google-chrome and you will immediately spot the difference mind the corners

23361744

i have many paragraphs and links which should show hide every paragraph independently

23369103

if you need to install it for all users then you should probably place the link to the executable the start script in bin and place the unpacked folder with the program files in a local directory like etc or opt

23369126

for the shells i m familiar with bash tcsh it will match all files beginning with a dot

superclass	subclassing
instead of a generic type object is used in the superclass and specialized in the subclassing the generated ddl does not contain any hint of a value column

23369312
superclass	subclassing
leave out value in the superclass completly and add it in each subclassing works if the value attributes have different column name specifications otherwise only on value with a random type exists

23369315

might also be similar to this question font-face problem firefox adds padding google-chrome does not

23369367

using the same css for the screen and adding the print-hidden class to specific div s our pages look fine using safari on a mac but using google-chrome on the mac or firexof and google-chrome on the pc the print preview shows the mobile version

23369382
ng-show	ng-hide
it always shows the tag ng-show never the ng-hide

23369428
int	chars
now the chars is upcasted to an int and the sign is extended

23369440
firefox	safari
also tried firefox which works seamlessly like safari apart from the rotating animation which isn t happening but i kept firefox out of consideration as it s a different browser

23369440
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome on mobile devices both ios and android are working and behaving like safari on desktop

23369452
children	parent
as children to your parent gameobject using

23369452
children	parent
this prevents the tedious nature of having to drag-and-drop onto the script itself and also allows you to access children that may be added to the parent dynamically and thus unable to drag-and-drop

23369455
int	double
i have a programm that creates 2d arrays of int and double some are int some are double

23369455
int	double
but instead of having two methods for int and double each i wondered if its possible to accept both int and double as a parameter

23369479
ready	each
2 create something like pixel 25 which won t be as easy to code ready because i ll need to do some simple math each and everything i want to access a element

i know that changing my method to a post and using the body content works but lets say that i m stubborn and wish to accomplish this using get

23369546

try right clicking on the column selecting column visibility and then entering your expression in the box under the show or hide based on expression radio button

23369565

23369581
super	self
self super initwithframe frame

23369587
int	double
the only difference will be the parameters- one will take an int and the other will take a double

23369616
post	get
that should get this working for you but if not post back and i ll try to help further

23369623
int	double
it is extended by both int and double

23369623
int	double
this type can be created from either double or int primitive types via autoboxing which will do this conversion for you automatically

23369656
google-chrome	firefox
in ie10 firefox google-chrome it works like a charm but in ie8 at this line

23369678
getter	setter
solution 2 use getter and setter methods provide they are accesible and they are in class or superclasses

23369684
oncreate	recreate
the oncreate method can be called when the activity is restarted recreate and in this case the fragments that use to exist will still exist and then the reference will be not null

23369707
int	double
you can keep the method taking as parameter the double and make a cast when calling the method with an int

23369743
post	get
i gave up trying to get this working and instead posted to a local php script which then used curl to post to the remote server

23369771

23369792

datediff	difference
use the datediff function in vb6 to calculate the difference between dates

23369965
web-applications	web-inf
for web-applications placing slf4j and logback jar files under the web-inf lib directory of the web-application is sufficient to endow each web-application with a separate logging environment

23369977
int	chars
not chars but unsigned int and only unsigned int or alternatively an int with non-negative value

23369977
int	chars
a variadic argument of type chars is automatically promoted to type int which turns 0xc1 into 0xffffffc1 as a signed representation of -63 in type int

23369977
integer	unsigned
i m pretty sure the output will still be ffffffc1 but in this case 0xffffffc1 is the prefectly expected result of integer conversion from negative -63 value to unsigned int type

23370015
versioning	upgrade
so i suggest you to upgrade your symfony2 or use the last versioning of fosuserbundle and use the last versioning of the documentation

23370043
division	multiplication
this two terms are based on an abstract byte representation where the lowest bit is located at the right and bits get higher in value when going left but by definition left shift has the same effect as multiplication by 2 and right shift has the same effect as division by 2 for unsigned integers

23370052
vb.net	vb6
i am using a vb6 textbox and recordset and need to know how i would implement the same thing in vb.net

23370062
width	margin
the issue is that scss in the codepen is calculating the margin and width to a certain decimal level

23370065
for-loop	arrays
a for-loop to put each item in the arrays list into its own jlabel would look something like

23370084
post	put
after post back the items don t become selectable so you can put this code line in

23370090
folder	directory
when i installed nodexl 2014 i realised that it did not create the required folder in my program files directory but instead installed itself in the following location

23370105
width	height
the pixel processing routines must explicitly deal with the width and height of the image

23370109
httpresponse	request
the problem on it is that after executed the row httpresponse response client.execute request

23370116
folder	directory
install bourbon into the current directory by generating the bourbon folder

23370148
oncreate	findviewbyid
must be inside oncreate method becuase the method findviewbyid called after app is created

23370149
opera	google-chrome
i just use -webkit- prefix so please test the demo on google-chrome or opera

23370149
width	height
this solution requires trial and error so to find out the values for width and height of the after element you may have to reduce increase and try it

23370171
highcharts	highstock
i m having a problem using columns in highcharts highstock

23370224
subtract	add
2 add subtract desired length unit vector to the start ending point

23370229
put	get
i m using a hashmap with a key to put in the array and then get an array list from it afterwards with the key mode

23370274
sudo	passwd
i feel the problem is sudo not asking me for a passwd as gksu does

23370274
sudo	passwd
- prompt the user to enter their passwd and pass it to sudo through stdin using the -s flag

23370274
passwd	visudo
you can then use visudo to give that system user the ability to run only the commands you need without requiring a passwd

23370280
min	max
it would be nice if this code could allow me to 1 input the number of components 2 input the min and max unit length per combo 3 input the min and max number of combos per combo.combo and 4 randomize the output list of combo.combos

23370281
width	height
if you were to make assumptions that touch devices generally utilize on screen input rather than external keyboards you can programmatically adjust the size on your own by taking the device height or width depending on orientation and factor in a multiplier for portion of the screen consumed by the on screen keyboard

23370298
hide	show
i need to create the desktop app that the jpane can hide and show

23370298
hide	show
it just like hide and show the div in html

23370299
width	height
grab the viewport width height

23370308
rubygems	rvm
as of ruby 1.9.3 you no longer need can require rubygems and you only need to require rvm

23370308
rubygems	rvm
if you want to use it in your .irbrc file for using wirble or awsome print you can use a simple trick to avoid a login error saying it can t include or rubygems or rvm

23370308
rubygems	rvm
including both rubygems and rvm does not seem logical because rvm replaces rubygems in some sort to handle the gems and gem repositories

23370312
google-chrome	firefox
with firefox and google-chrome it works perfectly

23370318
submit	submission
i am trying to submit a form but the form handler is not preventing form submission

23370328
hide	show
rather than use jquery to hide show the rows it would be better to use an observablearray to store your values in and a computed function to filter that array every time the filter value changes

23370347
hide	show
then when they click the button hide slide 1 and show slide 2

23370356
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
you can still use the free dotnetzip or sharpziplib of course

23370399
prepare	execute
although i suspect it is known to be an integer variable and therefore it won t break the sql it s a good idea to get into the habit of using prepare execute to prevent sql injection

23370406
width	height
vmin means whichever is smaller between the 1 of the viewport s height and the 1 of the viewport s width

23370416
int	chars
to try to convert a 0 -terminated chars -array a c string to an int consider using strtol

23370451
post	get
if you were to use the php get method instead of post you could retrive the value from the submitted input directly from the url using the window.location method

23370452
snmp	mib
in the original server there is a bunch of mib files in the default location at usr share snmp mibs and the 3com ones at usr share snmp mibs 3com_4500 mibs

23370452
snmp	mib
set does not show any env variable related to snmp or mib

23370462
ienumerable	ienumerator
walk is a trivial to implement extension method that simply walks through all ienumerator elements we need it because gettextelementenumerator returns ienumerator instead of ienumerable

23370465
minimum	max
you mention a max of 1000 hash keys but the concern is what the minimum is

23370472
hide	show
i am trying to create a show hide effect using toggle and animate

23370472
hide	show
once the animation has taken place when i click on hide info x i would expect the text to change back to show info +

it continually show hide info x

23370485
hide	show
my problem is how to show and hide the div2 when user clicks on the link togglediv2 within div1

23370485
hide	show
i have used the services for sharing data between controller and done show hide within same controller

i have a button in toolbar which should show hide the triggers

23370660
ssl	https
1 browser and web server communication is protected over an ssl connection https

23370700
width	height
you can still achieve the desired behavior with a fixed background by setting background-size auto 50 instead so its height scales to 50 that of the page mirroring the height you have given to the element and its width adjusts to scale

23370711
post	get
however no matter what i post to the token endpoint i always get the same response

23370755

23370809
hide	show
i m using this code to toggle the menu show hide

23370813
superclass	subclassing
using __file__ or __pretty_function__ because they capture will capture the superclass rather than the subclassing

puts	gets
no what i want is to display a table on my website that gets server info from table servers and puts the total amount player in front of it from table livestats

23371503
margin	height
to correct this you can make a negative margin on your master-container but then that has it s own issues too - and so you add this buffer div that matches the footer height - and the negative margin of the master-container this allows the page to fill to the footer but if the page is longer gently push the footer down

23371505

datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
the best way to do this i have found would be to use a datagridtemplatecolumn instead of a datagridcomboboxcolumn

23372331
width	height
you could also ensure that width and height of you control is empty if it s possible because span and anchor are inline control that has no height or width that why a webcontrol display is changed to inline-block so the height or width apply to the usercontrol

23372331
width	height
if your control need a height and width you could use as constructor and declare the tag has a div

23372352

mediarecorder	audiorecord
if you don t like the audiorecord this chart may be able to help you debug where you mediarecorder is getting put in an invalid state

23372732

the category derives all its other properties from its self-associated generic inherited of the recursiveentity class

23373059

23374034
hash	salt
current password hash functions will not just add the salt before hashing instead they do a lot of iterations and use the salt in each iteration

23374034
hash	salt
so in your case you would store the hash of the password in the database for authentication but use a different salt to generate the key for encryption

23374046
getter	setter
if i do a iteration it is of type object and will not display the getter and setter

inject	interceptor
fortunately the remedy is simple you need to inject into your interceptor and retrieve from the injector like so

23374253
getter	setter
and then you can access the setter getter of fakeclass using

23374258
inherited	properties
the formcode class cannot be inherited from and it inherited from xmlformxostitem class which has the maindatasource namespacemanager etc properties without a setter so i can t easily implement my own and have the formcode instance use them in my tests

memcpy	memset
to test this i wrote a simple program that runs memset or memcpy on a big array and reports the timing

23374286

children	parent
you have to set the font for the parent of the widgets before you create the children widgets

23375221
children	parent
once you have the parent s font set its children will inherit the font too

23375244
comparator	comparable
alternatively if you want to use treeset you could have your class implement comparable overriding comparator or provide a comparator for the treeset both of which would compare primarily on the one id and secondarily on the other

i have the following variables and i am trying to turn myint into a double however i am getting a cannot convert from double to int error

23375333
int	double
i noticed that i can turn a double to an int without incident but am unsure as to why this fails

23375358
int	double
java does widening conversions without help int to double but for a narrowing conversion you need an explicit cast

23375366
int	double
the assignment contains a primitive widening conversion which takes the int literal 4 and widens it to a double specifically 4.0

23375382
opera	google-chrome
edit i now set the fusiontable to visible to anybody with link and tested with google-chrome and opera

23375390

the assignment is to add subtract multiplying and divide huge numbers

23375753
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
the first task is to figure out the add and subtract because the teacher then wants us to call the add and subtract procedures for multiplying and divide

23375767
getter	setter
it is important to note that if you want to reverse the process save the modified database information a similar process is followed just using database setter methods instead of getter methods

23375806
width	height
i have a bunch of spans they are set to display in-line block with a width and height of 60px i want javascript to pick a random span from all of them and apply a color to it

the browser will basically send a http request either a post or a get i don t know which one it is since i don t know the page

23375839

versioning	upgrade
so your best bet is to upgrade your checkstyle versioning

23375953
versioning	upgrade
if you are using eclipse you can upgrade to the latest versioning of the eclipse-cs plugin which will also include the newest checkstyle

23375964

i m trying to write a script so that font-size can be set according to container s width height and the length of the text

23375966
width	height	width	font-size
current code is working but font-size to container s height width and text s lengths ratio needs to be fixed

23375989
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql db

23376011
persistent	transient
a more sensate approach would be make the calculated field transient and provide only the getters that will calculate the values based in the persistent fields

23376013
udp	tcp
this is not a question of tcp vs udp

23376071
picasso	ion
i like picasso and ion for this but there are others

23376129
multiplying	add
you can also try changing the node s blend mode to add or multiplying to get a more realistic flashing effect

23376147
for-loop	arrays
finally the for-loop puts 10 random tweets and associated random names in the store arrays

23376159

ubuntu	debian
the error is showing on a debian with php 5.4.27 squeeze the webserver comes from an ubuntu with php 5.4.16 oneiric

23376217
google-chrome	firefox
text plain was verified using the debugging tools in google-chrome but it s definitely not browser-specific as the styles are not loading in firefox either

23376259
integer	fractions
taking math.floor of that removes the fractions part so you are left with an integer n in the range 0 n arr.length-1

23376262
lwjgl	slick2d
a while back i had a problem occur in eclipse where somehow the main class of my game written in lwjgl and slick2d was wiped and replaced with just tab delimiters

the font appears to be 1 font size larger in google-chrome as compared with ie8 ie11 and firefox

23376524
inherited	properties
the css transition properties does not inherited

23376558
int	double
use arrays.copyof double int

23376574
int	double
the answer is to use sqlfunctions.stringconvert use decimal or double but int won t work see example

23376593
ssms	ssdt
in fact you ll have different install locations depending on if you just use ssdt or if you install it as part of ssms or the standalone installer

23376609
int	double
alongside a.clone and arrays.copyof double int you may also choose to use system.arraycopy object src int srcpos object dest int destpos int length

23376645
octree	quadtree
this is more in reference to quadtree which i am more familiar with but they are the 2d equivalent of an octree

23376653
width	height
right now the width and height are 562 and 344 which is also the width and height of the containing element

23376654
post	put
now what i don t know and the real question behind this long-arse post is what to put inside the if in my script so that it pulls the value from the webpage i ve set up be it a 1 or a 0 so that the script responds to the states of the switches

23376671
wildfly	jboss
using jsf 2 and richfaces 4.3.4 deployed on jboss wildfly 8

23376673
google-chrome	firefox
that said i looked at your sample site in both google-chrome and firefox and it looks exactly the same to me

23376686
switching	screens
i tried implementing an intent that was a separate class to front camera but when switching back to the back camera the screens will stay black

23376694
width	margin
i then set it at a width of 980px same as width of content container and set it to margin 0 auto

23376769
for-loop	loops
however if you re going to add code to do something for each empty value then you ll want to loops through everything and if so you d take the test on allgood out of the for-loop above

23376806
int	boolean
right now i have radiant_wins as an int taking values 0 and 1 but i want to use this sort of boolean structure so that i can access the two possible values

23376826
hash	salt
the first part after that should be the salt seperated by an then there is supposed to be the pwd hash

23376832
int	chars
use a negative int for the substring -3 to get the last three chars

23376865
many-to-many	one-to-many
for instance suppose my model a has fields which refer to other models through either a vanilla one-to-many or a more complex many-to-many relation

23376865
post	put
what i would like to do for post put and other write methods is be able to pass the foreign key ids for the b and c fields something like this

23376865
serializable	deserialization
every reference i find to foreignkey-based deserialization involves using primarykeyrelatedfield as the serializable field type for both b and c

23376879
folder	directory
i create the path variables eclipse- preferences- general- workspace- linkedresources new and give it the path to my cocos2dx3.0 folder directory which is on my desktop

23376915
scikit-learn	libsvm
no scikit-learn has only the standard svms via cython bindings to libsvm

23376930
viewdidload	viewwillappear
place some nslog statements in viewdidload viewwillappear etc

23376992
portrait	landscape
the problem is that when i switch to portrait mode everything extend down to fill the available space like it should but when i rotate back the controls don t go back to the position they started from they remain in positions that are out of view in landscape mode

23376992
portrait	landscape
when i replace the scrollviewer with a grid the effect disappears and the controls resize correctly when i switch between portrait and landscape

23377015
express	node.js
i m building some web-services with node.js express 3 mongoose mongodb

23377029
width	height
x stays the same y height width decrease

23377105
int	double
you have defined the constructor as string double int so you have to supply all three

23377117
versioning	upgrade
i m not sure if it s important enough for you to upgrade over but versioning 9.4 added fields for upc

23377140
int	double
so instead of calling constructor you need to pass three arguments to it which are string double and int

23377140
int	double
there you go you just posted your employee class code which clearly shows you have created a constructor that takes three arguments string name double salary int department and it looks as if you completely forgot what you want to do with the third arguments department as i do not see it being used anywhere else in the code

23377164
width	margin
you can change width margin in this code

23377194
tabcontrol	tabitem
i made a tabcontrol but the fontsize that mehapps uses for header in each tabitem is very big for my application

23377222
children	parent
that s generally fine but in addition to this sort i want to apply the constraint that parent always sort before their children

23377229
folder	directory
i need to search for an excel file with in the sub folder of this directory and then open it

23377271
ubuntu	linux
i do go build with mac os but i need to run this binary from vagrant that uses ubuntu linux

23377288
post	get
and the post stats route which saves the game and the stats and redirects back to the get request above

23377288
post	get
it will totally hit the part of the code and will even print hello world if i set up the post route like so but will not redirect to the get game id route

23377308
folder	directory
on whatever directory that has a .svn folder

23377312
hide	show
i want to show hide some elements when user clicks certain buttons

23377312
hide	show
click once on button 1 will show the image1 and click again will hide the image1

23377318
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you can make use of viewwillappear and put your checks and use viewdidload appropriately there after

23377322
inherited	properties
each is based on your core base model and then you extend with extra properties you need defining one inherited per role

23377327
post	get
currently the routes are only set up to accept get and post requests and it performs successful requests for me in the browser and in my terminal

23377364
hash	salt
passwords should be hash and salt in storage

23377364
hash	salt
one thing you might do is use either a uuid or a timestamp as the range key and the salt of the password and store the hash and salt password as a regular element of the table

23377372
shim	polyfills
also the other big problem is that there is no shim polyfills for plain tcp sockets in the browser for now

23377441
popover	tooltip
this will apply to both tooltip and popover

23377441
hide	show
and now you can call hide and show from javascript this is a show in 3 seconds

23377444
outputstream	inputstream
my issue is that after correctly receiving these from the first client i can t open any more scanners and printwriters on the same socket s inputstream outputstream

23377499
width	height
you must initialize width and height before utilizing them as the array dimensions

23377547
jfr	jmc
also there is an eclipse plugin that supports jfr and jmc and capable of displaying information user-friendly

23377548
folder	directory
in example you have to scan in windows folder you pass c windows and it will check into all nested not nested directory and return an array of string which include the fullpath that s all

23377571
int	double
fortunately 64-bit double have enough precision to represent any 32-bit int exactly so on the javascript side you typically don t need to worry about it

23377574
keydown	keyup
change keydown to keyup

23377605
button	checkbox
note that i changed the vertical alignment of the checkbox and radio + add some right margin and an extra small button

23377633
pop-up	dialog
the goal is to have a map that pulls in json data for the points and then when the points are clicked a jquery dialog pop-up with the correct json data for each point

23377653
mouseleave	mouseenter
if it area is the same on each form you could create a custom baseform or similar which derives from form and put a label on there and use its mouseenter and mouseleave events to hide the cursor

23377654
width	height
i m trying to build a simple layout with fluid values percentages for height and width

23377654
width	height
i got a container and a wrapper but for whatever reason i can t seem to change the width and height values of the wrapper

23377688
width	height
percentage height s and width s are relative to their immediate parent element s dimensions

23377688
children	parent
in your scenario the parent element is only consuming the dimensions of its children s contents thus your perceived issue

23377746
google-chrome	safari
if the classes are the same as you indicate in your edit inspect the elements with a browser tool like firebug or google-chrome or safari s developer tools

23377767
avro	thrift
i have found avro and thrift modules for node.js and thrift has node.js support now seeming to indicate this should be straight forward but that is not working there may not be enough information about which transport protocol to use with flume-ng or maybe i just don t understand it well enough

23377827
inherited	properties
if you would still like to have the annotation on the class for a reason that i can t imagine right now you could then declare a protected client attribute this way you would be declaring the client navigation properties but it wouldn t be accessible for anyone but inherited classes

23377847
capitalize	uppercase
i have a navigation with all of the items capitalize via text-transform uppercase

23377861
children	parent
the idea is that the sub-menu slides down when its parent is hovered over and slides up when the mouse leaves including all of its children

23377868
udp	tcp
this file identifies the socket in much the same way a host and port identify a tcp or udp socket

23377870
builtin	isinstance
these will persuade the the builtin isinstance and issubclass functions to treat the instances returned from b and c as instances of their factory class

23377949
adc	uart
for example you are writing an atomic 8 bit variable register in your isr uart adc twi etc

23377966
screens	tablet	portrait	landscape
i am writing an application that will run on android and ios tablet supporting multiple screens sizes on both platforms and both landscape and portrait orientations

23377966
portrait	landscape
i ve included a small demo app below that mirrors these symptoms text color green on portrait and red on landscape no images for simplicity

23378010
versioning	upgrade
however if you have the performance upgrade versioning of fogbugz on demand you will not have access to plugins

23378029
int	boolean
for the simple case defined there they work ok but what i m trying to do is use them to make a generic json parser in play framework that would only accept certain values string boolean int undefined and then pass them successfully

23378047
int	chars
to the number forces an int to be treated as a floating point number and has no effect on real floating point numbers since strtod just stops when it encounters a chars which can t be decoded as part of a number

23378079
i2c	spi
you can use highspeed 400k i2c or spi between the avrs so you can go up to some megabits if you need the bandwidth

23378096
width	height
if you have any other properties of the image that must also be changed height or width or alignment for example then you can add those to each branch of the if else but doing it this way you have to fully initialize the image object because it may have been set a different way based on the previous image

23378109
base	fractions
but one must pay attention to stored packed unpacked values because they must be fractions of encoding base 255 here

23378112
post	get
to get a post s id

23378115
width	height
then just change the src and width height etc

23378119
super	extends
i avoided calling super so that i could reference the jframe -- guiphotoalbum extends jframe

23378150
nsstring	nsdata
the gist is you should create an nsstring or nsdata object that contains every offset then run the entire thing through sha256

23378211
getter	setter
i have to construct container and entity classes but where i m struggling is trying to nail down the proper syntax for my getter and setter functions in the container class

23378211
getter	setter
i m trying to figure out the proper way to translate the setter and getter functions from my entity classes to the container class so i can change individual elements of each class object in the dynamically allocated array

23378211
getter	setter
i hope this question makes sense and i m not looking for anyone to write all of the setter and getter for me i just need someone to point me in the proper direction for the syntax

23378231
screens	tablet
if i was developing this game to display on a phone or tablet i d make rows and columns variables instead of constants so they can be set dynamically at the start of a game to match the screens size and orientation

23378231
switching	screens
i d also allow the screens orientation to be changed at any time mid-game - all you need to do is switching the values of rows and columns while leaving everything else the current square number that each player is on and the start end squares of all the snakes and ladders unchanged

23378246
ant	maven
cocoapods is like using maven or ant for xcode

23378262
for-loop	loops
was meant to break out of the while loops but all it will do is break out of the for-loop

23378270
for-loop	loops
instead use your for-loop loops through whatever collection holds the strings i m guessing it s the namelist and compare the string held at each item with the entered string

23378270
awt	swing
you re better off using the swing library components not awt

23378273
subtract	add
this gives you the mean angle from which you can compute the variance normally but remember to add or subtract 360 degrees until the difference is in the range -180 degrees 180 degrees before squaring

23378322
hide	show
secondly the two elements to be hidden and show each have the id of delayedtext which means that the two different functions one to hide and one to display are acting on the same objects at the same time and canceling each other out

23378371
width	height
the rotation width and height can be acquired from the presentationlayer of the glkview

23378374
hide	show
to make it future-proof and completely customizable color font size etc. i would just add a uilabel on top and hide show it manually according to the uitextfield contents

23378431
google-chrome	firefox
my code is working decently though slow in google-chrome but failing in firefox

23378436
ssl	https
i have a qt symbian dropbox app which was working normally but recently many users have been reporting an ssl handshake failure when performing any action which requires an api call all api calls to dropbox servers are supposed to be done using https

23378447
single-quotes	double-quotes
it s pulling the json itself out of the javascript statement replacing the single-quotes with double-quotes because the json module won t accept single-quotes and then feeding it the json module

23378461
width	height
i added a second map under the first using the same setup but with a printable dimension like 700px width by 500px height

23378492
many-to-many	one-to-many
i am new to windows app and i am going to build the sqlite-net extension project to .dll file in order to make the models have the relationship attribute of one-to-many one-to-one many-to-many

23378504
textarea	textbox
im sorry but a textarea is not the right way to go as you want the area you placed a textarea to be selectable only not writeable and editable otherwise it voids the purpose of having to add items with a single line textbox

23378581

another approach have another instance of mysql running in a tempfs that uses a ram disk

23393911
post	get
open file wp-admin admin-ajax.php there you should add name of your action in i guess you are using get not post for this type of request core_actions_get array and then create function with the same name you just entered in wp-admin includes admin.php which will return current user meta for you

23393950
int	double
double takes precedent as it is the most specific you can imagine how chopping a double into an int would lose information as opposed to converting int to double there is no lose of information

23393950
int	double
then float as float has less precision than double but more than long or int

23393991
folder	directory
what i would like to do is only make a folder for that user if the directory in which those files are contained exists

my first idea is to use apache thrift for serializable and deserialization as i already worked with it and it is fast as far as i know maybe i write some small python programm to take care of this

23394217
serializable	deserialization
would thrift work well in this scenario or is there some faster way for serializable deserialization

23394220

23394341
put	get
so whatever is on the right of the get put into the left side

23394432

width	height
i need to set a div width the height is fixed according to the width of the image i will going to use as a background

23394539
ienumerable	ilist
note that you can combine any type of ienumerable with this technique array ilist and so on so you don t need to worry about an add method

23394562
versioning	upgrade
this should automatically remove any previous versioning of the application and install the latest versioning and it should be presented to the user as an upgrade

23394562
versioning	upgrade
i don t want to change the upgrade code of the product because i would then have to create new upgrade paths one for each previous versioning which is messy

23394562
versioning	upgrade
i ve tried this before incrementing the versioning number but not changing either the product code or the upgrade code but each time i do when i run the installer to upgrade the product it says resuming the wizard for productname and sometimes some of the files are not replaced with their newer counterparts from the newer installer

23394720
operands	decrement
the pre-increment and pre-decrement operators increment or decrement their operands by 1 and the value of the expression is the resulting incremented or decrement value

23394720
operands	decrement
in contrast the post-increment and post-decrement operators increase or decrease the value of their operands by 1 but the value of the expression is the operands s original value prior to the increment or decrement operation

23394721
int	chars	int	double
note 2 arguments to variadic functions such as printf will suffer arithmetic promotions so float values will be passed as double short and chars as int and so on

23394726
post	get
i originally followed this post to get to where i am but not been able to find anything to help me get round this roadblock

23394741

they are both working great except for one thing if my browser prompts me to remember my password when i log in the next time i try to login my last name and password in the register form is filled with the username password from the login form such as the image below

23394890
google-chrome	firefox
this is a problem that is happening on google-chrome and firefox at least those are the ones that i ve tried

23394900
addition	modulo	subtraction	modulo	subtraction	addition
this just doesn t appear to be possible - what you would need to do would be to use modulo to change the order in which the colors get applied depend on which row you re on but you can only do addition or subtraction - explained here - nth-child with mod or modulo

23394965
inherited	properties
however that s not the whole story those returned objects are extended types that inherited every properties and method from excel range - but .columns and .rows have a special for.

23395065
post	get
i get a list index out of range error and i suspect it has something to do with how i m trying to save the answerformset post data

23395077

your code is going to just put the json into your html and that isn t going to get displayed properly

23395096
express	node.js
contra need node.js express on the server

23395096
express	node.js
i think you can ignore the starup time for node.js and requiring express

apache	nginx
but you can measure the time for each request express and jade will need and compare it with a static file serving service like apache nginx

23395108

as technet mentioned in comments your app must be installed with a bundle-identifier for which apns has been activated on itunesconnect . as far as apns is concerned there is no difference between your iphone ipod or ipad any of the variations. the error message no valid aps-environment entitlements string found for application specifically refers to the provisioning profile used on the device and the bundle-identifier not being authorized for apns

23395142

if you want to hide and show quickly subclass the view that includes the accessory view and implement internally the setting and removing of accessory view

23395152

you re far better adding a function to allow users to login with existing md5 passwords encouraging them to upgrade to the new hash and not allowing any new users to set md5 passwords

23395152
hash	salt
when comparing plaintext values to hash you have to pass the original hash as the salt value in order to retain cost parameters etc

23395211
post	get
i have used the following to get my blog post from blogger

23395245
range	min
based on your if test it s clear you believe the random number is being modulo-ed by the sum of int range and int min

23395245
addition	modulo
the modulo has a higher operator precedence than the addition operator therefore it will happen before the addition

23395245
range	min
so you re really taking the modulus of the rand with int range and then adding int min

23395266
getter	setter
user class contains id as attribute with setter and getter and you can replace anything with id which should have attributes and setter and getter in userclass

23395284

23395386
width	height
i have 9 buttons inside a view with width and height 75

23395389
range	min
your problem is that you are checking for the case where int range + int min is zero but for the modulus you are using just int range

23395492
excel	listobject
if i delete only the values of the destination listobject and keep the rows empty the first column is copied immediatly so i think the problem is related on how excel calculate the first rows to be added to the listobject

23395522
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome won t let you use localstorage -- i don t remember if firefox does

23395548

otherwise i guess you should dive into jni compiling harfbuzz freetype and may cairo for rendering glyph outlines if there is not any other way for it

23395644
setcontentview	findviewbyid
your activity is calling findviewbyid before setcontentview was called

23395650
post	get
the iframe probably uses that for any messages it post back to the originating page and so if the query parameter was hacked those messages never get received by the originating page and nothing works

23395687
put	get
by convention links use the get method but you re modifying something so put is the action you want

23395696

23395742
oncreate	findviewbyid
the reason is that you re calling findviewbyid before oncreate when initializing member variables

23395742
setcontentview	findviewbyid
if you had the window and was callind findviewbyid before setcontentview a null would be returned instead of an npe being thrown

23395742
oncreate	setcontentview
the solution is still the same move the initialization to oncreate after setcontentview

23395764
free	malloc
malloc is used to allocate memory and free to free it

23395782
prng	random
you need to understand how prng work and the hint is in the p for pseudo the rest is random number generator

23395782
prng	random
a prng does not create a random sequence of number because it is not random for the same input seed the same sequence is always produced and this sequence cycles at a given period

23395808
serializable	deserialization
if you serializable it and then deserialize it back the process of deserialization may remove mutability

23406259
width	height
if you take that out the menu will display....but of course it will affect all the other items you have in your other slides...especially images so i would suggest that you make sure that the height width etc...of all these are equal and see if that will work ok at different media sizes etc..

23406307
put	get
because of its methods like put get we dont know their inner workings or are they data structures

23406421
maven	pom.xml
as this specific version is not available on maven central repo nor any of our internal repos i copied the jar to the project lib dir and defined in pom.xml with dependency systempath as the following

offline installation of rvm - i made the relevant files rvm itself ruby and rubygems accessible to the vagrant machine using a shared folder and turned the offline rvm instructions into a not very good puppet module and used that

23406737

width	height
logcat for listview with width and height equals to wrap_content

23406901
width	height
logcat for listview with width and height equals to match_parent

23406914
post	get
but when i test the web hook then send owl send empty data means empty array data is in either post get

udp	tcp
well you have to remember that dns amplification attack is based on udp rather then on tcp thus - no connections need to be established

23407021
put	get
i haven t worked that much with spring mvc but my feeling is that you first do the controller stuff get data work with the data and then put necessary data on the model so thymeleaf can continue and render the view based on a template and the data on the model

23407079
folder	directory
i m still a bit foggy on how the asset pipeline works but my guess is that on production environments rails looks in this directory first then your app assets folder

23407135
getter	setter
you can use an entity class to define getter and setter for variables

23407135
getter	setter
now define a variable showhide image and generate its getter and setter

23407159
serializable	deserialization
removing formatters will make look up quicker but cost of the lookup is very tiny comparing to the serializable deserialization itself and other processes

23407223
mouseup	mousedown
i originally thought that mousedown and mouseup was the answer but it is not the case

23407267
margin	height
and the last thing is to give a bottom margin of the footers height so that it doesn t overlap i also gave a top margin due the fact that i made the header absolute as well

23407367
post	get
they are very well outlined in the elasticsearch blog post - managing relations inside elasticsearch i would recommend reading the entire article to get more details on each approach and then select that approach that best meets your business needs while remaining technically appropriate

23407367
children	parent
updating a single field in a nested document parent or nested children forces es to reindex the entire nested document

23407367
children	parent
children are stored separately from the parent but are routed to the same shard

23407367
children	parent
so parent children are slightly less performance on read query than nested

23407367
children	parent
updating a child doc does not affect the parent or any other children which can potentially save a lot of indexing on large docs

23407377
getter	setter
as i see it what robert martin tries to convey is that objects should not expose their data via getter and setter unless their sole purpose is to act as simple data containers

23407377
getter	setter
classes that provide getter and setter invite breaches of the law of demeter for instance

23407377
getter	setter
on top of that knowing the structure of the state of some class knowing which getter setter it has reduces the ability to abstract the implementation of that class

23407432
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome but not in firefox

23407467

so you provide public methods called accessors and mutators to allow them to do so also called getter and setter

23407731
nsurl	nsstring
you assume that urlindex is an nsstring but actually it is an nsurl so you have to find the right nsurl method

23407819
int	chars
also accessing a string s chars array directly is a little bit faster than using charat int on string -- the reference is direct instead of making a method reference to the array

23407841
implements	extends
public class checkout extends activity implements oncheckchangedlistener

23407846
getter	setter
rails automatically creates getter and setter method

23407860
zoo	xts
the issue is that xts zoo align objects by index before performing any ops methods arithmetic logical operations etc so your growthrate function will never work correctly on xts zoo objects

23407943
width	height
your best bet is to explicitly declare the image width height

23407943
width	height
if width height are unknown you could save the image dimensions into the database and retrieve them together with the image path

23407985
satellite	altitude	distance	altitude
note that the conversion between elevation and off nadir angle here is quite good provided that the value h + r distance between the satellite and the earth center range + earth_radius is corrected by the altitude on earth that is h + r + target_altitude

23408132
children	parent
if the parent terminates first then all of its children either zombie or non-zombie are inherited by init while the parent is terminating

23408161
width	height
if you don t specify a height and only a width the proportions stay the same

23408183
post	get
what this means is that it actually uses two http connections- one post request to upload the content as a â œliveâ chunked stream and a second get request to access the results which makes much more sense for longer audio samples or for streaming audio.

23408183
post	put
if someone needs more information about it let me know cause i m not able to put more than 2 links in this post

bower	npm
you have to install it with npm however you don t have to require it or use it directly bower will require and use it for you since you configured it to do so

23408496
hide	show
consider using deadbolt-2 it s dedicated for this job it allows to show or hide content in views depending on logging state but also by roles and permitions

23408499

it wants me to put namespaces in my xmlroot attributes which i can and it solves the problem but the xml i get doesn t have namespaces in it so i don t think this is going to serialize

getter	setter
now i need a getter and setter for name and a getter for namechangecounter

23408809
getter	setter
i looked up how to make getter and setter in javascript in this question

23408878
width	margin
edited here is a jquery way to do the margin calculation automatically - it even has an input to the right of the black box where you can specify a different width for your divs

23408911
min	max
attributes such as min max and step are supported in rails 4

23408953

versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of ant such as ant 1.9.4

23409203
subclass	abstract-class

note that you save the parent it will store its changed children too

23409243
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have a problem with this code in safari in firefox and google-chrome it works

23409251
google-chrome	firefox
there are two tools that are good to use that are built into your browser if you are using firefox or google-chrome

23409287
short	base
the short answer is that the snippet you posted creates a base view which you are then meant to use when extending instead of the backbone.js view

23409361
post	get
but let s say the shopping cart post model get to the controller

23409406
serializable	deserialization
a much better approach is to subclass textfield and override the relevant methods to do the serializable deserialization transparently as required

23409438
nunit	moq
using nunit and moq you could test your service as follows

23409481

23409533
bash	subshell
a subshell such as your invocation of bash is completely unable to influence its parent

23409571
sudo	passwd
maybe i should note that i connect to my server using ssh with the aws .pem file containing the key and my server has the normal user-pass login disabled i hope i describe it correctly meaning i don t need any passwd for a sudo for example

23409583
post	get
i have the standard 2 create methods in my controller - 1 get 1 post and am using this viewmodel to get stuff into the view

i m having trouble in having my link represented by an image and off to the left side of the page be actually effective in causing a div which contains a sentence and in the center to show up hide when the link is clicked on

23409843
post	get
one thing i would recommend though is abstracting the query so that your get and post actions will simply call a function that won t change and if you need to make a change to how the select list is created you just do it in one place

23409872
rdf	owl
a common way of representing this kind of information in rdf or owl is to use a new node to represent an instance of the relation and to relate the three parts to that individual

23409887
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
as max is only supported in internet explorer 10 opera google-chrome and safari

23409900

entities	entitymanager
projection queries can be much faster than entity queries in breeze because in general there is no need to merge the result of a projection into the entitymanager cache which is a time consuming process if you have a lot of entities

23415026
downcasting	upcasting
upcasting means casting the object to a supertype while downcasting means casting to a subtype

23415074
equals	compareto
normally the compareto method should return 0 if the two objects are equals

23415074
equals	compareto
you often hear the phrase compareto should be consistent with equals which means that equals should return true when compareto returns 0 and equals should return false when compareto returns something other than 0

23415123
slideup	slidedown
my advice is to not use slideup and slidedown i would instead use css transitions to perform this animation

23415123
slideup	slidedown
although slideup and slidedown are nice quick solutions i ve found their performance is poor in most scenarios

23415140
tunnel	vpn
even though i was not running an active vpn tunnel i needed to quit viscosity before codekit would download the active list of bower components

you will probably need a x constraint height constraint and a width constraint as well

23415182
versioning	upgrade
i m on 0.7.0 so no blaze i can t upgrade at the moment due to the other package which i m using they just don t have 0.8+ versioning as of yet

23415245
put	get
i put that as the first javascript file that is called on the page but i still get the error in ie8 object doesn t support this property or method when it hits an indexof call

23415249
post	get
my intended approach is to use long polling to retrieve messages from the server and a separate connection to send messages to the server using get post obviously there is no need for this to be long polled

23415253
int	boolean
for boolean 0 for int 0.0 for floats for strings and nil

maven	pom.xml
...where pregressiontests is configured in maven pom.xml as follows

although xfs is supposed to be very clever about allocating resources most filesystems experience degrading performance the more files you have in a single directory

23415297
hash	md5
consider taking an md5 hash of the word you want to store and base your filename on this

23415303
google-chrome	firefox
you cannot expect the same behavior for window.open to be true across all of internet explorer firefox and google-chrome because of the different ways in which they handle a user s browser preferences

23415303
google-chrome	firefox
i m not 100 sure but it looks like google-chrome version 34.0.1847.131 m does not appear to have any settings that the user can use to choose whether or not to open popups in a new window or a new tab like firefox and internet explorer have

23415303
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox specifying a width and height will force a popup even when a user has set firefox 29 to open new windows in a new tab as mentioned in the answers to javascript open in a new window not tab

23415303
width	height
however the same code snippet above will always open a new tab in internet explorer 11 if users set tabs as their browser preferences not even specifying a width and height will force a new window popup for them

23415303
width	height
so the behavior of window.open in chrome seems to be to open popups in a new tab when used in an onclick event to open them in new windows when used from the browser console as noted by other people and to open them in new windows when specified with a width and a height

23415303
google-chrome	firefox
you cannot expect the same behavior for window.open to be true across all of internet explorer firefox and google-chrome because of the different ways in which they handle a user s browser preferences

hide	show
i only use one at any given time with a few small exceptions and i use show hide to manage which panels are displayed at a given time

23415765
hide	show
my question is this is it best that i create all 30 panels at the inception point of the code hide the 29 that are not needed and move on and then show hide between the 30 panels as the code runs or should i only create the one or two that are needed at the start and create the others as they are called for and then hide destroy the ones that have served their purpose

the videos seems to be working perfectly on mostly all devices browsers google-chrome safari iphone android etc except of course for firefox

23415842
portrait	landscape
i have the layout files created properly for landscape vs portrait etc and if i start the app in either orientation it works fine

23415842
portrait	landscape
for example if i start in portrait mode and rotate to landscape mode fragments 2 and 3 are now blank and don t show up and if i rotate back to portrait mode the app crashes because it can no longer find those fragments to add back to the app

23415876

23416658
post	get
you can also use ajax post using jquery click event for anchor tag to post the form and once you get the result you can make a client side redirection

23416683
getter	setter
i was wondering how it is best to create a data entity in c++ where the setter is private and getter is public

23416683
getter	setter
this in my mind makes the setter private and the getter public but this example is not practical if the data members are 5-10.

23416683
getter	setter
how would you make a entity class struct such that the setter is private and the getter is public without making the constructor taking in all the data member variables

23416708
int	double
if you are working with a double or with two int you might get an inconsistent state

23416708
int	double
where during a write of process 0 half of the double variable or one int of two already has the new value and the other part still the old value while you read it in thread 1

23416708
int	double
64bit systems on the other hand usually handle two int 64bit as one chunk there it would work with the double but not with bigger constructs

then use javascript to show hide them as necessary

isotope determines the layout based upon the width and height of the images when the page is loaded so initially the items were all overlapping because isotope wasn t calculating the correct size

23419026
strcpy	strncpy
lastly in this amazingly bad piece of code which really isn t worth mentioning is relevant to neither strcpy nor strncpy yet seems to have earned me the disfavor of nonsensicke who seems to write very verbose and thoughtful posts.

you cannot use android ui methods such as findviewbyid in the initializers of an activity or similar class as these are only valid during and after the call to oncreate

23419216
put	get	setcontentview	findviewbyid
and when you do so be sure to put the findviewbyid after setcontentview as matiash so correctly points out - otherwise you will only get a different null pointer exception

23419217

for-loop	arrays
also consider changing the foreach version of the for-loop to a regular for-loop that skips the initial element of the arrays

you first will want to create oop-compliant objects complete with non-static variables constructors methods including getter setter etc

23419933
stdout	fflush
tried using fflush stdout

23419954
symlink	realpath
note setting realpath_cache_ttl to 0 does not disable the cache. or if you want to keep it enabled you should be able to use the clearstatcache function to clear the realpath cache immediately after deploying your symlink using a capistrano hook

23419956
stdout	stderr
the output of sort -c goes to stderr not stdout

23420027

x86	mips
hopefully you will see that the problem is the same no matter what architecture x86 arm mips etc

23420121
min	max
this will create the default approximately 10 ticks for wide domains but will create one tick per integer value when the difference between the max and min of your domain is less than 10

23420122
min	max
however it involves converting the array to a collection which as this so post points out is very inefficient if all you need is min max

23420122
min	max
instead you should write the min max function yourself

23420131
floating-point	integer
now you have the above type you can scan a hexadecimal integer and interpret the resultant bytes as a floating-point number

23420134
folder	dir
i created a folder named dir and in that folder i created two sub_folders depend and depend2 and in both of them i created a .java file with following code

23420148
min	max
they re both centered around your center but for one the min is one standard deviation away to the left and for the other the max is one standard deviation away to the right

23420148
min	max
on the left you keep the one with the standard deviation corresponding to min and on the right the one corresponding to max

23420148
min	max
if you want min and max to be hard limits you will have to add rejection for values outside those bounds

23420148
min	max
for min 10 max 100 and center point 70 using a tightness of 3

23420148
min	max
for comparison the distribution this will produce with the same min max center and tightness is

23420157
superclass	subclassing
lets say you have superclass animal and subclassing land and water

23420181

children	parent
if you have your cascades set up correctly you should only have to save the parent object and then the children will get created and id s assigned automatically

23420776
superclass	subclassing
you only encapsulate functionality in a superclass if all subclassing share that functionality and while your objects both need id s these id s are not related to each other

23421788
innodb	myisam
you could always convert to myisam ignore-add the index and then convert back to innodb

23421845
gson	jackson
for instance if you get an application json content type then you need to to use a deserializer like gson or jackson and entity.getinputstream as an input for that deserializer

23421930
fgets	strtol
or you could read a whole line with fgets and then parse tokenize that line i would use strtol for that in this case since it makes it trivial to continue to the next nmumber

23422151
int	chars
and if the input is an int it will fail too the comparaison will automaticaly cast the chars into int so any number between the ascii code a to z and a to z will be ommited

23422210
children	parent
this is typically done as one or the other document collections having the related key information either all children or the parent in order that the results can be referenced

23422210
children	parent
the limitation here is that your are typically restricted to not being able to filter parent document results based on the content within the children

23422210
children	parent
this may vary on the implementation but any parent that stores references to all of it s children with have that restriction for example that is

you can use the sum aggregate-functions for achieving this

23422345

23422844
packets	multicast
the controller is said as a platform as this gives the programmer the flexibility to add specific modules for a routing module which takes care of routing only multicast packets using some very different routing algorithm and run them on the controller

23422874
qgraphicsscene	qrect
also instead of creating a qgraphicsrectitem and using its rect method to return a qrect object that you will use in qgraphicsscene addrect you should just create a qrect object and use that

23422895
int	double
i know it is because i use an int instead of a double precision as an input parameter

23422895
int	double
if i want a subroutine which handles int and double precision data it seems i have to define 2 subroutines for doing these things

23422897
hide	show
when i click on available trims - 3 then its corresponding list items will be toggled show and hide effect

23422930
memcached	apc
beyond apc there are third party key value pair storage engine in memory like memcached

23422996
opera	google-chrome
unfortunately according to caniuse.com it is only supported in google-chrome and and opera at the moment

23423030
getter	setter
getter and setter could be one reason however sencha touch and upcoming ext 5 use config extensively in touch it is even mandatory

23423065

23423612
fadein	fadeout
i m sure this will work for you.the 3000 is the time miliseconds to wait before executing .i usually set it equal to the previous fadein function so that as soon as its done the fadeout starts in the settimeout piece.i like using settimeout because it s much broader than the others and i use it many more ways than a simple fadein fadeout

23423637
hashchange	popstate
however i recently bumped into issue where ie doesn t fire popstate on hashchange while while pushstate with urls works just fine including ie11

you would have to make sure that the connection information is sound on the sip side of things have it negotiate against a stun turn server and once it has good information you can simply write the sdp with that information and send it

23429156
sdp	turn	sip	sdp
you negotiate against an ice stun or turn server on both sides independently get the good connection information from that and write it to the sdp you can parse the ice candidates on the sip side to get the good connection and write to the sdp with all the candidates gathers on the sip side

23430231
width	height
basicaly you want to place expandable content inside layout that will be one group and to be initially set to visiblity view.gone on click change to visibility.visible. br remember that visibility view.gone set on view ensures that this view wont be rendered and will not take place in your layout so you wont have to worry about height or width you can set it to wrap_content when you will change visibility to visible then it will be rendered and any items below will be shifted down

23430242

edit note that this issue can be circumvented by using fgets to read a line into a chars buffer then extracting the int using sscanf

23430360
fgets	getchar
as long as size is large enough the newline will be consumed by fgets and the subsequent getchar in the loop will work as expected

aiff wav and next snd file formats only

23435343
getter	setter
it is not possible to set a property except by calling the property s setter because a property is defined as a getter and optionally a setter

23435345
udp	tcp
you have to either keep the tcp connection alive to be able to send an update later or you can use something like udp which also comes with its own problems like packet loss or double receiving but doesn t require a connection like tcp does

using windows.applicationmodel.package.current.installedlocation gets me close but it puts me in the ... debug appx directory

23435412
folder	directory
when viewing the built project structure the actual folder containing my .rtf file lives in ... debug tales and winrt applications are very restrictive about walking directory structures not to mention it probably wouldn t be portable to the windows phone anyway

23435545
folder	directory
start the console run windows + r then type cmd and move to the platform-tools folder of sdk directory

versioning	upgrade
the versioning reading 4.5 in the portal is misleading unfortunately and due to the fact the 4.5.1 upgrade did not change major minor versioning of framework so the 4.5 remains

23435637
sctp	udp
this is why sctp needs to be on built on udp so that you can go around nats

23435637
sctp	tcp
firefox does not support sctp over tcp anyways

23435637
sctp	tcp	google-chrome	firefox
all this said google-chrome should still support sctp over tcp and firefox still does not according to bug 891551

23435637
sctp	tcp
i also highly doubt that media will ever support a tcp connection and suspect that only sctp will be supported for any tcp connection relayed or not

23435657
getter	setter
both the getter and setter for the text property in your base class are named text so they only appear once in the __abstractmethods__ set

23435657
getter	setter
when you override the getter in the subclass it counts as if it had overridden the setter too

23435657
getter	setter
unfortunately while a getter-only abstract property works fine there doesn t really seem to be an elegant way to have a property with both an abstract getter and setter

23435657
getter	setter
if you use separate names for those functions and then use the concrete subclass will need to replace all three things the getter setter and the property object itself

23435657
getter	setter
a better approach may be to have the property itself be concrete in the base class but have it make calls to abstract getter and setter implementation functions which can be abstract and which subclasses can easily override

23435658
put	get
if i put the svg element inside the tab no clicks get registered

23435665
hide	show
dojo tabcontainer tab switches are not refetching the page from the server and re-rendering the page in the browser they re using the tabcontainer widget js runtime to hide one tab div and show another which is why your checkboxes are not going back to their original state on a tab switch

in my scenario it becomes clear i did not have to learn and to perfect four languages swift objective-c java c# javascript but only two c# and javascript

23435947
swift	objective-c
this is an incredibly huge benefit as it s not only about some language originalities of swift objective-c or java but also about the different frameworks you are using on ios and android

23436218
multiplying	division	multiplying	add
it s just like in base 10 when you want to multiplying a number by 10 you know you can just add a zero to the right side of the number the reverse division would be taking the zero off of the right side

things get wonky at extreme peak values so i left that out and put a warning in the code. you can see the peaks right where they should be

23436864
cgsize	cgrect	cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect
in particular you will as a minimum need to know what the bounds frame center x y cgpoint cgrect cgsize all are in order to fully understand what value to change and what effect changing those values will have on the position of the uiimageviews

23436872
min	max
will give a number between min and max with the mode at average

23436908
hide	show
what i think you might want to do is pass in what you need through the directive scope and use other angular built in directives to hide or show your default non directive state until the scope gets set from the controller for example

23437002
fgets	fread
so you can read the output with fread or fgets

opera	google-chrome
it s pretty widely supported ie8+ ff6+safari 4+ google-chrome 1+ opera 9.5+

23437059
portrait	landscape
another requirement is to have the app in portrait orientation when and in landscape when the columns are more

23437059
portrait	landscape
while everything works great on portrait while on landscape orientation the listbox goes crazy

23437059
portrait	landscape
it does not respect the landscape orientation and treats the uielements as if they were rendered in portrait

23437070
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this same app works with either localhost or computer-name using firefox google-chrome and safari

23437080
inherited	properties
in general replacing the object on the prototype properties isn t a great idea and you should only do it when setting up inherited hierarchies

23437087
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
also es6 right now only experimental this feature is already available in edge firefox google-chrome and safari

this way you have all the benefits of a feature branch while you re working and can still follow the squash policy

23437244
post	get
as you might expect these map onto http get and http post requests

23437244
post	get
your current problem stems from the fact that you have implemented the dopost method in your welcomeservlet therefore expecting a post request when it will actually be serving a get request

23437244
post	get
speaking very crudely you can think of get requests as read operations and post requests as write operations

23437257
for-loop	loops
as a c# developer it seems a very simple task that could be accomplished with a for each style loops with another for-loop inside it

23437300
int	double
if you are using some numerical data type you could just get a count on the rows and multiply it by the size for instance 4 for int or 8 for double but it won t reflect the actual size taken up on disk however

23437323
textview	imageview
if your icons are sized correctly eg 48 pixels in the drawable-mdpi folder then you can dispense with the imageview altogether and use in the textview

23437325
width	height
so i have an image which is of variable height and width inside a div

23437345
inherited	properties
but your name properties in your stylesheet class is hiding the exact same properties in the class that it inherited from file - this is causing the serialization error

23437348
hash	md5
you could try the md5 hash which should do for your purpose and may be faster still it is also in assembler

23437401
unix	aix
moreover beware that some unix implementations might require an environment variable to be set for them to behave a posix way eg bin_sh xpg4 is required on tru64 osf1 xpg_sus_env on on aix ...

width	height
the first way i have tried to specify the width and height of the ratingbars in the layout file as shown below

23437501
width	height
now when i try the second way which is more like the way i would like to do it by not having to specify the exact size of each of the ratingbars by just setting the layout width and height to wrap the following is the code

23437505
folder	dir
however when i use the counting function within the new function that adds folder names to an array there seems to be errors with the dir command in the function

23437550
debian	centos
i could not understand why when running under centos i was getting very low numbers even stalling or halting of the process and then if i temporarily booted into debian the performance was exponentially higher

23437561
min	max
i guess it would be simple if you group the rows by date and hours except minutes and then count the different dates if there exists more than one this satisfies the seconds difference condition and thus you can use min max to get the dates from y- m- d h group

23437565
hide	show
what i m trying to do is if the data-bind id is equal to 1 or 2 hide it but show all the others

23437628

pull	push
you are not going to do git pull git fetch or git push ever if you use google drive to keep your repository in more than one place

23437988
min	max
not sure this is what you want but here is a way to draw a random number with a distribution which is uniform from min to avg and from avg to max while ensuring that the mean equals avg

23437988
min	max
assume probability p for a draw from min avg and probability 1-p from avg max

23437988
min	max
the plot of the probability is piecewise constant p from min to avg and 1-p from avg to max

23438075
superclass	subclassing
martin s answer is the best in that you really don t need to do this for superclass properties and arguably should not on the theory that class implementations should be private even from subclassing to the extent possible

23438086
subtract	add
so if you increase the probability of an item or add an item you ll want to subtract from other items

didreceivememorywarning	imagenamed
imagenamed conventionally included to the project the memory usage is high and once in a while 400 images i see a call to didreceivememorywarning but the app is running fine

23438165
pull	push
if i get you right after rebasing you want to do git push -f origin instead of git pull

23438194
mousemove	mouseup
also just some advice as i ve implemented drag and drop many times you might find it a little cleaner to attach your mousemove and mouseup on to window

23438194
move	drag
this will allow you to move off of the div and still have it drag as well as lifting the mouse anywhere on your page to stop the drag

23438239
do.call	lapply
you can use do.call with rbind and simplify your lapply call

23438271

button	checkbox
i m using a dark theme and when any of the elements defined in the layout gain focus they are highlighted in a yellow color a button with focus has an overall yellow highlight while a checkbox with focus has yellow text

23438465
width	height
the selects the element with id of insert and the rest is just asigning the height and width values

23438523
for-loop	arrays
then i m thinking a for-loop would be used to generate the 1-5 to fill the arrays

23438890
int	chars
the .digitvalue will work if the case if for numerics which the buttons would be of type int but qt doesnt have a chars value i should say after 6hrs of reading qt doc and another 4 of trying different combinations it would not work i think it has to do with how many bits it takes to store each variable type in an array

23438898
post	get
if this isn t what you need please make a sqlfiddle with sample data and post the result you re trying to get in your question

exponent	modulo
one clever way to do this is to use exponent of a primitive element in modulo

23452500
free	malloc
see about malloc and free

23452525
pull	push
ever since i can t pull push any of my repos although i can login via a browser

versioning	upgrade	jruby	mri
upgrade your mri versioning if possible or give jruby a shot

23452617
for-loop	arrays
the only thing that may be beneficial about the 2nd would be if you want to use the arrays outside the for-loop

23452617
for-loop	loops
as you can see the compiler simply restructured your for-loop into a standard loops

23452622
post	get
however i m not sure how to design the interaction with the backend server through post get requests

23452622
post	get
my problem is that i m not sure how to given an list element a div container as a list element retrieve sufficient information about said list element to complete the post get requests

23452631
button	checkbox
radio button checkbox and selects can t be styled very well in a cross-browser fashion using only css

23452641
post	get
i can get recent post successfully though so i know it s working

23452693
nsstring	nsdata
the only thing to bare in mind is that the objects can only be nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

23452695
ansible	puppet
however it does not support mint 13 its output is chef puppet or bash not ansible and it has not been updated in a few months...but that project does what you are thinking of

23452709
proj	tilemill
as you ve seen from that link tilemill can export your proj to mbtiles

23452727

see this link for full codes i m trying to show and hide the div content depending upon selected checkbox

23452734
jar	war
this exact build works on my local host different url of course and i can see the openshift jar in the correct place in the war file

23452830
hash-collision	key
the program that uses these classes together with routines that probe the hash-collision of each key inserted into a dictionary is located here

23452860
fgets	getline
notice that for real keyboard input in a terminal you may want to use libraries like ncurses or readline they permit more editing than the classical getline 3 or fgets approach

23452901
cout	cin
i tried taking out just to see what would happen and it predictably put out a bunch of cout cin endl was not declared in this scope errors but i was surprised to see that it gave some swap was not declared in this scope errors as well

23452922
put	get	post	get	post	put
put any fields you want to pass to a post get request in there

23452922
post	get
change get to post if that s what you prefer

23452928
memcpy	strcpy
use the functions from memcpy or strcpy families

23452990
getter	setter
all above can be achieved with return values or a getter function indicating the current state and a setter manipulating the current state - an exit call is a poor solution in a library

23453046
width	margin
instead set left and right margin to auto and a width suggestable smaller than 100 to show the effect

23453060
children	parent
if the graph is a tree each parent can own its children and delete them in its destructor

23453072
memcpy	strcpy
as the other answers have pointed out when you want to copy an array of characters you need to use memcpy or strcpy

23453080
ada	pascal	fortran	ada
this is in stark contrast to ada pascal and fortran that send descriptors of the array to the function

23453083
mouse	keyboard
i want to design an ui that includes a some buttons and also some keyboard shortcuts for users that don t want to use the mouse

23453182
m2e	groovy-eclipse	maven	m2e
what worked for me was to install the m2e groovy-eclipse integration but also to add more configuration to the maven compiler plugin in order to work with java and groovy classes

23453251
aggregate-functions	sum
when you do a group by query every column that isn t part of the group by clause must be an aggregate-functions sum max etc

23453271
children	parent
the parent can open shared memory and other resources and pass it on to the children

23453297
put	get
to get around this i ve put an event on the mouseover event of the container itself but this isn t great either as it then requires the user to move his mouse over the container before it actually shows the map something i don t want to happen

23453297
jqvmap	jvectormap
instead i opted to use jqvmap which is to some degree a fork of jvectormap however the issues experienced with jvectormap were no longer a problem

23453300
int	chars
and now you want to add another pk column and change the type of existing pk column from chars to int

23453312
post	put
only post and put requests have a body

23453322
width	height
your function sets a transition on height then changes the width

23453349
spaces	linefeed
match a single character that is a â œwhitespace characterâ ascii spaces tab linefeed carriage return vertical tab form feed

23453412
puma	unicorn
so i have noticed that the docs for various application servers think unicorn puma for ruby warp for haskell etc always mentioned something similar to it is optimized as an app server.â typically this is mentioned when describing the standard setup of using a http server like ngnix in reverse-proxy in front of app servers

23453467
apache	nginx
but basically apache nginx strictly deliver static web content

23453467
apache	nginx
because at the end of the day apache nginx still are the best tools for simply delivering web content

23453467
apache	nginx
and apache nginx concentrate on the front-end side of web delivery

23453467
apache	nginx
as a systems administrator i prefer to proxy via apache or nginx since i already know how to configure optimize those tools for my use

23453467
apache	nginx
if i have to learn how to fine tune passenger or tomcat it should only be enough to allow me to get it running so i can place apache or nginx in front of that

23453483
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to use spring security to authenticate a web application to protected resources using ajax as in a pop-up dialog rather than the default redirect to a separate login form

23453493
queue	fifo
the first one in a queue will be the first one out of the queue fifo

23453518
width	height
just keep in mind that anytime you have a split column use display table property as much as possible because display table gives you flexibility in setting up the container width and height

23453518
box-sizing	border-box	width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
box-sizing border-box changes the way width and height calculate

23453518
width	height
now width and height will include the padding of the container

23453518
box-sizing	border-box
therefore by using box-sizing border-box you will almost certainly get the value that you want

23453518
width	height
i think this should be the default value of the css property width and height

23453519
width	height
and then find the average by summing up luminance of all pixels and dividing by width height

23453529
int	chars
now i often use that function to write chars s but there is one scenario in which i need to write an int between 0 and 99 to the screen

23453558
children	parent
disadvantage is that you cannot obtain the parent and it s children in one query

23453565
int	chars
you just need to convert your int to two chars

23453605
getter	setter
encapsulation doesn t restrict to call public setter getter

23453631
width	height
in the img-zoom class you need to contain the width and height of that effect

23453631
width	height
at the point you have it now it s doing a 100 height and 95 width you can notice that when you hover over it you have a 5 on the right that does not get the layer over it

23453631
width	height
so you can go about it a couple of ways like giving the width and the height of img-zoom to be the size of the image and the zoom icon

23453649
postgresql	mysql
so i used update statement for postgresql which is similar to mysql to update all to remove to installed

23453666
zfcuser	bjyauthorize
i am using zfcuser bjyauthorize et roleuserbridge

23453694
width	height
set a proper height width on your images and they will reserve the space even before loading

23453700
opcache	apc
both apc and opcache have several forms of shared memory their defaults and the most suitable kind is mmap d memory but for all kinds of strange reasons they need to support inferior kinds none of these inferior kinds leave a possibility even an unrealistic one for this to work

23453700
nginx	lighttpd
use a sane webserver such as nginx lighttpd and use fpm included with php

23453700
opcache	apc
fpm s process model allows the child processes it forks to have a common cache problem solved applicable to both apc and opcache

23453804
ready	each
notice they perform the .connection.hub.start in document ready not for each chat request

23453808
folder	directory
in your theme directory open et-pagebuilder folder the open et-pagebuilder.php file in your editor

23453811
hide	show
what i m trying to achieve is show only the first 3 elements from the list after 5 seconds hide the first 3 and show the next 3 then again hide these 3 and show the next 3 so hiding the current 3 and showing the next 3 loop

23453835
superclass	subclassing
my superclass holds most of my fields but the subclassing are both containing one extra field each - ph decimal and volpercentage decimal

23453896
google-chrome	firefox
however it does work on firefox and google-chrome

23453947
rspec	capybara
we are using rspec with capybara and selenium so our tests has to open the browser imitiate the user actions wait for javascripts etc

23453983
express	node.js
i am currently working on a large application in node.js on top of express

23453983
post	get
so far so good but now things get more complicated and they will always only get even more complicated as i have to consider the sequence of module initialization as they might attach themselves to the handler stack with use get post etc. and more.

23453996
versioning	upgrade
so in your case better upgrade your jquery versioning to 1.9 or higher because ur using bootstarp 3 so i would suggest upgrade jquery

23454063
oncreate	findviewbyid
it won t be in the activity view hierarchy yet in oncreate and findviewbyid won t find it returning null

23454065
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately this code causes firefox google-chrome and ie to break

23454131
getter	setter
validations checking that they re in correct state and calculations are usually put in the property setter getter while operations for transforming data are exposed via public methods

23454140
for-loop	loops
actually you can use values assigned in a for-loop definition outside that loops

23454149
post	get
as you can see the method is get change that to post

23454173
pop-up	dialog
i have a simple winform mvvm setup that updates the developer information and the view will pop-up a dialog with the new developer information after being notified of the update

23454217
inherited	subclassing
unfortunately afaik there is no such thing as where condition in mapping so i tried to solve my problem with inherited - i created two subclassing of class comment

23454239
stdout	stderr
gcc s warnings are printed to stderr not stdout

23454240
stdout	stderr
to redirect stderr as well as stdout use

23454241
stdout	stderr
the error messages from gcc are going to stderr and your pipe is only catching stdout

23454241
stdout	stderr
assuming that you re using bash try this to capture stderr as well as stdout

23454251
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
but pushviewcontroller animated is method of uinavigationcontroller not uiviewcontroller

23454291
uiview	subviews
when i detect long press in my viewcontroller i show popup menu add uiview as a subviews

23454353
nsubstitute	moq
it uses moq instead of nsubstitute but the general concept should be similar to what you are asking for

23454373
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to use a for-loop to use a python script to call an api to each ip address in the arrays

23454385
jndi	jta
jboss 7 automatically creates a jta transaction manager and binds it to the following jndi location java transactionmanager by default

23454387
put	get
note that you get a hen-and-egg problem if ldap is your first entry for host resolution in etc nsswitch.conf so you can t avoid the etc hosts entry if ldap comes before dns in etc nsswitch.conf and you need to put hosts in front of ldap there

23454411
submit	submission
i have created a form using asp.net mvc 5 and when i click the submit button it sucessfully submission the data

23454439
post	get
as for the handler binding execution order of the get post etc - you still could control the package loading order do not forget that so you can achieve it all in a standard way

23454499
setinterval	settimeout
i cannot imaging why you would want to do something like that without using more generic settimeout and setinterval

23454506
getter	setter
for example don t reference another object s attribute directly but use getter and setter methods

23454515
min	max
when using the default validate method on the form without any rules it checks the text inputs for min max values and since the input value is a string returns the following message please enter a value greater than or equal to 0

23454521

23454575
filewriter	bufferedwriter
you re closing underlying filewriter but actual data are still stored buffered in bufferedwriter object

23454585
integer	unsigned
you can prove that to yourself by decrementing the integer and seeing that negative values are provided rather than it wrapping back round to the maximum number for an unsigned integer

23454590
post	get
and start the cluster solution 2 in the linked post i still get the same error datastreamer exception

by superclass i am not referring only on the class that is a subclassing of but also all other classes that are up its inherited line

23454830
width	height
edit since this affect only the image on the border i found a workaround opening the svg in a text editor and increasing the height and the width of a couple of pixels which means leaving a bit of transparent padding around the text

23454847
dlsym	dlopen
that is working using the dlopen and dlsym for basic funcions

23454878
width	height
the coordinates of the buttons are relatively calculated according to the height and width of the trinity div

23454878
width	height
in other words my xml_button_create window.myvalue height width false isn t firing off

23454904
client-side	server-side
there are two types of validations client-side done with javascript and server-side done with php

23454904
client-side	server-side
client-side validations can be overriden hacked thus server-side are more secure

23454947
pascal	delphi
i have not worked with fast report web server myself but for my own delphi free pascal http server applications i use apache as reverse proxy

23454964

23454964
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
and none of these methods touchesbegan touchesmoved longpressbegan is called

23455008
int	chars
seems optional is only useful if the type t in optional is a primitive type like int long chars etc

23455025
width	height
if you want it to toggle back after clicking you would just detect the width or height etc and reverse the css attributes

23455031
google-chrome	firefox
here i use table and table-cell to make the element stick into bottom my screen is 150 height it works well for my google-chrome but for firefox the bottom element stick at the bottom of 100 screen not the whole screen

23455044
int	chars
alter table tags change id article_id chars 32 add column id int 11 not null auto_increment primary key

23455522
int	chars
to set the size of the text field pass an int to the constructor specifying chars columns new jtextfield 15

23455625
post	get
using a post get param to transmit the hash allows an easier exploit

23455630
min	max
starting with the innermost expression min max x y z .

23455630
min	max
then the expression evaluates to max min x y z

23455630
min	max
if min x y z then z is smaller than x and y both as the relation becomes max x y min x y z

23455630
min	median	min	max	median	max
therefore the min x y is indeed the median and max min x y z returns that

23455630
min	median	min	max	median	max
if min x y z then z is indeed the median as min x y z max x y

23455630
min	max
the expressions evaluates to max min x y x

23455630
min	max
since max x y evaluated to x min x y evaluates to y

23455630
median	max
we return the max of x and y as the expression becomes max y x which is x and also the median

23455630
min	max
and min of max of x and y and z is z

23455630
median	max
the max of y and z is y which is the median

23455630
min	max
and min of max of x and y is x and z is z

23455630
median	max
max of the above two is x which is the median

23455630
min	max
and min of max of x and y is x and z is z

23455630
median	max
max of the above two is y which is the median

23455654
swt	styledtext
but adding a class to swt package seems harder first because there is different jars depending on the operating system used org.eclipse.swt.cocoa org.eclipse.swt.gtk .... and also because copy pasting the code of styledtext is not that easy since there is call to external methods waiting for a strict styledtext

23455661
dlsym	dlopen
if using dlopen dlsym you always should check for errors

23455702
memcached	apc
i solved using memcached for shared memory and apc for the byte codes cache

finally i renamed the municipal_id to municipalid underscore removed and also rename getter setter and the repository findbymunicipalidorderbylastnamedesc and the issue solved

23456209
passenger	unicorn
however if you are looking for a zero-downtime either unicorn or passenger enterprise are what you are looking for

23456265
put	get
i believe it is more correct to say that the if-match value should be set from the etag from the most recent get or put operation not the value of the etag header you received when you disabled the distribution

23456285
textview	imageview
if you want imageview inside of your listview so you should write a custom adapter for that default arrayadapter doesn t accept imageview as listview resource and it should be just textview

23456288
google-chrome	firefox
but when open using google-chrome firefox its everything ok

23456351

game is in portrait mode camera width being 0 to 480 and height being 0 to 800

23456390
for-loop	arrays
according to the jls 14.14.2 an enhanced for-loop for an arrays type is equivalent to a regular for-loop with the following pattern

23456493
vpn	wlan
icmp packets continuously go through the vpn interface and successfully encrypted decrypted and after that they are sent to the wlan via the wlan interface as esp packet with the vpn interface as src ip

23456493
vpn	wlan
after disabling the vpn the vpn interface goes down icmp packets are sent directly to the wlan interface with the wlan interface as src ip in plaintext un-encrypted

23456493
vpn	wlan
but when the vpn is established again and the vpn interface is up again packets are sent at the same way but the esp packet encapsulates a wlan src ip and not the vpn src ip

23456493
vpn	wlan
icmp packets go through the vpn interface and then via wlan interface as esp packet with the wlan interface as src ip and not vpn interface as src ip

23456519
jax-ws	saaj
you could keep it simple by using a jax-ws client generated with wsimport or even manually building the message for the call by using something basic as saaj

23456538
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you can do that in the browser but it works only in modern browsers google-chrome firefox safari latest versions

23456551

unfortunately all the examples i could find only deal with arrays of the same type and i don t know how to load only two int into one 128bit register and then convert them to double

23456557
postgresql	mysql
i can t see what is wrong with the sql statement it worked fine with postgresql and modified slightly for mysql too

23456570

post get or cookie for example

23456974
post	get
while talkol might be right that you can use for both post and get there is rarely good reason to do it

23457006
folder	directory
ultimately how you do this is dependent on your app logic of course you might choose to read the path to your folder from a configuration file which you can edit post deployment or you could add a function in your forms app to set a directory to look in and persist the info

this way the superclass calls its subclassing method

23457670
ionic	angular
the project uses ionic and angular basically none yet to create a simple swiping sidemenu app

23457672
min	max
in addition to the min and max cv minmaxloc returns the top-left corner of the template position for the best match

23457672
min	max
note that if you expect more than one max min then cv minmaxloc is not sufficient since it returns only a single point

23457704
width	height
which means your oval always has a width of zero and a height of zero

23457732
width	height
it will set the height or width based on the content size

23457732
width	height
see the documentation where you can find constant value to set the height and width as per need

23457757
post	put
in your case just put the post processor of the request that will give you the response containing the child node

23457775

this code should send min and max values to server and then retrieve data from server

23457846
strncmp	strcmp
â for some reason i had to replace the strcmp it didn t compare like it s supposed to in the while loop to strncmp and set the int n to 13

23457846
memcmp	strcmp	strncmp	memcmp	strncmp	strcmp
with general encryption since the encrypted data is a blob of binary data that might include embedded null bytes 0 you would probably use memcmp rather than use either strcmp or strncmp

23457880
uiview	subviews
uicollectionview is more optimized than display dozen of subviews to make a grid in an uiview

23457900

23458040
mouseover	mouseout
on mouseover of the holderdiv display the pictures and on mouseout hide them again

23458098
int	double
note that all int of magnitude less than or equal to 2 53 +1 are exactly representable in ieee754 double precision and consequently your isbaratdefaultvalue function will do exactly what you expect it to in your case of defaultefficiency equal to 100.0

23458141
factors	matrix
obviously order of execution and bounds checking are factors here but i imagine these could be accounted for by the matrix orientation and formula respetively

23458160
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
case in point in rlwrap the parent process keeps the slave pty open to keep tabs on the child s terminal settings on linux and freebsd one can use the master for that but not in solaris for example

everything works fine when i access the page but when i resize the window the height is correctly resized but the width keeps its initial value i want it to be proportional like when i access the page for the first time to the height

23458891
unsigned	short
if t is unsigned short then only two 6-bit fields fit into a 16-bit storage unit

23458891
16-bit	64bit
the 32-bit or 64bit assignments are somewhat similar to the 16-bit version

23458892
folder	directory
as defined above target directory but the request is not creating this folder

23458902
google-chrome	firefox
settimeout at least in google-chrome and firefox which are the browsers i m concerned with is defined such that if the page calling it is not in your active tab it can be called a maximum of once per second

23458917
put	get
but in order to get the thing working functionally can anyone advise on what is going wrong and why the rules link is showing n other node types and for a php novice like me at this stage could i simply put some php in somewhere that would ensure the rules link only shows on a set content panel on my custom panel page

23458975
ubuntu	debian
specifically is it safe to run on ubuntu and debian machines which have eglibc

23458981

width	height
make a div position it with css on top of your page and it s width and height to match the document width and height or whatever width and height you need

23459084
button	checkbox
first of all if your two checkbox are mutually exclusive you want to be using radio button so that only one can be checked like so

23459084
submit	submission
that being said the best option would be to use two form elements but this would require either two submit buttons or javascript to perform the submission

23459087
noexcept	throw
there is no throw or noexcept

23459088
integer	unsigned
eax is being used as an pointer to a 4 byte integer could be unsigned

23459090
hash	md5
at that point you could even replace all the queries in the client code with their say md5 hash

23459102
width	height
remove width and height from the and add an viewbox attribute instead

23459102
width	height
this way the receives its width and height from the context it lives in from the css in your case

23459111
post	get
this works fine and relates the post to that user but when i try to fetch the post later it doesn t seem like i can get an instance of _user from pfrelation

23459186
hide	show
you need to show or hide the scrollbar in handlescrollbar manually

23459210
centos	linux
os linux centos 64-bit

23459262
post	get
parse provides the possibility to retrieve also referenced objects in the original query and this is done using the includekey method in the original query that is the query you setup to get the post by asking to return the user data and not just the reference

23459285
ubuntu	linux
note i m running r version 3.1.0 under linux ubuntu

you are missing closing for form class because of this your form data are submitted as get not post

23459408
google-chrome	firefox
now this works fine on google-chrome but on firefox ie while the script still works it reloads the page

23459490
division	modulo
i would suggest returning two derived fields in one query the first one to get hours through division the second one to get minutes through modulo

23459537
ng-style	ng-class
another option would be ng-style but i can t seem to bind my controller flag is_modal to the ng-style since it does not allow to ask for conditions as ng-class does.

23459558
folder	directory
also the folder generated files appears on project properties c++ additional directory

23459679
for-loop	loops
several of the introductory tutorials i ve read on using for loops in plpgsql have said unless i really need a for-loop i should find another way

23459704
width	height
window resize affects only the width of the element but not the height

23459704
width	height
it is kinda make sense because if you resize the height more content is scrollable that means don t do anything to width but to increase the scrollbar length so more content to be scrolled

23459735
ng-style	ng-class
but if you want to have a more consistent and maintainable solution with a complex set of conditions to append with your styling then i suggest you create a scope function that you may place in your ng-class or ng-style directive

23459752
mouseout	mouseleave
a nice different between mouseout and mouseleave is shown here.

23459776
mouseout	mouseleave
i believe you should use mouseleave instead of mouseout

23459782
textview	imageview
1- define your desired layout for a row as an xml layout file - e.g your rows can contain any number of ui widgets like textview edittext imageview ..

23459782
implements	extends
whatever class you choose to extends you should implements a getview method

23459801
sse	avx
since you know the size of your data and it is very small you can directly write sse or even avx intrinsics that will copy those 512 bits for the source address to the destination address

23459824
portrait	landscape	switching	screens
now i also want to specify a different grid layout when i switching from portrait to landscape mode .for example in mobile screens i want to use col-xs-6 in portrait mode and col-xs-3 in landscape mode

23459830

23460083
for-loop	loops
while it doesn give me siginifcant boost as compared to cpu implementations such as fftw i noticed that if it is put in a for-loop the performances dramatically decreases as loops iterates itself

23460099
filtering	grouping	post	get
my rationale was that one table containing every post for all grouping would get really big in theory anyway and slow down filtering and also that the extra field for grouping name would in the long run be a waste of memory when i could have separate tables per grouping and skip this field

23460132
put	get
what you should do is get all the database logic and put it in a webservice on a separate server - and modify the application to access the database via the webservice

23460202
express	node.js
i am creating a web application using node.js socket.io express modules

23460239
put	get
when we enter the loop we will first print 1 then get the next number 2 put it into tmp then repeat the process with the other numbers

23460287
width	margin
i managed to get in dead center using a mix of the margin and width properties earlier but it wouldn t stay in the center if i shrunk the page i did still have the image set with display inline so that might explain it but it s the only way i have been able to get the columns and the image in one line

23460293
rss	feed
my webapi return rss feed data

23460294

how can i get a layout where those category checkbox not overlap settings bar button etc

23460301
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i am trying to make an arrays with specified size and loops through it avoiding for-loop

23460436
try-catch	exception-handling
catch the exception-handling with a try-catch -finally block

23460480
postorder	inorder
since your ds is a tree you would have to use one of the tree traversal algos ie inorder perorder or postorder

23460517
google-chrome	firefox
for example if your first user is alice using firefox and second user is bob using google-chrome

23460652
cos	exp	cos	sin
i was impressed when i learned that you could do it for simple functions like cos x sin x and exp x at all

23460668
implements	extends
create an abstract class interface which holds a static instance variable of type thisclass and then extends implements this abstract class interface in classes you want to have the same thisclass instance

23460681
getter	setter
the best way that i can think of is to use an interface for my locator set it in the default constructor of each service using a static getter and have a setter so that i can set a mocked locator

23460685
snap.svg	raphael	d3.js	raphael

use an md5 hash of the password - never store the original password

23460776
scrypt	pbkdf2	scrypt	salt	pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
use pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt with said salt and as large an iteration count work factor as your processors can handle to create a password hash

23460776
pbkdf2	hash
if you use pbkdf2 in specific do not request a larger output than the native hash size sha-1 20 bytes sha-256 is 32 bytes sha-384 is 48 bytes and sha-512 is 64 bytes or you increase the comparative advantage an attacker has over you the defender

23460776
scrypt	pbkdf2
alternately you can base64 encode the binary output of pbkdf2 bcrypt scrypt but then you must be sure to either use a case sensitive comparison or base64 decode it after retrieval

23460776
hash	salt
retrieve their version salt iteration count work factor and resulting hash from the database

23460776
hash	salt
hash whatever keyword password they just entered with the salt and iteration count work factor from the database

23461597
createjs	easeljs
im quite new to javascript and easeljs createjs but i think i understand them enough to do simple task

23461620
google-chrome	firefox
i suggest you use the developer tools of your browser right-click anywhere on your page and choose inspect element - google-chrome firefox when you re on your php pages and check if you see the tag added correctly having the exact same path set there as in your html pages

23461640

23461752
rss	feed
i have a sheet that will update based on new articles in an rss feed using importfeed and the urls are analyzed with importxml

23461754
int	chars
it should make it trivial to read int from a file one byte at a time assuming chars to int is one-to-one

23461754
int	chars
an example of using this method to read chars individually as int and then casting to chars follows

23461754
int	chars
again this assumes that each chars is encoded as a single byte and that there is a one-to-one from chars to int s

23461754
int	chars
if you re dealing with multi-byte chars encoding and or you want to support int greater than 255 then the problem becomes more complex

23461775
for-loop	loops
python s for-loop is many other languages foreach loops

23461775
for-loop	loops
and really a c-style for-loop is just syntactic sugar for writing a while loops

23461781
button	checkbox
i am trying to find all controls in a c# program that are radio button or checkbox

23461781
button	checkbox
i ve only gotten it to work with just radio button - if i repeat the ienumerable line with checkbox instead it tells me that a local variable named button is already defined in this scope

23461807
stdout	stderr
now for a fix for your specific implementation what you want to do is write a bar to stdout or stderr with no line return then erase it then draw it again

23461812

23461993
superclass	subclassing
yes in java at least interface implementation propagates from superclass to subclassing

23462001
google-chrome	firefox
jquery 1.10.x had a source map comment the second line of the minified script so developer tools features like google-chrome developer tools perhaps firebug perhaps internet explorer f12 developer tools perhaps firefox developer tools load the uncompressed script and let you debug jquery using it

23462030
int	double
you should use a more useful type for this like int for int or double for decimal values and use nextint or nextdouble on the scanner instead

23462056
google-chrome	firefox
use other browsers -- same error in google-chrome firefox and ie on multiple machines

some gotchas and limitations in the code below note that recent numpy now allows boolean values internally represented as int and allows nas but that value_counts ignores nas compare to r s table which has option usena

23462229
put	get
all of my delete and put requests get blocked 405

23462234
lwjgl	jogl
lwjgl and jogl are two different java bindings to opengl libraries both of which have native code they load in

23462234
lwjgl	jogl
lwjgl is much more aimed towards gaming with opengl where as jogl is more worried about complete and perfect bindings to opengl opencl

23462258

apache	nginx
i want to migrate my wordpress installation from apache to nginx

23462424
put	get
the problem arises when a permit obtained in the wait block of put operation is not used because the buffer is full or the opposite for a get operation

23462426
min	max	range	min	range	max
just give min and max values as parametres to the function and you will get a random value between the range you specified

23462446
int	double
your linklist class is updating this value every time you call the insertfirst int id double dd method

23462464

hash	md5
how you validate it is to create an md5 hash of the password supplied by the user and compare that with the md5 hash of the password in the database

23462603
folder	directory
you have public directory files in which are public and accessible by typing url in browser and non-public folder which can not be accessed by url

23462654
udp	tcp
with udp you can transmit an effectively empty packet but tcp won t allow you to do that

23462665
addclass	removeclass
using addclass would be a better call hence we could removeclass from the tr selector before we stripe the table

23462666
put	get
i also strongly suggest you look at a project like ngbp to get a better idea of how to put your whole app together

23462722

23462812
picasso	universal-image-loader
i would like to share my experience with these 3 libraries universal-image-loader picasso and volley

23462812
picasso	universal-image-loader
i previously used universal-image-loader but then i came to the conclusion i can t really recommend it and i would suggest to use volley or picasso instead which are both developed by highly talented teams

23462812
picasso	universal-image-loader
this may be in part due to the fact that universal-image-loader does not support batching the image responses while picasso and volley do that by default

23462812
picasso	universal-image-loader
volley and picasso do that and they use the expiration time returned by the server by default while universal-image-loader ignores it

23462814
spaces	delimiter
spaces delimiter list

23462830
addition	multiplication
just like they teach you multiplication before addition at school there s a precedence for all the other operators as well

23462927
int	chars
is there any performance penalization if i use a var chars let s say 5 instead of an int in a mysql + innodb database

23462962
stdout	stderr
x .. captures stdout while ssh error messages are written to stderr

23462962

with git i switch branches with git checkout master leaving me in the same directory though i understand that git restores the snapshot that the destination branch is pointing to adding removing files and folder as necessary

23463150
jtabbedpane	jtable
maintain some kind of look up between the tablemodel and the jtable or jtabbedpane depending on what it s you are ultimately after

23463173
ubuntu	debian
what i ended up doing is updating my server from debian 7 to ubuntu 13.10 and that solved the problem

23463334
superclass	subclassing
it is even harder to ensure that a subclassing correctly adhere to the synchronization policy defined by its superclass

23463353
short	base
as per that document short integers that had the bit-depth of the base architecture no longer exist or only internally

23463374
subtract	add
to give your close button some room when the title is too long you can add some padding-right to the header and subtract that in its width so that it stays 200px

23463443
width	height
however now i want to have the height adjust smaller from 250px as you keep reducing the screen width working with a responsive design

23463456
width	height
private int x y width height

23463456
public	protected
you want the fields to be either public or protected to access them using the dot notation but imo it s a better design to keep them private and use get and set

23463456
public	protected
see also in java difference between default public protected and private that explains the fields visibility

23463460
put	get
right now i am working on a widget that i want certain people to put on their sites that will send info to them and get some info back

23463505
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
every time loops runs it is creating a new jbutton arrays and it s only creating a local button arrays within the context of the for-loop

23463505
for-loop	arrays
if you look at your for-loop s they are generally doing the same thing the only difference is the source content the character arrays and where you re adding the buttons

23463505
button	checkbox
have a read through how to use button checkbox and radio button and how to write an action listener for more details.

23463512
bash	subshell
in addition the sed commands need to be in single-quotes when executed by the bash subshell to prevent history expansion from interfering with the use of negation

23463606
width	height
you can do this easily using jquery by storing the window width in a variable and then applying this variable in the element s height

23463617
for-loop	arrays
the problem is that alerts in the for-loop is empty which means that the arrays didn t pass with the ajax call at least that s my guess

23463631
put	get
if i were to put binding.pry under the def initialize user i get nil win i call user

23463733
strlen	calloc
the previous term strlen new_str will always be zero due to calloc s zeroing-out the new memory feature

23463757
equals	gethashcode
the default equals and gethashcode are based on reference equality

23463757
equals	gethashcode
if the object doesn t override equals and gethashcode which you can verify with a decompiler like dotpeek then each object instance will be a unique dictionary key so yes you can use a dictionary to attach extra data to each instance

23463764
youtube	vimeo
what i want it should resize the youtube and vimeo iframes only in the .post-body

23463798
imperative	declarative
this isn t terrible but it does have more noise with the repeated layer reference plus its more imperative and less declarative

23463801
put	get	post	get	post	put
instead of get i would use post then set up a php script you call where you put your values strings into variables using _post and use the mail function to mail those variables strings

23463854
azure	hdinsight
i am using azure hdinsight

23463919
mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	portrait	landscape
assuming you will maintain the same aspect ratio regardless of whether the screens is in portrait or landscape orientation and you will be displaying the image via an imageview you will only need 4 versions of each image - xxhdpi xhdpi hdpi and mdpi

23463919
mdpi	hdpi
so if you are using an image width of 640 px in landscape on mdpi the hdpi xhdpi and xxhdpi should have widths of 960 px 1280 px 1920 px and 2650 px respectively

23464190
youtube	vimeo
if you are looking for the same thing i was looking for resize your youtube and vimeo video iframe to its parent div width for 100 this is a good script which works also in blogger source

23464190

23464519
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
move the code from viewdidappear to viewwillappear

23464555
sorting	grouping
for this you need grouping by hierarchy and apply custom sorting in grouping options in crystal reports

23464570
tcplistener	serversocket
so i think java s serversocket and c# s tcplistener are working differently

23464572
superclass	subclassing
in java fields declared in a subclassing shadow but do not override fields bound in a superclass like methods do

23464572
superclass	subclassing
fields declared in the subclassing exist separately from those in the superclass

23464587
shadowing	named
if you declare a member variable with the same named in your child class as your parent the child member variable is shadowing the parent s

use instead of relative layout in which you can the positions of the children in relation to each other or to the parent

23464706
instances	transient
when you change this to transient instances created that try to establish references to one another will fail

23464706

conclusion is windsor works great with singletons but with transient lifestyles it cannot wire up the slightest complication in instances relationships

23464707
put	get
but when i try to get the bitmap of that image and try o put it in a circular image view i get the default fb display pic which everyone is assigned if you dont have a display pic

i think for this i need to load sprite in the memory and select a tile by specifying height and width and coords from texture memory to display it on screen

23464784
folder	directory
i even tried making an actual resources folder in the root directory of my project so i can just try the resource path but that s not working for me either

i have a single tab in the application and wish to hide the header but still show the tab itself

23464846
hide	show
in order to show hide a particlar div you need to make use of jquery in built methods toggle

23464846
hide	show
like in your case if you want to hide show a div then you will simply use

23464875
shapefile	geojson
if there aren t too many points more than a few hundred then you probably want to generate geojson from the shapefile and display the data that way

23464875
shapefile	geojson
you can convert your shapefile to geojson with the gdal library

23464876

23464909
width	height
there is no way to have the svg automatically update its width and height when you add elements to it

23464909
width	height
all you can do is manually update the width and height yourself

23464909
width	height
however rather than having to remember to update the svg width and height every time you add something you could add an interval timer function to do the check for you

instead of messing with the issue of removing trailing spaces i would use my repl.bat utility to transform the data from fixed width to delimiter format

23473102
spaces	delimiter
i would then use another repl.bat to strip out any spaces that precede the delimiter and then a normal for f can safely parse the values

23473102
spaces	delimiter
if you know that no value contains consecutive spaces and all values are separated by at least 2 spaces then you can get by with a single repl that replaces 2 or more spaces with a delimiter

23474368
width	height
as jcmiller11 suggested setting the width and height helps

23474368
width	height
a slightly nicer solution is to retrieve the width and height of the canvas before drawing the chart

23474400
inherited	subclassing
this would return all the subclassing that are required to be built due to inherited which eclipselink would then use for subsequent queries

23474473
put	get
basically you have to manually put in the month day and year each time even if it displays the month day or year you want because what you see is only what you get if you choose it

23474487

getter	setter
you would want to make variables have a getter to access them from another class instance and possibly even a setter

23474609
client-side	server-side
client-side js code can t directly call on server-side code and server-side code can t call client-side code because js calls cannot pass through an http layer

23474612
post	put
put the entire thing you want to post into a file call the file blob.txt

23474619
textview	imageview
an alternative method would be to use a relativelayout with an imageview and a textview then just position the textview where you need it

23474648
getter	setter
if this were c++ i d create getter and setter that would allow me to do my bookkeeping whenever the setter was called and i d have the getter return a const reference so that the compiler would yell at me if i tried to do modify the list through the getter

23474648
getter	setter
in python we have the property system so that writing vanilla getter and setter for every data member is thankfully no longer necessary

23474648
getter	setter
a fix for this last problem would be not to use the property system and make normal getter and setter methods

23474648
getter	setter
the negative thing about this is that it is kind of un-pythonic to write getter and setter like this and if the class has other list members i would have to either write getter and setter for those eww or make the interface inconsistent

23474648
getter	setter
returning a tuple from the getter or using a tuple in the first place prevents one from using the + operator which can be a useful operator and also triggers the bookkeeping mechanism by calling the setter

23474652
width	height
i have an app that shows a lot of activities each one showing a bitmap that fits the 100 of the width of the screen and normally more than the 100 of the height

23474721
freebsd	linux

23474800
spock	jbehave
but now we introduced jbehave and as a result we got the test steps in my opinion it would be the same if we would use spock or any other framework

23474850
pop-up	dialog
i would need to see what you implemented in your code in order to provide you the best solution overall - as theres multiple ways to implement a dialog in a pop-up

23474850
pop-up	dialog
however here s a couple options depending on how your pop-up dialog is programmed

23474850
jsf	jspx
you ll need a managed bean for your jspx jsf page

23474850
pop-up	dialog
return listener - if you re running a task flow as a pop-up dialog on your button then add a returnlistener to your page s managed bean

23474850
pop-up	dialog
this fires whenever a your pop-up dialog is closing

23474875

- using the mgcv package as opposed to gam

23478143

23478989
int	chars	int	double
it might not even be a big thing at all but i noticed that when i free an int chars or float pointer the value is removed or replaced with a garbage value but when i free a double pointer the value remains the same

23478989
free	malloc
my understanding of how malloc and free work is that when you malloc a pointer you set aside some bytes of memory for the pointer to point to

23478989
int	chars	int	double
this supports rodrigo s hypothesis in the comments that because the double is 8 bytes - as opposed to int chars and float s 4 bytes - free only modifies the first 4 bytes so it does not lose all of its data

google-chrome	firefox
when centering an element with auto i m finding different computed results between firefox and google-chrome

just set the size in the width and height

23481292
width	height
in other words i need the height to be 50 of the width for example

23481306
min	max
if your state check passes some rule 12 month objects at min width or a 10 year object above max width you would request a layout which would then replace the views with the appropriate new views and update your state objects

as implied in ceafdc s answer a better approach might be to hide and subsequently show those views that aren t necessary

23481519
hide	show
looking for other solution to show either chart or table based on show or hide parameter

23481522
restrict	shared
if you want to avoid the lost of data when the application is closed if you don t use preferences you have to create manually a method to store and load your data on a file so sharedpreference is the best choice if you want to shared an object only during the program execution you can use singleton to restrict its instantiation however if the value to store is a string or a primitive using preference also in this case has no side effects but is a bit dirty programming choice

but the problem is that because of the height contrain the text just gets cut off so i can t test if the width of the text is bigger than the containing div

23481891
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
a quick fix would be using box-sizing border-box on all input elements in the form and then declare a uniform width this will ensure that the width is computed as the final border-box width inclusive of border widths and paddings

23481898
spaces	linefeed
so with your current code + sign gets decoded as a spaces and combinations like n get interpreted as control characters such as linefeed new line etc

my understanding of how malloc and free work is that when you malloc a pointer you set aside some bytes of memory for the pointer to point to

23482250
free	malloc
my understanding of how malloc and free work is that when you malloc a block of memory you set aside some bytes of memory

23482250

23483523
rss	feed
i am currently designing an app which for all intents and purposes is exactly like an rss feed reader

23483523
rss	feed
for not so obvious reasons rss feed are not always necessarily ordered by the date of their containing posts however and since i want to display their feed in order they were release and not in the order i retrieved them it made me question performance issues as the app grows and linked list could have tends of thousands of posts under each subscription a feed can also be made up of many subscriptions which might further affect performance

23483547
short	base
i wish i could mark both solution as answers but considering the base of my query is from papo s solution and also that it is very short compared to the other solution i mark that as my answer

23484625
arduino	avr-gcc
the arduino ide defines a lot of things that are not available in a plain avr-gcc compiler digitalwrite so you will need to replace references to those things with something else

23484634
put	get
to get rid of that you should either put the function main at the end of the file after all other functions declaration or you should declare prototypes for the other functions before main

23484642
min	max
the problem with that is i specified brks seq min x max x length.out 500 but hist x breaks brks complained that some entries of x wouldn t be included in the histogram

23484648
width	height
specifying absolute width height for the images i want them to aligntop and alignbottom from the textview on the left

23484653

google-chrome	firefox
this is related to another question chart is rendered in google-chrome but not in firefox and ie however i am of the opinion that it is a valid question in itself and this will hopefully help describing the problem more in-depth

23493557
google-chrome	firefox
apparently the firefox internet explorer engines execute xmldata.getelementsbytagname differently from google-chrome where it works fine which in turn leads to wrong return values and therefore an utter breaking of all following code

23493557
google-chrome	firefox
the question is why firefox and ie do this and how to prevent them from doing it and return the proper result just like google-chrome

23493557
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome opera return 0

23493557
google-chrome	firefox
and the same is true vice-versa so google-chrome returns 417 using the namespace while firefox ie return 0

23493577

i think you re confusing powermockito and easymock

23493621
easymock	powermockito
in these cases powermockito provides extra functionality that easymock does not

i m coding a webpage and i have a problem with a div disappearing in opera and maxthon browsers works ok with firefox

23493699
ceil	sqrt
if the compiler is able to proof that i is not changed during execution of the loop constant propagation may remove the repeated evaluation of sqrt and ceil

23493699

23493888
width	height
basically in android s imageview class there s no way to simply specify hey keep a square aspect ratio width height for this view unless you hard code width and height

23493888
width	height
you could do some manual adjustment of layoutparams in the adapter s getview but frankly it s much simpler to let imageview handle all the measurements and just override the results to say whatever the width ends up being make my height stay the same

23493915

23494138
portrait	landscape
looking at your example it seems that you re trying to place the button in a complete different position between ipad portrait and landscape orientations so probably you cannot use auto layout but consider that you can still link the top and leading edges of your button to a reference the view controller view and then update these constrains if no other objects are constrained to this button the operation is not computationally intensive and you can still use auto layout

23494156

23504525
google-chrome	firefox
also sometimes the vs ie combination will catch errors that google-chrome and firefox firebug reports with a nonsensical error message

23504541

23504849
keystore	jks	pkcs#12	pfx
firstly in many cases you don t need to convert from pkcs#12 pfx to jks many applications will let you set the keystore type to pkcs#12 instead of the default jks which will allow you to use your pfx file directly

23504849
keystore	jks
presumably your ad server has nothing to do with this jks keystore

23504889

23505534
profiling	debugging
all the profiling tools rely on the debugging information generated by the compiler during the build

23505534
profiling	debugging

23505552
width	height
in regards to the first issue the percentage based padding-top value is relative to the width not the height therefore the positioning won t be consistent if the width of the browser is changed - try resizing the window to see this

23505582
int	double
the isvalid method you have only validates if a number is within a range not if the number is a valid int instead of a string or a double

23505644
versioning	upgrade

23505644
versioning	upgrade
and here is a demonstration of the fix upgrade to bootstrap versioning 3.0.3

23505674
width	height
the padding-top percentage is based of the width of the parent element not the height

23505674
width	height
so it goes outside because 95 of the smaller height + 5 of the larger width more than 100 of the height

23505674
width	height
set the textarea width and height to 100 and use a fixed measurement like px or em for the padding if you don t like how the top and bottom percentages work

23505674
box-sizing	border-box	width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
then use box-sizing border-box on the textarea to make its width height and padding stay within 100 of its parent

i store these new hash values and the salt in the database like this

23506562
hash	salt
when alice logs in all i need to do is look up her salt and add it to the end of her entered password before generating a new hash value

23506934
int	chars
are a result of toupper requiring an int type as a parameter while the question code is providing a chars type

23506934
int	chars
to be thorough you can cast the values returned by toupper from int back to chars

23506946

if you have more than one set of radio button in the form or also have checkbox you ll need something like

23507316
pop-up	dialog
1 the easiest way i been able to get around this problem is by using dialog instead of pop-up windows

23507316
popupwindow	dialog
their api is really similar and in my cases are fairly easy to replace popupwindow using dialog

23507316
popupwindow	dialog
2 the second approach is harder but might be a suitable if popupwindow to dialog replacement is not doable is to user fragments in place of popupwindows

23507335
rdf	owl
does not add hasprogramme rdf type owl functionalproperty back to the model

23507367
int	chars
it works when it s just with int and chars though

23507404
libsvm	liblinear
not to mention that the algorithms are coded with different goals in mind libsvm is written in a way to allow switching between different kernel functions while liblinear is optimized to always be linear and have no concept of kernels at all

23507404
libsvm	liblinear
which is why libsvm is not easily applicable to large scale problems even with a linear kernel and often it is suggested to use liblinear when you have large number of instances

23507404
libsvm	liblinear
furthermore regarding multi-class problems with k classes libsvm by default implements the one-against-one approach by constructing binary classifiers while liblinear implements the one-vs-the-rest strategy by constructing k binary classifiers it also has an alternative method by crammer and singer for handling multi-class problems

23507404
libsvm	liblinear
the tolerance for the termination criterion should match default value of -e parameter differs between the two libraries with for libsvm and for liblinear

23507433
put	get
i want to get the first letter of each word put together making something like i need help turn into inh

23507447
tolower	toupper
the toupper and tolower functions declared in along with the functions expect an argument of type int

23507469
kde	gnome
to display firefox within the virtual machine you ll need to install xorg server display server it ll be easier if you just install a gnome kde de or lxde xfce4 enlightenment wm

23507563
int	chars
as mahonri moriancumer correctly identifies in his answer and indeed as keith thompson correctly identified and explained in his answer the problem with the calls to toupper is that the type you re passing is chars yet the functions expect an int

23507563
getchar	fgetc
the result of getchar getc or fgetc matches the specification of the argument type for the functions and this is not an accident

23507563
int	chars
the compiler assumes you won t pass out of bounds values if you use an int but if you use plain chars to hold chars such as ã u+00c5 latin capital letter a with ring above and plain chars is signed then you will be passing a negative value well outside the range of valid values

23507563
int	chars
simply casting a signed plain chars to int doesn t deal with the sign properly

23507583
