960028
getter	setter
rather use getter setter

960035
cpu	processors
assuming this isn t a question in reference to some crazy low end processors you take a tremendous speed hit to access memory outside of your cpu caches so unless you re algorithm is doing math on a very few numbers enough that they all basically fit within the l1 and l2 caches you re not going to notice any speed up from optimizing any of your arithmetic

960084
pdcurses	ncurses
if it has to be console only i would suggest using something like ncurses or pdcurses to create a text based interface

960111
ssl	https
if the browser is viewing an page in ssl through https then it ll request that asset with the https protocol otherwise it ll request it with http

960126
int	double
if all your math is in the int domain double and floats do exactly the same as int and also can be compared safely

960169
ant	maven
typically modules are stored in the same project as the main application but each app module is compiled into a separate swf either by flex builder or an automated build tool such as ant or maven

960173
bde	dbase
otherwise you can use .db files dbase - xbase bde should be able to handle them directly

960204
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
in foo a nullpointerexception is thrown if the caller passes in null whereas bar throws illegalargumentexception

960204
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
you throw nullpointerexception in foo but illegalargumentexception in bar

960211
put	get	post	put	post	get
method can have get post put and delete

960240
folder	directory
i have tried setting specific directory permissions for the sql server agent account on the databasebackups folder but still get the same error

960255
portrait	landscape
what i would like to do is be able to is have the main view load in landscape and the flipside view in portrait

960255
portrait	landscape
edit to clarify i want to lock the main view into only a landscape orientation and the flipside view into portrait - these views shouldn t be able to rotate

960287
put	get
you could put the binary value in an array lets say i 64 iterate through it get the power depending on its position and keep adding it to the double

960301
jobs	cron
i am developing an application on google app engine and was just checking out cron jobs

960332
put	get
i went ahead and set a var to the name i put the hashmap in the modelandview under top line but i m not sure if that s the right way to get at that object

960354
pascal	delphi
so if your read the original gof design patterns book you can easily apply its concepts to delphi 2009 and all its previous versions even some of turbo pascal

960369
onfocus	onblur	width	height
cant remember off hand if divs support onfocus and onblur but you could try making one div absolutely positioned to the top left where the width the body width and the height the body height then put another one on top of it which only covers the object in question then set an action to the big one s onfocus

960375
calloc	malloc
changing malloc to calloc in the texture2d source fixed the problem

960389
avr	microcontroller
i have encountered a problem in a c program running on an avr microcontroller atmega328p

960389
free	malloc
all malloc ing happens on startup and all free ing happens at the end of the application which in practice is never since the main part of the application is in an infinite loop

960470
profiling	instrumentation
i m looking for profiling techniques for evaluating and reducing image size waste in the same vein as shark and instrumentation help for run-time evaluation

960481
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
a crash in realloc or malloc or free can be triggered by writing past the bounds of a memory block -- and this can happen anywhere else in your program

960483
directx	directwrite
this will be fixed in beta 2 once wpf integrates with the directwrite code in the latest versions of directx

960501
put	get
currently it copies a file from the first fpt server to the local computer where it runs using ftp get and then copies it to the second ftp server using ftp put

960501
ftp	telnet
one idea is to create a java telnet session and and send a couple of ftp commands

960583
queue	fifo
to dequeue doesn t mean to release. it means pull off the queue of cached no-longer-in-use reusable cells. it s called dequeuing because it s a fifo queue of cells and you are pulling the first one off

960591
int	boolean
because it generalizes better to any number of columns with linearly growing instead of quadratically growing amount of coding it s even neater in sql dialects that don t require explicit casting of boolean aka bit to int but i m not sure if sql server is one of those

960594
pull	push
and rebasing commits is not okay cause i push to a bare repository which then has a hook that pull that to a working directory that is the testing server that is accessible by others

960609
cpu	processors
note also that using maximum cpu is generally a good thing especially on modern processors

960633
postgresql	mysql
i would use normal database say mysql postgresql firebird etc. on server

960688
spaces	delimiter
the spaces are interpreted as delimiter and the entries should be relative

960697
mouse	keyboard
3 do the same thing hooking the various mouse and keyboard emulation functions

960706
google-chrome	firefox
that works in firefox and google-chrome but not ie7 i don t know why

960716
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
take a look at the eventwaithandle manualresetevent autoresetevent classes

960720
entity-relationship	diagram
it can generate sql for several different databases as well as entity-relationship diagram and even code

960742
int	chars
then for array of int chars float you have the biggaray library a pointer p to an already-allocated c or fortran array can be wrapped and returned to caml as a big array using the alloc_bigarray

960754
calloc	malloc
make sure that all your variables have a default value and that all dynamic memory is zeroed out before you use it use calloc rather than malloc

960758
width	height
modifying width height seems really ugly because fixed sizes in wpf are almost always a wrong way to go and also it s absolutely unflexible

960774
sum	coalesce
i m pretty sure the linker will coalesce equivalent strings so the total will be less than the sum of the parts for these sections but i guess typically not by much

960853
put	get
you can put your class in a module and then you won t get the error because you ll be defining set within a namespace

960866
for-loop	arrays
it s trivially easy to construct a new arrays from an arguments object with a simple for-loop

960870
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately array.from and rest parameters are currently only implemented in newer versions of firefox and google-chrome check the browser compatibility table in the above links but you can use a transpiler like babel to efficently write es6 code with really low compatibility issues

960888
int	double
int to object or int to double

960895
int	double
your oggplayer is an iplay double not an iplay int

960895
int	double
you can t cast an iplay int to an iplay object or an iplay double to an iplay int like that

960907
int	double
note however that regardless the second will not work because there is no inheritance relationship between double and int

961015
super	self
you can use super description instead of self to avoid the infinite recursion like so

961033
post	get
there are a number of nasty little details around mez s post we don t get to see that would define the company s need more completely

961051
implements	extends
public class mainclass extends whateversuperclass implements whateverinterface

961054
width	height
the innder div is absolutely positioned to left 50 top minus the height of the div and has a margin-left of minus the width of the div

961068
svnadmin	visualsvn
you can just dump the repository from visualsvn with the standard svnadmin tools and load it into something else very easily

961150
getter	setter
the getter would work as a is also a b but the setter wouldn t work since the implementation expects an a while the interface allows you to set theobject to b

961159
firefox	safari
firefox and safari however simply ignore the comma

961183
addition	multiplication
what is important to note about the ackerman function is it essentially defines the heirachy of additive functions on the integers a 1 n is addition a 2 n is multiplication a 3 n is exponentiation a 4 n is tetration and after 5 the functions grow too fast to be applicable to very much

961183
addition	multiplication
another way to look at addition multiplication etc is

961217
put	get
i m a serial unfinisher - repeatedly i put very skeletal open source code out mostly on code.google.com and see if i can attract other developers to get synergy

961244
int	chars
chars whose int representations are in the range from zero through 31 are not allowed

961244
filesystems	ntfs
if you know that your program will only ever write to ntfs filesystems you can probably be sure that there are no other characters that the filesystems does not allow so you would only have to check that the file name is not too long use the max_path constant after all invalid chars have been removed or replaced by underscores for example

961312
put	get
so its better to put the validation inside foo even if it will get called repeatedly

961349
division	modulo
the modulo tells you the remainder of a division of two numbers

961352
division	modulo
it checks if the modulo of the division

961354
hash	md5
store them as md5 hash in the database

961377
hide	show
i then use animate instead of hide and show to try to solve the problem

961417
hide	show
may be you tool also have drawing setting to hide some part of the operation to reduce the width for instance to show or not the parameters or their direction their type etc

961435
consistency	acid
consistency in acid means only valid data will be written

961444
openbsd	freebsd
the freebsd openbsd sys queue is another good option for a generic macro based linked list

961458
xslt	schematron
jing supports pre-iso schematron validation note that jing s implementation is based also on xslt

961458
xslt	schematron
apply the skeleton xslt on your schematron schema to get a new xslt stylesheet that represents your schematron schema in xslt

961487
haskell	sml
pretty much all functional languages from the ml lineage miranda haskell ocml f# sml etc. don t require parentheses for function calls

961514
xslt	xquery
saxon sa supports streaming for xslt and xquery for details see

961542
gif	bmp
it loads jpg gif bmp etc

961558
client-side	server-side
this means that the debugging facilities of your ide are available to debug both your client-side gwt code and any server-side java code as well

961568
yslow	pagespeed
tools like yslow and pagespeed will give you suggestions about how to speed up the page both loading and rendering

961650
quicksort	heapsort
the stl sort may depend on the implementation but as wikipedia says it is usually introsort a combination of quicksort and heapsort

961662
quicksort	mergesort
in most cases quicksort will run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer

961701
hide	show
then i would hide show myradiobuttonlist.visible false true the list depending on some conditions

961707
for-loop	arrays
currently i am using a for-loop with 2 index variables for each arrays so only plus operations but all the managed arrays checks will not compare to a c pointer method

961725
put	get
in your example get a pointer to the alpha tag in all the xml documents and put the contents of all of them into a new document s alpha if they re not present there already

961779
put	get
i guess one way to do that is to get all apis exposed from the dll using dumpbin and put breakpoints on all those from windbg

961790
typedef	struct
use typedef with struct definitions so you don t need to scatter the struct keyword throughout the code

961817
haskell	ocaml
in functional programming languages ml haskell f# ocaml any function just has one argument - multi-parameter-functions are represented by passing tuples or currying

961817
lisp	scheme
lisp scheme don t need parentheses for their function calls too but there are many parentheses anyway

961882
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i tried to create an iphone application with uitabbarcontroller and some uinavigationcontroller inside it and faced the same problems as mamcx

961907
post	get
the reason for this is in respect to prg patterns where you have a get url and post url given that you post data and it isn t acceptable the server redirects you to the get and does some magic in order to send data to that get using most often session state to store a variable

961934
sqldmo	smo
you could use sqldmo obsolete to script them out or smo to do it

961942
vbscript	vb6
the answers covering 80386 assembler vb6 and vbscript have been removed

962049
actionscript	mxml
for flex you can only do mxml and actionscript although there s an option to compile c c++ code using alchemy

962092
keydown	keyup
it would propably be the easiest to extend the textbox class and add logic so that it behaves like a console respond to the keypressed keyup keydown events or similar

962138
gridview	objectdatasource
then gridview using objectdatasource will read this dropdownlist selected item and use it as select parameter

962164
vsto	add-in
see paul stubbs article how to create excel udfs in vsto managed code where he uses a vba add-in to expose vba udfs which in turn call his managed udfs written in vsto

962169
gprof	callgrind	valgrind	gprof	valgrind	callgrind
also to get a good understanding of the basic calltree during startup the initialization procedure you may want to consider using gprof or callgrind valgrind

962169
folder	directory
in addition i would recommend to directly start commenting the source code yourself by adding plain text files to each subfolder describing the contents of each code directory the purpose of each individual file and basically everything that s useful from a high level point of view to grasp the project s overall structure so that you can basically refer to some form of index file detailing the internal structure of each source code folder

962187
ssl	https
i m currently working on a php openid provider that will work over https hence ssl encrypted

962201
haskell	ocaml
the incredible type system aka haskell and ocaml praat is coming to you

962206
vmware	esx
optional set up vmware vsphere esx or find a hosting service that already has one

962220
super	extends
super t so we can add a rule for animal to a dog validator assuming dog extends animal

962225
dom4j	xom
this answer is part of my evaluation of xom which was suggested as one option in my question about the best java xml library to replace dom4j

962228
bazaar	svn
i m switching from svn to bazaar for my private projects

962240
post	get
you still need to make sure you send it via post request not get

962255
stdout	stderr
i want to continue using stdout so redirecting stderr into stdout is not helpful in this case

962268
stdout	stderr
redirected stderr to stdout stdout to dev null and then use the backticks or to capture the redirected stderr

962301
octal	binary
when converting from binary to octal it s more easy each 3 bits give you 1 digit in octal

962320
octal	binary
the ratio you noticed octal binary is log base 8 n log base 2 n 3

962339
int	chars
note that the worst case for the buffer size happens when you convert to binary which gives you a buffer size of 32 chars for 32-bit int

962352
hide	show
note that you could just as easily use create free instead of show hide

962357
post	get
one of the easiest ways to get people to contribute to a wiki is to actually have them provide contents in a wiki-suitable fashion so that whatever they post using their usual channels of communications newsgroups mailing lists forums issue trackers chat is basically suitable for inclusion on the wiki

962373
ubuntu	debian
if you don t want to use cpan to get the module both debian and ubuntu have a libnet-subnets-perl package

962399
vbscript	vb6
my issue with vbscript and vb6 is when i use them to script windows or office applications the right domain for them - i find myself struggling with the language they fall short of being the right tool

962399
vbscript	jscript
while there are certain things that work better with vbscript such as passing arrays back and forth from com objects is slightly easier although it is easier to pass event handlers into com components with jscript i am still surprised by the amount of coders that still use vbscript to script windows - i bet if they wrote the same program in both languages they would find that jscript works with you much more than vbscript because of jscript s native hash data types and closures

962399
vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6	vb6	vba
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages

962493
daemons	systemd
8 systemd administration commands and daemons

962510
fastcgi	scgi
the number one way to speed up your web application especially when you have lots of mostly-static modules classes and objects that need to be initialized use a way of serving files that supports serving multiple requests from a single interpreter such as mod_wsgi mod_python scgi fastcgi google app engine a python web server.

962601
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this works fine with firefox and ie but not with opera or google-chrome

962601
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome opera everything seems to work ok in script one

962601
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i now have it working in firefox ie and google-chrome but opera seems to refuse to load any .js files at all now

962610
stdout	stderr
on windows use eclipsec.exe instead of eclipse.exe to have build output written to stdout stderr and so that the call blocks until completion

962637
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome might be a little less messy than you re hoping for

962653
rss	feed
you could always subscribe to the rss feed or hit the main page and parse out this

962663
uitextfield	accessoryview
use the accessoryview property of the uitableviewcell which you can assign an arbitrary view to such as a uitextfield or uiswitch

962749
solaris	aix
i_recvfd is part of the streams extensions which are normally only present in system v based unixy operating systems aix and solaris for example

962753
kde	gnome
take a look at d-bus yes for windows too which is the modern spiritual heir of various componentry frameworks corba gnome bonobo kde s dcom

962758
put	get
you just loop through your list and put all elements smaller than your pivot at the beginning and all others at the end - which is not enough to get a sorted list

962770
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we ve seen huge leaps in javascript engine performance already from google-chrome safari and firefox

962806
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying is just multiplication and scale and propagate the integer overflow

962806
16-bit	64bit	unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
a number bigger than 64bit can never occur in a multiplication because c is an unsigned integer of 32 bits and k is a unsigned short of 16-bit

962806
integer	unsigned
if you try to multiplication an unsigned integer with unsigned integer you get another unsigned integer

962819
hide	show
if your not a 100 satisfied with the reportviewer s toolbar you can always hide it and show your own

962823
client-side	server-side
server-side classes can import client-side classes but not vice-versa usually

962823
client-side	server-side
finally we modify the getstocks method of the stockserviceimpl class so that it translates the server-side stock classes into client-side stockclient classes before returning the array

962843
mouse	keyboard
constructing a script effectively ruins your wrists as you re swapping between keyboard and mouse thousands of times an hour typing stuff into the the little config boxes and re-arranging your lines of code

962890
mergesort	heapsort	quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort
it s easy to see that mergesort does as it s symmetric but reasoning about something like bubblesort or more importantly quicksort or heapsort is not

962931
firefox	safari
the gwt team does not provide a list of unsupported browsers only supported browsers and it s a vague list at that most recent versions of internet explorer firefox and safari

962932
width	height
of course i made the width and height up so change as you require

962945
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
all the deprecated methods in java.util.date given the introduction of java.util.calendar - what a mess

962955
datamapper	activerecord
i am trying to use datamapper in a rails app as an alternative to activerecord

963017
equals	gethashcode
as for a generic equals and gethashcode there s a technique based on serialization that might work for you

963085
inherited	properties
the gwt.xml file used for development would inherited from the gwt.xml file used for production and set the user.agent properties as well

963090
datamapper	activerecord
however using datamapper in place of activerecord in rails why would this line

963110
put	get
for some reason anything i put into a textbox does not get saved

963124
objectdatasource	detailsview
i have an objectdatasource that i m binding to a detailsview control

963131
getter	setter
i m wondering if there are generic getter setter methods for the hashtable used in a class

glut	glui
opengl -- gives the win32 version of opengl glut glui

963214
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in ff3 ie7 ie8 google-chrome and safari win

963216
width	height
it seems that the final width or height passed in to arrangeoverride method is never less than the desired width or height returned from the measureoverride method

963229
hide	show
also most decent starter frameworks such as html5 boilerplate and modernizr will do this using css classes on the html tag so you have a global way to hide show content from your css file instead of using js

963310
innodb	myisam
both tables must use the innodb storage engine myisam doesn t support referential integrity constraints

963321
aptana	radrails
i have used aptana s radrails version of eclipse to debug a rails app as you describe--setting breakpoints and stepping through the code

963321
aptana	radrails
in aptana radrails i choose to debug the app

963334
width	margin
i don t understand how the width is 100 i would have expected to see some margin auto rule or width 100 specified somewhere in the css but i can t find it

963367
post	get
for a definitive answer you should try to track down david wang s current blog -- i don t have the rep to post links it s been a while since i last read his blog but if he s still active then you re going to get a much better answer from him he s one of the main iis developers at ms

963417
versioning	upgrade
now i upgrade it to 2010 versioning i wanna send it back to my friend so he should be able to use it

963418
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
one of the methods i came across while surfing the net was to have an intermediate page that shows the animation while loading the actual page using javascript location.href .so i figure use a couple of ajax calls from the intermediate page to a servlet to get the feedback.problem is it works fine in ie 6 7 and firefox 3.but the ajax callbacks dont seem to be getting executed in case of google-chrome and opera the location.href part seems to mess it up and the callbacks never get executed

963449
post	get
you could do this in one call by getting a whole html page as a response with the ajax get or post methods and carving up parts of it to dole out in the success callback function or if you wanted to do it for each piece of the page you wanted to update separately you could use jquery s load method

963488
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
if you haven t implemented division yet then that implies all you have is addition subtraction and maybe multiplication

963506
hide	show
the complete table is dynamically constructed in loop and only after that should the tabs should hide and show each of the table corresponding to each tab

963557
innodb	myisam
mysql supports a few different types of tables but the most commonly used are myisam and innodb

963557
innodb	myisam
myisam in mysql 5.6+also innodb tables are the types of tables that mysql supports for full-text indexes

963557
innodb	myisam
if this value is anything except myisam or innodb then mysql will throw an error if your trying to add fulltext indexes

963584
post	get
the code at the bottom of this post is an example of how to get this to work

963587
jsf	seam
to implemented proper layering i suggest you put your configuration in some kind of globally accessible bean instantiated by seam probably populated from a .properties file which you reference in your jsf pages

963595
onreadystatechange	onload
i workarounded this problem assigning onload event instead of onreadystatechange

963636
width	margin
i thought that if i define the width of the parent div then the unordered list should be able to center itself with margin 0 auto

963648
dom4j	xom
this answer is part of my evaluation of xom which is a strong contender in my quest for finding the best java xml library to replace dom4j .

963704
wav	riff
to start with refer to the windows api for dealing with riff files that s the file group for wav files.

963718

subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
i succeeded at making adding subtraction and multiplication work correctly but i am quite stuck at division

963764
fixed-point	fractions	integer	fractions

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
using the code below i tested in firefox opera google-chrome ie6 7 8

963879
mvp	presenter
this is a problem because you use mvp for decoupling view and presenter but this design makes them tightly coupled

963888
opera	firefox
get some inspection tool like firebug for firefox or dragonfly for opera and see which rules are applied to the box you want and its inner elements

963902
mp3	wav
if your input file is not wav or mp3 you will first need something that converts it to wav though

when a file is moved or deleted in svn submitting the code in perforce results with an error saying the file is missing and can t be committed

964098
pop-up	dialog
should pop-up a download this file dialog

964105
division	subtract
btw - the ordinary shift and subtract algorithm for division would work as well

964129
salt	md5
better approach to store md5 of username+password+email+salt in the database salt being random and stored together with the user s record

964152
rss	feed
i recommend you to check out the following frameworks and blogs the best ones from my rss feed

964156
inherited	properties
but for cases when indeed every entity of address class also has the same properties as name class inherited is acceptable

964218
temporary	tablespace
it uses temporary tablespace to store both data and possible indexes

964270

then maybe https with either ssl client certificates or http auth or http digest authentication

964307
post	get
if you use this controller method with just one html input you ll get error on form post with unchecked checkbox value of checkbox will not be posted and binder will not know what to use for value of isitemselected

964309

964407
aptana	rubymine
i can t speak for eclipse never worked well for me or aptana not tried but from experience i can say that both netbeans and rubymine will do what you want

964416
filtering	grouping
i know about view filtering but i really want hide the view completly from this grouping

964492
submit	submission
if the last semi-colon will cause you problems then strip it off just before submission the form by putting a handler on the submit button

964514
inherited	properties
if your control inherited from usercontrol or most other controls available you just need to set the dock properties to dockstyle.fill

964523
jgit	egit
the egit project is implementing eclipse tooling on top of the jgit java implementation of git much stable now

964541
int	chars
sometimes chars type is more usable than int - fixed size chars doesn t take much storage room and you can see enumerated values directly in database fields

964564
mouse	keyboard
update snipped since apparently you can t write global windows hooks in .net managed code except some low level mouse or keyboard hooks

964668
pascal	delphi
i love delphi and it has been my first choice as development languages ever since the day it replaced turbo borland pascal but nowadays the competition .net for example has become just as powerful to use

964824
iprincipal	iidentity
csla uses standard iprincipal iidentity authentication

964832
int	double
and when you are writing an excel project inside visual studio with the automatically generated proxy objects instead of the regular interop project you need to cast r.interior.color to a double and then back to an int

964869
kde	gnome
also colinux can be easily set up to run x11 and window managers like gnome kde so that you can for example use something like vnc to access your linux desktop

964902

you can implement your query as a class create a connection and prepare the query in the class constructor and then execute it in a method

965004
ftp	telnet
namely telnet into a machine and use the dos ftp client to pull some files over

965010

you shouldn t use the change event on radio button and checkbox

965066
pop-up	dialog
according to the selected item from suggestion list then pop-up a dialog with some input field

965105
post	get
if anyone else that reads this post is looking for similar guidance i d recommend the following resources to help you get up to speed more quickly

965151
inherited	properties
create a separate class to hold your data properties then do something like this.datacontext new myaddressclass . you ll notice that the datacontext propagates all the way down the control tree so that nested controls inherited their parent s datacontext as you d expect

965164
hide	show
and if i hide it this way it also doesn t show correctly afterwards

965211
config	ini
it keeps people from needing to remember what the various settings were named in the config files and even where config information is stored config file database registry ini file etc.

965226
paramiko	pexpect
unfortunately - while there are many approaches to solve that problem on unix-like operating systems such as pyexpect pexpect exscript and paramiko i doubt any of them works on windows

965253
rss	feed
rss feed is that the input text can

965254
put	get
i was impressed with the way that i could then use linq to entities to do creation - ef figures out that it must put some data in one table get the identity key value and use it in the other table

965310
int	chars
for example int addition would treat these bits as an int and print would treat them as a chars string

965310
int	chars
in forth for example while there are usually data types in memory what s on the stack which means what s actually being manipulated is stack entries rather than int or chars or whatever.

965313
imagemagick	libjpeg
basically imagemagick was only slightly slower than libjpeg

965342
packets	multicast
keep in mind though that you run the risk of dropped packets there is also the question as to whether or not all the machines on the network support multicast

965352
hash	md5
first you should probably stick with the md5 hash to fulfill your difficult to reverse requirement

965372
richfaces	icefaces
check out icefaces and richfaces for some good examples

965374
pop-up	dialog
i guess a better question should have been how do you create a timed pop-up in jquery...but anyway when i run my code it appears that my dialog appears for just a split second

965445
hide	show
each content class not object has its associated contenttype and contenttype basically holds some attributes that could be set using online form which then can be used in the views to show hide some of the content objects attributes

965454
ubuntu	linux
i m using ganymede on ubuntu linux and i have junit-4.3.1.jar in my build path

965489
superclass	subclassing
an object that extends a class will have memory allocated for the subclassing like normal as well as any methods variables used in the superclass

965489
superclass	subclassing
as a rule of thumb you can just think of a subclassing object containing all of the memory from it and all superclass

965519
post	get
get the variable from post or get

965539
inherited	properties
i m now investigating another possibility which is to create a fakeperson class which inherited from person but hides the properties with new read-write properties

965539
inherited	properties
my last solution of hiding the properties through inherited does in fact work however by using moq i get a standardized set of functionality that is more maintainable

965563
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
if you wish to pass the md5 hash of your salt key to des you should use some key compression technique

965563
hash	md5
for instance you could take the top 7 bytes somewhat undesirable or perform des encryption on the md5 hash with a known constant key and take all but the last byte as the key for des operation

965590
post	get
when i post my own headers which are required for an external server they then get prefixed my header batch_type shows up as http_batch_type

965641
width	height
note that i ve changed the parent relativelayout to a height and width of fill_parent as is generally what you want for a main activity

965686
post	get
when the form values are accessible via or which contains both post and get values

965709
inherited	properties
the css opacity properties is not being inherited although it may seem so

965709
children	parent
so if the parent has an opacity of 0.5 then visually all its children can only ever achieve that opacity no higher

965721
width	height
if i m reading your question right this is just a consequence of the way opacity works right now child elements inherit opacity as a range so the value of their opacity is normalised against the parent similar to how height width can work

965751
coalesce	isnull
for the remaining cases you can generally use functions like coalesce or isnull functions to return something that s easier to process

965757
command-pattern	mediator
you might also try having the gui give the mediator a callback object that handles retrieving return values or setting whatever values you need a version of command-pattern

965760
wxpython	pyqt
there are two gui toolkit for python which we know wxpython and pyqt

965764
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
at its heart pbkdf2 is combining salt and the password through via a hash function to produce the actual key

965769
inherited	subclassing
projects are just a way to create an assembly full of usable types - they don t in and of themselves inherited anything nor do they allow for subclassing etc

965803
hash	salt
also it s good practice to salt the hash with a value which is particular to the operation you are doing and won t change internal userid

965811
subtraction	addition
quotes are natural the same way + and - are natural for addition and subtraction

965844
width	height
it s essentially copying the x and y position height and width of your input and applying them to the autocomplete layer so that they match up visually

965851
int	chars
operands that are int constants ï oating constants enumeration constants chars

965867
perforce	svn
are the files in perforce also in svn

965867
perforce	svn
i suspect that may be some use for synchronising changes from svn to perforce

965869
gridview	repeater
please note that these linkbutton elements are not added to a datagrid gridview or repeater

965930
migrate	upgrade
if you can upgrade your crm 3.0 machine to 4.0 and make sure that it and your new system are at the same rollup level then you can migrate everything across

965938
serializable	deserialization
it stores native objects so there is no serializable deserialization steps involved

965972
submit	submission
the proper way of checking a form submission is to check the form s submit event not the button s click event

966025
post	get
we have a rest web service that uses post - to insert data into database unmarshall data from xml and get to retrieve data marshalled into xml

966077
put	get
i have servlet mapped on say servletpath after that i can put whatever i want and get my servlet responding depending on the rest of a path except when there is 2f in the path

966096
dreamweaver	aptana
i think i want to switch from dreamweaver to the eclipse based ide aptana

966107
int	chars
far better to use a surrogate key and yes a join on an int is often faster and you can join in delete staments in many databases not use the slower subquery especially since names tend to be longer than a few chars

966131
gif	bmp
this works for all files except for image files jpg gif bmp ect.

966208
subtract	add
but i can t write -1 or +1 to subtract add day like in sql

966229
dreamweaver	aptana
as aptana is based off eclipse you could basically choose whatever source control repository technology dreamweaver could support and install an eclipse plugin for that i would think

966272
pop-up	dialog
things i can immediately think of include pop-up calendars and modal pop-up dialog but there must be more.

966275
richfaces	icefaces
jsf with icefaces or richfaces come to mind

966291
post	get
mostly for ajax get and post here

966301
setinterval	settimeout
you should better use setinterval instead of settimeout

966312
hide	show
i use it for pre-loading more content than is actually show - if i have a tabbed page i load the contents of all tabs at once and then show hide the different sections and style the tab menus with css classes using jquery

966324
lapack	gsl
it draws from lapack blas and gsl gnu scientific library

966386
folder	directory	folder	dir
dir s b a-d lists all files at or below this folder s in bare format b excluding directory a-d

966407
hide	show
inside those functions you can show hide your indicator

966426
width	height
effectively giving it a height and width of 0 and behaving as if it doesn t exist

966459
spaces	delimiter
add a spaces or other delimiter only if a variable is set in order to avoid ugly unnecessary spaces

966470
for-loop	loops
this however has nothing to do with my answer a foreach loops creates an iterator so it shouldn t access the database 99 more times on the post they used a for-loop to access the first 100 items

966479
equals	gethashcode
and override the equals and gethashcode members

966597
coff	omf

966639
cpu	hyperthreading
make sure you test on a machine with multiple cpu cores or at least a cpu with hyperthreading

966662
free	malloc
memory allocated by malloc is free when the process ends

966674
free	malloc
malloc ed memory is definitely free when the process ends but not by calling free

966686
hash	md5
i think the best bet would chose a standard hash either md5 or sha1 to obtain a hash of your string and then to get an integer hash to a and that should convert your hash into a integer hash

966689
coff	omf
answer nicked out of metawindow faq - omf vs coff object file formats.htm

966689
coff	omf
coff object modules later became the defacto standard for all microsoft win32 development tools and gained an advantage in being much closer in format to portable executable files - the native executable format for win32 a coff-format linker has much less work to create a 32-bit exe or dll from a coff file than from an omf format file

966689
coff	omf
just as there are omf- and coff-format object files .obj s there are also omf and coff format library files .lib s

966689
coff	omf
to make things difficult however both omf and coff use the same file name extensions .obj and .lib to reference the two different types of object and library file formats because of this you can t just look at the file name extension to tell if the object module or library file is omf or coff

966689
coff	omf
the problem with mixing object files and library files from different compiler vendors is that some vendors support coff other vendors use omf and a few can handle both

966689
coff	omf
borland for example still uses omf object files and libraries while microsoft s 32-bit compilers produce coff format files

966689
coff	omf
watcom c c++ v11.0 seems to prefer coff when compiling and linking windows applications but generates omf object files for use with their dos4gw 32-bit protected-mode dos-extender

966689
coff	omf
along with this microsoft masm 6.13 produces omf files by default but with the coff switch can emit coff object files instead

966689
coff	omf
for example the microsoft visual c c++ linker is designed for coff format object files and libraries but will try to convert omf object files into coff files if necessary

966689
coff	omf
some dos extender and embedded system vendors such as phar lap provide their own linkers which support both omf and coff giving you a choice

966689
coff	omf
the bottom line is that mixing omf and coff object and library file types can be a mess plus the cryptic error messages from the linkers don t help

966689
coff	omf
unless your linker specifically supports it you should stick with recommended object and library format for your compiler linker platform and avoid mixing omf and coff files

966726
client-side	server-side
for a web developer it would be very common to work with a client-side and a server-side language every day such as javascript and java

966947
put	get
debugging user mode code from kernel mode is most definitely possible but is a bit more complicated - for instance to get a break in the process before it starts you need to put a breakpoint on the kernel s process creation code or on a ntdll s user mode code that first executes

966954
fseek	fread
by fread unless you call fseek or

966954
fseek	fread
in fact if you don t need to read anything from the file i would just use fseek in place of your call to fread

966991
width	height
first of all take a look at measuredwidth and measuredheight properties of uicomponent so all the controls and containers have these properties flex already measures required width height of the containers

967044
ienumerable	ilist
wcf service tries to return an ilist or ienumerable here here

967063

967105
post	put
you put your url after post

967114
cos	sin
if you pick a certain magnitude for the initial velocity u speed then you can write the x and y components of u as u cos a and u sin a respectively where u is the initial speed and a the initial angle

967129
mouseover	mouseout
have you thought about using mouseover and mouseout to simulate this

967129
mouseleave	mouseenter
also look into mouseenter and mouseleave

967147

java will have more libraries for random things like fetching rss feed

967356
activemq	rabbitmq
as an alternative to activemq mentioned above there is open-source rabbitmq

967377
getter	setter
what you are saying by defining your getter and setter in the abstract class is you must implement this if you want to inherit from me. then you are asking how can i made a derived class ignore this rule.

967377
getter	setter
the answer is that if you have a situation that every derived class needs a getter put that in the abstract class and let the derived class decide if they will implement a setter or not by leaving it out of the abstract class

967442
spaces	delimiter
assuming you know which primitive types you will be using you can loop through to form a single string using a spaces or whatever you choose as a delimiter then use the string.split method to split the string back out into a string array and finally loop through that array and cast its members to reproduce the original array

967463
postgresql	mysql
any input from people having dealt with similar problems is welcome -- i am not a mysql guy trying to batter postgresql into making all the same mistakes i am used to -- just dealing with data i don t have full control over

kde	gnome
b to be hosted in .net applications for automation similar to dcop in kde and how gnome is using corba

967705
put	get
in my opinion powershell as a shell is clearly intended as a replacement for cmd easy to see and windows script host windows script host didn t get much attention in recent years even though it had similar concepts as .net back in its day one platform multiple languages with activescripting but with .net microsoft basically put that to rest and resurrection probably wasn t an option for them

967776
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
this is working in ie6+ ff2+ and opera but for some reason there are huge gaps in safari and google-chrome like those two browsers are ignoring it and just applying regular breaks

setter getter on stripes action beans are used to allow the actionbean to receive the request parameters url parameters in the case of get requests form parameters in the case of post requests from the browser

968001
for-loop	arrays
reason i ask is because i need to run a for-loop inside the other function where the arrays is passed

968027
primes	modulus
in fact the only time a primes modulus fails to detect a single swap is when two equal indexes mod m are swapped and if m is big they must be far apart

968082
hash	salt
you use them for something like a password such that every time someone tries to log in you compute the hash of the password they tried to log in with plus a salt and compare that with your stored value

968087
touchescancelled	touchesended
this example doesn t take into account a number of things including the touchescancelled method and the relevant threading if you re always running some code i m not sure but you may never get the touchesended method to run - play with performselector afterdelay or performselectorinbackground

968089
des	aes
some common algorithms used in practice today are aes des and blowfish

968132
accessor	properties
from my understanding private would mean that the variable cannot not be used outside the class unless there is a accessor method or get properties

968164
hash	md5
use the md5 hash of a database table and modification date utc to determine if a table has changed

968244
virtualenv	setuptools
this is the structure pinax used for external django apps at one time but i think it s using virtualenv + pip instead of setuptools distutils now

968379
min	rank
and that will do group by of id and min rank and join back

968385
capitalize	capitalization
it looks like you have a capitalization issue - since your columns are capitalize activerecord will create capitalize attributes for you

968465
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
as written i m not sure that i understand the sequence of how the code would emulate a complete drag event - composed of mousedown mousemove and mouseup events

968591
inherited	properties
in linq to sql this can be done in the or designer by selecting the properties then in the properties window set inherited modifier to virtual

968612
client-side	server-side
so unless your company policy forces you to don t sign jars on the server side and keep common jars in signed and non-signed versions signed go to the client-side deployment non-signed go to server-side codebase

968640
bazaar	git
as for the first tool to choose problem with git bazaar and mercurial is they are distributed vcs s

968733
multicastdelegate	delegation
however only the system and compilers can derive explicitly from the delegation class or from the multicastdelegate class

968765
mantis	bugzilla
i ve personally switched from bugzilla into mantis and installed some plugins and found this more comfortable

968768
free	malloc
you need to either do malloc and free or pass buffer and its length to this function

968853
inherited	properties
you should define those properties as private only if you do not want them to be inherited

968873
implements	extends
i would also consider taking this a step further to implements a testable session solution that extends the system.web.httpsessionstatebase abstract class

968881
openssl	botan
for c++ your free and open source options seems to be to look into openssl or botan

968887
min	max
how to get a min and max column value for the modified date

968951
equals	gethashcode
overriding equals without overriding gethashcode is a bad idea and introduces a lot of complexity

969038
folder	directory
it will show you a list of every file and folder in your output bin-debug by default directory

969057
nfa	dfa
regular expressions at a theoretical level form the foundations of what a state machine is -- in computer science you have deterministic finite automata dfa and non-deterministic finite automata nfa

969158
min	max
you can further use min rownum or max rownum to get the first or last row for matt respectively

969189
xlsx	xlsm
the code previously implemented takes in the xls file saves it on to a column in a table using the stream i use the same method but the only change is the the file saved is a xlsm or an xlsx type file it saves to the column in the database

969189
xlsx	xlsm
here s the code to save the xlsm or the xlsx file

969200
int	chars
ishighsurrogate chars codepointat charsequence int and tochars int

969254
folder	directory
you are assuming that the program folder is the current directory

969263
principalcontext	userprincipal
from principalcontext you can instantiate userprincipal which includes permissions requests and i assume hopefully meet many of your requirements for building out a custom portal

969325
cvs	svn
the approach to migrate from cvs to svn is to use the cvs2svn tool

969325
cvs	svn
this migration tool assumes a one time action to convert the cvs repository to svn

969325
cvs	svn
during the conversion the cvs repository should be frozen and after which everybody should use the svn repository

969325
cvs	svn
the tool isn t suited for gradually moving parts of the cvs to the svn

969325
cvs	svn
it doesn t create a persistent record of which cvs version relates to which svn revision number

969342
hide	show
another way to put it would be write a javascript functions show commonimageid nexttoimageid and hide commonimageid nexttoimageid that would be used like show correct draggable1

969384
jqgrid	tablesorter
you can also look into jquery addons like jqgrid or tablesorter

969397
post	get
assuming you know how to load the pdf in to a byte array you ve got to get it base64 encoded and then post that to server using mime multipart encoding

969406
mathml	tex
but then i have to convert mathml to tex somehow wich is not so easy

969439
hide	show
instead of having multiple divs that you show and hide you can try this solution as well

969492
freebsd	linux
but a simple hello world application that just uses the console as output can be compiled on windows linux vms as 400 smartphones freebsd ms-dos cp80 and almost any other system for which you can find a c++ compiler

969524
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
keyedcollection does not implement neither inotifycollectionchanged nor inotifypropertychanged

969539
rsa	aes
rsa vs aes

969560
firefox	safari
browsers like firefox and safari are better at line numbers but they are generally pointless due to minification of the files

969571
des	rsa
then you need to decide whether you want symmetric think des shared key or asymmetric think rsa public and private keys and also think hard about key management because that is often the point of weakness

969580
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it displays fine across most browsers ie 6-8 firefox 2.x-3.5.x google-chrome safari but when i try to print the page i m having some cross-browser problems some work half some of the time and others don t work at all

969592
submit	submission
this way the value of the submit button will be ignored upon submission the form

969624
hid	keyboard
this could be based on for instance the microsoft keyboard hid driver

969629
hide	show
you then use jquery to hide and show different parts of the form and when the final section is show the entire form is posted in one post to the server

969660
mouse	keyboard
in addition you need a monitor with dvi a usb mouse and usb keyboard

969677
rsa	aes
as for encryption algorithm rsa is a very different type of algorithm to aes and twofish see

969690
width	height
this returns the correct values for both width and height

969690
width	height
however in ff3 width gives the correct value but height is always zero

969709
disk	ram
in future these lists may be read from disk and larger than available ram

969771
rss	feed
this sets the proxy for the rss feed in particular

969771
rss	feed
it will apply to all rss feed you read as well as all other http communicatious going out from your app

969795
put	get
to get started all you need to do is download the xalan jar s from here and put them in your project s classpath

969822
post	get
if you wanted to you could just get your google calendar s xml data as per mickey s example in the accepted post above process it in your server-side language of choice and feed the calendar control with that data

969838
min	max
exactly i need min value and max value for the modified date

969881
many-to-many	one-to-many
the problem is not made any better by the fact that linq to sql does not support many-to-many relationships directly and in reality assuming that your lookup table only defines a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship you d have to do something like

969884
icmp	tcp
a typical implementation will use icmp echo requests if the privilege can be obtained otherwise it will try to establish a tcp connection on port 7 echo of the destination host

969902
ant	maven
integration it s done for both maven and ant

969922
hide	show
if you are ok with validating multiple steps at once tomas lycken s suggestion hide show with jquery would give a fast step by step experience

969939
glog	gflags
glog gflags and boost asio

969945
onmouseover	onclick
you may also want remove event handlers like onmouseover and onclick etc

969985
google-chrome	firefox
i have the following css code works fine with firefox google-chrome but breaks like hell when i run it in ie7

970025
msg	eml
i store each msg in separate eml file

970130
onclick	onchange
the same problem was with every href attribute and the html.actionlink pretty much solved most of it but i still dont know how to route onchange or onclick

970169
inherited	properties
where car and bike presumably have a common root vehicle in the xsd but their own specific properties on top of the inherited ones

970174
nofollow	noindex
you should also see the meta tags with noindex and nofollow

970180
dictionary	map
is it possible to map parent products to dictionary so that i can do

970194
vimeo	flickr	youtube	vimeo
you can specify the allowed tags attributes via the allowed member variable the following code sanitizes embed code from sites like youtube vimeo flickr etc

970256
inherited	properties
also the properties in the inherited class should be marked overrides

970282
bitarray	bitvector
there are a few modules that can help such as bitvector bitarray and bitstring

970292
vim	emacs
c-x 3 emacs and vsplit vim are great for multiple separate views into the code but i d like it to flow from one column to the other like text in a newspaper

970325
stdout	stderr
tshark should send its output to stdout and only for some strange reason would it send it to stderr

970340
int	chars	int	double
the numeric types are the integral types byte short int long and chars and the floating-point types float and double

970382
post	get
with the above code i get the following compiler error from vs2008 this is only the first few lines of 160 in total which i think is a bit too much to post here

970389
post	get
you can add more get variables or you can post data with this

970437
put	get
use collections.list results to put the results in a list and then use list.size to get the count and iterate over the list

970478
width	height
get width 2 and height 2 of the rectangle then using system.graphics.measurestring to get the dimensions of your string again half them and subtract from your earlier width height values and you end up with the x y coordinate to draw your string at in order for it to be centered

970557
pull	push
you have to push to php instead of pull from swf meaning your flash movie has to report its lso s state if it changes

970574
post	get
on the api call you should pass the server the last updated time as a get or post parameter

970621
lxml	elementtree
i would normally recommend lxml but since that uses a c-library libxml the alternative would have to be as aaron has already suggested elementtree as far as i know there is both a pure python and a c implementation of it available

970640
post	get
this is typically necessary if you are not doing a post but a get

970673
super	extends
one of the issues with building a map is that it will not support subclasses unless you register them specifically or extends your get function to look up super classes specifically

970687
post	get
yes but you might want to make sure that when using this code you check that the request method is post if you are going to change anything as a consequence of the request rather than treating get and post as the same thing

970697
public	protected
you could use an internal or protected modifier for the constructor instead of public

970817
rss	feed
we are pulling in an rss feed that could potentially have anything in it

970819
rar	zip
i am writing a set of classes rar zip and trip

970819
rar	zip
2 write zip rar and trip classes

970848
ssl	https
the transmission protocol used is https ssl

970849
gridview	repeater
another option would be to put a templatefield that contains the bindable control repeater another gridview etc. you choose to use and binding the datasource property to the attendees property of your business object

970849
listview	gridview
also i don t if you re married to the idea of using a gridview but in cases like these where you need more control of the layout i would suggest the new listview .net 3.5 control or lately i ve just been using nested repeaters so i can have more refined control of the layout i am trying to generate

970855
inherited	subclassing
inherited itself will do you well and it will help to have a base archive class if there are a number of methods common to your subclassing

970965
codeigniter	kohana
given that kohana is a fork of codeigniter you ll maybe fix with this

970976
serializable	deserialization
for total control over serializable and deserialization implement java.io.externalizable instead of serializable

971001
post	get
get is generally used for display purposes while post is used for admin purposes adding editing items confirming choices etc

971001
post	get
there may also be a slight security problem someone could like to a page using get parameters and force execution of something like deleting data - actually this can be done with post from an external html form but is much less common

971027
children	parent
each node of the tree needs to know both who it s parent is and who it s children are

971027
children	parent
the fields used to track each nodes parent and children are not accessible outside the base node class

971088
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog box that pop-up type in

971106
jquery	scriptaculous
i am using a combination of prototype and scriptaculous to implement a lightbox effect in my asp.net page.i have also jquery included in my page.i have several div tags in my page but after including the prototype file in my head of the page i am not able to read the divs in my javascript using jquery

971149
disk	ram
if you can t physically load all the data into ram then you re going to have to deal with having some on disk

971149
disk	ram
obviously when you run out of ram then some of the data will be on disk when you query for it but depending on the load on the system this will only be an issue for the first keypress not the subsequent ones as the row will be in memory after that

971158
maven	pom.xml
what i m looking for is some way in the maven pom.xml to direct the assembly plug-in to get the correct version of those two files

971168
client-side	server-side
onpagechanging is a server-side event and jquery is a client-side library

971189
folder	directory
mac apps are folder that you copy into the applications directory

971225
folder	directory
will list the changes associated with the specified revision so you could process the output of this command to help copy the desired files to somewhere after checking out a working folder for the full directory

971239
width	margin
otherwise it defaults to the full width of the page and the auto margin for the left and right get set to 0

971239
width	text-align
if you want the footer bar to take up the width like the stackoverflow notice bar and center the text then you need to add text-align center to your definition

971240
post	get
i would recommend keeping both post and get vars since you can t predict how they are going to be used

971311
accessor	properties
properties are new in objective-c 2.0 and provide auto accessor generation

971314
getter	setter
since you appear to be using nsviewcontroller i assume you re on leopard os x 10.5 in which case you should probably be using property and the synthesize d getter setter if possible

971322
serializable	deserialization
2 use some serializable deserialization into one hidden field

971343
post	get
that way your view markup stays simple but you still get the pre post state tracking in your post info

971369
post	get
i can read get using oauth just fine however when i try to send a status update via http twitter.com statuses update.xml using a post it returns a 401 with the following xml

971424
superclass	subclassing
what does need to happen is that the subclassing constructor should call some appropriate superclass constructor

971474
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
tested safari 4.0 firefox 3.6a1pre camino 2.0b3 opera 10.00b1 mac

971478
mysql++	soci
i found mysql++ and soci to be pretty interesting and i would like to know which one you guys prefer and why

971525
put	get
because there s no content at all haml fails to put in an end declaration so when the file gets interpreted you get

971567
concave	convex
i don t think spaces could be convex or concave in general.

971576
firefox	safari
first time i tried safari s debugger at least i think it was safari--i was going through all the debuggers to see if they had caught up with firefox it made me so angry i haven t tried it since

971584
concave	angle
for every pair of conjoined faces if the angle between them is obtuse the volume is concave

971622
stdout	stderr
to redirect stderr to stdout we use 2 1

971628
profiling	debugging
as a workaround i just defined my debugging build to also use the development profiling

971690
width	height
i disagree i have been able to set select width and height using css with something like this

971719
button	checkbox
but to have it set up that it will not go to the next page unless the checkbox is checked you would have to know the button that is clicked to go to the next page lets say the button id is button1

971788
cvs	svn
i think it s possible that you re using the term check out here in its cvs sense that is an svn update

971800
versioning	upgrade
it looks like you need to upgrade xcode to the newest versioning of the sdk as well as your iphone ipod touch to the newest versioning of the sdk

971825
jtree	jtable
i am not sure if this is what you are looking for but there is a two part tutorial from sun on creating tree tables which is essentially a jtable with a jtree renderer in the first column

971847
post	get
in a similar vein to what ammoq suggested i don t have enough karma to comment on their post - instead of laws have documented code standards. it s a lot of work but a non-confrontational way to get everyone on board with better code quality

971848
pull	push
i bleieve you may need to push the schema changes from the publisher as opposed to attempt to pull them from the client

971856
mouse	keyboard
it s nice because once you have the user set up the client software you can arrange with them a time to leave their pc unattended so that you can remote in and take a look with the option to disable local keyboard mouse and monitor access

971923
versioning	upgrade
however if you are going to be updating content frequently then you can either upgrade to the latest versioning of any popular cms preferably joomla or drupal

971952
backtracking	greedy
since s can never match w and visa-versa possessive quantifiers and ++ can be used instead of the usual greedy ones which will avoid prevent any potential backtracking

972006
kate	kde
right now i m using the eclipse ide with the automatic workspace refresh option and kde 4 s kate as my text editor

972006
ant	maven
i looked at ant and maven though haven t employed either yet i ll also need to spend time solving #3 and #4

972006
maven	buildr
update 2 - from benchmarks i ve seen daniel spiewak is right that buildr s faster than maven and if one is doing incremental changes maven s 10 second latency gets annoying so if one can craft a compatible build file then it s probably worth it.

972033
spaces	delimiter
if you define words as sequences of characters delimiter by spaces .

972056
hide	show
when i tried in google chrome the show hide text would toggle but the embedding widget doesn t show up

972074
postgresql	mysql
it s supported as a vendor extension to sql by mysql postgresql and sqlite

972111
short	base
the increase occurs because ntfs base the short file name on the first six characters of the long file name

972169
width	height
it can be tricky moving items absolutely if one does not know the height and width

972203
spaces	delimiter
this method can handle more delimiter than spaces by the regex being used

972342
puts	fflush
this will work better if you use puts which will append a newline terminator if there is not already one at the end of the line forcing a buffer fflush

972366
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works fine for google-chrome 2.x ie8 and opera 9.64 but not on firefox 3.0.9

972383
daemons	systemd
as mark clarified it s a linux systemd the script could easily make itself fully independent a daemons by following this recipe

972408
windows	wow64
you need to compile your app as 64bit binary or run it under an emulator like wow64 on windows

972429
hash	salt
a secret salt value and then hash the

972432
google-chrome	firefox
tested in latest version of google-chrome ie and firefox

972442
profiling	debugging
install zend studio which is an excellent php ide check the features page and makes debugging and profiling very easy

972443
pop-up	dialog
i have a dropdown with some products and i want to give the user the ability to add a new product so when they select add new it will pop-up a dialog and when they are done it will insert the new product into a table in the database

972499
vbscript	jscript
in fact in its early days it was done with with vbscript and jscript and just called dhtml

972515
hide	show
based on the linq results you can hide the datagridview and show some other control like a literal or something that show the message

972552
dsl	mvel
we are adding simulation and testing for this using an mvel dsl which we believe will be a huge hit

972596
int	double
primitives such as int double etc structs and strings string are an exception to these but works similar are allocated on the heap so things work a bit different

972607
folder	directory
instead i made a folder in my user directory instead

972652
postgresql	mysql
the application is developped with php and zend framework database should be mysql or postgresql

972730
inherited	subclassing
i think for such classes designed for inherited and used as build blocks of application based on some framework definition of behavior should be more abstract - leaving some details to subclassing even if class itself is not abstract

972730
superclass	subclassing
subclassing should be different is some way from superclass otherwise it does not make sense to create subclassing

972730
superclass	subclassing
and you always can abuse this difference and write a program that works for superclass and fails for subclassing

972737
post	get
when i click the get date button i saw the date flash on the screen for a second but since the whole page is loading it disappears and when i view it in firebug i see it is doing the post but quickly disappearing

972751
vmware	virtualbox
i m currently using virtualbox and vmware and this does not look good enough for me correct me if i m wrong the hard drives could lock for instance either because two virtualized machines run on them or because all hard drive access is channeled through the same hdd controller

972781
jobs	cron
i considered having a cron job that polled my twitter account every few seconds but i think google appengine only allows cron jobs once a minute

972816
put	get
to get sub-elements in a xsd complextype you have to put a xsd sequence in it first level along with annotations and attributes wich states that you want well.

972848
put	get
i get some results which are not relevant to me but anyway but if i put

972855
width	height
now a lot of the objects in xna such as a graphics device and such inste3ad of containing a vector2 that tells you the size of the viewport they offer separate width and height methods

972864
google-chrome	firefox
firefox for example is using cairo internally - google-chrome is making use of the skia engine see here

972876
x86	64bit
intel has an implementation of openmp that works with their c++ and fortran compilers for x86 64bit clusters

972905
hide	show
yes but you need additional javascript that will show hide the silverlight app

972978
firefox	safari
if you stick to built-in widgets and composites your applications will work similarly on the most recent versions of internet explorer firefox and safari

972984
maven-assembly-plugin	pom.xml
note in my pom.xml file excerpt above i specify maven-assembly-plugin version 2.2-beta-3 which was the latest at the time of writing

972985
width	height
the goal is to expand to the viewing screen with the nav fixed by width and top fixed by height ideally without javascript

972993
maven	cargo
when we deploy to test and prod i would like to use maven cargo plugin and specify the version to deploy to these environments

973004
x86	64bit
i m trying to run a 32 bit application built as x86 on a 64bit machine

973054
hide	show
anyway what i want to do is have a treeview in the first column of a gridview using wpf which can expand and collapse and that will show hide the row it belongs to pretty much something like this the demo is for asp.net i want to be able to do the same in wpf

973055
yacc	bison
flex lex and bison yacc are two good tools to develop such things

973083
google-chrome	firefox
you could also just recommend google-chrome or firefox

973093
folder	directory
directory path to 123 folder doesn t exist

973113
folder	directory
the problem is that bash performs tilde expansion before shell parameter substitution so after it substitutes path to folder for it doesn t try to expand the so it looks for a directory literally named with a tilde in it which of course doesn t exist

973229
folder	directory
my current implementation has a function to find the latest file in a folder that conforms to a file mask cjl .log and uses 2 anonymous classes one to filter a directory listing and another to sort a list of files based on modifieddt

973247
rss	feed
xml is application xml and text xml but there are also specific variants like application xhtml+xml application svg+xml and application rss+xml that ll you ll need to decide whether to override the default behaviour catching these would break xhtml rendering svg images and rss feed respectively

973277
required	placeholder
this solution required a placeholder symbol # not occuring in the input

973278
spaces	delimiter
you can use stringtokenizer to enumerate over your string with a spaces delimiter and in your loop you can add your prefix onto the current element in your enumeration

973293
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
if you re unwilling or unable to use private apis there s an open source bsd license library called asihttprequest that provides a wrapper around the lower-level cfnetwork apis

973320
filesystems	ntfs
the historical reason for this is that the underlying ntfs filesystems supports alternate resource streams that can be accessed with names like yourfile.txt hiddendata.txt

973320
filesystems	ntfs
there is also a limitation in current versions of asp.net that incoming urls need to map to the ntfs filesystems for purposes of determining managed configuration data

973341
put	get
i unzip i get some folders i then put these extracted folders in to another folder and zip it back

973342
spaces	delimiter
a spaces is the delimiter

977577
width	height
1 after changing the size of the frame by using the mouse and executing the drawframe method a rectangle is drawn as intended but the frame expands a little after drawframe method is executed more than the size it was changed using the mouse.this is because i suppose the width and the height obtained through frame.size includes even the border size.so when mycanvas.setsize width height is executed mycanvas expands to size of the frame which includes the border size also

right now these constants are initialized by a function float2fixed whereby in floating-point it does nothing while in fixed-point it finds their fixed-point representation

978547
floating-point	fixed-point
for instance 0.5f stays 0.5f if working in floating-point whereas it uses the pow routine and becomes 32768 if working in fixed-point and the fixed-point representation is qx.16

978613
min	max
here we ve passed two additional bits of state into min and max - but we can t define to know about that as that is a caller detail

978619
hide	show
now you can add a tag to a button or link to hide and show the modal panel

978644
folder	directory
for example if there is a sub folder named test it enumerates everything inside test but doesn t finish enumerating the files inside the original directory specified

wicket	smartgwt
just as a counterpoint to the poster above who mentioned troubles with wicket the smartclient forums forums.smartclient.com have reports of success integrating smartgwt with a wide variety of other technologies

978648
wicket	smartgwt
this poster s problems sound like 1 a gwt bug causing bad javascript and 2 css naming conflicts between smartgwt and wicket probably neither framework s fault

978658
put	get
if you put it at the start you ll get an error on reading beyond the beginning of the ram

978700
inherited	properties
the best way is to create your own event arguments class that inherited from eventargs and expose it as a properties there

978708
fadein	hide
it looks like hide and fadein are being applied to not the

978729
free	malloc
this is also an improvement over traditional memory management malloc free or new delete which left it up to the operating system to manage any memory fragmentation

978731
fadein	hide
instead construct your item first and apply the hide fadein before adding it

978741
ready	each
my current strategy is to fire off an asynchronous call beginexecutenonquery with each record when it s ready

978770
ant	maven
there is nothing like it msbuild is not like maven msbuild is like ant

978781
width	height
the landscape setting should automatically do the translation of height and width

978865
put	get
the only approach i ve thought of so far is to put a special row into the table model that always get sorted to the bottom

978885
width	height
adjust width height of iframe to fit with content in it

978945
passenger	thin
also with workling you don t have to use starling as the queue it also uses amqp stuff but this is more easily integrated into an environment that uses eventmachine like thin or evented mongrel so if you are using passenger it s a bit more difficult

978975
subtract	add
if it is the end of the month add one day add one month subtract one day.

978979
post	get
the html is getting a little broken when i post but i think you get the point

979001
firefox	safari
i tried loading the equivalent html js into both firefox and safari and it was fine

979008
google-chrome	safari
air is more like safari and google-chrome

979008
google-chrome	safari
air uses webkit and it s a bit behind safari and google-chrome in the webkit version

979079
min	max
you write a query that returns both the min and the max

979079
aggregate-functions	sum
you use an aggregate-functions such as avg or sum where no row has that value

979197
min	max
with the above class when setting min or max you need to synchronize

979198
boost	stl
boost libraries tend to be very complicated as they try to follow strict programming standards and styles for them to be compatible with things like the stl

979208
udp	tcp
you should be able to see all the kerberos requests ap-req ap-rep tgs-req tgs-rep using wireshark on the client tcp or udp port 88

979234
centos	linux
red hat linux or centos you want several of the mingw packages from see epel how-to then yum install mingw32-binutils and mingw32-gcc-g++ at minimum

979255
width	height
x 0 y 0 width 0 height 0 - button4 was scrolled out of view

979255
width	height
x 211 y 36 width 25 height 13 - button4 was scrolled so the upper left corner was visible

979255
width	height
x 161 y 36 width 75 height 13 - button4 was scrolled so the top half and entire width was visible

979255
width	height
x 161 y 26 width 75 height 23 - button4 was scrolled to be entirely visible

979255
width	height
note how in addition to the width and height changes that the x y also changed with scrolling

979275
integer	fractions
the problem is the integer division in the innermost part of the expression which truncates the value omitting the fractions part

979275
multiplying	multiplication
since m_pi is a floating point number and multiplication in c is left-associative meaning it proceeds from left to right the first multiplication 2 m_pi will be promoted to a float as will each successive multiplying

979275
multiplying	add
to get the correct range you d want to add 1 then multiplying by 50

979281
width	height
it will accurately reflect the field s new height and if you change the field s width the height will immediately be updated etc

979342
firefox	safari
if your users are using bleeding-edge browsers and if firefox 3.5 and safari 4 support it i don t know that either do will you could adjust the css color-profile attribute of the image setting it to a grayscale icc profile url

979414
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade to the latest versioning 143 the exact same code worked

979440
jobs	cron
that being said it may be more practical to use something like daemons to manage a background process that goes to sleep now and then than to rely on something like cron to kick off jobs

979445
firefox	safari
this works in firefox safari but not on ie

979460
hide	show
if you want to replace them with spans then use the same technique to show hide their span counterparts

979553
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to dbartisan 8.5 and have seen significant performance improvements over the previous versioning

979585
xmltype	clob
but if it is xml why store it in a blob rather than an xmltype or clob

979592
pull	push
so the data that will be processed is what is being acted upon in either case and the direction push pull it is moving is relative to the person triggering the processing

979617
getter	setter
i m following all of the necessary conventions for getter and setter as far as i know.

979650
pull	push
push pull really is poor terminolgy though

979651

ssl https traffic between their

979659
hide	show
implement it using if-else conditions for each department and show and hide input controls as per department

979677
folder	directory
search path sounds like a folder directory name so i am not sure what this option is good for

979740
put	get
you can put words that you get from the text file into a hashset and the ones you get from the ricktextbox1 to another hashset and intersect them

979807
mechanize	hpricot
using mechanize hpricot nokogiri in ruby

979834
versioning	upgrade
a lot of compaines may have have some versioning of flash installed but may not allow the user to upgrade or install anything that has not been vetted by the it department

979852
bmp	png
if your original image is a bmp then converting it to png and then uuencoding the png file will result in a considerable shrinking in filesize

979881
ubuntu	linux
for this reason as well as that some gnu linux distributions ubuntu in my case still comes with python 2.6 i can t completely throw 2.x out the window yet

979893
mouseup	mousedown
have to use mousedown and mouseup to check if these two events happen on the same element

979893
mouseup	mousedown
if mousedown and mouseup happen on the same element a new window opens so you ll know that your link was clicked

979899
vb.net	vb6
i have a few vb.net programs to maintain that have been ported from vb6 and use the old style unstructured exception handling

979933
updatepanel	scriptmanager
if it is not for high performance you can use an updatepanel otherwise you should just use the scriptmanager by yourself

979956
implements	extends
i ve noticed that on all the examples that illustrate the decorator pattern there is a base class interface and there is a decorator class that inherits implements it after which all the decorated classes extends the decorator class

979974
maven	pom.xml
in the maven pom.xml if i change the org.hibernate dependency to be -

979987
rss	feed
i follow high scalability rss feed

980058
webkit	gecko
i think the best way to do this for my requirement is to use a rendering engine - like webkit or gecko

980066
nunit	mstest
use nunit or mstest to achieve this functionality in a more graceful way

980100
inherited	properties
a process group is a properties just a number which you can set before forking and child processes then inherited it automatically

980151
put	get
if you re still worried about security you can get your own boxes and put them in a co-location facility but then you have to worry about administration security yourself

980235
spweb	spsite
the spfeaturereceiverproperties in the featureactivated override has the current spweb or spsite as spfeaturereceiverproperties.parent

980254
gtk	motif
jcolorchooser has a recent-color panel in some look feels motif but not in others gtk

980259
pascal	delphi
turbo pascal was one of the if not the main compilers of the dos era and delphi is still the second most sold ide in the world after visual studio so i think the dead language and teaching language bits are a bit exaggerated

980260
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
updated isn t declared in the headers for nsmanagedobject or nsobject so i guess it must be a private method

980319
equals	gethashcode
as several other answers have stated sorteddictionary doesn t override the default implementations of equals or gethashcode

980321
int	double
fenton a jet date field is an int value for the day plus a decimal value for the time -- no an ace jet datetime column is a float synonyms double float8 ieeedouble number with limits the maximum datetime value is #9999-12-31 23 59 59# though the maximum float value that can be cast to datetime will be a little larger

980328
equals	gethashcode
no this is not how the equals and gethashcode methods are implemented

980350
post	get
something the blog post doesn t mention once you ve set your project to use iis rather than webdevwebserver and set the override url s you sometimes have to do something extra to get debugging working

980371
findwindow	showwindow
in general terms you could call findwindow to get the hwnd of the window in question then showwindow with sw_hide to hide the window

980376
sorting	filtering
but my advanced search may include joining mytable with category table geographic_location table for searching within 10 20 miles etc filtering by someother criteria and of course sorting of search results

980398
xslt	xquery
if you do the above the parser will return you the ordered list without any further work and or you can process it more easily using standard xml tooling like xslt xquery etc

980513
children	parent
the parent partial view simply contains renderpartials for the children

980521
cpu	processors
with a single-core processors where all your threads are run from the one single cpu the idea of implementing a critical section using an atomic test-and-set operation on some mutex or semaphore or etc in memory seems straightforward enough

980566
pop-up	dialog
if it is a complex application with sub-panels lot of pop-up dialog menus mdi behavior with docking etc. it might be hard to impossible to port.

980679
punctuation	words
it will search up to the first 10 words or so and doesn t handle case punctuation or multiple spaces properly but it should give you an idea of an approach you can take

980693
tinyint	varchar	tinyint	boolean	int	boolean
id is int name varchar all other tinyint 1 boolean that is

980702
division	modulo
i think using a native modulo in c internally uses a division operation which is costly on the processor i am using. no div instruction

980718
for-loop	loops
this is just an example of where i am finding the problem txtfile.txt has 5 lines so the for-loop goes 5 times each time test gets +1 to it and the a displays the correct value of x but the last echo on the for-loop displays 0 which is what test is set to before loops

980718
folder	directory
here is what i want to accomplish as there may be an easier way i want to run a for-loop that findstr s all rtf s in a series of sub folder and copies them all to a all directory with a new name 1.rtf 2.rtf 3.rtf etc

980723
post	put
this doesn t work for me i would not expect a different behavior regarding use of culture if i post a value or put it in the querystring

980725
free	malloc
there are tools like electricfences that replace malloc and free and take advantage of the mmu but those are intended only for spot-checks .

980811
implements	extends
use it with implements and extends build a jar from your classes and import them into your spring project

980831
versioning	upgrade
there could be good reasons why these sites haven t upgrade -- such as compatibility with other plugins that don t work with newer versioning

980831
versioning	upgrade
either they can upgrade their page most likely since the older versioning is probably being used due to inertia or drop your plugin

980852
multiplication	modulo
since you want the modulo by a constant you can probably beat it by using reciprocal multiplication

980884
hide	show
then create an onchange event on the insuredsalicense2 listbox which hide the not important field and show the important one

980898
hide	show
on the following site i have used jquery on the menu to show and hide options projects and contact

980911
decltype	auto
visual c++ 2010 beta has some useful c++0x support - you can play with lambdas rvalue references auto decltype

980929
udp	tcp
as for a protocol you should use either tcp ip or udp depending on what you need to do

980929
udp	tcp
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag

980932
post	get
from the quickbase guide there are two methods of hitting the api post and get

980932
post	get
i can handle the get calls but some api methods require xml to be sent over post

980937
firefox	safari
the test runs as expected in firefox and safari

980951
google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome and firefox

980952
fadein	fadeout
however the default methods fadein fadeout seem to use display none which removes the buttons from the flow

980962
division	multiplication
on many processors integer multiplication is faster than integer division

980962
division	multiplication
this blog post shows how to replace a constant integer division with a constant integer multiplication

980977
datediff	difference
datediff can get you the correct data difference between 2 dates

981027
pull	push
i ve contemplated adding support for components to be either push pull both

981027
pull	push
i m looking for responses regarding the merits of push vs pull vs both hybrid

981060
button	checkbox
i have just been tasked with changing this to be three checkbox and having the ok button disabled until all three boxes have been checked

981156
hex	binary
clipspy unfortunately the only workable multi-format viewer clipspy shows me the string data wrapped every 10 characters and expands the hex and binary views which i m not concerned about

981198
google-chrome	safari
i have a weird issue that only occurs in safari and i can only assume google-chrome as well since they both use webkit

981198
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this works great in firefox ie 6 7 8 and opera but for some reason on safari windows and mac versions the add_endrequest ... does not always fire

981198
hide	show
this is a show stopper for me because not only does the processing request... message appear but i also put a transparent div on top of the entire page to prevent multiple clicks after submitting so the page becomes unusable unless you know how to hack the css to hide the transparent div

981235
children	parent
if you iterate through the parent itemcontrol s visual children recursively you shouldn t have any difficulty locating the text boxes you are seeing on screen

981273
children	parent
model nodes build a 1 n tree each component except the root has 1 parent and 1..n children

981273
children	parent
data flows almost exclusively from parent to children

981273
children	parent
parent nodes don t need much any information about their children

981281
organization	naming
it sounds like you re also facing apathy within your own organization if they are uncooperative about even naming the tool

981289
ilist	icollection
i believe that if you call linq.count on either an icollection or ilist like an arraylist or list then it will just return the count property s value

981300
groupbox	panel
using visual studio 2008 winform designer i have a container form panel groupbox whatever and some controls in it

981337
ienumerable	ilist
i would recomend returning objects or ienumerable ilist etc of objects

981366
opera	firefox
it works well in firefox and ie8 but when i ctrl+click in opera new dialog save as appears which causes saving the clicked image

981383
post	get
selects use of get or post

981409
folder	directory
and folder using active directory

981452
spweb	splist	spweb	spsite	splist	spsite
the audit is a property available on the spsite spweb splist and spitem properties

981469
ssl	https
in practice you could use https ssl tls to protect your saml message

981535
put	get
this library differs from that built in to groovy however it looked very well written with some thought put into the kinds of things you want to mock and more importantly the error messages you would get when tests should fail

981548
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
you can use every image format for icons that qt supports bmp gif jpg png tiff xpm ...

981562
put	get
what i mean is you can use an xml document for integration whether it is stored in a database or sent over a rest interface or stored in a filesystem or put get on a queue

981572
firefox	safari
i am looking for something that will work in the 3 main browsers ie firefox safari

981617
folder	directory
just delete the .svn folder then run a cleanup on the parent directory

981623
git-am	git-apply
then apply it with git-apply 1 or for email git-am 1

981704
ssl	https
i have a client program that talks to a web server through a ssl connection https

981741
post	get
in all honesty your example doesn t given enough data to determine which method post get would be appropriate for you

981750
trojan	virus
if the man-in-the-middle actually sits on the client computer think of a virus trojan or other malware they can read modify anything going on over that connection

981790
public	protected
you probably don t want to do that so instead you will need either to add public accessors or use the ones which are there already if any or else make them protected members of the base class of types specified by typedefs in the derived class or else have the derived class declare the base class a friend

981793
post	get
and yes both get and post data can be easily tampered so you obviously have to check for validity

981829
serializable	deserialization
i did find you cannot have objects with securestring properties unless you want to implement custom serializable deserialization for them

981857
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox google-chrome and ie

981888
hash	salt
if you wanted to store the passwords hash and salt for instance you d need to think through how to implement that in your scheme and you could make a mistake that would lead to a security problem

981964
user-controls	elementhost
this is where i m trying to hook in - the winforms user-controls that s currently getting loaded will have the elementhost

981964
user-controls	elementhost
winforms user-controls - contains the elementhost

981964
user-controls	elementhost
the elementhost has dock set to fill and its child property set to ucreport which is a wpf user-controls which has the following markup only top level design included

981964
user-controls	elementhost
when i view the winforms user-controls the one that has the elementhost in the designer the problem is apparent

981986
min	max
it also helps alleviate many of the issues caused by the sort operations required for aggregation operations such as min and max either with datatable.compute or linq

982000
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ported a widget i ve been using with actionscript 3 to javascript and it seems to be working fine with google-chrome safari but on firefox is throwing an exception

982035
hide	show
i can add some data that would make ie render the such as make it show a 1 pixel image which would enable the element in the dom but this would hide the fallback markup

982055
inherited	properties
inherited may be an option to make it more elegant - factoring out the shared properties into a base class

982064
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
paletted pngs with transparency are fine in ie6. most other browsers work correctly though including ie 7.0+ firefox safari google-chrome netscape opera epiphany konqueror.

982068
avm2	neko	mxml	haxe
you might want to take a look at haxe a high level language that targets many platforms as avm1 avm2 php c++ ectc. and neko a server vm available as compiler target for haxe as well as haxe remoting you can simply compile your haxe net-code to an swc and stick to as3 mxml for the rest .

982079
firefox	safari
firefox and safari rendered them differently

982145
width	height
you could write a javascript wto find the window height and width and make it to half to find the centre point

982149
apache	nginx
nginx serves static files and reverse-proxies to apache

982165
folder	directory
i have taken the approach of copying the ootb documentlibrary folder and files structure from the 12hive template feature directory changing some of the default files to make this a new customdocumentlibrary and wrapping the new files and folder up as a feature to be deployed with stsadm

982172
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
by using a compiler you can define variables loops add subtract multiplying etc

982185
sudo	passwd
sudo requires the passwd of the user running it

982185
sudo	passwd
if you use sudo it will cache credentials or can be configured to do so so you only get asked once for a passwd - but it will prompt the first time just like su does

982185
sudo	passwd
sudo is better in most respects but still requires a passwd which asroot does not

982194
hide	show
you can have controls appear or hide depending on the editmode of a page so what is show to the user is totally different but all the code for a page is still in one place

982236
width	height
i think you need to specify two more arguments to putimagedata width and height

982246
post	get
i just found this post which may help you get the proper configuration setup to handle what you need based on your iis environment

982263
getter	setter
the only solution i ve found is to have aimpl hold a bimpl instead of a b and have the getter return bimpl and the setter recieve bimpl

982267
post	get
limit to get head post debug uncheck check that file exists

982288
hash	md5
now you can encrypt the password easily with the hash module md5 and similar modules in python 2.5 and below

982326
integer	unsigned
rather than that approach and assuming that each of your version string elements is less than 255 you could just take each element as a byte in a 32 bit unsigned integer

982339
int	double
your double are being automatically truncated to int

982346
fadein	fadeout
false default to skip the animation otherwise specify a valid ext.fx method blind the current effect fadein fadeout ...etc

982356
metaclass	superclass
if not found the search continues to the metaclass object s superclass where the search continues

everything is working wonderfully in firefox safari and google-chrome

982437
richfaces	icefaces
go check out the component showcases of icefaces and richfaces two jsf ajax cable libraries

982437
richfaces	icefaces
my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs

982446
mouse	keyboard
i was wondering if there was a way to write a program that could bind buttons on a gamepad to certain mouse keyboard inputs

982446
mouse	keyboard
for example moving an analog stick on the gamepad to move the mouse and clicking certain buttons on the gamepad pressing keyboard keys or mouse clicks

982455
boost	stl
if you really have to write it yourself take a look at how it is implemented in stl or boost

982470
for-loop	loops
to be precise any for-loop without anything between the semicolons will loops forever until terminated by some other means because it has no defined invariant

982486
mouse	joystick
for example in java you can use jinput to read the joystick and then use jawa.awt.robot to move the mouse

982486
mouse	joystick
you may want to use some movement controls such as a quadratic gradient to speedup slowdown the mouse movements the longer the joystick is pushed in one direction for instance

982497
post	get
one of the possible solutions would be use the http request common module which exposes some useful functions like get post and header

982531
int	double
std numeric_limits float std numeric_limits double std numberic_limits int etc..

982537
photoshop	fireworks
to get the exact look you want your best bet is to jump in flash fireworks photoshop etc and tweak a button skin to your liking

982543
inherited	properties
then your dog object would already inherited properties

982560
super	extends
if your dog extends animal you can create a constructor that takes an animal and initializes the super parent constructor

982569
versioning	upgrade
if you find a method that works the developers will likely classify it as a bug in the future and break your code when you upgrade to the next versioning

982605
for-loop	loops
i d recommend using a regular for-loop with a termination flag in loops invariant

982611
firefox	safari
seems to work fine on safari 3.2.1 and firefox 3.0.10

982675
datamodule	tdataset
you could have a generic tdataset on the shared datamodule and set it on the ondatachange using the dataset property of the field parameter

982748
hash	salt
always store salt hash rather than password itself

982749
put	get	post	put	post	get
restful services should use the correct http method get head put delete or post for the action ensure that any scoping information is contained in the uri and ensure that the http message envelope does not contain another envelope soap

982809
graphics2d	bufferedimage
if you just want to draw on this image you can get a graphics2d context from your bufferedimage

982843
try-catch	exception-handling
i do have a try-catch block around the save operation and even though the exception-handling is caught jboss still continues with the rollback

986034
implements	extends
then when you define a visitor extends this abstract class instead of implements the interface directly

986034

width	height
i think the solution was to force the values of width and height for the desired amount regardless of the selected item in paper size dropdown box in report properties - page setup

987682
width	height
in our case we wanted to print in a4 so we set width 21.59cm and height 27 94cm even if selected paper size remains as letter

988011
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
basically i want to do two way databinding of multiple controls textbox dropdownlistfor checkbox etc to a single instance of custom class entity ie person

power is just repeated multiplication and mod is related to division

988074
division	multiplication
we know that multiplication and division are inverses so through that connection i would assume there s a correlation between power and mod

988132
uitextview	uiresponder
since uitextview inherits from uiresponder indirectly it actually inherits from uiscrollview which inherits from uiview which then inherits from uiresponder you can call the -becomefirstresponder method on your text field which will cause it to become the first responder and begin editing

988146
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i can think of several techniques to make the uitextview become the first responder but the easiest is probably in your view controller s viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods

988202
implements	extends
there is an application django-simple-history which implements and extends this approach docs here

988221
feedback	review
when this pops out only on the system implementation you whether go back to review the domain or you discovered some fragility whose feedback could - and should - aggregate changes on related details of the business to make the domain richer and better modeled

988292
hide	show
you can use user.identity.isauthenticated to check if the user is logged in and show hide the login button based on that

988302

988357
put	get
one way would be to put a dummy file in that folder dummy.txt and do an http get of the file

988362
translation	localization
the only catch here is that if you want to assign the localization to a global variable you have to run it async false otherwise you won t have the translation available when you need them

988588
integer	unsigned
i was reading the c standard the other day and noticed that unlike signed integer overflow which is undefined unsigned integer overflow is well defined

988605
integer	unsigned
one way where i could think of unsigned integer overflow causing a problem is when subtracting from a small unsigned value resulting in it wrapping to a large positive value

988611
base	fractions
you should be aware that all information in computers is in binary and the expansions of fractions in different base vary

988611
multiplication	exponent	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	multiplication
floating point multiplication consists of re-adding the hidden 1 to both mantissas multiplying the two mantissa subtract the offset from the two exponent and then adding th two exponent together

988613
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer overflow in the shape of wrap-around is routinely taken advantage of in hashing functions and has been since the year dot

988625
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
the key point of that article is to bind the collectionviewsource to an ilist implementation rather than a weaker icollection or ienumerable interface

988654
fixed-point	fractions	integer	fractions
this data type uses a 16-bit signed integer and a 16-bit fractions to represent fixed-point decimal numbers.

988694
profiling	debugging
as client-side libraries become more and more robust and more responsibility is placed client-side in general this type of debugging and profiling will only become more useful

988714
integer	unsigned
it is perfectly legal ok safe to use unsigned integer overflow as you see fit as long as you pay attention and adhere to the definition for whatever purpose - optimization super clever algorithms etc.

988758
postgresql	mysql
afaik ms access is a database and you can connect to it through odbc etc but it is not a database server in the way sqlserver mysql postgresql or oracle are database servers

988991
inherited	subclassing
if your subclassing does not follow the liskov substituion principle it shouldn t be a subclassing an inherited relationship is not appropriate and you should choose some other design

988991
superclass	subclassing
you can always invoke the superclass method implementations with from within your subclassing

988993

i m using the mouseenter mouseleave event to fadein fadeout respectively

989036
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout	hide	show

expander	togglebutton
looking at the expander through mole or looking at it s controltemplate generated by blend we can see that the header part that is responding to space enter click etc is really a togglebutton

989411
expander	togglebutton
now the bad news because the header s togglebutton has a diffrent layout for the expander s expanded properties up down left right it s already has styles assigned to it through the expander s controltemplate

989411
expander	togglebutton
that precludes us from doing something simple like creating a default togglebutton style in the expander s resources

989411
expander	togglebutton
if you have access to the code behind or don t mind adding a codebehind to the resource dictionary that the expander is in then you can access the togglebutton and set the tabindex in the expander.loaded event like this

one very nice thing about svn which is not true for cvs is that moving around directories is pretty trivial

989490
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you could just add both the uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller to the app delegate

989552
keydown	keyup
you should try to trap tab earlier in the keyup event or maybe even earlier in the keydown

989619

if you have access to a compiled class animal.class in your example then you can recompile a subclassing dog.java you don t however need to have access to the source code of the superclass

990270
superclass	subclassing
if you don t even have access to the compiled superclass then if you know the relevant methods those which are implemented or called from the subclassing then you can create a stub of the superclass just to get the subclassing to compile

- there are rumors already that opera might do that and i think i ve seen a google-chrome plugin that enables webslices

990435
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
it might not sound like much of a problem for a single developer but if you try to upgrade nunit one project at a time you ll see how much nicer it is to be able to checkout the trunk of your project and know that you ve got the right versioning of nunit along with it rather than then having to uninstall nunit and reinstall the right versioning

990519
width	height
height + math.ceil linelength width

also importantly i do not know all the hash keys in advance that is i do not know width height or depth -- they could be cats dogs and hamsters

990826
realloc	malloc
with one exception it is not true for local variables or for data allocated with malloc or realloc

990830

vim	emacs
i hate to say it being an avid vim user but emacs supports wiki markup

990960
implements	extends
instead of extends something like a mouseinputadapter which can be annoying since java is also single-inheritance or implements a lot of pointless empty methods you can adopt a protocol and implements only the optional methods you care about

990964
prototypejs	mootools
i choose to use jquery as our default ui library precisely because it does not extend or otherwise monkeypatch native objects unlike prototypejs or mootools

991002
int	chars
accessing variables such int or pointers as chars or unsigned chars in not a problem from a portability view

991020
git-cherry-pick	dcommit
if this is the problem you have at the moment you can probably create create a new branch from the point you last updated from svn and then use git-cherry-pick to transfer your simple bug fixes to this new branch from which you can then dcommit to svn

991053
division	modulo
the modulo gives the remainder after integer division

991162
g++	gcc
note comeau and gcc g++ 4.0 give an error with the code above

processors	hyperthreading
in a multi threaded environment hyperthreading multi-core or multi-processor the bootstrap thread usually thread 0 in core 0 in processors 0 starts up fetching code from address 0xfffffff0

991274
int	boolean
the wsdl-code generator in flex builder creates a string boolean int and other classes which are built-in types

it comes down to the image you want to repeat it s height width in relation to the sprite it exists on the direction you want to repeat it and the size of the container you want it to repeat in

991364
cifs	smb
if you need to have it accross machines then i assume samba would use inotify to get notified and convert that to smb cifs events but i m not familiar with that

991366
exponent	modulo
i don t know what it is but i expect them to be modulo d exponent

991366
exponent	modulo
when i create an rsaparameters and assign the 3 byte arrays to modulo d exponent and try to use that rsaparameters in rsacryptoserviceprovider.importparameters decryption fails stating corrupt keys

991366
exponent	modulo
i don t have that values is there an easy way to decrypt a byte array using only modulo d exponent in c# as in other languages

991371
opera	firefox
according to w3schools the .form property of input fields is supported by ie 4.0+ firefox 1.0+ opera 9.0+ which is even more browsers that jquery guarantees so you should stick to this

991385
getter	setter
as i am sure you already know the c# compiler in vs 2008 will automatically generate getter and setter for properties when compiling

991390
width	height
you can also use the lazy method provided by bufferedimage s superclass image getscaledinstance - using -1 for either width or height will maintain aspect ratio

991426

it isn t possible to create a subclassing because appengine and django have different database models with their own metaclass magic

991615
width	height
well you must have a maximum height and width lets assume the image size you have available is square say 100x100

991615
width	height
when a user uploads an image get the dimensions of it then work out which is greater the height or the width

991615
width	height
then take the greatest measurement and get the ratio of that measurement to your target measurement then use that ratio to scale both the height and width

991615
width	height
so if the user uploads a picture of 500 height and 450 width as the height is greatest you d divide 100 by 500 your thumbnail size

991764
hide	show
is there a way to hide the window title so that it won t get show in fullscreen mode

setcontentview	findviewbyid
i can then turn the full screen capability off and on using the following code in my activity class usually called from a menu option the m_contentview variable is the view from findviewbyid using the id that you used when calling setcontentview in your on create

992060
hide	show
well if you are trying to dynamically show and hide it during the lifetime of the activity i am not sure if you can do that with the official window title due to the note that has been mentioned about window features needing to be set before setcontentview is called link

992060
hide	show
one thing that you could do is implement your own title bar and dynamically show and hide that.

992132
post	get
i found another post on here that basically states i have to right a small book of code to get it resize my image.

992146
uiview	uiwindow
the uiview has to be contained within a uiwindow to be visible during simulate interface mode

992161

for verilog and vhdl many other langauges too

992225
getter	setter
ides such as eclipse and netbeans will automatically write the getter and setter in the above format

992232
boost	stl
boost enjoys a near stl status due to the number of people on the c++ standards committee who are also boost developers

992252
wordpress	joomla
normally this translation is done by joomla wordpress itself and it only works as long the how_to_get_the_ladies text is known and unique throughout the system database

992261
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i believe you need access to the httpd.conf or vhost configuration file though rewritemaps or some related directive cannot be put in .htaccess files

992270

when subversion changes the working copy versioning in a release such as 1.5.x - 1.6.x any 1.5.x working copy is silently upgrade to the 1.6.x format as soon as it is touched by a 1.6.x client

992335
boost	stl
as rdbound said boost has a near stl status

992367
nsurl	nsstring
look at the stringwithcontentsofurl encoding error method of nsstring - it lets you pass in a url as an instance of nsurl which can easily be instantiated from nsstring and returns a string with the complete contents of the page at that url

992380
touchesbegan	touchesended
have a look at uiresponder s touchesbegan withevent and touchesended withevent

992410
resx	baml
you have to manually do this generating .resources from locbaml and then merging the resx and baml resources using the assembly linker

992412
serializable	deserialization
theoretically and yes this is a terrible idea you could catch serializable exceptions and parse the error for the older version details of course current deserialization will work without throwing .

992412
serializable	deserialization
basically bindtotype is being given the opportunity by the deserialization process to substitute a known type for the one originally used to serializable that object

992455
nsview	nsoutlineview
remember that nsoutlineview has a fairly long object tree - it inherits from nstableview which inherits from nscontrol which inherits from nsview which inherits from nsresponder which inherits from nsobject and there are various helper methods that exist in each of these classes which can often help you achieve what you want

992455
inherited	subclassing
the easiest way to create the shell of your subclassing would be to select then choosing objective-c class as you would with any other class which will create a new class with header and implementation files that inherited from nsobject

992455
nsview	nsoutlineview
since you are creating a subclass you can change the default implementation of any method up the object tree - that is you can override methods declared in nsoutlineview nstableview nscontrol nsview nsresponder and nsobject although you should rarely override methods declared in nsobject

992502
hide	show
similarly if i scroll past the top to fully hide the bottom most cell and it rubber bands back to show that cell it will crash before showing it

it is a local variable in oncreate but it is not declared in ondestroy at all

992577
sorting	filtering
if you implement some kind of filtering sorting paging or worst searching then you might at some point miss the quereing capabilities of sql

992599
debian	linux
on a debian system and probably other linux distros you could do this

992653
getter	setter
in eclipse you can create the getter and setter for a field with ctrl-1 when the cursor is located on the field in question

992663
button	checkbox
client side has few trackbars checkbox button and picturebox

992787
hide	show
to implement that you need to add a title-bar-like layout item with your text and progress bar and hide show when you need it

992823
daemon	cron
the plug-in is on github and you can use it both to build a daemon a process which stays in a loop polling the mail server for new messages or to write a batch file to be run from cron taken from the plug-in docs

aggregate-functions	sum
one of the nice things relational databases support are the aggregate-functions like count sum avg etc

993062
int	double
you ll note two extra complexities here first it s actually a function type not just a simple alias and second that it s parameterized plotdatagen is a type constructor that i apply to another type to create a new type such as plotdatagen int double

993069
queue	fifo
as the queue is a fifo fifo data structure this ordering is typical

after a deep analysis and compare i have see that the il contents is exacly the same but all the classes and methods property getter and setter etc

993180
hex	binary
so if i compare the two assemblies with and hex editor comparer i see a completely different binary body

993209
put	get
your best bet is to use something like firefox firebug to get access to the css source copy and modify the css to do what you need it to do then put it in your local site and maintain it there from then on

993220
int	boolean
my version set all strings as the name of the field setname would be called with name then set all int as 1 boolean to true etc

bazaar	git
now that repositories for git and mercurial have been mentioned launchpad s the equivalent for bazaar

993319

993354
fadein	fadeout
i searched here and found a similar problem with fadein and fadeout .

993354
fadein	fadeout
i must admit i don t seem to get the issue with fadein and fadeout

993375
inherited	subclassing
i also wanted to pass along a tidbit i learned that can bite you down the road +initialize is inherited by subclassing and is also called for each subclassing that doesn t implement an +initialize of their own

versioning	upgrade
my current wix setup upgrade from the original rtm versioning correctly

993434
hex	binary
things i want to do include presenting arbitrary chunks of the data in various forms binary decimal hex convert data from one endianess to another etc

993439
profiling	benchmarking
these kind of benchmarking can be a lot of fun to write and profiling don t let a few false starts get in the way of digging in and looking for speedups

993471
accessor	properties
you d have to specify the properties names as strings so that the framework could look up properties accessor using reflection or java bean introspection

993590
free	malloc
i know i should release memory - the golden each malloc free or each new delete rules exist now in my world but i m using them to rather simple objects

993597
width	height
if you want to stick with div s you can do that easily by setting specific width height values for each parent cube and the child cubs and simply floating them left right

993597
width	height
just be sure to use the clear fix to keep the content from flowing past their sibling tags if you decide not to use explicit width height values

993649
mouseover	mouseout
jquery doesn t add a hover tag it merely provides handlers for javascript s hover event iirc it s actually an abstraction of mouseover mouseout

993700
strtol	strtod
it seems that strtol and strtod effectively allow and force you to cast away constness in a string

993749
nunit	moq
here is the excerpt from the test nunit moq that is giving me problems

993768
daemons	systemd
if you want to do something like this i would advise you write a systemd daemons that applications can use as a copy store and access through systemd ipc such as dbus

993771
folder	directory
these structured namespaces correspond to the folder directory structures in which the source code and the projects are contained

993816
filesystems	ntfs
the open-source project ntfs-3g for ntfs driver on unix platforms has developed a posix filesystems test suite to check the posix compliance of different filesystems on these platforms with more than 3000 regression tests for different commands

993817
superclass	subclassing
i m not sure about it here but if initwithstyle allready calls init in the superclass when you override init in the subclassing and call the super you might have a loop on your hands

993823
for-loop	arrays
for example if you had a vector of pointers to stl strings or c-style character arrays put that into a stringcontainer use a better name and have the stringcontainer hold a vector and in the stringcontainer destructor run a for-loop to delete each string in the vector

993823
public	protected
you can make the vector inside the stringcontainer a public member and mess around with it directly but it s even better design to make it private or protected and add some member functions to manage the string vector

993833

- represents a single row with getter and setter

993862
width	height
fade works by changing the opacity of an element and blind i think by changing the width height

993887
triples	tdb
i assume you re asking about persistence of triples and possibly graphs via quads where the storage is either a native triple store for example tdb or a relational database with a triple store overlay like sdb

993893
udp	tcp
one problem with it is that all the traffic is udp which makes the connections unreliable so you need to implement your own version of tcp over it if you need reliability

993955
maven	pom.xml
if it s in the pom.xml how will maven know to go to the repository since it needs to already know where the repository is to get the pom.xml

994000
vsto	add-in
this functionality was removed in later versions 2003 and 2007 with the advent of the vsto software although obviously you could still create com add-in in a similar fashion without the use of vsto or vs.net by using vb6 ide

994038
width	height
you can assume that width is constant 150px and height can vary between 150px and 300px

994057
opera	firefox
update this code works and is tested in opera 9.51 firefox 3.0 and ie7

994065
children	parent
here main waits on parent but since parent s children were indeed created as detached that does not make main implicitly wait on the children as well so main and therefore the whole process can and often will terminate before some child task has had a chance to run

994071
disk	ram
long answer you can use a ram disk as a hack

994073
clang	llvm
the llvm developers are trying to compile it with clang

where you might forget to public after the protected methods

994254
onfocus	onblur
using onfocus onblur works in firefox but not in ie6 or ie7

994272
postorder	inorder
you would do a parallel tree traversal - choose your order pre-order postorder inorder

994297
integer	unsigned
i assume you mean size_t -- this is a way of indicating an unsigned integer an integer that can only be positive never negative -- it makes sense for containers sizes since you can t have an array with a size of -7

994301
integer	unsigned
the type size_t can be defined as the largest unsigned integer on that platform

994301
integer	unsigned
for example it might be defined as a 32 bit integer or a 64 bit integer or something else altogether that s capable of storing unsigned values of a great length

994328
public	protected
in this class all methods are public except bar_protected and bar_private which are declared protected and private at the end

perforce	svn
when something gets committed we use perforce but this would work for svn a cronjob on one of our build boxes notices that there s a more recent change than is build fires of an http request to download the source tree and starts building with gmake mostly

994357
integer	unsigned
the return type of sizeof is size_t and it is an unsigned integer

994357
int	chars
size_t is not included in the list of fundamental int types so i have always assumed that size_t is a type alias for one of the fundamental types chars short int int and long int

994429
doc	odf
now i thought i would try one of my scripts run a graphical diff for odf doc on windows

994429
ubuntu	linux
which is a surprise because on ubuntu linux uno is supported just fine in python just by

994465

now after some days there will be change and again another setup will be created with the versioning 1.0.0925.3 in that the prompt for the upgrade will be disabled

994571

if i enable this then any setup is ran every time it will be asking for upgrade either it is on lower versioning over higher versioning or higher versioning over lower versioning

994642
int	chars
error c2446 no conversion from chars to int

994647
floating-point	integer
if you just want a fast integer log 2 operation the following function mylog2 will do it without having to worry about floating-point accuracy

994647
integer	unsigned
it will return uint_max for an input value of 0 as an indication of an undefined result so that s something you should check for no valid unsigned integer will have a logarithm that high

994690
width	height
flex builder defaults some components to fit to content if you don t specify a set width or height

994709
integer	unsigned
if you are on a recent-ish x86 or x86-64 platform and you probably are use the bsr instruction which will return the position of the highest set bit in an unsigned integer

994717
inherited	properties
you get an ambiguousmatchexception if a two or more properties with the differing return types and the same name live in your inherited chain

994723
bash	zsh
here is a function i wrote which will work in zsh bash or ksh

994733

it seems that if you open several tabs and navigate to the same url in a browser like firefox or google-chrome the browser makes the requests sequentially it waits for one to finish before making the next

995259
getter	setter
what s the point of having getter and setter

995293
put	get
the only way i can think is to make a hidden element that has variable width set by css put text in its innerhtml and get the width of that element

995342

995587
folder	directory
if we look at the .folderdata folder inside the code directory

995636
bazaar	git
the recent historical popularity of subversion is clearly reflected by the number of questions indicating at least a small tipping of the scales towards git over the mercurial or bazaar

995636
bazaar	git
obviously only two-data points aren t enough to show a trend but it looks like git and subversion are largely entrenched mercurial has seen a lot of growth and bazaar has remained relatively quiet

995640
nsstring	nsdata	nsurl	nsdata	nsurl	nsstring	post	get
if you just need to post or get something use nsurl in combination with nsdata nsstring or something to retrieve the information contained in it

tried fiddler but when using transport level security https the error changes to could not establish trust relationship for the ssl tls secure channel

995822
versioning	upgrade
if it does your only option may be to upgrade ie7 to a newer versioning or re-open the issue

996052
haskell	ocaml
i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes

996093
getter	setter
i want eclipse to automatically generate javadoc comments for my getter and setter methods based on the previously defined comments for the fields

996093
getter	setter
so i have to do redundant work by describing the fields and describing the getter setter again

996179
getter	setter
why getter and setter methods are evil

996213
getter	setter
getter and setter methods are put in place to control access to a class members

996213
getter	setter
getter and setter methods that just look a little prettier

996213
getter	setter
getter and setter can be useful for variables that you specifically want to encapsulate but you don t have to use them for all variables

996218
getter	setter
getter and setter can be useful for variables that you specifically want to encapsulate but you don t have to use them for all variables

996218
getter	setter
the trouble programmers have and allen holub was right in pointing it out is that they sometimes use getter setter for all variables

996224
getter	setter
getter and setter are used as little more than a mask to make a private variable public

996264
awt	swing
i ve written the ui layer in terms of awt abstract window toolkit or swing which are both abstraction layers

996310
floating-point	integer
convert the integer index into a floating-point number of sufficient precision

you could use vbc or csc from the .net framework they re shipped as part of the framework not sure about the new 3.5 client stuff

996351

to get the exact formatting you specified at the top of this post you could call it something like this

996364
passenger	webrick
it works fine when started with ruby script server webrick -e production however i m having trouble getting it working in apache with passenger

996375
getter	setter
holub is pushing the point that getter and setter are an evil default antipattern a bad habit that we slip into when designing a system

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter are usually a cop-out when the programmer is just to lazy to do the analysis required to determine exactly what each class is and is-not and so we go down the path of it can do anything

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

996375
getter	setter
that s cool just cop-out and use getter setter antipattern for now but when you do know through experience what the class is being used for you ll probably want to comeback and cleanup the dirty low level interface

996375
getter	setter
getter and setter are an easy trap to fall into

996375
getter	setter
yes beans basically require getter and setter but to me a bean is a special case

996376

query caching almost always translates to memcached sometimes to apc shared memory

996495
hash	md5
assume i have two strings or byte arrays a and b which both have the same hash with hash i mean things like md5 or sha1

996495
hash	md5
i tested it with md5 and in all my tests appending something to the end made the hash the same but appending at the beginning did not

996505
put	get
efficient amortized o 1 get put delete

996515
width	height
meaning each cell is the same height and width as the table

996548
postgresql	mysql
perhaps even a free one like postgresql or mysql

996554
actionscript	mxml
the reasonong behind this is that mxml is actually translated into actionscript and then compiled

996575
free	malloc
one lab that i did enjoy and found useful however was writing our own malloc free routines

996576
queue	fifo
if efficiency is being asked for in the question then a non-recursive solution is best and done using a fifo list a queue in c# parlance - i m not a c programmer

996656
getter	setter
as corletk points out there is wisdom in thinking long and hard about the highest level of abstraction and not just programming thoughtlessly with getter setter that just let you do an end-run around encapsulation

996690
width	height
template files where each property has a variable to swap with string interpolation ex mx hrule height hruleheight width hrulewidth

996789
getter	setter
getter and setter make sense when they reflect some sort of coherent idea

996789
getter	setter
it probably makes sense to have getter and it likely makes sense to have setter

996789
getter	setter
there are some advantages of getter and setter over public variables

996789
getter	setter
so i d say to use private variables almost exclusively getter and setter where they have a real meaning in object behavior and not otherwise

996789
getter	setter
just because getter and setter are frequently overused doesn t mean they re useless

996791
versioning	upgrade
one was recently upgrade to use the 1.0 versioning and one is stuck on an earlier preview versioning

996797
persistent	transient
if i just pass the exception back up the stack or don t do this rollback then i will hit an error when i do try to save the other data null or transient object passed to persistent as the bookinglines are already persistent

996803
public	protected
use public private or protected instead

996807
google-chrome	firefox
of course firefox has huge market share and the up and coming google-chrome etc crowd

996848
for-loop	arrays
the next problem i am running into is that i cannot perform the for-loop easily after converting the byte arrays into uint32 or long

996873
hash	md5
using a hash function like md5 is probably overkill for random error detection

996909
integer	unsigned
the syntax to change the value of group_concat_max_len at runtime is as follows where val is an unsigned integer

997030
octal	decimal
0 means use the usual rules no prefix is decimal 0 prefix is octal and 0x is hexa -- just like eval

997070
opensuse	linux
i tested this manually rm and mkdir on my opensuse linux installation and the soft link was still fine after recreating the directory structure

997105
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to make this work in firefox ie and google-chrome

997108
hash	md5
the hash functions being discussed here are typically cryptographic sha1 md5

997135
sorting	filtering
this all works fine with sorting and filtering on the gridview but when iâ m paging it the grid pages like it should but the paging template always stays on the first page show 1 as active

997141
post	get
unfortunately i don t have the exact error text with me something about not being able to figure out which overloaded function to use at the moment or the specific version of g++ the latest being distributed with ubuntu but i ll update this post when i get that

997147
klocwork	coverity
assuming you can t use dynamic memory checkers like the open-source valgrind tool on linux static analysis tools like the commercial products coverity prevent and klocwork insight may be of use

997238
pdfbox	itextsharp
since i m a .net guy i ve taken a look at both pdfbox and itextsharp

997273
addition	multiplication
a single addition is going to be fewer op codes for the cpu then a multiplication and addition and thus horizontal scanning is faster because of the architecture of computer memory

997279
folder	directory
to make this more general and allow copying folder not in the root directory i would do something like this

997309
hash	md5
the algorithm message digest 5 or md5 it is a one-way cryptographic hash function

997309
hash	md5
md5 performs many binary operations on the message binary data for example of an iso image to compute a 128-bit hash

997309
hash	md5
it is useful to check the integrity of a downloaded package such as ubuntu because generating the md5 hash will be identical if the package is exactly the same as the authenticated source

997327
moose	mason
i would suggest looking at perltidy mason catalyst template-toolkit2 moose dbi and poe as relevant keywords to start searching once you learn the basics of the language

997333
post	get
in particular if you get an exception then post the complete exception including stack traces and innerexception instances

997361
quicksort	mergesort
in my experience in school is that quicksort and mergesort are the other two basic sorting algorithms introduced with or shortly after bubble sort

997383
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
however if you want to modify the method dispatch for a single instance i think your only option is a conditional statement within your viewdidappear method or to consider a redesign that does not require separate methods on first and subsequent appearances from your description separating your code into viewdidload and viewwillappear functions seems to make sense

997384
cpu	processors
instead it reads that location and a bunch of nearby locations into a processors cache that lives on the cpu and can be accessed much more quickly than main memory

997423
vsto	add-in
vsto may also be a way to go if you design an add-in that added a toolbar to the inspector mail window that inserted your url to your secure service say via small winform that looked up that patient by name id etc

997442
viewdidload	viewwillappear
it s almost certainly over-clever and should probably be separated into viewdidload and viewwillappear rather than two versions of viewwillappear

997473
mbunit	nunit
but i think nunit mbunit and xunit.net all support transactional tests out of the box or with a contrib project

997480
centos	linux
centos linux and mac os x report the limit as being 128

997549
google-chrome	firefox
ive got a problem with ie which is fine in firefox google-chrome etc.

997549
google-chrome	firefox
- as i say absolutely fine with firefox and google-chrome

997572
ctime	strftime
the c way is to use ctime or to use strftime plus either localtime or gmtime

997602
put	get
update if i switch around the lib paths and put platformsdk lib before the vc lib switch i get this error

997650
mvp	presenter
with mvp every view has a presenter that does the view s job

997650
mvvm	delegatecommand
i will replace the events with commands using the delegatecommand eliminate the views references on the view-model and i think that s all because the examples that i saw of mvvm is much like mvp

997659
ethernet	wireless
for network failures nothing beats first unplugging your computers ethernet cable or d c it s wireless and then unplugging whatever cable gives you access to the cloud

997725
rss	feed
one screen could be an aggregated rss feed of development topics pulled from sites such as stack overflow or even coding horror

997736
internationalization	translation
another thing is even if the standard right now is that the app will only be released in english you are also blocking the possibility of internationalization with ascii adding to the work that needs to be done when the company policy decides that translation are a good thing

997811
apache	nginx
i am working on adding some nagios alerts to our system -- some of which will monitoring the rate of certain events hitting the nginx apache logs or parsing values from those logs. the way i ve approached the problem so far is with a simple shell script tail -f ing the log for 25 seconds or so to a temporary file killing the process and then running awk etc over the temp file

997824
width	height
if the inner div is empty make sure you define a width height otherwise it will not appear on the page

997888
post	put
you will need either a server script that accepts the xml document sent using a post request or for the server to support put request to replace the original xml url

997906
inherited	properties
note i do not want to inherited and extend each control i want to have this properties available on

997931
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch blocks that handle any thrown exception-handling should remove the appropiate exception-handling from the list unless a rethrow instruction is detected

997962
jtextfield	jlabel
however you could use a jtextfield and just change the foreground background colors to make it appear as a jlabel

998015
nscopying	nsfastenumeration	nscoding	nscopying
these structures adopt nscoding and nscopying plus nsfastenumeration on 10.5+ so they work seamlessly with native objective-c code

998016
capitalize	capitalization
as for capitalization capitalize the first letter

998016
pascal	delphi
cardinal and longword didn t exist in delphi s and turbo pascal s 16-bit days

998016
16-bit	64bit
the longint and longword types will become 64bit types because they have always been the same size as the pointer type which was 32 bits even in 16-bit times

998025
ramaze	camping
the three i like are sinatra ramaze or _why s 4k camping get the one with the bugs fixed

i am looking for a way to branch tee the input read from an istream cin in my case out to a log file clog ofstream etc while still using the input for processing

998101
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this may appear a bit convoluted but it can be adapted in a number of directions and should work in at least ie firefox google-chrome and probably safari and opera.

998113
int	double
the value property is an object so i can be set to string int double etc

998132
mp3	wav
in my c# application i need to play multiple audio files wav and mp3 one after the other

998143
r-tree	quadtree
the simplest sturcture is the grid index then the different search trees kd-tree quadtree with r-tree as the most frequently used a generalized b-tree for more dimensions

998144
getter	setter
if you had a macro language you could write a function like open a popup that allows me to type in some text then generates the getter and setter including its javadoc based on templates

998248
g++	gcc
i m developing an embedded application using gcc g++ compiled for arm-eabi

998286
mouse	keyboard
the parent page has a couple of event listeners for mouse and keyboard events as shown below i m using the prototype library

998315
hide	show
i made it hide and show again the #results and it makes ie rerender it and realise its height again

998386
public	protected
however if the variable have to be protected or public use an explicit access method or rely on the local scope rule i just demonstrated

998396
firefox	safari
the attribute works perfectly on firefox safari etc

998413
postgresql	mysql
while he doesn t have examples for derby directly i suspect you could probably adapt them to your problem particularly the postgresql or mysql one it seems somewhat platform agnostic

998420
cvs	rcs
cvs uses the old rcs file format and uses rcs tags both for branches and cvs tags

998451
translation	localization
staticity is a life-time and technically memory localization property it tells if the variable will be global in the scope of a class when in a class or a translation unit when used with a global variable defined in a cpp

998475
sharepoint	spsite
we faced the same problem some days ago and the solution was to set the application that is trying to create de spsite object to use the same apppool that the sharepoint s web application

998478
integer	unsigned
assuming img_ is of type iplimage and assuming 16 bit unsigned integer data i would say

998529
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the problem never happens for other browsers such as firefox google-chrome opera

998542
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
do we have same value at navigationcontroller and parentviewcontroller

998571
integer	unsigned
i am trying to write a c++ template function that will throw a runtime exception on integer overflow in casts between different integral types with different widths and possible signed unsigned mismatch

998571
boost	stl
edit for various reasons stl isn t available so i can t use std numeric_limits and anything from boost is right out

998577
cobertura	emma
cobertura emma for code coverage

998619
google-chrome	safari
yes this is how safari and any browser based on webkit google-chrome behave

998644
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my main view controller is a uitabbarcontroller with 4 uinavigationcontroller as the tab bar items

998648
hide	show
i was thinking i could have one web page for each one or i could have a single web page and show hide the fields for the subclass

998655
google-chrome	firefox
if i copy a 32bit image from photoshop or ie firefox google-chrome and run the above code the output loses its alpha channel instead it is saved against a black background

998671
int	boolean
a magic 8ball is something most people can relate to and it s an introduction to basic strings floats int io cli boolean and rng s using only the simplest tools

998695
int	chars
here is a slightly edited version that i ve tested for converting from int to chars

998701
imperative	declarative
you have less control over the algorithms used since it s more declarative than imperative

998702
debian	linux
the server i ve been trying is just django s built in server using manage.py python manage.py 0.0.0.0 8000 since i need to access it externally on linux debian

portrait	landscape
in my case i would like to setup that cropping frame to 320x240 for images that are landscape and 240x320 for images that are portrait

998756
vbscript	jscript
custom actions even without tools like installshield can be .exe vbscript jscript or dll based

998783
disk	ram
note that this is distinct from error -34 disk full and appears to be referring to your system memory ram + virtual ram

998809
postorder	inorder
if you want to get to the bottom of the tree first then you do an inorder or perhaps postorder search

998853
versioning	upgrade
one thing that may be different is that this app was created back when mvc beta was the latest versioning and was upgrade to the rc and then rtm as they were released

998865
folder	dir
it has scripts presentations etc in it.s i should probably create a bin subdir in the mesh folder and put that bin dir in my path

998902
put	get	post	put	post	get
of the http methods like post get put delete etc

998958
int	chars
while chars can be used to represent chars it s inherently an int data type

999010
put	get
when i put inner on a different domain i get the problematic behavior

999018
put	get
the primary problem with sending byte s over web services is that they get put in the soap body which is gets encoded as a base 64 string

999032
int	chars
the cast from int to chars works fine

999093
implements	extends
when extends the class you may create a static method of the same name but you are not in fact implements a static abstract method

it works for click dblclick mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout keydown keypress and keyup

999113
bazaar	git
you should be aware however that open source projects borrow ideas from one another or have similar features developed independently one example would be finding bugs by bisecting searching history for commit that introduced the bug which was as far as i know developed first in git and then implemented as plugin in bazaar and first extension and currently core functionality in mercurial

999113
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
we have kde and we have gnome and xfce and other window managers and desktop envirionments

999113
bazaar	git
and we have git mercurial and bazaar

999136
post	get
firefox permits changing the page showing within the modal panel via a normal post but ie opens it in a new window which seems to imply that a straight get or post won t work

999154
redland	jena
i m the creator of redland which includes native triple stores in c plus i ve used some of the java systems like jena and sesame

999174
kde	gnome
there are ways to do this for both kde and gnome

999192
pull	push
the program simply pull some information from the database and do some calculation then push some data back to the database

999203
width	height
part of this may be keeping track of the display height and width of the rows and columns so that the display system can iterate over the range until the desired width and height of cells has been collected

999268
width	height
if the orginal file s width is greater than 480 or lessthan 450 then i want to set the width of output image as 450px.and the height has to be proportional of the width

999268
width	height
if the width of the orginal file is its height then add white space to the top and to bottom to the height so that the new height will be 650

999268
width	height
ex my orginal image had width 450 and height 1094

999268
width	height
desired height desired width ratio ie

999272
textwrangler	bbedit
open the eula file up with bbedit or the free textwrangler and see what encoding it uses

999280
rational-numbers	fractions
this introduces if you can associate every member of set a with exactly one member of set b mathematicians say the sets have the same size. next comes showing that every fractions every rational-numbers can be associated with exactly one counting number using the diagonal method

999297
struts	wicket
eg a different framework wicket vs struts vs spring vs pure ejb j2ee architecture number of distributed tiers one box setup or 3 tier setup

999320
width	height
what you need is a simple ratio between the width and height of the image

999320
width	height
now if we wanted to resize the same image to an width of 50 dividing it by the ratio would give us an height of 100

999347
maven	m2e
first even when i enabled all m2e features checkbox i still couldn t check out a project as a maven project from subversion

999366
parentviewcontroller	navigationcontroller
parentviewcontroller is not always a navigationcontroller

999376
getter	setter
in your class1.m file the getter and setter methods for today are never created

999392
wordpress	joomla
software like joomla and wordpress are open source but it also creates jobs with support customisation extension templates developent

999405
google-chrome	firefox
the way i see it open source will absolutely flourish for applications that us normal users use every day be it operating system linux browser firefox google-chrome etc etc

999414
width	height
choose a constant height and width for your element and create one png out of it

999414
opera	firefox
here is a working solution for ie7+ firefox opera that achieves exactly what you are looking for

999450
queue	fifo
for example if i was implementing a queue admittedly you d use a framework for a queue i d say something like fifo data structure with o 1 insert remove and size

999468
igraph	networkx
we tried networkx and igraph

999482
jruby	mri
i m trying to understand the practical impact of different threading models between mri ruby 1.8 and jruby

999491
jruby	mri
i do not know of any place where mri ruby 1.8 code runs slower on jruby

999497
jruby	mri
so the only real performance difference is the fact that your mri yarv ruby applications won t be able to utilize all of your processor cores but your jruby applications will happily do so

999549
min	max
i am using coregraphics to draw a quadratic bezier but want to computer the min max value of the curve

999578
put	get
so the best advice i can give is put in the plan the need for working prototypes at the earliest possible stage so that you can get those numbers and plan for those numbers to change over time so get prototypes or working versions at every checkpoint to retest all along the project timeline

999583
hash	salt
set a session cookie of a hash and salt secret value

999620
min	max
calculus gives the standard box of tricks for finding the min max of continuous differentiable curves

999670
rspec	machinist
all i do in my rspec tests for my controller is create a user with machinist and then assign that user to be the current_user

999670
rspec	machinist
you obviously would probably need to adapt this to work in test unit and without machinist if you don t use it as i use rspec but i m sure the principle is the same

999744
pull	push
but after some initial research in the web i found out some disappointing facts which are applicable to our application - using git for large systems like ours is painful checkout clone merge push pull and commands are complicated geeky would be more appropriate for a developer base which is dvcs ignorant and mostly windows users

999744
cvs	svn
there is no fixed mindset for git but if i have to go for a centralized approach in really worst case then what should be the way cvs svn apart

999823
cpu	processors
you submit commands to the opengl subsystem and then they are executed on the gpu so not by definition a parallel thread b c the graphics processors doesn t necessarily have the concept of threads in the same way as the cpu

999825
move	drag
i need to draw line circle and rectangle by mouse drag on canvas and then i need to to move and resize the drawn shapes

999834
folder	directory
when i am i am giving the folder of 2nd website in settings of 1st website i am actually giving the root folder and not path of any virutal directory

999840
versioning	upgrade
basically if you want to support upgrade change the major.minor.build versioning number

999951
google-chrome	safari
also this doesn t happen on other browsers like google-chrome and safari

999974
interpolation	splines
when i now use a splines bezierspline in degrafa for interpolation the interpolation at this point does not work as expected at this point my function has a kink

999974
interpolation	splines
now when interpolation with a splines it draws some kind of loop around this point

1000004
serializable	deserialization
this is a place from where serializable and deserialization starts

1000004
serializable	deserialization
however if serializable will be implemented with usage of java s classes converted with ikvm then there will be classnotfound exception thrown during deserialization

1000062
versioning	upgrade
ssis sql server integration services is an upgrade of dts data transformation services which is a feature of the previous versioning of sql server

1000062

1000141
hide	show
with a dummy button btnloader to allow me to access the show and hide from code behind

1000163
client-side	server-side
for my data model i have typical objects like user etc. that are basically the same in the database the server-side java code and the client-side as code

1000204
merb	ruby-on-rails
forget about both and use j2ee ruby-on-rails merb django etc

1000218
swt	swing	awt	swing
any case where a method is deprecated because of defective design think anything dealing with date s in java or because a better way is now supported think awt to swing or swt requires far to much thought to be automated

1000281
hash	hmac
the subject of how to store web site users passwords in tables has come up several times on so and the general advice is to store a hash of the password eventually an hmac hash

1000299
put	get
i m currently building an app for my work it work perfectly on my pc but one i put the compile code on to the 2008 server with sqlserver 2005 and run it i get an sql error truncat data

disk	ram
it uses the magic of dma direct memory access allowing the data to go from disk to nic without ever going through ram or the cpu

1000484
submit	submission
i am trying to use this approach in a bug submission system where a form submit symptoms of a bug and i would like a screenshot of the error for debugging

1000489
hide	show
use say jquery to show hide each group

1000493
put	get
to the excellent points that have already been made here i would add that there is something about the high speed in which flash projects are put together and the fact that most will not need to be maintained that encourages people to just get things done as quickly as possible and singletons are a good way to make that happen and you can use getinstance rather than passing around references dependancy injection etc

1000589
int	chars
causes fprintf to pad the output until it is n chars wide where n is an int value stored in the a function argument just preceding that represented by the modified type

1000593
webkit	gecko
there is only a handful of browsers you need to test as some share a common rendering engine gecko or webkit

1000593
opera	firefox
build your site using firefox or opera on any platform

versioning	upgrade
test in ie 7 if you like and do the same or use conditional comments to ask users politely to upgrade their versioning of ie

1000593
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
finally try enlarging the text in firefox opera ie and safari

1000593
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in practice i find that if a site has valid code and works in firefox safari and opera it ll probably be okay in ie7 up

1000643
cairngorm	flex
i am in the process of writing an application in flex 3.3 using the cairngorm framework for deployment as an air application

1000666

1000681
children	parent
with a parent class foo and children bar baz bazza

1000742
rsa	aes
asymmetric encryption such as rsa have the notion of key pairs where each key in the pair can decrypt data encrypted with the other key in contrast to symmetric encryption such as aes where the same key works for both encryption and decryption

1000755
post	put
here is a way without cursors using the link that tekblues put in his post

1000774
inherited	properties
the list inherited all of the properties from all supertypes all types in the hiearchy contain the entire list for the hiearchy to make accessing the list as quick as possible

1000791
rsa	aes
the most practical use of assymmetric encryption like rsa is to encrypt the symmetric keys for aes or similar algorithm that were used to encrypt the data and also to sign a secure hash of the message digest sha-256 etc

1000803
postgresql	mysql
one of the team actually rewrote the database layer to use oracle or postgresql or mysql but it was slightly slower than the original

portrait	landscape
if i push another controller on top in the usual manner and then pop back to the portrait view it displays correctly - this only occurs when rotating back from landscape

1000844
many-to-many	many-to-one
an item is associated many-to-many to category and a category is mapped many-to-one to customer

1000886
erd	diagram
if it doesn t have to be an erd and can be say a uml class diagram you have a bit more scope because you can high level entities that effectively encompass multiple tables so you can have diagram at different levels

1000898
gif	png
using imagemagick ghostscript you can convert the pdf to some bitmap format gif png or jpg

1000908
public	protected
but a base class should have a destructor that is public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

1000915
entity-relationship	diagram
an entity-relationship diagram of 500 tables cannot be useful

1001006
gcov	lcov
i would suggest using gcov in conjunction with lcov

1001017
onchange	onkeyup
use onchange instead of onkeyup in this case

1001127
websphere	ibm
disclaimer i m a websphere esb consultant for ibm

1001127
websphere	ibm
in practice you will need websphere integration developer wid to do that - it would be a lot of work to create the mediations manually it s not documented and it s not supported by ibm either

1001172
content-length	content-type
when you re posting at minimun you need to define the content-type and content-length

1001196
datamapper	activerecord
between activerecord and datamapper i d chose the latter

1001196
datamapper	activerecord
both use the activerecord pattern so you ll actually get your database tables back in objects without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe

1001250
gcov	lcov
this should result in only the targeted areas emitting gcov artifacts which are blindly consumed by the lcov scripts

1001271
post	get
you may get a more complete answer if you post some code

1001323
entity-relationship	diagram
while not primarily a database tool it can reverse-engineer a database into an entity-relationship model then you can create one or more diagram from that model

1001327
int	chars
this requires sizeof int sizeof chars but it s definitely true for the discussed platforms

1001373
powerpc	i386
this is also much better than fixing the endianness at compile time - for os which support multi-architecture fat binary on mac os x for example this will work for both powerpc i386 whereas it is very easy to mess things up otherwise

1001394
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this solution works on ie7 firefox safari google-chrome and opera

1001459
jdom	xom
if you need to keep the tree in memory to navigate xom or jdom are good choices

1001459
xslt	xquery
for example the saxon xslt xquery engine works with dom sax or stax but builds internally a tinytree default or dom optional

1001531
folder	directory
you can set up individual sites in iis that point to the a shared directory or use a virtual directory in each where all the logic sits but you can t share the app_code folder

1001535
g++	gcc
hi all quick question i m in a situation where it would be useful to generate my c++ executable using only gcc without g++

1001535
submit	submission
reason for this is that i have to submit the code to an automatic submission server which doesn t recognize the g++ or c++ for that matter command

1001535
g++	gcc
now based on what i understood from the gcc man page i may be way off so tell me if i am g++ is basically gcc but it links the c++ library

1001562
fileoutputstream	filewriter
instead of using filewriter create a fileoutputstream

1001575
maven	pom.xml
the resolved pom.xml is output to the output directory target with the name resolved-pom.xml by default these two properties can be overridden with the usual maven plugin configuration approach by setting the outputdir and or pomfilename properties

1001590
xslt	xquery
you can then use xslt or xquery to create versions in specific languages on-demand or at least enable the reader to do so

1001590
xslt	xquery
that s harder to do if you use but if you use the above your xslt or xquery could actually generate another file with the comments in the target language

1001609
extjs	qooxdoo
when i have to build rich browser-side applications i d always switch to the big solutions extjs yui qooxdoo that offer a variety of ready to use widgets

1001710
centos	linux
as i make the full switch from windows to linux centos 5 i m in search of the best free gui sql client tool for mssql mysql oracle etc.

1001725
versioning	upgrade
if it s an older versioning then upgrade it to the newer versioning and things should work

1001751
width	height
in your stylesheet give them absolute positioning your png as a background image with background-repeat set to no-repeat and an explicit height and width that s the exact size of your rounded corner

1001751
width	height
edit you ll probably still run into problems with div#corners having an explicit height and width and acting as a layer

1001806
ant	maven
we use maven ant s big brother for all our java projects and it has a very nifty war plugin

1001806
ant	maven
it s a lot easier than ant fully compatible with eclipse use maven eclipse eclipse to create eclipse projects and easy to configure

1001813
post	get
to get progress information on an upload process the server would have to provide the information which would require a means of communication between the server and the client during the operation which isn t there for a regular http post operation

1001827
jar	war
a war file is simply a jar file with a war extension but what makes it work is how the contents is actually structured

1001847
gridview	radgrid
i have problems binding both a telerik radgrid and a plain vanilla asp.net gridview to the results of the following linq to entities query

1001855
vbscript	vba
i believe that the reports are using something more along the lines of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that

1001906
vim	emacs
certainly vim and emacs will

1001910
client-side	server-side
this allows you to do things like format a javascript regular expression as a python string so your server-side python script can feed a regex into client-side javascript code

1001916
translation	localization
you re probably not going to do automatic localization but you can probably automate the process as far as gathering together the changed comments sending them off to be localized then incorporating the translation documents into your documentation once they return from being translation

1001919
multiplying	add
however if you can add then multiplying then you can t check only add and multiplying individually you must check them in all their possible permutations

1001953
oncreate	setcontentview
the next thing that you will need to do is let your activity know that you are using a custom layout by calling setcontentview in your activities oncreate

1002004
mouse	keyboard
in this small class i have widgets which are supposed to react to mouse or keyboard event

1002054
bufferedreader	printwriter
i m using bufferedreader and printwriter to go through each line of an input file make a change to some lines and output the result

1002178
folder	directory
i d recommend you create a folder in that directory for your application and copy there

1002181
public	protected
btw this is slightly misleading a base class should have a destructor that is public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual

1002189
installation	upgrade
.net 2.0 installation upgrade the script mappings to 2.0 and that doesn t work for all web applications

1002196
gridview	objectdatasource
i am working with a gridview and an objectdatasource

1002196
gridview	objectdatasource
using an objectdatasource with a gridview requires implementing a method called select that provides a sort expression the number of rows to return and the start row

1002257
nunit	moq
i have been following some asp.net mvc tutorials that use nunit for testing and moq for mocking

1002265
hide	show
that will show the element with id mycontrol when the checkbox is checked and hide it after it has been unchecked

1002395
webkit	gecko
i tried setting wmode transparent but while it works in webkit browsers and ie it fails in gecko browsers

1002440
perl	tcl
i d like to add perl which much like tcl has interpreter-based threads

1002468
union	distinct
use a distinct with a subquery which contains a union

1002497
xmltype	clob
then take your clob or bfile and convert it to an xmltype column with the defined schema and you re done -- the shredding happens automatically the data is all there it s all relational it s all available to standard sql without the xquery or xml extensions

1002497
xmltype	clob
of course if you d rather use xquery then just take the clob or bfile convert it to an xmltype and go for it

1002540
pentaho	olap
1 i only have experience creating olap cubes with mondrian pentaho which does allow you to revise the cube s schema which is just an xml file and rebuild them or in pentaho-speak publish

1002544
post	get
not sure if this is the best way but you could redirect to a reload page and use the values from post or get to reinput the existing fields

1002544
post	get
then the post or get will have all of the values the user filled in and the missing required fields will already be blank so you just loop through and load up the supplied info

1002549
post	get
i want to use the name of the input button to get the recordid to edit and post it to a new page using http post as opposed to an url param

1002584
folder	directory
i would probably write it to a folder contained within a directory of the application itself

1002585
stdout	stderr
redirecting stderr to stdout a couple of gotchas

1002593
button	checkbox
so you can use them very easily in the case of text-fields but a bit more work is required for select options checkbox and radio button

1002593
button	checkbox
for radio button select options and checkbox you instead have to check the value to see if it corresponds with the entry you are currently outputting and print selected selected

1002618
icmp	udp
the udp socket will recvfrom any host sending to this one with correct port unless you explicitly connect in which case you can just write and read and get errors upon received icmp messages

1002653
inherited	subclassing
since i strive to document the apis for my framework as completely as is reasonable i would like the documentation for my custom subclassing generated by doxygen to include descriptions of the most common methods of ns mutable dictionary so users don t have to look at another page just to the methods that a particular custom dictionary inherited unchanged

1002659
union	distinct
use distinct and union

1002667
ubuntu	linux
i am currently trying to compile and build qt for embedded linux on an ubuntu box for arm architecture

1002691
put	get
quite simply put code behind is hard to unit-test but can and usually does include logic that doesn t get tested

1002698
pull	push
if you are using a standard web server it will never push anything to you - your client will have to periodically pull from it instead

1002752
folder	directory
iâ ve checked the â œbinâ directory in my project folder

1002770
inline	inlining
note that if most widgets belong to classes that your container cannot possibly know about because they re in different libraries for example then you can t possibly have inlining unless your dynamic linker can inline

1002956
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so in your case if i understand correctly you simply have to override the viewwillappear or viewdidappear method on what you call the parent page which is presumably handled by a uiviewcontroller and put in code to update the appearance of the page to reflect the data just entered

1002983
hash	md5
it could be that the checksum is simply a crc or md5 or other hash appended to the end of the firmware or it could be in a header somewhere

1003023
dictionary	map
i have a dictionary to map a certain type to a certain generic object for that type

1003037
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview with an objectdatasource and i want to be able to sort it

1003074
post	get
i haven t had time to get this to work yet but there is code for a vs2003 2005 add-in to auto-sync here see the post marked answer

1003075
eiffel	spec#
not having ever used eiffel i can t comment on the comparison but i have messed around with spec# which has design by contract and is what is mostly being rolled into c# 4.0 and i can say this

1003097
swt	swing
for a quick demonstrator i m looking for a swt or swing component which can display geographical data

1003128
folder	directory
should i place my app cake and vendor folder as well as .htaccess and index.php files in the public_html directory

1003140
implements	extends
then extends observablecollection for each of your custom classes implements the itoggle interface

1003159
codeigniter	cakephp
in php cakephp and codeigniter do as well and i m sure most good frameworks do this as it falls under the category of common tasks that frameworks are supposed to abstract away

1003167
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
develop test interfaces in firefox safari opera google-chrome arora etc. first

1003195
vb6	vba
microsoft wrote a whitepaper many years ago detailing some best practices for writing dlls to use with vb5 vb6 which of course would also apply to vba

1003237
put	get
i was under the misguided impression up until a couple of years ago that i could get away with only synchronising the put and remove operations on a hashmap

1003262
put	get	maven	pom.xml
i encourage you to put the repository definition in the pom.xml this way any developer just grab a copy of the code and run maven to get it compiled without having to change things in his settings file

1003282
websphere	ibm
this is under jdk1.5 and ibm websphere 6.1 rad7

1003310
user-controls	elementhost
it appears as though i m going to need to do a user-controls for the actual content and then host that content via a winforms form with an elementhost since user-controls has no showdialog method

1003329
pylons	turbogears
turbogears is a recent framework based on pylons

1003329
pylons	turbogears
for turbogears and pylons the most suitable solution is sqlalchemy which is actually the most complete and rising orm for python

1003383
centos	linux
fonts such as arial and verdana which many web designers take for granted may not be present on linux browsers even firefox on centos from experience

1003392
postgresql	mysql
the sqllite concat is the same as postgresql || and not mysql or mssql concat

1003423
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
i prefer to use django myself but given your needs i d go with pylons or turbogears rather then shoe-horning a different orm into the system

1003443
implements	extends
it checks types to see if they implements or extends specific interfaces base classes inpc incc dependencyobject etc and so doesn t care if the interface is implements explicitly

1003483
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the page has some checkbox and dropdownlistfor at the top that are used as filters for the gridview right below

1003483
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
then there s the start of the wrapping div that starts with a table where the checkbox and dropdownlistfor are

1003483
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i ve got plenty going on in the page.load codebehind in vb but the animation simply does not come up when i click on one of the checkbox to make a long trip to the database or select something from a dropdownlistfor to filter the results i already have

1003490
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox safari or google-chrome this works fine but in ie 8 don t have an earlier version of ie to test and msft won t let me uninstall ie 8 and have a working ie 7 the only cookies it sees are the session cookies not any of the persistent cookies the ones found in the temporary internet files

1003528
folder	directory
in c# i d loop over the directory get the list of files in each folder then loop over them to run the commandlines

1003562
width	height
whenever you mix padding with ie you start to lose control over width height

1003609
tax	shipping
the project is being split into two parts the store front which includes displaying the items and taking the customer s shipping and billing information and the payment site which will collect the customers credit card compute tax and save the order into the company s system

1003611
post	get
i have seen other post indicating that the approach i am using see below should work yet at runtime i get the following exception thrown by imappingpart.positionondocument method of joinedsubclasspart

1003613
width	height
i ve done this by creating a 100 height width translucent black div which has its visibility toggled on off via javascript

1003641
awt	swing
use swing awt

1003651
getter	setter
but watch out when using getter and setter instead of public variables

1003657
mouse	joystick
i want to emulate a joystick using keypresses and or mouse input

1003657
mouse	joystick
so other programs games will think that user is using a joystick while he is using a mouse

1003714
x86	mips
once upon a time microsoft supported windowsnt on processors other than x86 such as mips powerpc and alpha

1003732
versioning	upgrade
and the 500 price tag is for a new copy of office not the upgrade versioning

1003751
apache	nginx
it s looking like apache might still be needed it works with php-fcgi but i would prefer a nginx solution

1003771
width	height
by setting all of top bottom left and right the height and width are automatically calculated

1003774
switching	screens
however this approach doesn t handle the device lost event happening due to lock screens ctrl+alt+delete remote desktop connections user switching or similar

1003786
profiling	debugging
if you re running the xcode debugging profiling you should get a stacktrace in the debugger when the app quits.

1003818
gcov	lcov
however if you really want to hit it out of the park with pretty reports using gcov in conjunction with lcov is the way to go

1003818
gcov	lcov
another approach is doing the gcov emit on windows and doing the lcov post processing on linux where it will surely work out of the box

1003883
children	parent
if you expand either the one or two parent nodes and click one of the children the child that was selected does not show up as selected after the focus method is called on the text box

1003895
children	parent
the objective of the query is to recurse through parent child relationships of product categories and return the number of products under each category this includes any products contained in children categories

1003895
children	parent
my big question is at this level parent 942 how can i make it count the products contained in the children below to show 13 as the productcount i m kinda thinking i may need one more recursion method

1003923
yacc	bison
i m looking for a way to get flex bison or lex yacc et

1003943
yacc	bison
engine like bison or yacc but it s

1003986
getter	setter
if you know what the option keys are going to be in advance you can declare special getter and setter for them like so

1004041
mouse	keyboard
between hot-keys shortcuts and keyboard navigation a user rarely needs to use the mouse

1004041
mouse	keyboard
itunes is on the other extreme -- it relies on the mouse almost exclusively as do most drag-drop dominated uis and using the keyboard only is next to impossible

1004068
maven	pom.xml
you could remove the scm section from your pom.xml and have hudson pass -dproject.scm.developerconnection scm type user pass foobase footron fooproj on to maven

1004070
width	height
and while a camera and a mobile phone have length width height in common most of the other measurements will not coincide the camera won t have any audio information and the mobile phone won t have any lens or viewport measurements

1004070
superclass	subclassing
is there a general rule that says you should always put common data together in a superclass even if it s a small percentage of the subclassing s descriptive data

1004124
pull	push
i pull push changes from the local repo on each machine to a transfer repo on usb stick and things still work out correctly

1004142
portrait	landscape
now with the orientation in landscape the scrollview is starting at the top left when i really want it to start at the original orientation point from when it was in portrait mode which would be bottom left

1004213
wan	lan
we ve done something similar to this on our internal lan wan only wan being for instance san francisco to london

1004225
disk	ram
the ssd is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude but it s quite reasonable to have a 50gb hash table on disk but not in ram unless you pay big money for big iron

1004252
jobs	cron
if your server can run cron jobs consider making a script that checks the api for a valid response every few minutes

1004272
children	parent
then do everything as usual update parent and then children

1004284
versioning	upgrade
the easiest fix may be to check to see whether the versioning of tomcat you are using has this error in any other versioning you may just need to upgrade revert tomcat

1004328
notepad++	gedit
notepad++ and pspad both do this on windows and i use gedit default gnome text editor when on fedora

1004380
freemarker	velocity
if you re looking at velocity you may also want to consider freemarker

1004432
versioning	upgrade
one way to work around this could be to create an intermediate dummy rpm versioning n+1 of the old package which contains no files upgrade to that and then update to your final new package

1004435
chown	chmod
all fine and well while i m in ssh i can always chmod +w the files or chown nobody

1004492
itertools	functools
many other common uses can be satisfied with some combination of the operator itertools and functools modules

1004570
onclick	onchange
onclick onchange onclose

1004579
django	turbogears
use python and django turbogears twisted plone wsgi modpython

1004592
ant	maven
otherwise if you want to use the ant method as suggested maven can run ant tasks.

1004607
width	height
the other problem with this approach is that afterwards i can t change the size of the rectangle that i m cropping the image with which i need to be able to do because i have to have the image be an exact number of pixels in width and height

1004641
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
my setup is hudson 1.310 running as a system service cvsnt latest version on the server tortoisecvs 1.10.10

1004672
sorting	grouping
update i need to do more testing on it but it appears my nasty query works out better if i don t do the grouping and sorting in the db but do it in ruby afterwards

1004697
versioning	upgrade
basically the fix is to upgrade to a newer versioning of mod_jk

1004701
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview with some elements visual representation of game board that user can interact with while the interaction logic game rules are encapsulated in other class

1004702
width	height
if you want to rotate around the center merely center the asset inside your sprite by setting the internal assets x and y to half of the width and height of the asset

1004737
yacc	bison
nor can many other widely available parser generators such as antlr javacc yacc or traditional bison or even peg-style parsers used in a pure way

1004780
implements	extends
if you actually have access to the source code of the class you could implements an inner class which allows you to extends it although if you could do that you could just make one of the constructors package private as well

1004826
google-chrome	firefox
update it appears firefox uses mouse stopped moving to trigger tooltips in the browser google-chrome eg back forward buttons

1004975
subtract	add
the first one compiles fine because you can subtract pointers in c c++ but not add pointers

1005004
put	get
we do this where i work ie put interface in one package and implementation in another and the main advantage we get out of this is we can easily swap between implementations

1005017
multiplication	modulo
the multiplication in mixcolumns is indeed reversible and it is not modulo 256

1005023
integer	fractions
it can be represented if you store the integral part 1 as an integer and the fractions part .1 as another integer and then you need to create the logic to deal with these structures

1005038
post	put
better might be to put a counter_cache on post

1005048
coalesce	isnull
just to clarify things since there seems to be a lot of discussion about coalesce isnull will still return null if no rows match try this query you can copy-and-paste into sql server directly as-is

1005048
sum	coalesce
note that the where clause excludes all the rows from sys.columns from consideration but the sum operator still results in a single row being returned that is null which coalesce fixes to be a single row with a 0

1005058
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
with this question i want to know how can i switch from nunit to mbunit xunit or even mstest

1005136
coalesce	isnull
all the cool people use coalesce instead of isnull

1005158
addition	multiplication
integers are closed under addition and multiplication

1005213
post	get
check out this blog post not mine for a very understandable description of a very understandable algorithm which seems to get good results for how simple it is

1005238
pylons	turbogears
i d go with werkzeug personally as the framework most suitable for highly complex projects requiring ridiculous amounts of flexibility and power -- though pylons and turbogears 2 on top of it may be acceptable as a fall-back if the team just doesn t have the web app experience and skill it takes to make truly beautiful music with a flexible framework such as werkzeug

1005241
goto	break
if you have ever used a break or a continue you ve used a goto

1005241
goto	break
whether implicit gotos like continue or break are used or explicit gotos using the actual keyword goto for whatever language

1005254
width	height
if the swf is set to 100 width height it will stretch to fit the wrapper whenever the wrapper is resized

1005287
post	get
as wikis were originally designed to work in a standard browser and most browsers did not support anything except get and post rest is not a concept used a lot on the wiki world

1005287
pmwiki	foswiki
as wikis with a pluggable backend i know only of pmwiki and foswiki the open fork of twiki

1005297
getter	setter
i don t have my copy of clr via c# here with me but getter and setter of properties are just methods on the class with special decoration

1005327
expression-blend	silverlight
experience using expression-blend and visual studio for silverlight application development

1005327
expression-blend	silverlight
experience using expression-blend and visual studio for silverlight application development

1005333
daemons	launchd
most likely the app will end up running in the background so you ll need to mark it as a windows service unix daemons or mac launchd application

1005428
maven	pom.xml
actually maven is not as constrained as everybody thinks all the poms are extended of one super pom.xml in which is defined the name of the target folder

1005445
put	get
that way the scrollbar updates as the user types and if they type in an invalid value the scrollbar stays put and they ll get an error when they move to whatever the next stage is

1005456
folder	directory
one method that requires no programmatic setup and is quite secure is to mount a folder from the other server and use php to save to that directory like you would normally

1005503
getter	setter
or how to write setter and getter method for these arrays

1005505
hash	md5
in this case using an md5 hash of the page content as the etag will be a lot easier

1005539
int	double
it is working fine for int type values but when the data contain double values it doesn t sort

1005570
mouse	keyboard
you can mouse click your way around or use the keyboard

1005591
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview

1005661
children	parent
create an object node which contains a parent node and a list of children node

1005774
getter	setter
later i figured out i can use strings in my applicaiton which makes it easier to pass around nulls as the actual domain fields are nullable most of the time and only change those fields getter and setter to use getdomainvalue index and setdomainvalue index value method that will translate between the key and value to from the underlying feature object

1005780
public	protected
my understanding was when a type is inherited all protected and public members will be accessible from the derived class

xrange	enumerate
this behaviour changes in python3 range is an iterator to which the python2 equivalent is xrange or even better for your case enumerate

1005891
int	double
it is present there so the compiler decides to call b f int converting double to int

1005891
int	double
now b class has two overloaded functions for int and for double

1005903
doc	rtf
doc rtf pdf html.

1005911
superclass	subclassing
i tend to prefer the use of override in this case so that the method gets flagged in the subclassing if the superclass changes either removing the method altogether or changing its signature etc.

1005986
post	put
and i also agree with the above post that say your reasoning around point 1 is off - if there are classes with incorrect implementations of equals and or hashcode that you want to put into a set you fix them and then use a set

1006055
sorting	filtering
there is a very good library called glazedlists that makes it a lot simpler to work with lists and tables including column sorting and row filtering

1006308
versioning	upgrade
ver_suite_smallbusiness microsoft small business server was once installed on the system but may have been upgrade to another versioning of windows

1006417
equals	gethashcode
the problem that i have is that both functions throw the compiler warning function gethashcode or equals shadows an overridable method in the base class object

1006425
for-loop	arrays
if you re looping through an arrays it shouldn t matter - the enhanced for-loop uses arrays accesses anyway

1006468
put	get
with this command i can get the address of this function and can put breakpoint

1006517
post	get
passing large amount data as get post around might not be the best idea

1006537
int	boolean
i wanted to convert the typex to int or boolean and this operation is one common thing that i am doing in lots of places in the code

1006554
put	get
rather if they find some deficiency in what you have put out there you are likely to get helpful bug reports or even patches

1006621
post	get
however i now get a runtime exception which i will post separately

1006708
setinterval	settimeout
any animation is going to rely on settimeout setinterval and the page won t wait for those to complete before leaving

1006726
profiling	debugging
the down side of course is that if you have to debugging or profiling optimized code be prepared to deal with call stacks that look like theyâ re missing a few frames

1006764
int	double
a read or write from int or any smaller type should be atomic but as robert noted longs and double may or may not depending on the implementation

1006805
gtk	motif
it covers systems such as microsoft windows mac os x linux unix x11 motif and gtk openvms os 2 and amigaos

1007017
rss	feed
i want to serve up specialized rss feed on a different subdomain from the rest of the site

1007107
innodb	myisam
the actual cause was that the main db table was in myisam and the innodb tables couldn t create a foreign key connecting to it

1007112
maven	pom.xml
if the local pom.xml definition takes precedence over the settings.xml definition then you could try omitting the default value at the cost of having every maven instance in your control developers build machines etc specify my.build.directory in its settings.xml

1007146
rank	percentile
since all this is sort of meaningless without a frame of reference i want to show users their percentile rank among all users

1007146
rank	percentile
i d also like to show percentile rank for the different time spans-- i may be 11th percentile overall but 50th percentile this month and 97th percentile today

1007158
width	height
obviously it doesn t have to match exactly due to ratios the width would be the key size so the height would be variable

1007185
mouse	keyboard
the user selects some text using the mouse or the keyboard in any application window

1007211

i m sure of safari 4 firefox 3.5 from rc1 and maybe google-chrome 2

1007245
webkit	gecko
as far as i know it is supported either partially or fully in the gecko webkit and presto engines

1007267
range	percentile	rank	percentile
as you mentioned total up the reputation points earned during the time range and calculate the percentile rank based on that

1007284
division	modulo
once you realize that the and are used for doing modulo und division calculation respectively you can write what you want as

1007340
google-chrome	firefox
i was just reading this question and wanted to try the alias method rather than the function-wrapper method but i couldn t seem to get it to work in either firefox 3 or 3.5beta4 or google-chrome both in their debug windows and in a test web page

1007342
folder	directory
to execute the script if saved to your user folder from root of your settings.bundle directory just use the syntax

1007381

it s the cron daemon that makes that file

1007413
integer	fractions
integer division expressions have the fractions portion truncated where in the past they would result in a floating point result

filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
you can then set parameters to return data of a certain type and apply filtering sorting and grouping

1007446
post	get
this blog post by heather solomon is one of the best resources to help you get started with how to create your own transform and configure the cqwp

1007459
memcached	apc
you would probably be better off storing the object in memory with memcached or apc and don t forget that you may have issues with locks on the file is several people are hitting the site at once

1007483
inherited	properties
classes also defines from which other class or classes if multiple inherited is allowed this class inherited and which properties if selective inherited exists

1007571
public	protected
when i tried using the -p option with some c++ code however it usually returns the access specifier private public protected etc which isn t terribly handy

1007645
titlebar	window
i used a jframe got the content pane and set the background to red what ever color you want then set the frame undecorated which removes the titlebar and border of the window

1007672
versioning	upgrade
i did have some issues with the lack of any sort of discernable upgrade path between versioning though

1007698
int	double
in c# value types like int double byte and structs are passed by value by default

1007708
webkit	gecko
gecko webkit and presto engines are suppose to support it but i think only partly

1007708
opera	firefox
so firefox 3.5 and opera are your best bet

1007711
bids	ssis
bids is the sole environment to build ssis packages

1007736
bids	ssas	bids	ssis
bids is just visual studio with the vspackages for ssis ssrs and ssas development

1007806
accessor	properties
you should not use properties accessor in and dealloc methods for the same reasons that you should not use them in the legacy runtime it leaves you open to potential errors if you later override the properties methods and end up doing something that shouldn t be done in or dealloc

1007835
gridview	sqldatasource
if you are hooking up a databound element to a datasource a gridview or combobox to a sqldatasource make sure the datasource is assigned to one of your connection strings

1007870
vim	gedit
personally unless it is java development convoluted in itself i stay away from traditional ides and use a modular solution of vim gedit makefiles and other automations

1007908
firefox	safari
the css code works just fine in safari 3 on mac and windows but not in firefox 3 windows

1007908
firefox	safari
i m running the django dev web server and i can see the css file being called in the console when in safari but not when using firefox

1007914
button	checkbox
i like to keep all advanced options hidden under a more less button or advanced mode checkbox depending on the context and application

1007967
accessor	properties
i can understand ejames argument against using properties accessor in init dealloc at all but the flipside is that if you change the properties behavior for example change from retain to copy or just assign without retaining and don t use it in init or vice versa the behavior can get out of sync too

1007967
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
if initializing and modifying an ivar should act the same use the properties accessor for both

1007975
int	double
2 32 + 1 should be recognized as double even though it looks like int

1007987
children	parent
when i run the children page alone outside the parent the modalpopup and it s buttons works perfectly.

1008027
put	get
you shouldn t put extra code in your settranslate since it won t get called

1008049
width	height
you can still set height and width on an element floated this way and since it can still accept the position relative

1008056
width	height
if contents inside the div might get bigger than the div s height width use the overflow style to decide what to do

1008103
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox and safari but when i tested it in ie7 it errors

1008113
for-loop	loops
here is the output when i run the script with jim s while loops replacing the for-loop

1008113
for-loop	loops
however i still don t get why i can t use jim s while style loops instead of the for-loop i am using

1008144
ceil	floor
there s really no need to multiply floor ceil anything the math.random function gives value which is larger than or equal to 0 and less than 1

1008173
vim	textmate
however i do occasionally use textmate or vim with rails.vim

1008182
post	get
this ensures they aren t included in the post and you don t get false positives

1008183
int	double
that is you can convert an int to a double but converting a pointer to an int to a pointer to double would make the compiler believe that there are 8 bytes of memory at the pointed address while in fact only 4 bytes are present assuming 32 or 64 bit architecture with 32 bit int and 64 bit double

1008235
width	height
you need set measurements on the div height width and once you define the image in the css you do not need to put it in the html as well

1008237
qtabbar	qwidget	qtabwidget	qwidget	qtabwidget	qtabbar
this is somewhat similar to how qt provides a qtabwidget class that inherits qwidget but has a private qtabbar that it uses internally

1008237
public	protected
one significant difference is that it provides a protected tabbar accessor rather than a public one

1008262
x86	64bit
this is because the x86 cpu calculates the value with 80bit while the value is stored as 64bit in memory so you end up comparing a truncated 64bit value with a full 80bit value

1008378
post	get
right click on the first packet that has your client calling out on it should be something like get service.svc or post service.svc and select follow tcp stream

1008415
children	parent
if some of the children warning flag changed to true then the parent warning flag should change automatically set to true

1008415
children	parent
a node integer field is the sum of the children integer fields and if any of the children changes the parent integer field calculates the sum immediately

1008418
keydown	keyup
ok i got it its the keyup event not keydown thats causing this thanks for the help

1008432
width	margin
it is not a width margin problem because when all of the subreports are short it looks fine

1008463
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	solaris	netbsd

1008463
bluetooth	usb
bluetooth usb token ring frame

1008509
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome the only two i have to test on at the moment neither the keydown nor the keypress events fire when the keyboard focus is on the location bar and the enter key is pressed

1008509
keydown	keyup
so i suppose you could stick with keydown and or keypress events or keep track of keydown events and ignore any keyup events that aren t preceded by a keydown

1008519
instances	transient
because the new container instances has a null identifier hibernate assumes it is an unsaved transient instances

1008519
persistent	transient
since the persistent and transient container objects have the same business key values what we really want is to issue an update

1008536
min	max
if you use min max you can aggregate any value since there is only one

1008543
setinterval	settimeout
also create threads to speed up ui using settimeout and setinterval

1008579
hash	salt
when the user visits this link mysite.com zneg8rjk it would set a session variable which is just a hash of album 5 plus a salt and then it redirects them to the full url

1008584
versioning	upgrade
engine.js is something that will never change unless you upgrade your dwr to a newer versioning

1008628
client-side	server-side
they are two vastly different creatures and performing client-side tasks from the server-side will not work

1008633
equals	gethashcode
these both produce a value of 3 for gethashcode causing equals to return true

1008654
int	double
it has more possible values than an int so it is impossible to have a unique int for each double

1008661
vb6	vba
it s a poor vb6 vba man s approach to polymorphism

1008666
equals	gethashcode
first off - do not implement equals only in terms of gethashcode - hashcodes will sometimes collide even when objects are not equals

1008671
post	get
post is not more secure than get as itâ s also send unencrypted

1008675
post	get
a post can be sniffed just as easily as a get

1008689
uitableview	nsindexpath
- nsindexpath tableview uitableview tableview willselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath

1008693
post	get
the only difference between http get and http post is the manner in which the data is encoded

1008697
post	get
there is no way for someone to get the post data you send from your home unless you are using a proxy tor or someone is tapping your wires

1008699
children	parent	inherited	properties
children inherited their parent properties so only define differences

1008704
post	get
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure

1008733
stdout	stderr
it also captures any output after duplicating stderr onto stdout in a temp file

1008745
width	height
you need a width and height

1008752
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
i have had no issue getting ruby on rails development environments up and running in os x linux opensuse ubuntu fedora and windows

1008762
post	get
i have a blog post that details what an http request looks like and how a get request compares to a post request

1008763
width	height
you can override this by telling the height and width to be auto which will reset them unless there s a rule which is more specific somewhere else in the stylesheet

1008779
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
then using a md5 function for javascript i hash and salt the password 4k times like linux does when it uses md5 for it s password hashing client side then i pass that hash to the server in plain text

1008781
ethernet	wireless
one is a statically defined ethernet interface and the other one is a dhcp configured wireless interface

1008807
ssl	https
if it is very important drop the ajax and pick up a ssl certificate and use the https layer

1008817
firefox	safari
supported natively by recent versions of firefox and safari

1008861
charindex	substr
you can use charindex and substr

1008925
portrait	landscape
presenting a portrait modal view over a landscape view and vice-versa

1008925
portrait	landscape
you could rotate to landscape for a pdf and get back the portrait view for the message when you dismissed the attachment view

1008945
super	extends
the rationale for calling super first during setup is that you want to make sure everything is in place before you extends functionality

1008945
superclass	subclassing
the corollary is that when you are deallocating you don t want any superclass ivars your subclassing depends on to be dealloced before you have a chance to handle them

1008986
children	parent
i can of course put the parent properties directly on the child datatable fill them w the results of a join between the underlying db tables but i d like to avoid that if it s possible my real app involves just a few parent each w many many children i d like not to be moving so much unnecessary data

1009015
firefox	safari
safari 3.1+ and firefox 3.5 both support the audio element

1009035
int	double
if you want int division to return an int and you ve imported from future use a double

1009095
filtering	grouping
having - combined with + group+ this can be used to filtering the records that a grouping by returns

1009104
getter	setter
makes a lot more sense to me to move the int currentlocation declaration to the top level inside your person class and provide getter setter methods

1009131
folder	directory
going to the app tmp cache directory and removing the files in the model and persistent folder

1009243
memcached	ncache
if you realy need a good performance you could also implement distributed cache like memcached o ncache

1009245
put	get
but the trick here is that you have to wait until server.exe exits to get the out put

1009268
width	height
well you could get the width and height of the browser and that d tell you if it was minimized

1009300
setinterval	settimeout
look up settimeout and setinterval for doing the timing

1009341
httphandler	httpmodule
this is really a job for a httpmodule not a httphandler

1009354
versioning	upgrade
1. in your gac ed dll upgrade the minor versioning number

1009365
firefox	safari
strangly enough in ie 6 7 8 it works fine but in firefox safari i m using mac but tested it in windows and they both give the same problems the map doesn t load entirely

1009365
firefox	safari
please take a look at the link below and click the third tab in firefox safari and ie and you will see the problem

1009383
width	height
most likley you have a div within a div and you need to set the inner div to width 100 and height 100

1009411
mouse	keyboard
in a nutshell idlemonitor is a class that observes mouse and keyboard events adjust accordingly for your needs

1009444
int	boolean
i have tried casting to boolean and int and haven t had any success

1009446
inherited	properties
they will all inherited from a base class that will have a companyid properties

1009530
uiview	subviews
add them as subviews and set your uiview as the tableheaderview

1009531
hash	md5
to ensure uniqueness you ll have to also create a separate varchar column to store an md5 or sha1 hash and add a unique or primary index

1009538
keydown	keyup
other important items to note non-character keys including page down page up etc. do not raise a keypress event they only raise keydown and keyup keypress events are swallowed by the form if you set

1009598
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1009662
google-chrome	firefox
i am using 1.3.2 and using your code copy pasted i can successfully run this in firefox 3 ie 8 and google-chrome

1009705
elf	coff
the tool is available on solaris for elf which is an extension of coff and probably elsewhere

1009747
pop-up	dialog
it s probably right and there s nothing you can do to keep the os from disconnecting and turning off wifi except to pop-up a try again dialog if you really need a connection for the current operation

1009751
hide	show	stdout	stderr
this is probably not the problem but the console view in eclipse has some toggle buttons to show hide the console when output from either stdout or stderr changes

1009787
firefox	safari
some browsers originally only ie but firefox 3 and safari jumped on the wagon support the document.activeelement property which achieves what you want

1009792
put	get
for example i might need to send a short array of numbers and this could either be encoded in amf via netconnection.call or could be put into get parameters using sendtourl

1009832
mouseover	mouseout
another solution would be to run the binding code again after you add a new but that is not as clean as just using live which supports the mouseover and mouseout events you re going to need to do the hover

1009868
min	max
it took min 0.4sec average 0.5sec max 0.6sec

1009888
puts	gets
this puts the original stack trace in the _remotestacktracestring field of the exception which gets concatenated to the newly reset stack trace when the exception is re-thrown

1009915
portrait	landscape
but when i tap a filename while in landscape mode the image slides into view in the wrong orientation even if the second level view controller s shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation returns yes for only portrait modes

1009936
multiplying	add
it s just a shift by two and two adds or a multiplying by 5 and one add

1009942
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
using gtk on x windows linux freebsd solaris you can use the xembed protocol to embed widgets using gtk.socket

1009967
width	height
then you can reposition the buttons the x y values should be calculated as a of the width and height of the panel

1009967
width	height
you could even rescale the buttons so that the width height ratio is the same of the panels ratio

1010016
public	protected
i assume the loop is through each field in the object both public and non-public fields - and i ve read that protected fields are forbidden with reflection on medium trust

1010073
google-chrome	firefox
the following solution has been tested in google-chrome firefox ie8 and ie8 in ie7 compatibility mode

1010100
int	boolean
update the jet internal storage of a boolean is as an int go figure--but that s what they chose...

1010105
int	chars
memory used using 32 bit int would be 4 bytes per original chars

1010133
n-gram	words
you split a words into its constituent n-gram such as for the words hello you would get hel lo

1010133
n-gram	words
then you build an index with n-gram as keys and the words they come from as the values

1010133
n-gram	words
from that list you select the words that had the highest number of matched n-gram

1010137
put	get
myself i seem to resort to similar tricks like this more and more often simply because they work and they get the job done ... note also if you were using a separate viewmodel which i recommend for this you could put this code in there and leave your domain model nice and clean

1010197
children	parent
the repository should handle the entire aggregate object parent and all children because that s what makes it a repository

1010222
x86	64bit
if on a 64bit machine make sure to set the cpu target to x86 rather than anycpu

1010257
min	max
nor do i believe that the sparkline images go in the view model what if my view wants to represent the data differently say as a grid row just showing min max average standard deviation etc

1010338
xsl-fo	xslt
if you have some money to spend on training ken holman has an excellent set of xml xslt xpath xsl-fo training courses

1010338
pull	push
then xslt templates and the distinction between push and pull really make sense

1010347
graphics2d	bufferedimage
the imageio.read method takes in a file to read in and returns a bufferedimage which can be used to manipulate the image via its graphics2d or the graphics its superclass context

1010388
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned

1010388
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

1010388
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

1010388
integer	unsigned
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then

1010388
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the

1010388
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

int	chars
in this case chars could be either a signed or unsigned int type -- its signedness is implementation-defined

1010388
int	chars
fortunately though an int can represent all possible values of a chars whether or not chars is signed assuming you re on a system where chars s are 8 bits and int s are at least 16 bits

1010388
int	chars
if chars is signed then the second paragraph above applies so both operands are converted to int the type with higher rank

1010388
int	chars
since 0x98 as a signed chars is negative it s converted to the int -104 which is then less than 7

1010388
int	chars
the unsigned chars would be converted to 152 as an int which is greater than 7

1010388
int	chars
if you need 8-bit int of a certain signedness explicitly use signed chars or unsigned chars or use the c99 types int8_t and uint8_t defined int

1010422
profiling	debugging
it would help to have a look at the code but if you want to debugging it yourself have a look at xdebug it ll help profiling your application

1010426
goto	break
you probably have a break or return or heaven forbid goto inside the loop

1010439
width	height
that will give you x y width and height for characters and or substrings in the document

1010440
put	get	post	put	post	get
returns the name of the http method with which this request was made for example get post or put

1010440
post	get
this method returns the parameter regardless of whether the request was sent via a get or a post

1010448
setinterval	settimeout
link for further reading timers with settimeout and setinterval

1010497
cassini	iis
the visual studio web server aka cassini won t accept remote connections - you need to use iis

1010498
folder	directory
if you have windows xp professional or vista with iis you can create a virtual directory that points to your publish folder

1010500
google-chrome	safari
interesting that webkit google-chrome and safari displayed the css even with the misspelling

1010505
put	get
hi i have a table with some some values ids and of course when i get the result i got just the int ids but i want to put it more user friendly for example when its the number 1 i want to put the string avaible when its 2 not avaible im on an n tiers enviroment and i need to get this done on the model whats the best way to accomplish this i have to declare another class to project the strings or must i use something like a dictionary key - value

1010509
redmine	trac
i have no experience migrating trac to redmine but i do see one solution

1010522
komodo	aptana
i believe komodo and aptana do as well

1010548
int	chars
the robot.keypress method takes in an int key code -- not an actual chars code

1010548
keyevent	keyrelease
also if one wants to use the keyevent s returned from a keylistener s events such as keypressed and keyrelease the keyevent object has a getkeycode method which will return the keycode of the event

1010582
post	put
anyway if you want to use put post request for uploading one file per request - is amazon s api restriction and it seems to me there s nothing to be done

1010593
ant	maven
maven is a framework ant is a toolbox

1010593
ant	maven
maven is a pre-built road car whereas ant is a set of car parts

1010593
ant	maven
to put it another way maven is a framework whereas ant is a toolbox

1010593
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
he compared a simple maven pom.xml with a simple ant build file and he made mention of how maven projects can become more complex

1010593
ant	maven
which leads me to the point about how all this stuff has to be explicitly written in ant whereas it is declarative in maven

1010593
ant	maven
after my 2 year experiment with maven i pulled the old ant build file out of the closet dusted it off and put it back to work

1010593
ant	maven
when compared with ant the build guy on a maven project will spend more time

1010593
ant	maven
troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins

1010608
jboss	glassfish
another approach is to run your application in a java ee application server which supports jsr 196 eg glassfish or jboss

1010611
maven	cobertura
i m using the maven cobertura plugin to generate coverage reports but for some reason the instrument goal gets stuck in an infinite loop

1010616
submit	submission
editstoreaction and submit form to the same action i would know that the user has pressed the accept button for changes on submission

1010619
pull	push
you can quite easily manage code in bazaar with something like 4 commands add commit merge maybe push pull and log or qlog and you only need merge if you want multiple branches

1010631
tstringlist	tlist
c the non-visual components like tlist tstringlist and so forth should be implemented.

1010811
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
when all else fails you can provide your own global operator new delete and malloc calloc realloc overloads -- how to do so will vary a bit depending on compiler and platform -- and this will be a bit of an investment -- but it may pay off over the long run

1010818
post	get
may be one for all get requests and another is for post requests

1010818
post	get
now your first action being get will go to editstore method of storecontroller whereas the second being post request will go to savestore method of storeformcontroller

1010844
nunit	mstest
given the fact that all three types of tests are built using mstest or nunit it is still code test

1010851
button	checkbox
when i click on of these button the properties on the objects are changed but the checkbox does not update

1010855
put	get
when you have another one to put in you take it put the comma and get the next name in the aux

1010875
int	chars
i want to hash a chars array in to an int or a long

1010879
put	get
but to add data to the arraylist i have to constantly use hashmap get key to get the arraylist add value to it then put it back to hashmap

1010977
minix	linux	netbsd	minix
though if your looking for good kernel source to read i wouldn t go with linux it s a beast of a hack about like saying the gcc sources are fun instead you may wish to try minix or one of the bsds darwin is basically a branch of netbsd iirc or even one of the many free dos clones if everything else is a little too scary

1010983
put	get
so basically you put similar things together so you can collapse everything to definition and get to your stuff really faster

1011047
gina	winlogon
i looked around and found gina and winlogon notification packages

1011051
integer	unsigned
when you take the value of x assuming implausibly for real life but sufficient for the purposes of exposition that ulong_ptr is an unsigned 16-bit integer is 0xbfab then

1011080
hex	binary
alternatively you could just display it in hex it d mean nothing to a human though and it would still be binary for all practical purposes

1011089
post	get
i used this blog post to get started

1011210
integer	fractions
convert the money type to an integer to get rid of the fractions

1011229
folder	directory
don t install the jde or simulators in the default c program files folder as they need to write to their own directory during runtime and vista does not like the user accounts writing to any subdirectory under c program files

1011345
stdout	stderr
you can have a custom snmpget utility download the source replace stderr with stdout then recompile

1011373
folder	directory
these folder are not copied in the bin directory of the webapps when the solution is built in msbuild but they are copied when it is built in visual studio

1011470
strncpy	malloc	strlen	strncpy	free	strncpy	free	malloc
use strncpy for copying the string strlen for detecting string length malloc and free for dynamically allocating a buffer for the new string

1011499
tinyint	boolean
also remember that mysql uses tinyint for boolean so true false are actually 1 0

1011545
free	malloc
whenever you allocate space using malloc remember to call free when you are finished with it read memory leak

1011554
put	get
you will probably get better results if you put a separate index on each of these columns

1011567
getter	setter
since this is the official representation of your data and you have data types and getter setter already there this validation captures user errors and programming errors from people extending your system

1011575
interpreted-language	compiled-language
pretty much any interpreted-language suffers in that way in comparison to most mainstream compiled-language

1011748
inherited	subclassing
i would like to draw your attention to the fact that apple documentation does not document inherited methods in subclassing documentation

1011750
mvvm	delegatecommand
i currently have delegatecommand and attachedbehaviors in my basic mvvm template that i can use but i can t figure out how to get them to fire when combobox selects a new item

1011779
rss	feed
i can generate the rss for each individual resource but i m not getting how to synchronize into one rss feed for these multiple feed

1011779
rss	feed
currently i ve setup the articles feed via feedburner and even feedburner doesn t have this facility to merge different rss of the same app into one so that i users can subscribe to individual rss which i ve done already or to just a single main feed to get all the updates

1011794
hash	md5
if you create a md5 out of some data it is not possible to create the data out of the hash

1011823
versioning	upgrade
later on you upgrade this to use versioning 3.1

1011845
opensuse	linux
i ve installed qt creator in opensuse linux distro can i know if it is possible to create .exe of qt program which is perfectly executing in linux

1011849
mouse	keyboard
another option is the twapi tcl windows api extension which has facilities for sending keyboard and mouse input to another application see

1011941
superclass	subclassing
misspelling overridden method names in a superclass or subclassing

1011941
superclass	subclassing
the superclass misspelling mistake is worse because none of the subclassing override it correctly

1011950
bazaar	git
i have used bazaar extensively for personal projects for a couple of years since the 0.8 days but i have switched to git last year and never looked back at least for source code management

1011950
bazaar	git
bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git

1011950
bazaar	git
bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes

1011951
implements	extends
edit 2 i am no longer extends the sqlmapclientdaosupport class instead my accountdao is a pojo which implements what little functionality was being provided by the support class

1011987
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and safari

1012008
nunit	typemock
at my company since we started unit testing with nunit and typemock we reach higher code coverage and release the software in a shorter time to market

1012021
hide	show
p.s i know that i could simply hide the div with the input-text and show the one with the x but i ll prefer to keep the html markup minimal and dont mess around with hidden divs

1012038
post	get
i then have this post method in my controller that is supposed to display an error message if the surname field is blank i realise there is no other logic in this function im just trying to get my head round validation

1012038
put	get
it runs fine if i put something in the surname textbox and the error does not get added

1012048
postgresql	mysql
also if structure correctly i see no reason why mysql or postgresql would not support 5000 rows per second provided the rows are not too fat

1012048
postgresql	mysql
both mysql and postgresql are a lot more forgiving to having a larger amount of transactions

1012106
put	get
i could put a fixed width in the border element but then a very long customer name might get cut off

1012135
richfaces	icefaces
originally i had planned to use icefaces but that didn t work too well either and also brings a lot of predefined styles with it so for now richfaces seems to be the best option

1012135
icefaces	tomahawk	richfaces	tomahawk	richfaces	icefaces
now i thought it would be nice to develop a clean tag library which provides some useful components found in richfaces icefaces or tomahawk not all of course

1012138
ant	maven
however i would definitely do a build clean first within eclipse and see if ant maven is affected you do have such build scripts i assume

1012152
hide	show
you can either use jquery s remove function on page unload or show and hide field

1012219
put	get
you aren t guaranteed to get data out of them in the same order you put it in

1012292
min	max
that function should generate a random number with the min as 0 and the max as the number of children of the #container element minus 1

1012328
post	get
you might also be able to get the same effect using an global ajaxerror handler and continuing to use post

1012337
ubuntu	linux
this is a linux box running ubuntu

1012365
post	get
also any groups in the regular expression you specify will be passed as arguments to the handler methods get post etc

1012420
spaces	delimiter
otherwise it reads the spaces as a delimiter and thinks the rest of the path is an argument

1012502
pop-up	dialog
i ve written a little batch file that will upload the 2 files via ftps.exe moveit freely but i get a dialog box that pop-up and requires me to click yes

1012559
mouseup	mousedown
you do not decide what delay setting between mousedown and mouseup results in a valid single click the operating system does

1012559
mouseup	mousedown
no sleep function can guarantee the timing between the mousedown and mouseup events you want

1012601
hide	show
i have a table which i want to show hide - linking it to a button using jquery

1012601
hide	show
the problem is that everytime i click on the button to show hide the table everything on the page shifts slightly left-right

1012620
nsstring	nsdata
this means the array and possible subcontainers can only contain objects of type nsarray nsdictionary nsstring nsdata nsdate and nsnumber

1012633
hide	show
it s possible that your show hide is adding an empty div somewhere which would explain the shift

1012645
spaces	delimiter
by default the scanner uses the white spaces as its delimiter

1012719
merb	ruby-on-rails
ultimately ruby-on-rails 3 and merb 2 will merge that might bring you the best of both worlds.

1012724
hash	salt
i was reading a few articles on salt and password hash and a few people were mentioning rainbow attacks

1012764
inherited	properties
just use a custom control that inherited from tablelayoutpanel and set the doublebuffered properties on true works great.

1012768
emacs	textmate
a friend of mine is considering switching to emacs from textmate

1012792
versioning	upgrade
p.s java versioning 1.4.2 can t upgrade

1012792
unix	aix
aix unix 5.3

1012832
salt	md5
instead of storing md5 password store md5 password + salt or even better md5 salt + md5 password

1012832
hash	salt
since even with rainbow tables it is going to be near impossible to store all possible salt hash

1012832
hash	salt
btw obviously you have to store your salt with your hash so that you can authenticate the user

1012834
mouse	keyboard
use qt s event filters they will allow your application to eat whichever events you specify keyboard and mouse events but still process other events such as paint events

1012836
freemarker	velocity
something akin to apache velocity or freemarker

1012841
sudo	passwd
you could use that to write the passwd followed by a new line and sudo or su should accept the passwd

1012847
keydown	keyup
i think you should somehow cancel the keydown keyup event for the character you want to remove before it is processed by the target window procedure notepad s

1012925
put	get
that should be enough to get you started basically take the current reference out of where it is in your normal project file and put it in its own itemgroup with an appropriate condition

1012939
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails and merb

1012939
merb	ruby-on-rails
and later on rails3 merging of ruby-on-rails and merb

1012945
wordpress	phpbb
the disadvantage of this is that each component of our portal the cms the blogging forums etc are not best-of-breed and to be quite honest they are pretty bad compared to their free and open source counterparts wordpress phpbb mediawiki are examples that come to mind

1012947
ant	maven
such a program are make ant maven

1012987
rss	feed
i want to expose those recordings mp3 files to the users as rss feed so that they can download them using their ipod itunes or zune

1013013
int	chars
you also needed to append the l chars at the end of your numbers to tell the java compiler that the number should be compiled as a long instead of an int

1013026
rss	feed
here is a link to the itunes rss technical spec itunes podcast rss technical spec there s also an example feed on that page to get you started

1013027
google-chrome	firefox
in ie and firefox they appear correctly but in google-chrome the 2nd floating div clears down below div a

1013027
google-chrome	firefox
when i remove float left in the css it goes to the correct position in google-chrome but clears down in ie and firefox as it should

1013039
hid	joystick
i am trying to modify my hid joystick events absolute x y so it may only move to the improved location which will be genarated by my application with some math functions like pow tan etc

1013101
postgresql	mysql
there is a django-popularity app on github that looks promising but only works with mysql i m using postgresql

1013115
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you are using a versioning of wordpress older than 2.1 then you can either remove the function call from your header.php file or upgrade your wordpress installation

1013215
sorting	grouping
i ve managed to get expand collapse and global sorting working sort by top level grouping then sort within each grouping but i want to add a feature where you can sort just within a top level grouping

1013235
udp	tcp
the only way you have is to do a tcp or udp ping

1013261
width	height
set the height to 4 the width to the width of your form and very important set the sizemode of the picturebox to stretchimage

1013261
width	height
with the borderstyle set to none changing the height width top and left properties will actually have a visible effect on the form although the form will be borderless

1013270
vim	emacs
i m seriously thinking about taking the opportunity to learn vim or emacs or whatever the windows ports are called but any other thoughts would be welcome.

1013280
mouse	keyboard
i need something like logmein free regarding its direct control of the mouse and keyboard but only working on local network and and not requiring an internet connection just like windows remote desktop connection

1013283
fflush	gets
you must fflush the response otherwise it gets partially transmitted

1013294
tcplistener	tcpclient
i m developing a simple application to send files over tcp using the tcplistener and tcpclient classes

1013306
tunnel	vpn
you could tunnel it over a vpn of some sort if you require more security

1013317
typedef	struct
either put the whole struct definition before the typedef or put this declaration before the typedef

1013355
redhat	fedora
our hosting is redhat enterprise linux-based so we have fedora vm s that we use for testing with apache and mysql or oracle and that whole technology stack

1013361
aptana	radrails
aptana radrails

1013417
put	get
i think that the header comment is probably the right way to do this but in order for it to be truly useful i need to figure out how to get xcode to put the comment in there when it s creating the file for me.

1013432
google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in ie firefox but when it is tried in google-chrome it is as if the onclientclick is not kicking off the javascript

1013469
switching	screens
having one activity+view for each screens and then i make the screens switching by calling each activity

1013469
switching	screens
having one activity and many views and what i switching views in each screens change this helps me re-use more code but makes saving states a mess

1013489
pascal	delphi
i ve got a lot of older code that uses the old-style pascal object type that i m trying to get working in delphi 2009

1013529
multiplying	multiplication
something else to keep in mind is that the compiler statically knows the value of sizeof char is 1 and it also knows that multiplying a number by a static 1 implies the multiplication doesn t need to be done

1013553
dbf	dbase
dbf file is in c dbase clip53 prg stkmenu wpack3

1013561
folder	directory
instead you can put your browser definition files in your project under a separate folder or just under the project and change the build action to content or none and copy to output directory to copy always or copy if newer in the properties for each file you want to go to your bin folder

1013567
children	parent
if you don t need transactions and you only care about retrieving the direct children of an entity not all descendants use the approach outlined above but instead of a listproperty just use a referenceproperty to the parent entity

1013600
hash	salt
if they have the same hash on two sites they could have the same password this depends on the hash salt used by the sites what method etc

1013637
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in every browser i ve tested google-chrome firefox safari internet explorer it works great except in ie

1013644
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the output of this code looks pretty much identical in firefox google-chrome and safari on windows

1013673
nomethoderror	nameerror
basically just like when you call anobject.some_unknown_method ruby will call anobject.method_missing some_unknown_method before raising a nomethoderror using someunknownconstant triggers a const_missing someunknownconstant before raising a nameerror

1013702
rss	feed
with yahoo pipes using the create rss module it appears to use a hashed version of each entry s link to generate a guid which as you point out is necessary for most feed readers to detect new entries

1013702
rss	feed
i ve attempted to set the create rss module s guid field to a value that s unique for each entry however the guid in the resultant feed remains identical for each entry

1013752
gif	png
png or even gif

1013779
button	checkbox
i would like to make a checkbox that looks exactly like a button

1013801
integer	unsigned
a size_t is an unsigned integer type that is guaranteed to be big enough to store the size in bytes of any object in memory

1013885
range	max	range	min	min	max
for example if the set of ids is small relative to the total number in the table and you know that the ids are relatively close together perhaps they will usually be recent additions and therefore clustered at the high end of the range you could try and include the predicate and fieldw between 109 and 891 after determining the min max id in your set in the c# code

1013896
ssl	https
preferably the embedded web service could handle https ssl type connections

1013911
apache	nginx	passenger	thin
check the ec2onrails mailing list where there has been a lot of discussion of the various thin nginx passenger apache alternatives and permutations plus some hard data posted based on some decent tests

1013924
maven	pom.xml
because by adding a dependency to your pom.xml the maven dependency management automatically retrieves the artifact from the repositories you specified and installs it to the local repository

1013927
vim	notepad++
get a decent text editor like notepad++ or vim if you re already proficient with it

1013927
mouse	keyboard
it may be easier to navigate with your keyboard rather than a mouse

1013929
put	get
if i put a breakpoint on the line of control2 where the control1 delegate is assigned i can step through and watch it get set in the control1 object

1013962
ant	maven
i m not sure if there is a maven plugin to handle this but it is fairly simple to use the maven ant tasks for this purpose

1013962
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
you don t need to have maven or a pom.xml file just ant and this build file

1013990
ferret	sphinx
and use sphinx instead of ferret as well

1014019
division	modulo
division and modulo will get your answer in just a few lines of code

1014028
for-loop	arrays
but i m not sure if that s better than iterating through the original arrays in a for-loop and just changing the values

1014054
ubuntu	linux	vmware	virtualbox
you could install virtualbox vmware or some equivalent and run ubuntu or your preferred linux distribution of course that way gaining access to the full unix toolset

1014207
folder	directory
i have a vs2008 i want to copy certain files from a directory into my bin folder

1014228
folder	directory
thats not the case its in the folder configuration of the teamcity data directory .buildserver

1014238
pull	push
create a thread or threads to pull an item off the filename queue open and parse and process the file and push the results into a result queue

1014258
pull	push
have the cpu thread push completed data into a queue which the hard disk thread then pull from as data comes in

1014274
ienumerable	iqueryable
however since i ve been able to use linq in c# i ve found that it s often easier to just work with ienumerable and use the iqueryable extension methods to get the information i need

1014302
hash	salt
this ticket will either be encrypted with a secret key that the authorized servers share or will be stamped with a hash of the ticket contents salt with a secret key that the servers share

1014332
inherited	properties
when i have entity b inherited from entity a using table-per-type for storage and try to write a linq query that filters on a properties on b for example

1014356
hex	binary
i would imagine your database is really storing the data as binary but the query editor will show it using hex encoding

1014381
merb	ruby-on-rails
instead of t4toolkit it uses a ruby script to do the generation job just as with ruby-on-rails or merb

1014408
mouse	keyboard
you could use the windows api to add a low-level keyboard mouse hook then mark as away when there s been no activity for a while then mark as available when the activity begins again

1014410
perforce	cvs
i have used cvs subversion vss and perforce so far

1014498
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
also note that if i was 0 when it got tested in the condition then it will be 1 in loops body for the while example so if i is an index for an arrays or something and not just keeping track of loops iterations you d be better to stick with just a for-loop which increments i after each iteration

1014515
ironruby	ironpython
an ironpython or ironruby project can be compiled to a dll or executable just fine and will be real executables in every way with the proviso that the person running them must have the relevant .net framework and dependencies installed dependencies may be present in the same directory by default instead but the framework must be installed

1014539
hide	show
on some of my company page i want to use show and hide toggle details while click on links

1014601
min	max
the most useful feature of a treemap is when you want to quickly find the min or max key

1014601
min	max
and algorithmically can be done in o log n time as opposed to iterating over each key looking for a min max if the collection is unsorted

1014609
hide	show
you can hide and show elements with jquery hide and show functions there is also a slidedown function

1014664
getter	setter
the injected attributes of the class are final immutability the builder class contains setter but not getter it doesn t need to as we declare it as an inner class of the class that is being constructed and no setter need to be created just for spring

1014671
superclass	subclassing
the superclass if this is a subclassing

richfaces	icefaces
that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation

1014695
versioning	upgrade
one last thing you should do is to add table valued parameters to your wish-list of reasons to upgrade to the next versioning of sql server

1014734
fiddler	charles
i would bust out an http debugger like fiddler or charles for the mac and make sure the problem is ie and not something else like iis dropping mis-handling requests etc.

1014781
stdout	stderr
if you re using the exec task to execute devenv.exe change it to execute devenv.com this should print warnings to stdout i think it s stdout might be stderr but warnings shouldn t stop the build

1014817
pop-up	dialog
creating a pop-up dialog in an iframe

1014873
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit this appears to be the case in safari 3.x mac and google-chrome 3 alpha mac not in firefox mac

1014905

the server would have its data root directory and you can store groups of files in folder with a root meta-data entry in each folder

1014928
scrollable	panels
i am trying to create a scrollable panels within a table cell

1015052
hash	salt
use a hash algorith with salt to store paswords

1015052

but they are vulnerable to dictionary attacks so use salt concatane plain text with something long and verbose than hash it

1015059
yacc	bison
nmake msbuild lex yacc bison flex tex postscript xaml ssis wix

1015064

1015245
cvs	svn
create a legacy branch in svn cvs for 1.1 and maintain that separately

1015245
versioning	upgrade
i have been in this position before and i did a cost-benefit analysis for management and showed that it would cost more money to do the dual versioning than do the upgrade

1015280
bmp	png
the bmp and png maintain the same bit depth as the tif

1015298
gif	png
if you really need compatibility offer both gif png

1015330
width	height
title testwindow height 500 width 500

1015369
for-loop	loops
without an explicit loops variable the for-loop uses the special variable called

1015428
groupbox	panel
you can group three radiobuttons together using a groupbox or a panel as is done here

1015446
groupbox	panel
just put them in a panel or groupbox as suggested by matthew

1015461
qtcore	qtgui

so when you say you are telling the shell to redirect stderr fileno 2 into stdout fileno 1

1015596
apache	nginx
use nginx over apache

1015622
jobs	cron
i use cron jobs to call a script each minute looking something like this

maven	cobertura
i have a problem that when i run the cobertura target maven the report always shows 0 .i ve tried forking my junit tests and no luck

1015927
opera	firefox
a number of years ago there was a highly visible discussion about mis-use of http cookies leading to various cookie filtering proxys and eventually to active cookie filtering in browsers like firefox and opera

1015948
cvs	svn
another solution is to use the keyword substitution feature from cvs and svn perhaps git and mercurial have this feature too and make a clever use of this feature

1015950
portrait	landscape
in 3.0 uinavigationcontroller polls shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation on each push or pop and obeys what it returns the way you d expect if you re currently rotated in landscape left orientation and you push an instance of a view controller that only supports portrait orientation via shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation it automatically and instantly flips the logical orientation and slides in the new view the correct way in portrait orientation

1015978
coalesce	isnull
fyi - it s sql server syntax but coalesce is just like isnull for the most part

1016015
firefox	safari
these will load the page you give it in either firefox or safari and you can tweak them to loop like crazy and allow the flash movie to run

1016050
heroku	engineyard
in the beginning though if you just need the code updates and maybe rails migrations then you can do simpler things like passenger and code sync or look at tools like heroku or engineyard s stuff where they do a deploy by doing a git clone and then offer some additional abilities

1016073
post	get
the gist of it is that you join the wp_posts table with the taxonomy tables a couple times to get the post ids in your desired category and then join those ids with the taxonomy tables a couple more times to get the related tags

1016096
datamapper	activerecord
the application models a fairly complex domain and i d feel more comfortable using tools such as the ruby datamapper orm having using nhibernate in the .net world than rails activerecord

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
all of these considerations of course point to using merb yet i m aware that merb is being merged into ruby-on-rails for version 3 and will no longer exist as a distinct framework

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
i d really like to know if it would be worth starting development in merb now and then porting it to ruby-on-rails but i ve yet to find anything suggesting how difficult this may be

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
in essence i d like to know how portable a merb app is going to be to ruby-on-rails 3 but am aware that it may be too early for anyone other than the core developers to know this

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
the plan is to start working on ruby-on-rails immediately and to continue fixing bugs and resolving other major issues in merb in the interim

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
we will also release versions of merb specifically designed to help ease the transition to ruby-on-rails 3

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
in particular we will do merb releases with deprecation notices and other transitional mechanisms to assist developers in tracking down the changes that will come between merb 1.x and ruby-on-rails 3

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
expect a number of interim releases that get incrementally closer to ruby-on-rails 3 and expect parts of merb most notably the helpers to be ported to run on ruby-on-rails 3 in order to further reduce friction

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
if youâ ve already learned merb we will be working hard to make sure that you can parlay that knowledge into ruby-on-rails 3

1016096
merb	ruby-on-rails
at engine yard we fully intend to continue using merb for our internal apps until ruby-on-rails 3 is out but we will be using those non-trivial applications to be sure the experience is smooth for everyone

1016115
pop-up	dialog
you can pop-up dialog add content all interactively and save it all back to disk for future use

1016117
ant	emma
i m using emma in my ant process

1016137
post	get
if you searched for a phrase that was only in private post you would get a blank page without any error for example

1016166
pascal	delphi
if i recall correctly basic turned into pascal while pascal was busy turning into delphi

1016197
put	get
the problem is then the test classes are in their own libraries they don t get linked into the main test program unless i explicitly call them i have to put in

1016205
merb	ruby-on-rails
both the ruby-on-rails and merb communities are going to have to cope with the merging of the projects with the release of ruby-on-rails 3 but that s going to be awhile

1016205
merb	ruby-on-rails
likely after the ruby-on-rails 3 release you ll find great walk-throughs on upgrading your ruby-on-rails 2.x merb 1.x application to ruby-on-rails 3

1016215
hash	salt
the token could be a cryptographic hash of some salt plus the username so it couldn t be copied to give permission to another user

1016258
put	get	post	put	post	get
i want to be able to delete or view the contents of a particular post from one url by sending either delete put post or get not different urls with additional params

1016303
put	get
in this approach you just put all your classes into one namespace and get your code working

1016304
post	get
facebook s rest server is a pseudo one you can do it like them asking for the post method post get etc

1016304
put	get	post	put	post	get
in facebook you only have server.php and there is where you make the request even for post get put delete...

1016377
put	get	post	put	post	get
put post or get not different urls

1016413
comm	grep
it appears that grep -l solves the real problem of the poster but for the actual question asked finding the intersection of two sets of strings you might want to look into the comm command

1016440
put	get	post	put	post	get
those verbs get post put and delete together with the path indicate what you want to do to the data on the server

1016440
post	get
the request to render this url would look like get post 4

1016440
post	get
the item being deleted responding with a redirect to get post makes good sense

1016440
post	get
get post 4.xml is intuitive server please give me xml describing post #4. the response will be that xml

1016501
filtering	grouping
if you wish to not have a grouping of files within a project inspected you can filtering these files out so they are not inspected by creating a file filtering

1016512
postgresql	mysql
honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql

1016535
getter	setter
i think that getter and setter should only be used for variables which one needs to access or change outside a class

1016535
getter	setter
that s why i believe in the proper use of getter and setter but you don t need them for every private or protected variable

1016537
client-side	server-side
however you don t do this on the server-side with php you do it on the client-side with javascript

1016576
put	get
catch rowupdated and get the latest autoinc value in the db in put it in the new row

1016578
postgresql	mysql
also mssql and postgresql are said to scale better but there are various successful applications that seem to do fine with mysql facebook and flickr as examples

1016628
free	malloc
i can see how you could do this for memory allocated off the heap using a custom version of malloc and free but i don t know about enforcing it on the stack too

1016662
gif	png
concerning the mime type of the image only gif jpg and png are supported

1016664
onkeyup	onfocus
onpaste onkeyup and onfocus of the area for which you want to do this action

1016703
nsstring	nsdata
nsstring nsdata nsarray or

1016718
ubuntu	linux
this is how the ubuntu live-cd boots linux if you select to use another option

1016719
entities	entitymanager
the first ejb module is the one that will extend the base entities and add ejb to get it s entitymanager

1016765
urllib	httplib
in python i m using httplib because it keep-alive the http connection as oppose to urllib 2

1016765
httplib	cookielib
now i want to use cookielib with httplib but they seem to hate each other

1016819
put	get
again you don t have to use it and you can happily write a manual bootstrap class to get you used to how the framework is put together

1016853
versioning	upgrade
so i have been developing against the iphone 3.0 beta s and have just gone to upgrade to the final versioning released this week

1016896
width	height
therefore i need to get the screen width and screen height and then set position

1016930
int	chars
in this string the first three chars are alphabetical and the next seven are int

1016966
datamapper	activerecord
zend framework does not use activerecord but instead uses the table data gateway and row data gateway pattern and uses a datamapper to map the contents of the row data gateway to the model because activerecord breaks down when your models don t have a 1 1 mapping to your database tables

1016966
getter	setter
to me their example looks very bloated with a ton of getter and setter all over the place

1016966
getter	setter
i came across various blog posts about domain driven design arguing that using so many getter and setter is bad practice because it exposes all the inner model data to the outside so it has no advantage over public attributes

1016966
getter	setter
following the mvc and zend example seems to break ddd and leaves me typing up a whole lot of getter setter and datamappers for all my models

1016975
cos	sin
the coordinates of any point on an ellipse which center is x y are x + a cos c y + b sin c with a and b defining the size of the ellipse and c defining the angle in 0 2pi

1016986
foldable	traversable
foldable traversable typeclasses that abstract many of the operations of lists so that the same functions can be applied to other container types

1017043
int	chars
note unlike other escapes for unicode rtf uses the decimal signed short int 2 bytes representation for a unicode chars

1017065
folder	directory
as my properties file is necessarily in current directory in .. or in .. .. i wrote a small groovy code that checks these three folder

1017116
folder	directory
you rename the directory with subversion tortoisesvn whatever of course you have to rename the folder with the rename command of a subversion client otherwise you will end up in trouble

1017122
move	drag
using tortoisesvn right-click on folder you want to move and while holding button down drag to new location

1017132
children	parent
it is actually a simpler scenario parent child relationship with the children referencing their parent but you could probably adapt it for your needs

1017170
ubuntu	debian
if you re using debian or ubuntu something like

1017170
vim	emacs
you ll find that advanced editors like emacs and vim add a lot of functionality and so will help with ensuring that your syntax is correct before you try and build your document output

1017180
ubuntu	linux
most linux distributions have installation packages for tex live--see for example the package database entries for ubuntu and fedora

1017208
versioning	upgrade
once the first versioning of the database has been put into production you will need not only build scripts mainly for developers but also upgrade scripts based on the same principles

1017209
vim	emacs
most editors such as vim or emacs come with tex editing modes

1017255
int	chars
also note that in c++ the size of the int and chars members is not defined in bits

1017309
versioning	upgrade
i m also unsure whether including thiry-party components into versioning control is a good thing because of the space it takes - though you can also put them somewhere else and include them as external which makes it much smaller but also imposes the problem that upgrading the components for one app will upgrade them for all - so you better have good integration tests

1017339
jboss	weblogic
i am trying to run a jsf 1.2 application created using eclipse ganemede and jboss tools on weblogic 10.0 mp1

1017339
jboss	weblogic
i have configured a weblogic domain and a server using the jboss tools plugin through eclipse

1017344
post	get
will post if i get more

1017354
pylons	turbogears	web.py	turbogears	web.py	pylons
once you ve done this it s not very hard to take the next step and move to turbogears or pylons or web.py for a very simple framework

1017355
post	get
to get raw body of post request use

1017385
asterisk	ivr
asterisk - can do ivr and ivvr with some extensions but we use it for call management

1017409
postgresql	mysql
take mysql or postgresql

1017449
vim	gedit
it happened to me when used vim gedit or editors like that

1017471
int	boolean
pascal and similar languages are more strongly typed - enums pointers int and boolean cannot be randomly mixed and matched in expressions

1017523
postgresql	mysql
ms sql server express postgresql sql mysql

1017547
implements	extends
if you re looking to manage state across events such as the browser closing you ll need implements your own state management mechanism persist state to a database for example and use a regular cookie with a long lifetime or with a sliding expiration where you extends the lifetime by a small amount of time on each request in your server side script to match state to the user

1017565
udp	tcp
if that is the case please note that nagle is applicable only over tcp streams which segments data into packets whereas so_sndbuf is a also applicable to udp sockets

1017603
postgresql	mysql
in between those you have mysql postgresql sql server db2 and probably more

1017603
postgresql	mysql
if you re doing a typical webapp my advice would be to go with mysql or postgresql as they re free and well supported by just about any orm you could think of my personal preference is towards postgresql but i m not experienced enough with either of these to make a good argument one way or another

1017609
dictionary	map
- then you can still use one or more dictionary as indexes that map key values to your class instances

1017611
subtraction	addition
all modern hardware will have the same raw performance for either operation where addition and subtraction of any native data type has identical performance in terms of cycles to complete and pipeline side effects

1017611
subtraction	addition
floating point addition subtraction then comparison to an int

1017611
subtraction	addition
integral addition subtraction then comparison with a double may be different

1017649
pop-up	dialog
then on a js error it will pop-up a do you want to debug dialog box and you can choose to debug in vs.net

1017893
inherited	properties
similarly having a common ancestor recipe type super class means that its very properties fields and methods can be expected in all sub classes inherited child recipes in other words a generic chocolate cake recipe might be used to create two new specialized versions of a chocolate cake white chocolate cake and dark chocolate cake where the color of the chocolate merely becomes an attribute that may be configurable using a chocolate cake specific method like setchocolatecolor

1017926
pop-up	dialog
when the user clicks the link a dialog from the os pop-up and asks if you would like to call this number

1018007
punctuation	words
usually contains seperate words but not sentences ending containing commas and ending in period or equivalent punctuation

1018040
freebsd	netbsd
i don t know if this would be of any interest to you but here are two links to presentations from nyc bsd conference 2008 detecting tcp regressions with tcpdiff freebsd and an introduction to the automated testing framework atf for netbsd

1018063
folder	directory
the webapps folder contains several files and directory but only one .jar file

1018074
width	height
derive game objects from bitmap use existing x y width height bitmapdata

1018074
width	height
use own game object with x y width height bitmapdata

1018110
instances	transient
the purpose of didturnintofault is to give you a chance to release any instances variables particularly for transient values you might be holding

1018110
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
while it is meant to be used as a replacement for dealloc for nsmanagedobject subclasses that s because the life cycle of an nsmanagedobject is quite different from an ordinary nsobject

1018127
put	get
sending a little data should be simple you build a http get request and just put your data in the url - however there is a limit to the length of urls - sometimes this is restricted by device or by the network that you are using the device on - and sometimes by the server at the other end

1018142
vim	emacs
i couldn t use emacs as i am a very proud vim user

1018142
vim	emacs
i m just looking for something a little more polished than vim or emacs but not quite as heavyweight as netbeans or eclipse

1018143
rss	feed
update i see via hn that someone has used readability to mangle rss feed into a more useful format automagically

1018196
sorting	filtering
by first just selecting all nodes and sorting them i was able to then filtering out the nodes i didn t want with

1018381
width	height
in my case i used a stackpanel to host the control and at runtime i set the height and width of the control inside my windowsformshost to the height and width of the stackpanel

1018384
versioning	upgrade
now when you install this versioning onto a device that has the old model - it will automatically upgrade that model to the new model

1018391
getter	setter
when using a dependency property the get and set methods must just be simple wrappers for this.getvalue and this.setvalue the reason for this is that wpf does not use the getter or setter to access the value so you can t depend on the extra code running all the time

1018447
int	boolean
to give one tiny example when you distinguish clearly between expressions and statements as opposed to is syntactically incorrect for using a statement where an expression was expected and not merely a type error for using an int where a boolean was expected

1018510
integer	unsigned
first you are casting the pointer to a signed integer - that s wrong - pointers are unsigned

1018548
division	modulo
the code is deployed and works but i was wondering if there was a better approach than writing a bunch of if switch integer division and modulo statements

1018624
ilist	icollection
does not require icollection or ilist

1018655
width	height
the css below will give you two background images that don t scroll in the page background - set the width of #mydiv to whatever you want or leave it unset for 100 and its height to 2000px just to test the scrolling and use your image urls instead of the example

1018704
sorting	filtering
i m trying to write a linq to sql method that handles sorting paging and filtering for an ajax grid

1018715
emacs	gedit
now on linux i still prefer gedit to the other options i ve tried with apologies to vi and emacs fans

1018725
google-chrome	safari
and paste a snippet of the html so we can test in safari google-chrome

1018726
mouse	keyboard
when the field acquires focus via mouse or keyboard it should immediately show available options if they are not very numerous

1018760
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if you have another code process that you need to wait for completion you can either join that thread or use either a manualresetevent or autoresetevent

1018777
postgresql	mysql
also any solution that could export to mysql or postgresql database formats will be welcome

1018819
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you can use the asp.net controls such as gridview datagrid and point them render into stringbuilder using stringwriter no need to use asp.net page for this this is a simple example in console

1018833
wordpress	joomla
php is fine when written well and good for learning how to construct html templates and symfony seems like a sound framework but avoid starting off by hacking say wordpress or joomla

1018833
wordpress	joomla
well how to hack wordpress or joomla whereas the real leap is in learning to program

1018834
ubuntu	linux
our domain name points at a linux ubuntu 9.04 server clean install nothing apart from the load balancing software

1018834
ubuntu	centos
i have now changed over from ubuntu to centos 4 and have tried again now i am getting random replys from the systems when i use wireshark

1018853
alloca	malloc
alloca allocates memory from stack rather than heap which is case in malloc

1018869
getter	setter
as far a possible create everything as an object with properties that have getter where you hide complexity and setter only if they can t be read only

1018881
alloca	malloc
however if the thing you want to alloc using alloca is reasonably small i think that it s a good technique that s faster and more convenient than using malloc or otherwise

1018884
notepad++	textpad
notepad++ is a good choice and so is textpad

1018898
division	multiplication
this is also the reason why it has actually become incorrect to state that relational division is the relational inverse of cartesian product as real-number division is the inverse of real-number multiplication

1018974
spaces	delimiter
i have a delimiter string delimiter by spaces in my example below that i need to tokenize sort and then join back together and i need to do all this using xslt 1.0

1018994
integer	unsigned
you can use the binary signed integer b or integer unsigned integer i types

1019003
accessor	properties
error type of accessor does not match the type of properties comments

1019012
post	get
if you post some of your code you re likely to get more help with some specific recommendations to address this

1019063
coalesce	isnull
second do you have a lot of code that is using isnull or coalesce which you need to update these things slow performance so if you no longer need to check for them you should change the code

1019063
put	get
sometimes people will put in bad information to allow them to get rid of nulls

1019082
qapplication	qcoreapplication
if this doesn t work you could attempt to redirect the events to the desktop by calling qcoreapplication notify and passing the event to the desktop widget obtained by calling qapplication desktop

1019083
integer	unsigned
i have a big number integer unsigned stored in 2 variables as you can see the high and low part of number

1019083
subtract	add
i know how to add or subtract some other that-kind of variable

1019093
hide	show
this uses a manual tooltip and timer to show hide a caption when the mouse moves over the title bar

1019100
width	height
but i love the fact that i can define image skins in the theme s skin files and don t have to cut and paste width height alternativetext align attributes for common images that i use lots of places throughout the site

1019118
datamapper	activerecord
i was trying to separate my dal from my business layer and in doing so i decided to eschew any activerecord approach and go for a datamapper approach

1019164
bazaar	git
for the dvcs we re considering mercurial bazaar and git

1019167
client-side	server-side
the server-side of a web service can return a message to the client-side

1019204
iprincipal	iidentity
i am using .net s iidentity and iprincipal objects for role based security and i am at the step of modifying controls shown based on roles the current user has

groupbox	panel
a groupbox may have a caption whereas a panel may not

1019215
bazaar	git
if you choose a dvcs mercurial bazaar -- or git since it works really well on windows you would not be able to get the same inheritance effect -- when you are selecting different versions with different successive select rules -- as said in that answer

1019258
groupbox	panel
the panel control is similar to the groupbox control

1019258
groupbox	panel
however only the panel control can have scroll bars and only the groupbox control displays a caption

1019258
groupbox	panel
also border styles of groupbox and panel are different

1019281
x86	64bit
windows uses completely different data structures to implement exception handling on 32-bit vs 64bit and on itanium vs x86

1019296
subtract	add
3 subtract shifted divisor from dividend and add one to result

1019305
datalist	repeater
the datalist is similar to a repeater in that you have to explicitly declare the emitted markup but offers more robust paging capabilities especially along with the datapager control

1019357
width	height
i get questions a lot from designers about not only width but what height to use to keep everything above the fold

1019359
subtraction	addition	subtraction	add	subtract	addition	subtract	add
you can do addition and subtraction of arbitrarily large binary objects using the assembler looping and add subtract with carry adc sbb instructions

1019365
accessor	properties
error type of accessor does not match the type of properties

1019383
folder	directory
i was wondering if it was possible to bind some filenames in a given directory of the clientbin folder to a combobox

1019389
multiplication	exponent
in other words fully factor the number into unique primes and exponent and do a simple multiplication from there

1019392
put	get
well get rid of the quotes then trim then put the quotes back

1019393
int	double
there s an identical question here in c# convert string to nullable type int double etc...

1019406
vim	emacs
despite being a vim user i m interested in starting to learn emacs

1019406
vim	emacs
however whenever i start to follow the emacs tutorial i end up hitting vim commands by accident and get frustrated with it

1019417
vim	emacs
the duration and intensity of the vim versus emacs debate suggests rather strongly that both editors are about equal in their usefulness

1019419
16-bit	64bit	128bit	64bit
if your processor or your c library has a fast 64bit divide you can break the 128bit divide into pieces the same way you d do a 32-bit divide on processors that had 16-bit divisions

1019461
post	get
from this post someone mentions recording x11 events this may get you halfway

1019465
vim	emacs
i don t have any experience with this i use vim but vimpulse is an emacs script to emulate vim as apposed to viper-mode which emulates vi

1019508
jquery	scriptaculous
if you haven t it s probably a browser compatibility issue - i would try jquery dojo or scriptaculous because they work smoothly with common browsers

1019518
accessor	properties
if you want to be sure that the returned array is not mutable you could declare the properties as in your original example and then roll your own accessor

1019558
post	get
i have heard that web crawlers are supposed to follow only get requests and not post ones

1019573
hdd	floppy
i m working on a project where the user is able to save their work most likely to the hdd but also possibly any other media including floppy disks

1019594
getter	setter
properties specially automatic properties in .net 3.5 are more concise than setter getter and less lines of code less code to maintain less bugs

1019647
getter	setter
maybe a minor point but with getter setter i find it annoying that when i m cycling through them in an ide with intellisense there s a massive block of getter next to each other and another block of setter

1019648
min	max
not the min one or the max value but the top n value encountered by sql server 2008

1019649
accessor	properties
properties are a runtime supported method of exposing a pair of get set methods that have metadata support which means they are discoverable using reflection without guessing what methods are supposed to form the accessor based on method name and signature

1019649
getter	setter
in the case of properties it doesn t mater if there is ambiguity between a function call and field access because for the greatest part you don t pay the function call cost property getter and setter because of their simplicity are high candidates for inlining which means that cost wise the are closer to fields than function calls

1019659
getter	setter
it is implied that a getter setter will be quick

1019678
postgresql	mysql
therefore postgresql and mysql developers don t get feel the need to improve it

1019751
perforce	svn
when i worked for a company in the middle of a switch the decision was between svn and perforce

1019808
multiplication	exponent
as int exponent gets larger taking powers might be faster than multiplication

1019822
translation	localization
then i ll incorporate the localization using the integrated translation environment and distribute localized updates

1019823
nscountedset	nsmutableset
the ability to optionally make nsset nsmutableset nscountedset store and enumerate objects in sorted order like a binary search tree would certainly be welcome

1019823
nsscanner	nsnumberformatter
currently you have to roll your own with an nsnumberformatter or nsscanner and the process is tedious and error-prone

1019823
nsstring	nsnumberformatter
for example see nsnumberformatter to format us telephone numbers and remove all but numbers from nsstring .

1019846
getter	setter
with properties you can eliminate the boilerplate getter and setter for the 90 of properties that have only trivial getter and setter

1019873
width	height
i have fixed width height div

1019904
stdio	gets
note this also gets rid of the stdio and stderr

1019915
inherited	subclassing
mysub is now a subclassing of drvcrystalfontz and some_other_class inherited their methods and adds a new one some_extra_method

1019931
serializable	deserialization
while this limitation is understandable for deserialization i would be satisfied with just serializable for web use

1019934
comparator	comparable
treeset uses comparator defined by comparable or compare defined by comparator

1019938
google-chrome	safari
i m aware of this question but none of the answers work in safari google-chrome etc

1019954
qpalette	qstyle
an alternative could be to use qpalette to get the correct colours and qstyle to get the correct spacing

1019992
getter	setter
as for why to use properties instead of getter setter methods i would suggest the following thoughts

1020038
vim	emacs
as you probably know from learning vim vim and emacs fluency comes only with tons of practice until the commands become second-nature

1020038
vim	emacs
it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa

1020038
vim	emacs
after a while you start to compartmentalize the two mentally and you probably won t have much difficulty though i still occasionally wq emacs and c- vim it doesn t happen often enough to be a problem

1020038
vim	emacs
a lot of the terminology and functionality of vim and emacs is similar but just different enough to make it all confusing

1020038
vim	emacs
much like h is indispensable in vim the emacs help system is a great boon in navigating emacs enormous set of builtin commands

1020038
vim	emacs
emacs will never be as good a vim as vim

1020038
vim	emacs
the emacs way of doing things is very different but it has strengths and weaknesses of its own compared to the vim set of keybindings

1020038
vim	emacs
nowadays i have borrowed a bunch of emacs shortcuts and mapped them in vim and vice versa

1020038
vim	emacs
when not if emacs starts to make you foam at the mouth in rage take a break hop into vim and come back later

1020038
vim	emacs
you aren t going to forget vim and replace it in your brain with emacs

1020038
vim	emacs
if you know vim and you learn emacs then you will know both

1020072
qapplication	qcoreapplication
see qapplication or qcoreapplication for a method named something like post

1020081
submit	submission
the web server accepts an upload of the source file a process polls the submission directory processes the file and then submit the result to another directory which the web application polls until it finds the result and displays it

1020081
freebsd	linux
since you use linux i d investigate user mode linux or linux-vserver which are very similar in concept to freebsd jails i ve never used them myself but have read about them

1020086
irrlicht	ogre3d
one way to get back in and have fun at the same time is to go through nehe s opengl tutorials or by using higher-level gaming frameworks such as irrlicht or ogre3d

1020126
ilist	icollection
the code below will work with any ilist or icollection but the same technique can be used with any data source like always if you want the display to update when you add or remove items you need to use an observablecollection or similar

1020168
mouse	keyboard
humans use the computer through the keyboard mouse and interaction with the console or the window manager

1020175
google-chrome	firefox
but not just internet explorer it should also work for anyone trying to run google-chrome or firefox too

1020218
hash	salt
tradeoff hashing will not help much if your attacker knows both the hash pin and the salt

1020236
mouse	keyboard
humans use the computer through the keyboard mouse and interaction with the console or the window manager

1020236
mouse	keyboard
no keyboard no mouse no console no window manager

1020236
post	get
all i see are http get and post requests

1020236
mouse	keyboard
i have no use for keyboard mouse console or window manager

1020243
portrait	landscape
also supporting dynamically change screen sizes between portrait and landscape

1020249
hash	salt
so you will use a properly salt hash

1020256
maven	pom.xml
if you don t want to use maven for your own project you will need to modify the libraries poms and repackage them yourself download the sources add the above snippet to pom.xml and run mvn package

1020258
post	put
the post or put payload can contain data organized however you want

1020259
hash	salt
passwords with salt hash are best

1020275
cvs	svn
svn cvs done right as they claim is somewhat better

1020275
cvs	svn
so if you have real need for branching and merging at least get svn not cvs

1020312
getter	setter
this data is centralized by means of a singleton class which aggregates a couple of arraycollections arrays value objects and some other native member variables exposed via getter and setter

1020339
bazaar	git
the big hosting sites for mercurial bitbucket git github and bazaar launchpad should give you plenty of projects to browse and hopefully contribute to -

1020370
folder	directory
one thing to note is that my iis virtual directory only contains my silverlightapp.web folder

1020429
mantis	bugzilla
you don t have to do what everyone else is doing take for example the loads of time wasting cms projects out there while there seems to be no proper ocr in java and jira is a great issue tracking system no doubt but its not open source bugzilla sucks don t say mantis and eventum is written in php i m a java fanatic

1020437
hex	binary
14 could be written as xiv in roman numerals fourteen or 0xfe in hex or 11111110 in binary

1020483
hide	show
the usual solution is to show hide them as appropriate

1020503
bluetooth	usb
they both run on a pc and remotely control the nxt via bluetooth or usb

1020560
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it s not jquery but in firefox opera and safari you can use window.getcomputedstyle element to get the computed styles for an element and in ie 8 you can use element.currentstyle

1020586
x86	64bit
intel adopted amd s extensions for 64bit instructions so a value of x86_64 means you re running either an intel or amd 64bit processor otherwise you re running the regular x86 isa

1020604
keydown	keyup
that is used in the drupal.jsac function to bind the element s keydown keyup and blur events with triggers the autocomplete ajax operation which caches its values in the acdb object for that element opens popups etc

1020604
hide	show
it may be more sensible to create different autocomplete fields and simply hide and show them based on the value of the select

1020621
mp3	ogg
ended up going with javazoom s vorbis spi and jorbis for ogg vorbis music after we found out we d need to pay royalties if we used mp3 via jlayer also from javazoom

1020630
strsplit	substr
for example you can write a generic version of strsplit that returns a strongly typed list so long as you tell it how to convert substr into t s

1020647
stateless	stateful
it attempts to turn stateless browser requests into a beast resembling a stateful form application not always successful and usually not gracefully large viewstate hidden fields broken back button functionality reliance on javascript for simple navigation

1020671
ienumerable	ienumerator
pass an ienumerator string rather than the ienumerable string by calling getenumerator

1020678
dictionary	map
this is not a suggested solution but the easiest way to see that this will always work is that you could store these immutable values into a map dictionary hashtable like structure keyed by a variable name

1020708
lisp	scheme
eventually you will probably develop a preference for scheme or common lisp but they both have enough differences that it s best to get a handle on everything that s out there

1020708
lisp	scheme
scheme has continuations for example and it s good to learn about those in scheme even though they can be implemented in common lisp

1020710
pop-up	dialog
i am having difficulty with the dialog box that pop-up when i try to check out a document

1020712
gif	png	gif	ico	gif	bmp	bmp	png	png	ico
input formats include bmp gif ico jpg jpeg and png

1020740
put	get
put x in get y out

1020740
put	get
now you put in a value of 3 in and you get a value of 6 out

1020753
getter	setter
protected means that a class and its subclasses have access to the variable but not any other classes they need to use a getter setter to do anything with the variable

1020754
public	protected
broadly speaking public means everyone is allowed to access private means that only members of the same class are allowed to access and protected means that members of subclasses are also allowed

1020766
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	irix	solaris	aix	gentoo	solaris	gentoo	linux	irix	linux	redhat	fedora
streamcm runs on a variety of platforms - unix solaris aix hp-ux irix etc. linux redhat fedora gentoo etc. windows xp vista and on macos ppc and intel

1020775
postgresql	mysql
the database would be postgresql or mysql

1020776
implements	modifiers
they are access modifiers and help us implements encapsulation or information hiding

1020806
lisp	scheme
this is no doubt why the little schemer was translated from lisp into scheme

1020810
union	distinct
this is effectively a pivot but it s easiest to represent as the union of two distinct sets - the set of publications and the set of areas they are linked to

1020810
union	distinct
a union all will probably produce multiple areas is two publications are in the same area so you ll need a distinct to stop the duplicates there if you use union all

1020819
width	height
the check for a monochrome cursor simply tests whether the height is twice the width

1020820
int	chars
a quick program with a simple structure containing int and chars members and a function showed that size of the structure was sizeof int +sizeof chars

1020820
int	chars
i have a one big struct class with simple int chars etc data types but a large number of them

1020822
postgresql	mysql
pyqt4 s qtsql module in particular supports mysql postgresql and several other databases

1020828
jdom	dom4j
jon doe suggested dom4j and jdom

1020843
mantis	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla
also using mylyn allows you to migrate your tasks to real back-end when you re ready like bugzilla trac mantis etc

1020848
jdom	dom4j
dom4j or jdom are probably the most elegant you can write code how you like it

1020862
stateless	stateful
stateless programming is just as expressive and powerful as stateful programming it just requires a little practice to train yourself to start thinking statelessly

1020862
stateless	stateful
of course stateless programming when possible stateful programming where necessary seems to be the motto of most impure functional languages

1020885
width	height
the height width and opacity of each

1020885
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout
also there are other ways to hide and reveal elements such as fadein and fadeout

1020891
google-chrome	safari
testing in google-chrome or safari

1020943
client-side	server-side
i m using the jquery validate plugin for client-side processing yes backed up with server-side stuff too the validation can t be done inline as the form needs to pass xhtml strict edit see my addendum below

1020991
stdout	stderr
reading stdout and stderr and communicating via stdin

1020994
lisp	scheme
however my lisp-oid experience is was mostly with scheme rather than common lisp so i may be subconsciously biased by the familiarity with the uniform namespace that in the end comes from that experience

1020997
lisp	scheme
a lisp-1 has a single namespace for both variables and functions as in scheme while a lisp-2 has separate namespaces for variables and functions as in common lisp

1020997
lisp	scheme
lisp-1 refers to scheme s model and lisp-2 refers to common lisp s model

1021044
packets	multicast
their is a special handshake at the switch level its telling the switch you are part of the multicast group so that you will also receive the packets

1021044
packets	multicast
what you need to do is join the multicast group then just recv the packets and write them to a file then i would assume the mpeg2 mpeg4 or however the stream is sent will be a file on your machine that should be playable through another program

1021077
versioning	upgrade
there are some very few obscure breaking changes when you upgrade to later versioning of the framework usually due to the use of deprecated apis or non-standard methods

1021131
boost	stl
for general purpose boost is best of breed and don t forget about the good old stl so i don t see the point of looking for something else that will cover much of the same ground but is not as polished

1021209
mouse	keyboard
the input structures can either be a mouse or keyboard event

1021217
width	height
then pretty much resize the movie as the browser window is resized and calculate the height from the new width divided by the original aspect ratio

1021238
mouse	keyboard
here is how you simulate input both mouse and keyboard

1021246
wav	flac
i second lunatiks answer but suggest flac instead of wav

1021246
mp3	flac
flac stands for free lossless audio codec an audio format similar to mp3 but lossless meaning that audio is compressed in flac without any loss in quality

1021246
mp3	flac
this is similar to how zip works except with flac you will get much better compression because it is designed specifically for audio and you can play back compressed flac files in your favorite player or your car or home stereo see supported devices just like you would an mp3 file

1021246
wav	flac
the reason why you d want to go with a lossless method flac or wav for storage in a warehouse is as follows

1021246
mp3	wav
if you do for example wav - mp3 - rm you will end up with a file that has artifacts from mp3 encoding and rm encoding

1021269
int	chars
in this case you have one box on the floor with the variables argc an int argv a pointer to a chars array a an int and b an int

1021276
mp3	ogg
xiph the people behind ogg vorbis have published a comparison between the leading codecs rm mp3 wma aac and ogg - you can listen and compare each of the codecs

1021318
fiddler	charles
a web debugging proxy fiddler charles etc.

1021322
public	protected
public private and protected keywords are used to specify access to these members properties and methods of a class from other classes or other .dlls or even other applications

1021345
put	get	for-loop	loops
put that in a for-loop to loops the color from 0 to 15 and you will get kids excited about programming

1021348
int	boolean
the mechanism which has the test on one line doesn t have that issue but generally it would be better to separate the test into a function which takes an int representing a year and returns a boolean representing whether or not the year is a leap year

1021354
macbook	isight
i had an old ibm laptop that had a keyboard light led mounted in the top of the lcd frame where the isight is on a macbook or macbook pro

1021397
helpers	actioncontroller
my conclusion was that you can have the config in place but you need to work with frontcontroller plugins or actioncontroller helpers

1021397
helpers	actioncontroller
from the helpers you can then load the actioncontroller and on that execute the getinvokeargs to load the bootstrap

1021402
post	get
i m not sure you can do it for post parameters but in case you will use get method you can pass parameters explicitly

1021404
postgresql	mysql
any relational database will do mysql postgresql sqllite oracle sql server - pick one

1021406
post	get
i don t understand why i get this message because i send a freshly created token in my post request

1021418
chm	winhelp
it s all available from the embarcadero website here in chm winhelp pdf html format

1021444
google-chrome	firefox
after trying jitters suggestion and getting it working in ie8 i realised the issue was with firefox and google-chrome when i click the button only

1021464
getter	setter
i m changing some classes of mine from an extensive use of getter and setter to a more pythonic use of properties

1021464
getter	setter
but now i m stuck because some of my previous getter or setter would call the corresponding method of the base class and then perform something else

1021464
getter	setter
how to call the property getter or setter in the parent class

1021470
django	web.py
for server-side actually almost every web framework web.py django etc. has its own form generation as well as validation lib for you to use

1021540
perforce	svn
i m not a git or svn user my main experience is with perforce but i ll try and outline some best practices that should work for any large enterprise level scm system

1021562
integer	unsigned
using 2 digits provides 31 major releases for signed 16 bit integer or 63 for unsigned

1021625
post	get
it seems that the server continues to add the normal get post content for that url

1021634
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
there are other frameworks out there that solve the same problem in a more straightforward fashion i suggest you have a look at openrasta and snooze or even asp.net-mvc

1021658
antlr	irony
you could pick a parsing framework that has a lot of existing grammars like antlr or newer ones like irony and use that

1021737
for-loop	loops
i was trying to figure out if a for-loop was faster than a foreach loops and was using the system.diagnostics classes to time the task

1021747
width	height
set exact width and height for them and overflow hidden and a float left on the li s

1021768
cvs	svn
it has a file control plugin that should do the trick among cvs svn and others

1021800
width	height
at the end of generating a crossword give it a score based on how many of the words were placed the more the better how large the board is the smaller the better and the ratio between height and width the closer to 1 the better

1021848
vbscript	jscript
keep in mind that classic asp includes jscript as well as vbscript

1021848
vbscript	jscript
interestingly you can parse json using jscript and use the resulting objects directly in vbscript

1021848
vbscript	jscript
you can access the contents of the jscript array from vbscript using dot notation

1021849
ant	maven
use a tool like ant or maven to specify and compile all the files in various packages and produce your final distribution

1021854
filesystems	xfs
among popular filesystems such as ext3 ext4 xfs jfs reiserfs reiser4 etc

1021857
factors	matrix
this one is about highly parallelizable approximate matrix factors suitable for use in kernel methods in machine learning

1021921
put	get
well it is possible to get the string that you need to put into the createquery method automatically

1021930
client-side	server-side
to smoothly integrate client-side dojo functionality with django server-side web apps i d look at dojango which does work fine with gae as well as without

1021959
width	height
you can have attributes like height width number of rooms city where it is located etc

1021984
queue	fifo
if you have large files or lots of traffic you could persist a fifo queue in a database and have a windows service take them out and execute them

1021988
min	max
i didn t want to know the exact number of rows that would return i just wanted to know if it would return rows that were between 1 and 100 or if it would return rows from min userid to 1 and 100 to max userid

1021990
nunit	mstest
for testing frameworks both nunit and mstest are good

1021990
nunit	mstest
there are nunit addins available for vs but they are quite as fully integrated as mstest

1021990
post	get
there s a blog post here about how to get going with that and an article here

1022000
googletest	gmock
i ran into this issue trying to detect googletest and gmock the google unit testing and object mocking frameworks with autotools and here s what i came up with

1022024
crypt	salt
function char crypt const char key const char salt

1022024
crypt	salt
the crypt function takes a password key as a string and a salt character array which is described below and returns a printable ascii string which starts with another salt

1022024
crypt	salt
without a salt an intruder can make a guess run crypt on it once and compare the result with all the passwords

1022024
crypt	salt
with a salt the intruder must run crypt once for each different salt

1022024
crypt	salt
the result of crypt will be the salt followed by a if the salt didn t end with one followed by 22 characters from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z up to 34 characters total

1022024
crypt	salt
for the des-based algorithm the salt should consist of two characters from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z and the result of crypt will be those two characters followed by 11 more from the same alphabet 13 in total

1022024
crypt	salt
to verify a password against the result of a previous call to crypt pass the result of the previous call as the salt

1022024
proftpd	vsftpd
if you want ftp-only users i would recommend using a ftp daemon that supports virtual users like glftpd pure-ftpd proftpd vsftpd .

1022026
accessor	properties	getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
java uses getter and setter or accessor and mutators wheras in c# you might be making properties for your classes

1022030
subtract	add
you can t sum dates but you can subtract them and get a time interval that you can halve and add back to the first date

1022051
getter	setter
the fact that some getter don t have a corresponding setter is normal since you might not want every attribute to be both accessed and changed

jruby	mri
the details vary by implementation but i know that at least in jruby and mri 1.8 there is a construct called an include class that is inserted in to the inheritance chain of a class when a module is extended or included

1022106
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i don t know why sortedlist and sorteddictionary don t as both would be able to search pretty easily

1022107
mvp	presenter
typically when you start implementing stuff using the mvp pattern you will start writing presenter logic at the same time defining the view interface

1022114
websphere	ibm
but i had a quick look to see if there are any messaging appenders for log4j i use log4net quite often - ibm have an article on a websphere mq jms appender which might be helpful to you

1022135
udp	tcp
it has very small overhead and is mostly used over udp or local unix sockets but may use tcp if you need reliable logging

1022170
ant	maven
if you are using fairly standard tools such as svn and ant maven - you should have a build up and running in 5 minutes

1022190
hudson	bamboo
we use hudson too and if it wasn t the recession we would probably use bamboo and most of the atlassian products bamboo crucible confluence together with jira

1022220
sorting	grouping
this is called natural sorting where you effectively treat a grouping of digits as a single character

1022225
sorting	filtering
this may also instruct sql server to filtering on k1 k3 k4 k5 k6 and order on k7 asc in one pass permitting sql server to stream the query results without the intermediate step of sorting a million results first

1022235
codeigniter	cakephp
once thing i will tell you is that if you want to streamline your understanding and your efficiency i have found great success with a number of mvc frameworks codeigniter cakephp etc

1022269
dictionary	map
most of us are familiar with the dictionary abstract data type that stores key-value associations whether we call it a map dictionary associative array hash etc

1022288
capitalize	uppercase

1022429
cpython	ironpython
i would like to make my code portable across python implementations cpython ironpython and jython

1022466
inherited	subclassing
worker ant queen ant drone ant derive from ant and thus exhibit ad-hoc polymorphism where they all derive from the same ant class and exibit subtyping polymorphism inherited of the ant class these ants are all a subclassing of the ant class and inherited the 6 legs 2 eyes 3 body segments etc

1022504
rss	feed
it looks like is messed up as are the 0.92 and 2.0 rss feed

1022514
put	get

1022596
ada	pascal
pascal and many of its descendants too - ada modula oberon etc.

1022602
maven	pom.xml
you should be able to compile your code by adding the gmaven plugin to your maven pom.xml

1022646
persistent	transient
i shouldn t need to double the number of model classes just to have transient versions of my objects â not when i want them to behave exactly the same sans persistent

1022646
persistent	transient
yes the other option is to have an in-memory persistent store which houses all of the entities you want to be transient

1022659
postgresql	mysql
if you decide to switch to mysql or postgresql you can run the following standard command to save your database on the windows machine

1022659
postgresql	mysql
and then configure the settings.py on the linux machine for the mysql or postgresql database and run

1022683
opera	firefox
while it isn t yet standard in javascript mozilla s js engine and opera s to an extent has supported a similar feature since js 1.7 available as part of firefox 2 under the name destructuring assignment

1022683
for-loop	loops
in javascript the body of a for-loop doesn t introduce a new scope so any functions declared in loops body all reference the same outer variables

1022683
for-loop	loops
in lua each iteration of the for-loop creates new local variables for each loops variable

1022719
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
if you use box-sizing border-box you can set width 100

1022719
width	margin
and the total of the width border margin and padding will be what is specified for the width

1022719
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.5 and safari 4 support it not sure about ie8 or google-chrome

1022726
clang	llvm
llvm clang doesn t seem prime-time ready

1022734
getter	setter
you don t need to implement all the getter setter you can use__get and __set

1022743
multiplying	add
let s solve the system as they teach in some high schools multiplying first equation by second by -a.m 1 and add if in doubt do this on a piece of paper to solve for v.x

1022743
integer	fractions
this function only works for integer values of n even though for some matrices we can also define a fractions power such as square root in other words a matrix b such that

1022743
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
because those are still instances of our matrix class we can do quite a lot of operations with those addition subtraction multiplication division power - it s all already implemented

1022751
width	height
however the user then resizes the window and i can resize the rectangle correctly by using a transformation based on the ratio of the new height and width to the old height and width but i lose my relative positioning the rectangle s coordinates are now incorrect see image - this is a rough mockup of the problem

1022751
width	height
its resize is constrained by the other application but the aspect ratio width height changes by some unknown function

1022794
ant	emma	ant	maven
i know you can in standalone emma and with ant but i haven t yet figured out how to do this with maven and emma

1022838
google-chrome	firefox
explorer ie firefox portable google-chrome portable iron chrom without google crap also portable qtweb arora

1022839
google-chrome	firefox
explorer ie firefox portable google-chrome portable iron chrom without google crap also portable qtweb arora

1022840
google-chrome	firefox
web-browser ie firefox portable google-chrome portable iron chrom without google crap also portable qtweb arora

1022846
width	height
you can hook into every resize event and get the values there but in most case you can t just ask for a height or width and get what you want

1022880
width	height
in drawframe i set width and height

1022880
width	height
in drawcircle i need to access the width and height of drawframe

1022895
width	height
then you can get the width height like so

1022918
x86	64bit
see documentation x86 boot.txt link to 2.6.30 s version for more detail for the traditional x86 architecture both 32-bit and 64bit including how these variables are passed to the kernel setup code

1022952
width	height
thatâ s because you are not setting the width and height fields in jframe but you are setting them on local variables

1022952
width	height
fields height and width are inhereted from imageobserver

1022952
width	height
if width and height represent state of the frame then you could refactorize them to fields and write getters for them

1022952
width	height
in drawframe i set width and height

1022952
width	height
width and height of drawframe

1022983
getter	setter
some things require public getter and setter like serialization and patterns like the data transfer object pattern

1022985
getter	setter
getter and setter hide your classes data specifics from the users of your classes

1022985
getter	setter
if you don t use getter and setter when you change your mind about a data member you break your classes interface and must alter the rest of your codebase to conform to the change

1022985
getter	setter
if you wrap your properties in getter and setter you can make those changes and hide them from consuming code by modifying the getter and setter methods

1022994
post	get
it is basically a primitive version control system and i use both http get and http post to transfer files and strings

1022995
getter	setter
getter and setter are one aspect of implementing the open close principle

1022995
getter	setter
they are so important that c# went through the trouble to make basic getter and setter easy to write

1023017
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox but it crashes safari the first time it tries to set the background color in the if statement

1023066
free	malloc
your habit of ending something that you started - whether it be the closing parenthesis bracket brace or the .close call to match .open or delete free call to match your new malloc - is an excellent one

1023066
vim	emacs
the direct answer to your question most good programmer editors can be customized configured so you ll just have to do some reading about advanced configuration of the editor of your choice - vim emacs the visual studio editor

1023101
draggable	droppable
if you re working on a rich interactive ui you ll find jquery ui interactions such as draggable droppable resizable etc to be a handy base to build upon

1023103
int	double
but as i continue my exploration of c# i notice that int double float in c# has some inheritance hierarchy as they inherit from

1023119
fink	macports
you should already have curl mine is at usr bin curl which you can use to get the fink or macports downloads

1023188
width	height
if what you need is the width and height of the frame in the circle why not pass the drawframe width and height into the drawcircle constructor

1023188
width	height
when changing the drawcircle constructor as described at the top of my post dont forget to add the width and height to the call to the constructor in drawframe

1023214
post	get
ideally i would like to turn on an option in php for that user to pass the session id back and forth via get post if their cookies are messed up

1023284
dictionary	map
from what i understand a map is a dictionary that has additional rules including ordering

1023331
int	double
btw i wouldn t use float ever and float i would avoid as well as it only accurate to 6 places i would suggest using int long or double

1023333
glassfish	weblogic	glassfish	geronimo	jboss	weblogic	jboss	geronimo	jboss	glassfish	weblogic	geronimo
i suppose that when you said i had made my project in j2ee you mean an enterprise application which runs on a j2ee server such as glassfish jboss weblogic geronimo etc

1023383
lxml	elementtree
for example little desktop utilities written with the python gtk bindings or website maintenance scripts written with lxml and elementtree

1023390
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
if you implement ilist you must also implement icollection and ienumerable

1023432
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
by implementing it in arraylist it becomes easy for one to know - which interfaces arraylist implements rather that going up to ilist to find that it implements icollection ienumerable

1023432
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
the class derived from ilist hence indirectly implements icollection ienumerable as well

1023432
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
so even if you write your own class implementing ilist and not add icollection ienumerable in the declaration - you will see that it will have to provide the implementation for icollection ienumerable

1023459
rss	feed
twitter knows it is getting impossible to tell your friends what you are doing via email sms blogs feed rss and so on so takes care of it

1023478
vsto	add-in
based on your description it is enough but if you need to create an add-in i would just look at vsto

1023503
hash	salt
they use salt in their hash and have quite some parameters to tweak the hash

1023509
hash	salt
salt is a randomly generated string that is included in the input for your hash function

1023509
hash	salt
when authenticating you retrieve the salt and the stored hash you prefix the given password with the stored salt and hash the two together

1023558
getdate	dateadd
you can also do this inside the database with getdate and dateadd ... or datediff ...

1023565
hide	show
control this form with show and hide methods from the outside code

1023572
hash	salt
if you store the hash and salt in a database and the key in the filesystem then this prevents anyone from cracking your hash if they get their hands on your stored hash and salt

1023583
min	max
the fastest one i can think of is to find min max y coordinates within a polygon loop repeated n times with two compares and two stores and then to compare if the min y y max y

1023583
multiplying	add
somehow i feel this could be solved more mathematically but i always end with slower code for example vector way -- i need to compute differences for n i and n i+1 then multiplying them add etc -- much slower then 2 cmps+stores

1023594
min	max
you could short circuit it as well as if you get partway through the check and have a min + max that are and your y value then you have an intersection

1023610
min	max
if you can cache the min max y value with the polygon then you can save time by not looping each vertex every time you do the test

1023618
google-chrome	firefox
i have just tested it with firefox and google-chrome for my application and page refresh does not clear the history

1023655
content-length	content-type
now you know the content-type and content-length maybe you need this for some kind of allocation

1023664
hash	salt
difference of hash values without salt the same 2 passwords generate the same 2 hash

1023678
folder	directory
in sql management studio connect to your server right click on the databases folder and choose attach browse to your database and select it note that you may need to move it to a directory sql can see - by default sql runs as network service and cannot peer inside c users

1023697
ienumerable	icollection
from my point of view though icollection implements ienumerable while sets don t have to be enumerable --- example set of real numbers between 1 and 2 even more sets can be generated dynamically

1023745
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have built a site in wordpress and the home page is really screwed up in ie but works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari

1023785

i m wanting to have our own context which provides some helpers on top of the standard httpcontext httprequest httpresponse etc objects

1023865
width	height
if it s a bar graph it creates a rectangle of width 0 origin at x frame.size.height-y and height y

1024009
width	height
the problem is the image s width height change to be smaller than the actual image

1024025
verilog	vhdl
also you can check out for vhdl and verilog modules

1024025
verilog	vhdl
you can select different cores input parameters and get ready-to-use vhdl or verilog component

1024028
submit	submission
next you re going to want to run some javascript on form submission so you should set the onclick property of your submit button to a function such as the following

1024030
put	get
right after i set it if i print i get the right value but if i put it after that for by the end of the function when i print i get the first char of novoestado- rotulo.

1024043
inherited	properties
i have a custom control that inherited from usercontrol and i can t get it s properties to show in intellisense

1024053
int	chars
then do the conversion from int to chars

1024069
typedef	struct
typedef struct node char rotulo 10 instrucao 1 2 10 flag

1024137
testcase	fixture
the most common patterns are testcase class per class testcase class per feature and testcase class per fixture

1024207
lan	intranet
for an intranet server application the proxy details will be irrelevant as the clients will have internal lan access to your application making proxy settings irrelevant

1024227
srp	principles
this question might be more of a matter what goes where but i think it s an important question with regards to srp single responsibility principles dry don t repeat yourself and keeping things concise agile -- and i am not experienced enough with this pattern and in general design to be knowledgeable about this

1024227
post	get
over time it s grown to include these actions many with their respective get post and delete methods

1024256
serializable	deserialization
deserialization also does something similar sharing some of the same mechanism to invoke the most derived non- serializable constructor

1024284
kde	gnome	xfce	gnome	xfce	kde
the major desktop environments kde and gnome use a file structure below a specific folder too not sure if kde 4 uses .config xfce does use .config

1024338
subtraction	addition
solid models can be represented in a number of ways either by constructional solid geometry csg where the shape is made up from the addition or subtraction of solid primitives from each other or by boundary representation b-rep where the edges are stored or by triangulated faces as used by 3d studio max wpf and many others and so on

1024361
goto	break
in my solution i use a goto statement to break out of two for loops

1024362
integer	unsigned
uint32_t is an unsigned 32-bit integer on all platforms and oses and won t behave differently when compiled for a different system

1024370
fgets	fread
i have tried commands such as fgets fread the only command that seems to work is fgets

1024396
calloc	malloc
or you could allocate it with calloc instead of malloc which will zero the memory that is returned to you

1024469
folder	dir
i read about the symbolic links and junctions problems so i use cmd dir al to find the real folder

1024504
profiling	debugging
i m not a c++ expert and even less so c++ debugging profiling expert

mp3	flv
not flv video but mp3 streams

1024696
telerik	radcombobox
i m trying to write a more generic method that will populate either an asp.net dropdownlist or a telerik radcombobox with states

1024696
telerik	radcombobox
i have a datatable that holds all the states which i loop through see below - i d like to make this applicable to a telerik radcombobox - so i need to change the first parameter and also the part where i insert a new listitem - for telerik radcombobox it is new radcomboboxitem

1024704
folder	directory
i made sure that the folder adder build exists under the current directory

1024709
width	height
width and height variables are for the size of dest and are available as class member variables

1024737
rss	feed
call a rest api or rss feed with file_get_contents parse it effortlessly with one of those tools and you re done

1024802
realloc	malloc
just initialize instrucao to null and realloc will behave like malloc when first passed a null pointer

1024826
setinterval	document.write	setinterval	settimeout	document.write	settimeout
if you re attempting to sandbox javascript code and disable every possible way to evaluate strings into javascript code be aware that blocking all the obvious eval document.write new function settimeout setinterval innerhtml and other dom manipulations isn t enough

1024827
children	parent
if rather than storing the children you store the xor of the parent and child then you can get the next node in whatever direction you approach from without having to mutate the tree

1024869
easymock	jmockit	easymock	jmock	easymock	unitils	easymock	powermockito	jmockit	unitils	powermockito	jmockit	powermockito	unitils	mockito	jmockit	mockito	jmock	mockito	easymock	mockito	unitils	jmock	unitils	jmock	powermockito
in particular check out the feature comparison matrix which covers easymock jmock mockito unitils mock powermockito and of course jmockit

1024891
hash	md5
caveat make sure you find out the best way to make a key for your hash in just about every circumstance the md5 ... above is not a good decision speed and output length issues i used it for illustrative purposes

1024893
client-side	server-side
to do this on the web you d probably want to divide the project into two components client-side and server-side

1024937
freebsd	procfs
freebsd if it has procfs readlink proc curproc file freebsd doesn t have procfs by default

1024973
photoshop	fireworks
drawit is similar to adobe fireworks while pixel is like photoshop

1024985
photoshop	fireworks
i don t know either of them but i have always worked with fireworks for things as web design as seemingly opposed to a lot of people who prefer photoshop

1025008
dictionary	map
i suggest to use a dictionary to map between the input and the command

1025021
width	height
then when creating the object its x location would be negative half its width and the y would be negative half its height

1025036
webrat	cucumber
i ve just gotten started using bdd with rspec cucumber webrat and rails and i ve run into some frustration trying to get my view spec to pass

1025036

1025074
hide	show
it doesn t matter if i just hide and show divs on the same page or if i go to a new html page

1025074
hide	show
home and services are the two links and i would like services when clicked to hide the #slideshow div and show the slideshow2 div which would be hidden and then replace the first one

1025080
ssl	https
another potential difference is that google and yahoo use https and if your php or ssl installation is misconfigured perhaps missing ca certs then your openid code will fail to establish an association or complete the check_authentication call

1025087
put	get
for that to work properly you ll need to fiddle around with the loader class and applicationdomain so that the classes get put into the proper domain

1025089
hide	show
you should use the callback method of the show hide methods

1025091
drwatson	minidump
when it crashes drwatson will create a minidump file load this into windbg my favourite and you ll be able to see exactly where your bug is it ll even tell you that the dump contains an exception and show you it by default

1025105
inherited	subclassing
you never know when you ll want to have a subclassing that acts like the others but really needs to inherited another class for some reason

1025163
jboss	weblogic
and full-blown java ee app servers like weblogic jboss websphere etc

1025255
versioning	upgrade
the problem is in order to get fixes you pretty much have to upgrade to the next versioning of scala as upgrade come out

1025255
versioning	upgrade
the problem with that is that most versioning upgrade contain breaking changes thus in order to obtain fixes you are likely to have to change your own code

1025255
versioning	upgrade
in order for scala to be viable in such situations long-term someone will have to start back porting fixes to earlier versioning so that people don t have to perform breaking upgrade just to get some fixes

1025272
touchesmoved	touchesended
depending on your need you could also override touchesmoved and touchesended

1025325
post	get
that s post get data cookies user-agent string search strings - anything that is supplied by the browser

1025476
post	get
use this free web service through either a soap call get or post

1025539
perl	tcl
and then you have examples like awk tcl tk perl which says that initially was a combination between sh and awk but it became so powerful that he considers it an odd but full-fledged programming language

1025551
x86	64bit
another strange problem is that sqlce 3.5 sp1 with entity framework will not work on 64bit systems unless you build it to target x86

1025565
folder	directory
hiding usage information in registry or some folder in c basically outside virtual directory is not an option for a website

1025592
iboutlet	ibaction
although you have the view tied to an iboutlet you need to connect the event using an ibaction or else you won t get any of those events

1025610
profiling	debugging
the debug_version lets you profiling frees in debugging code but both are functionally the same

1025618
post	get
you probably need to post a bit more detail about the type of exception that is being thrown to get the most help

1025627
inherited	base-class
let s say t base-class is of type stream and u is of type memorystream inherited class you cannot assign a stream to a variable of type memorystream

1025666
put	get
you create an activity indicator and put it onscreen where you like - then you tell it to startanimating when you request the media and stopanimating when you get a callback that the playback has begun

1025700
children	parent
a parent and two children will be saved

1025714
realloc	malloc
wrap malloc and realloc like this

1025802
dictionary	map
alternatively if there is truly a one-to-one relationship between the keys perhaps you could use a dictionary to map from old key to new key and enumerate over the result of

1025819
getter	setter
a property is actually some syntactic sugar and is implemented by 2 methods a getter method and a setter method

1025819
getter	setter
so i think that you should be able to determine if a property is abstract by checking if the getter and or setter are abstract like this

1025820
udp	tcp
then you should be able to send and receive data using tcp oder udp like you would do with any other normal application

1025820
udp	tcp
you just need to think in terms of how can i exchange messages using tcp or udp between my device and my server now

1025847
superclass	subclassing
that is have a conversion method in superclass bar and implements it in subclassing eg mybar httpbar etc

1025849
client-side	server-side
i have a vague memory that in order to use client-side ssl in jboss you first need to configure the server-side part

1025905
google-chrome	firefox
this gives me problem in ie if the container div is not big enough to show it tried with firefox google-chrome it is working fine

1025921
expression-blend	silverlight
from your question it s not clear if you are creating a silverlight or a wpf application in expression-blend

1025923
int	chars	int	double
you can sort an array of any type int long double chars or some struct pointers.

1025964
dlsym	dlopen
now i am thinking of using dlsym and dlopen to use these libraries instead of linking them explicitly

1026006
subtract	add
we have 2 variants of solution the first is to use len replace and the second is add a single symbol and then subtract 1 from result

1026020
gif	png
you must edit the image in a paint program like gimp add a transparency layer remove the part you don t like with the eraser and save it as gif or png

1026098
ucfirst	capitalize
you can capitalize a string by calling ucfirst some string -- for example

1026153
antivirus	mcafee
when i started searching about this error in google i came to know that may be because of mcafee antivirus this error may come

width	height
i m not 100 sure but in my tests you can t bitmapdata.draw any displayobject beyond 4079 pixels in width and 4082 in height actually you can but they will not be drawn beyond this limits

1026212
int	chars
since you are using c++ there are nicer methods to convert strings of chars into int

1026213
int	chars
function atoi converts string to int not only one chars

1026221
jquery	scriptaculous
i tried differend javascript frameworks jquery scriptaculous standalone - so i guess it s my image gallery which causes this behaviour.

1026249
post	put
put the select box in a form and make the form post back to a filter method in your controller

1026316
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
-referencing the arrays in a local variable within the function of the for-each loops is irrelevant but in the for-loop you do get a speed bump 75ms instead of 105ms

1026370
multiplying	addition
as you can see it s simply multiplying with an addition and a shift

1026393
google-chrome	firefox
however for some reasons the flash works fine in ie but not in firefox or google-chrome

1026568
uiview	subviews
one way to implement this is by adding a tag uiview s tag property with a integer value to each subviews

1026615
google-chrome	firefox
it s available as a userscript for firefox and as a google-chrome extension

1026620
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr to stdout and using passthru instead of exec will give you all the output

1026624
updatepanel	scriptmanager
other than updatepanel scriptmanager timer

1026682
folder	directory
let s say i have a file directory that stores all the images and other file types and this file directory is located on a different drive then my application folder

1026699
ubuntu	debian
i ve created a ubuntu debian package that installs an application that depends on r

1026756
dpkg	apt
this makes it impossible for apt or dpkg to figure out the package dependencies

1026763
width	height
i ve been able to make this work for rotating the icons around an ellipse but i also want to have them move around the perimeter of a rectangle of a certain width height and origin

1026764
punctuation	words
there are also potential issues with punctuation or other characters which are neither words nor whitespace characters

1026779
for-loop	arrays
in your first for-loop increments the pointer such that it doesn t point to the beginning of the arrays anymore

1026799
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
as you iterate through your loops you are incrementing the pointer and by the end of the for-loop you are pointing to the last element in the arrays

1026799
for-loop	arrays
when you go through the for-loop to display all of your values you are indexing to values past the end of the arrays since ptrheaparray is pointing to the last element in the arrays you allocated

1026808
for-loop	arrays
so after executing the first for-loop your pointer is pointing to end of the arrays and not at the beggining

1026810
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit

1026819
disk	ram
this technique allocates space dynamically but it s disk space not ram space

1026835
gif	png
suppose i have image canvas or previously loaded image which supports transparency gif png

1026839
put	get
so for example it is x 50 and you can put that into the line above to get the y

1026859
button	checkbox
i would suggest using a single checkbox or two standard button s instead of radiobutton s

1026889
google-chrome	firefox
here s a really really simple one works in firefox google-chrome and ie7

1026896
free	malloc
you d need to add logging shims to malloc and free so that you can get an idea of what dynamic memory operations are being performed

1026915
swt	styledtext
you can find many great code snippets at the swt snippets page including examples for drag and drop using the styledtext widget

1026966
interpreted-language	compiled-language
i like python a lot but there s one aspect of it and other interpreted-language i guess that is really hard to work with when you re used to compiled-language

1026980
hide	show
instead you should use show and hide with control logic inside your main form

1027028
post	get
request.servervariables query_string but for the post not the get part of the http request.

1027040
keydown	keyup
this should definitely work in general case but some corner cases might have unexpected results like having keyup keydown events overriden

1027054
nunit	moq
i am using nunit and moq for my frameworks

1027079
children	parent
i need to structure the data so that every parent has a children key which is an array of arrays repeated with no limitation on the amount of children a parent child grandchild can have the tree_depth key is worked out automatically by the dbms so i simply need to alter the structure of the array

1027081
versioning	upgrade
if you make sure you ve upgrade to the latest versioning of this plugin you can create multiple forms each with their own response messages

1027085
free	alloca
you can use alloca function that allocates memory on the stack - this memory will be free automatically when you exit the function

1027093
apache	nginx
how about running a simple webserver like apache nginx and have a php or cgi or other script that simply returns the time in any format you want

1027106
children	parent
of course it works only if your initial array is ordered the parent comes before its children

1027108
innodb	myisam
update i created a new table myisam of the same schema copied over all the records insert into select the changed the engine on the new table innodb renamed the corrupt table and renamed the new table then tried again and got the same error

1027134
folder	directory
try creating a virtual directory of the folder that holds the images and use that as away of linking to the folder

1027141
width	height
entitytypeshape entitytype model1.tph_table width 1.5 pointx 3 pointy 0.5 height 1.2636116536458335 isexpanded true

1027145
width	height
if i draw a rectangle and select it rendersize returns proper size for it but if line is selected rendersize returns size which has width set as line.x2 and height set as line.y2

1027145
width	height
for example line begins at x1 50 y1 50 ends at x2 130 y2 90 rendersize returns size with width 130 and height 90

1027149
pop-up	dialog
i need a pop-up dialog to be shown when i get a message from different thread but the dialog should be not dependent on activity i.e it should display the dialog wherever the screen focus is

1027170
width	margin
the width and margin of the menu are em-based

1027171
vim	emacs	vim	notepad++
have a look at notepad++ vim gnu emacs or similar

1027219
repeatbutton	togglebutton
it appears that this also applies to subtypes of frameworkelement buttonbase the supertype of button togglebutton repeatbutton

1027283
versioning	upgrade
when vs detects that the project file is not high enough for it s versioning it will force an upgrade

1027358
min	max
assuming you have a map thats x tiles wide and y tiles tall and the tiles that are next to each other are adjacent so that each tile has at max 4 and min 2 adjacent tiles you could use a matrix to access the tiles and also represent adjacency by matricial adjacency

1027358
min	max
this solution could also fit max 6 and min 3 tile adjacency if tile y+1 x+1 is adjacent to tile y x

1027360
subtract	add
hence i need to capture events when the user selects deselects the gridview rows and calculate add subtract the amount accordingly

1027398
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade to the next versioning of the 3rd party source tell svn to merge the difference between software-version and next-version into a working copy of trunk software

1027409
filtering	grouping
either grouping by or where clause that filtering on the most recent

1027410
post	get
now i got a big problem with subclassed form tb_order_service with a master detail approach when i post the tb_order_base dataset instead of delphi first post it and get the pk id from rdbms and then post the tb_order_product with id filled it does the opposed posting the detail tb_order_product dataset first then master tb_order_base so i get a big foreing key constraint error

1027437
hex	binary
analyze the binary data try to save various versions of the file with little variation and use a diff program to analyze the meaning of every bit with an hex editor

1027445
inherited	properties
i can t put them in baseviewmodel since other viewmodels inherited it which don t need these properties and i can t put them in ipageitemviewmodel since it is only an interface

1027455
disk	ram
when using the size is not limited by the protocol but by what your server can handle ram hard disk space database or as symcbean has pointed out what the server is configured to handle

1027458
allocator	stl
you could have it as std string name_ and have the stl take care of the memory allocator for you

1027463
inherited	properties
can you create a class that inherited from baseviewmodel that will implement these two properties - your pageitemviewmodel classes that need this could then inherited from that

1027472
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest uses different http methods get post put delete to specify which action is wanted and the server returns the status as the http status

1027640
folder	directory
this would not be ideal but in the absence of server-side processing which you really should be doing--either php or rails or perl or whatever your host supports you could allow directory listing on your images folder

1027665
rar	zip
the best way is to take your db offline zip it up or rar whatever and copy the .zip file somewhere safe

1027669
implements	extends
one way is to implements an activator for plug-in a which extends at least the class plugin plugina

1027683
gif	png
an un-orthodox solution - if browsers you care about support animated background images gif png just compile your set of images especially if they are small sized into an animated gif png and use that as background

1027705
pull	push
should i use ajax push or pull

1027744
accessor	properties
java bean properties accessor methods do not have to start with get and set

1027775
coalesce	isnull
i was playing around a little with some union selects with coalesce and isnull .

1027778
rss	feed
for background jobs that are not user-initiated such as grabbing an rss feed and parsing it on a daily interval

1027785
allocator	stl
it makes very limited use of the stl the queue class in the pathfinding module and because it s a game it also doesn t do any memory allocator outside of the third party sound library in a dll and what s necessary for loading the graphics bitmaps

1027796
post	put
the example is to create a suggestion form that post the data to itself which is then put into a database

1027804
folder	directory
when building a project in xcode 3.1.2 2 folder are automatically added as header directory with the -i option

1027808
division	multiplication
t is not very important as long as alpha is small otherwise you will run into some rather weird nyquist issues aliasing etc. and if you are working on a processor where multiplication is cheaper than division or fixed-point issues are important precalculate omega

1027819
jboss	glassfish
for that i want to configure the containers glassfish and or jboss to limit the number of instances of the bean

1027840
put	get
can you put some code in the executetest to get a template from that subfolder

1027881
.htaccess	httpd.conf
httpd.conf and or .htaccess and

1027884
inherited	properties
basically i inherited from panel expose any properties for the information i need from the panel anything that needs to happen to display information in the panel happens in it s own code behind

1027890
easymock	jmock
both jmock and easymock will support all the assertions you might want to make on the message you are sending and you testing is complete

1027918
kde	gnome
your process might have been started without a visible terminal as is common in graphical user environments like kde gnome or windows

1027977
postgresql	mysql
so moving from a mysql db to a postgresql or mssql db is a simple as changing the data provider connection string

1028016
width	height
i have tried playing with the width height of the chart to no avail.

1028036
pull	push
they work great for simple utility type programs but when you start creating a complex system using them you will find little gotchas along the way that are easily solved by using a standard edit and a function to push pull data to from the database

1028044
post	get
if the api already provides a soap interface then use it like kev said otherwise you should develop something like that like chells said or maybe something even more simple like a plain house-made get post page.

1028050
put	get
you can get it to work some of the time if you put spaces between the and the d

1028085
public	protected
i d need to know what the relationship of these two classes were in relation to each other to be more clear but you should be able to extend the class and use the new protected methods you have inherited without making them public

1028119
actionscript	mxml
mxml is just a way of writing actionscript without having to know actionscript

1028119
actionscript	mxml
when flex creates the swf it looks at the mxml and creates actionscript from it behind the scenes

1028119
actionscript	mxml
for what it s worth as far as i know file size is not increased by using mxml as the mxml is converted to actionscript before the swf is created

1028187
cassini	iis
i ve been developing an asp .net 3.5 web application against cassini the built-in web development server rather than against iis

1028197
addition	multiplication
if an additive operation ie addition or multiplication on two or more integers results in a smaller value than the operands then you know something went wrong

1028204
jobs	cron
it may well be possible to mock up cron jobs using tasks but i doubt it s worth it

1028204
rss	feed
about asynchronous urlfetch which might be the ultimate best way of updating rss feed

1028302
tostring	charat
it has all methods needed to solve the problem charat setcharat length and tostring

1028378
width	height
another source of delay in some browsers is img tags where the width and height are unspecified

1028400
post	put
when you save or update an entry in uddi analogous to your post and put you need to supply the unique id in the published data such that the server knows what to do with it

1028500
width	height
a rectangle in wpf is position-less it s just a height width so the two size values are equal

1028527
vim	emacs	vim	textmate	emacs	textmate
easily installable on multiple platforms emacs eclipse vim textmate

1028557
jruby	mri
also it lacks a good jit compiler currently though mri 1.9 has a bytecode compiler which is better and jruby compiles it down to java bytecode which then can compile via the hotspot jvm s jit compiler but it ends up being about the same speed as 1.9

1028570
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
so this works great in firefox google-chrome safari opera mac windows

1028606
qtkit	quicktime
i ve been looking into the quicktime api qtkit and it looks promising but if there s a better way - one that could be extended to support live video streams that d be amazing

1028623
ostream	istream
open input.txt as an istream and output.txt as a ostream

1028643
put	get
if you put it out of your implementation you get this warning warning instance variable is protected

1028645
xsl-fo	xslt
xml - xslt - xsl-fo

1028737
kde	gnome
i am trying to get a proof of concept going on any platform so if you know how to do it on xp in gnome kde or mac os i would really like to hear about it

1028766
jquery	scriptaculous
i recently started a project where the team decided we d like to use jquery rather than prototype scriptaculous for our javascript needs

1028779
hash	md5
in the header file there should be a cc_md5 function that will compute an md5 hash of arbitrary data

1028779
nsstring	nsdata
some more info here including a wrapper using nsstring - should be easy enough to convert to use nsdata

1028792
rss	feed
i am using the following code to get the item from the rss feed but it only gives me the first item

1028815
int	double
double because you can cast int to

1028936
getter	setter
so we auto-generate code by selecting a table from the database using the cf admin api and create the dao with the usual init setter and getter so the basic crud stuff

1028946
range	minimum
i would recommend looking at a combination of multi-dimensional clustering mdc range table partitioning and deep compression to manage the table as it grows facilitate easy roll-in roll-out and most importantly to quickly zero in on the data requested with a minimum of scanning

1028947
rss	feed
i use zend framework to read an rss feed is as simple as instantiating a zend_feed_rss object with the url of the feed

1028962
fflush	gets
now my problem is when a person object gets fflush it tries to execute a collection remove action against person#thincollection which fails because it s trying to execute

1028965
children	parent
one parent will have one or more children -- i have not interest in this application in childless parent

1028965
children	parent
in my database i can implement this with a normal foreign key relationship and the set-based nature of sql makes it easy to find all children for a given parent or the parent for a given child

1028965
children	parent
i think that the parent should carry a collection list whatever of children

1028967
getter	setter
now i could see for something more complex you might write more in the a parts to give context but for a majority of the getter setter out there the wording is almost exactly the same

1028967
getter	setter
i m just curious if for the simple getter setter its ok to only fill in either the a part or the b part

1028981
getter	setter
getter and setter ought to be self-explanatory

1028988
getter	setter
edit the above refers to getter and setter only

1028990
children	parent
you should probably re-examine why your children need a reference back to the parent and vice versa

1028990
children	parent
i would lean toward the parent having a collection of children

1028993
getter	setter
i usually just fill the param part for setter and the return part for getter

1028996
getter	setter
i d say only worry about commenting getter and setter if they have some sort of side effect or require some sort of precondition outside of initialization getting will remove an item from a data structure or in order to set something you need to have x and y in place first

1028996
getter	setter
edit in addition if you do find a lot of side effects are involved in your getter setter you might want to change the getter setter to have a different method name ie push and pop for a stack thanks for the comments below

1028997
children	parent
the solution you specify with parent containing references to children and vice versa eliminates the need to traverse the tree to obtain ancestry of a given child and children of a node

1029006
children	parent
as per your domain model parent have children and children have parent

1029006
children	parent
do you include the parent s children

1029019
postgresql	mysql
if you are using a decent rdbms like mysql postgresql sqlserver oracle etc.

1029023
children	parent
what is the fundamental issue you re having with a parent having references to its children and a child having a reference to its parent

1029033
qimage	qwidget
the server sends the image data using image.tostring and the client side receives it and turns it back into an image using image.fromstring then into a qimage using imageqt.imageqt image turns it into a qpixmap using qpixmap.fromimage qimage then updates my qwidget s qlable s image using lable.setpixmap qpixmap

1029058
getter	setter
when documenting setter getter i like to separate the what from the encoding

1029081
children	parent
if the children must have a parent i usually just require a parent type instance in the child constructor

1029090
profiling	debugging
try checking via the debugging profiling window perspective flex debugging the the breakpoints view to see whether there s anything in there you don t recognize

1029107
getter	setter
if it is a getter setter it should be documented

1029109
firefox	safari
with it and selenium rc you can puppet string ie firefox or safari from inside of perl

1029119
gif	png
where profile.avatarmimetype is an appropriate mime type for a gif jpeg or png

1029127
folder	directory
position of normal files and folder is stored in the hidden .ds_store file that exists for any directory

1029132
textview	imageview
there are sporadic examples out there largely consisting of contrived examples using programatically created interfaces or based on the assumption that the developer is working with a typical imageview or textview

1029132
width	height
the height and width are based on custom values that are being translated into pixels as needed

1029160
mouse	keyboard
your test application is a simple app or script that starts up your gui and then generates mouse keyboard events based on input files

1029160
mouse	keyboard
with any luck you ll be able to generate mouse and keyboard events with the api but you ll have to ask someone else if it s possible

1029169
for-loop	arrays
you ve created empty arrays lists in the for-loop so trying access any element in them return null to system.out.println

1029201
hid	joystick
you could modify this sample driver to emulate a joystick hid device and then send out joystick hid reports from the driver

1029270
hex	binary
alternatively you could manually build a hex string prefixed with 0x to create a binary literal to append to the query but it s not recommended

1029302
mouse	keyboard
xdotool lets you programatically or manually simulate keyboard input and mouse activity move and resize windows etc

1029306
rss	feed
the way i look at it is that if i am just parsing one rss feed a cron job might be good enough

1029306
rss	feed
if i have to parse x number of rss feed specified at run time by a user or any other system variable then i would choose tasks every time

1029306
jobs	cron
i only say this because in the past i have had to excecute many user defined twitter searches at regular intervals and with cron jobs i ended making a very bad queuing system to execute the requests that needed to be ran - it didn t scale it didn t help that and the smallest interval that a cron job can be is only 1 minute i had more searches to perform than minutes in the day

1029319
rss	feed
use sitemaps use rss feed use xml documents or even pdf files with links to offer your whole range of products

1029331
getter	setter
the r o will only have getter while the writable will inherit from it and add the setter

1029340
gif	bmp
i ve seen similar questions that answer how you might do this with image files jpg bmp gif etc but i haven t found a way that works with pdf

1029358
public	protected
mark the setters as protected in the parent and expose public setters in the child

1029391
put	get
as a side note my reasoning for wanting this is because i have graphic designers who put files into svn but they don t get added to the project and don t show up on deployment or deployment testing

1029419
versioning	upgrade
if you plan on using gems with system ruby you might have problems when apple upgrade the system versioning of ruby unless you are installing your gems in library ruby gems

1029440
opera	safari
crossbrowser object watch claims support for ie opera safari

1029440
opera	safari
opera safari

1029467
getter	setter
those methods are called setter and getter

1029467
getter	setter
by convenction setter and getter have the same name of the instance variable but this is not a requirement

1029503
mouse	keyboard
when i get bored of calling one common feature with the mouse i get the keyboard shortcut quickly

1029506
put	get
put it where you can t reach it and try to get along

1029512
post	get
the problems start when instead of get post is used which is easy because you can t know if this is a malicious post or just some really slow upload from an user

1029540
post	get
on the other hand if i run the doctest by calling doctest.testmod the pre post inv do get called

1029550
int	chars	int	double
i have no problem doing this for an int divide by 16 recursively and concatenate chars 0-9a-f but float double is stumping me

1029605
uisegmentedcontrol	uiswitch
i would recommend creating a custom control or an array of uiswitch controls representing each of the options in your uisegmentedcontrol

1029613
post	put
make sure your web server is configured to reject post messages without an accompanying content-length header and to reject requests and throttle the offending client which exceed the stated content-length and to reject requests with a content-length which is unreasonably long for the service that the post or put is aimed at

1029622
ienumerable	ienumerator
nope ienumerator and ienumerable are different beasts entirely

1029632
ienumerable	ienumerator
the basic reason you can t go that direction ienumerator t to a ienumerable t is that ienumerable t represents a set that can be enumerated but ienumerator t is a specific enumeratation over a set of items -- you can t turn the specific instance back into the thing that created it

1029637
xlwt	xlutils
there are three python modules that allow you to do pretty much anything you need xlrd reading xlwt writing and xlutils copy modify filter

1029666
margin	height
when a user clicks a button i want my elements height and margin set to 0px

1029666
margin	height
then i want it to set display to block and animate its height and margin to the values as defined in the css - 20px - to slide and reveal itself

1029666
margin	height
when the user clicks the button again i want to animate my elements height and margin back to zero

1029702
fold	traversable
groupby is defined on traversable and sum can be applied directly to the list you don t have to write a fold

1029711
button	checkbox
however since i want this function to be responsible for all the initialization of this class when being created and it contains mfc objects initializations such as combobox edit control checkbox control radio button control etc. should i be instead calling the initialize function here as i thought

1029712
width	height
that way the height width during the animation will be calculated correctly

1029724
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
there are other 3rd party mechanisms out there that you may prefer over the uikit uinavigationcontroller uiviewcontroller mechanisms

1029773
mouse	keyboard
to add to subtenante response since i don t have enough mojo to actually comment there if i find myself using the mouse do something repetitively my threshold is 3 times ie the third time i notice myself mousing the same task i look up to the keyboard shortcut and do that a couple times as practice immediately

1029779
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i can create it this way fine as long as i change the myviewcontroller to inherit from uiviewcontroller instead of uinavigationcontroller

1029791
post	get
you can access the buttons superview to get the uitableviewcell that contains your button but if you just need the row number you can use the tag property like the previous post deacribes

1029800
dictionary	map
it should be trivial to map this into a function dictionary list etc

1029840
subtract	add
my knowledge of excel sums goes only a wee bit further than add and subtract

1029841
post	get
and how would you receive post get information

1029849
freebsd	solaris	solaris	bsd
and since solaris and bsd working with freebsd at the moment don t have ip_recvtos from what i can see i don t get tos when looping over the cmsg data

1029862
rss	feed
rss feed in asp.net mvc

1029864
post	get
by doing a couple small joins in your query you can get post for a specific group from various different users - and thus fill your group-specific board

1029894
debian-based	linux
sometimes when i install a debian-based system i change the uid start option i forget its name i m not on linux now from 1000 to 500 for consistency with the other red hat-y machines

1029895
imperative	declarative
if i understand it is as why is it that css is a declarative language rather then imperative then it s because it s conceptually closer to how humans want webpages to be styled and how browsers feel comfortable reading it

1029901
hash	salt
which you can then use like this to salt you file hash

1029902
accessor	properties
if you synthesize your accessor declare the properties as either properties retain or properties copy

1029920
hash	hmac
in general i d go with an hmac rather than the standard hash function since they offer a bit better security

1029921
debian	linux
easy to set up on linux debian

1029940
post	get
cloudmade seems to be an open-source map location provider - the above blog post lists details on how to get forward geocoding

1029944
folder	directory
it doesn t require a server of any sort -- it s completely python based and the source control is kept within a .bzr folder at the top directory of the tree

1029955
inherited	properties
the contentpresenter gets it s content from the datacontext but i need the bindings on contained elements to link to original windows usercontrol s parent in logical tree datacontext - because this way when i embed textbox bound to viewmodel s properties it is not bound as the inherited chain has been broken inside the control

1029955
children	parent
it seems that i would need to save parent s datacontext and restore it to the children of all control s containers but i don t get any event that datacontext up in the logical tree has changed

1029973
int	chars
for chars in the basic multilingual plane casting the chars to an int will get you the codepoint

1029993
firefox	safari
as of now rounded corners are supported in firefox and safari through browser extension

1029993
firefox	safari
rounded corner is a part of css3 specification so if you want to implement a rounded corner using pure css and html now it is possible only using browser extensions -moz-border-radius for firefox -webkit for safari

1030017
margin	height
either you can create the appearance of equal height by setting a background image on the table row element the faux columns technique or you can make the height of the columns match by giving each a large padding and equally large negative margin

1030017
margin	height
here s an example using the padding margin technique to balance the height of the columns

1030017
margin	height
this barcamp demo by natalie downe may also be useful when figuring out how to add additional columns and nice spacing and padding equal height columns and other tricks it s also where i first learnt about the margin padding trick to balance column height

1030031
gridview	repeater
the gridview will work but i would strongly suggest the use of a repeater as it is considerably more efficient

1030062
xslt	xquery
it s also instructive to look at the saxon xslt xquery processor since being a well-behaved xml application it has to take into account how java stores codepoints in strings

1030066
int	chars
the methods that accept an int value support all unicode chars including supplementary chars

1030066
int	chars
casting the chars to an int as you do in your sample works fine though

1030088
winpcap	wireshark
you could try using winpcap which is what s utilized by wireshark

1030102
rss	feed
when i come across a broken rss feed the usual reason its all blown to pieces is because line 23 says sanford sons.

1030106
google-chrome	safari
this doesn t happen in ie8 safari 4 or google-chrome 2

1030112
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it isn t magic it is a uinavigationcontroller that instantiates a uiviewcontroller internally a uitableview that is populated with your address book contacts and sets the uiviewcontroller as its root view

1030125
vbscript	jscript
i see vbscript wsh powershell cmd jscript etc and wondering what to learn or what combination of things

1030135
int	chars
for a chars which can be represented by a single chars 16 bits basic multilingual plane you can get the codepoint simply by casting the chars to an int as the question suggests so there s no need for a special method to perform a conversion

1030135
int	chars
just compare the chars to the int directly as the question suggests

1030163
uiview	subviews
i would make own button by subclassing uiview or alternatively subclass a uibutton and add subviews to it

1030165
inherited	subclassing
you should reserve inherited for things that are genuinely subclassing not just to add some functionality here and there

1030177
opera	google-chrome
tried google-chrome and opera and they both work

1030196
getter	setter
a jsf model-bean should be a pojo that follows the javabean design pattern with getter setter encapsulating properties

1030196
getter	setter
although it typically has javabean-style properties with associated getter setter these are properties of the view -- not of the underlying application data model

1030246
ironruby	ironpython
there is ironpython ironruby and others

1030263
versioning	upgrade
typically you want to say libraryx is at versioning 2.32 and will stay that way until i tell it to upgrade

1030312
opera	firefox
it could explain why you can hit the site with firefox and opera but not with ie or webclient

1030315
width	margin
your new width should be reduced by twice the crop margin since you ll be chopping off that amount from both sides

1030429
cos	sin
at 45 angle value of cos sin is same i.e 1 root 2

1030432
cos	sin
crazy fact from the 1980s in the old days we used lookup tables for sin and cos

1030445
put	get
if you want to put code somewhere in your django project that will get run for certain every time you start up django pick an app form installed_apps

1030454
post	get
you could get the same functionality by simply having your form post to the destination url redirect to the appropriate place from there or send them back to the form displaying any errors that may have occurred

1030459
awt	swing
however this new functionality is a part of awt so it doesn t do a very good job integrating with swing components

1030469
jquery	scriptaculous
judging by your latency requirement of 2 seconds it would be wise to look at some sort of ajax framework - jquery or prototype scriptaculous are both good places to start

1030469
ant	maven
in terms of other technoloqies to make things better you will want to consider a build system ant maven are fine with maven the slightly more complex of the two

1030522
lxml	celementtree
i m parsing the documents using celementtree or lxml semi-negotiable

1030535
rss	feed
i ve been seeing this in my visual c# 2008 rss feed forever now

1030555
width	height
let s assume we have the class rectangle with the two for simplicity public properties width height

1030555
width	height
but though the claim is a square will behave like a rectangle we can t set .width 1 and height 2 on a square object your class probably adjusts the width if you set the height and vice versa

1030559
width	height
because changing a rectangle s width does not affect its height

1030559
width	height
by definition a square has height and width always equal

1030559
width	height
that test will fail because setting a square s width to 100 will also change its height

1030559
width	height
to answer your question the correct design should probably be that both rectangle and square derive from a common polygon or shape class which does not enforce any rules regarding width or height

1030586
width	height
in matt s example if you have code that relies on width and height being independent then it does in fact violate lsp

1030618
qevent	qobject	qevent	qapplication	qapplication	qobject
you can use the qapplication postevent function to send custom qevent messages to a qobject to be processed in the gui thread with the qobject customeevent handler

1030622
mako	genshi
so i thought i would ask the community to provide me with some advice as to where when i might know i should consider using a templating engine such as jinja2 genshi mako and co

1030673
submit	submission
so pad submission software would be software that submit your application to agencies that keep track of software using that standard

post	get
i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get

1030692
rss	feed
over at spokenword.org weâ re trying to figure out how to scrape youtube pages or pages with embedded youtube players then hack a video or shockwave url that we can include in the enclosure element of rss feed

1030692

division	multiplication
the performance cost of multiplication division square root etc operations for embedded systems

1030776
post	get
so now when the form submits the ajax request gets sent but you are redirected to submit page anyway which i think has populated the get array instead of post

1030783
jboss	glassfish
since httpsession does not necessarily inherit from or is implemented by clientsession in the java ee spec unless i missed something fundamental the code will likely blow up when you run it on a different server say glassfish or tomcat or jboss to name a few

1030788
superclass	subclassing
if you re retaining it in the subclassing for some reason you should also release it in the subclassing but setting the property to nil in the superclass shouldn t have any negative side effects

1030793
width	border-box
however this raises even more questions which i ll ask in a seperate question but it seems that width uses the normal css box model and max-width uses the ie border-box model

1030799
translation	localization
fwiw i have uses tsilang translation suite in the past and am currently working on another project using the localization tools shipped with devexpress vcl

on windows i checkout the vim folder over the one in the program files directory

1031397
hide	show
you can then use jquery a neat javascript library that makes a lot of things easier when writing client-side code to show and hide the tooltip with the following code

hide	show
what you want is put the content you want to hide show inside a tag invisible by default by setting the display hidden

1031417
put	get

hide	show
in those cases where you don t want the user to be able to see select other values you should hide the dropdown and show a static text container instead label

1031823
button	checkbox
my thoughts on this is to have a checkbox by the save button which states my profile is complete which the user will select once they are happy with it and i have another module which creates a trigger by using the node_api hook and checking the type of the node the action and the value of this checkbox

1032527
n-gram	words
words n-gram will generally be more useful for most text analysis applications you mention with the possible exception of language detection where something like character trigrams might give better results

1032527
n-gram	words
words based n-gram plus support vector machines in an excellent way to perform topic spotting but you need a large corpus of text pre classified into on topic and off topic to train the classifier

getter	setter
to get around this jaxb doesn t even try to instantiate the property class list derived from the getter setter pair if it s a collection

1034405
getter	setter
probably the simplest work around is to mark your business interface with xmltransient and add a different getter setter pair with xmlelement for the view for the data that you want to expose to jaxb

1034405
public	protected
i usually make these protected rather than public because i don t care to have the somewhat-goofy jaxb behavior as part of my classes public contract

1036758
elementtree	beautifulsoup
i suppose elementtree or beautifulsoup would be good starting points to interpret the html structure

1037514
swt	swing
my criteria to choose between swt and swing

1037514
swt	swing
notice i have only commercial experience with swt on small project and my swing experience is so small that can t be taken seriously - my knowledge is rather theoretical than practical

1037514
swt	swing
briefly after my swt eclipse rcp experience - on next project i would choose swing

1037514
swt	swing
and there is lot of more custom components in swing than in swt this is very big pro for swing

while it s unlikely that you ll find a significant benefit in postgresql over mysql if can t hurt to test

1038288
post	put
similar to the following post i believe when you have any object or array syntax you need to put in braces

1038307
hash	md5
i was reading this question on md5 hash values and the accepted answer confuses me

1038342
implements	extends
you can t extends multiple classes but you can implements multiple interfaces

1038350
filtering	grouping
use linq specifically groupby then filtering by grouping count and return a flattened selectmany list

1038361
inherited	properties
perhaps you can mark the base class properties with a common mapping than you only override the properties in inherited classes where it should be different

1038408
webkit	gecko
java perl python to hook onto webkit gecko to solve the above rendering problem

1038413
hash	md5
1 the primary purpose of a hash is to map a very very large space to a smaller but still very large space md5 which will take anything and convert it into a space of size 2 128 -- big but not nearly as big as aleph-0.

1038413
hash	md5
so a good hash that makes even use of the destination space will make it difficult to find two inputs with the same output just by the odds if md5 were perfect the odds that two inputs would have the same output would be 2 -128

1038422
multiplication	exponent
powers are easy - just repeated squaring and multiplication based on the binary representation of the exponent

1038465
getter	setter
don t use any getter setter properties

django	turbogears
a web framework like turbogears django grok repoze.bfg webpy or such

1038527
administration	activation
because those features are normally activated by administration from either the command line assuming the admin also has rights in the farm config database or from within central administration where activation occurs through the farm service account -- guaranteed to have rights to the config database

1038566
vb.net	vb6
vb6 and vb.net are totally different languages and ms has never officially endorsed an automatic migration route for anything beyond simple applications

1038567
postgresql	mysql
i ve got a potential client who wants a database driven app either in java or python driving mysql or postgresql but we need to get input from an external machine such that every time this external machine closes a microswitch a value in the database gets decremented and it shows up on the app

1038587
int	double
there is no automatic conversion between int and double elements in the array with arraycopy

1038591
int	double
that s exactly the case here - int and double are different primitive types so the exception is thrown as documented

1038613
width	height
doing so will make all of the contents in the wrappanel with the same sharedsizegroup share their width for columns and height for rows

1038618

ant	maven
i moved a project from ant to maven recently

1039052
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin	maven-assembly-plugin	pom.xml	maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
it worked well at the end but i had to use two different versions of maven-assembly-plugin and maven-jar-plugin in the same pom.xml got two profiles because what worked in one version was broken in another

1039154
ready	each
the threaded tasks will get one manualresetevent object each and call the set method when they are ready

1039181
post	get
the latter is just a bunch of keys and values and can be parsed the same way whether for get or post whereas the former requires full mime support and is thus more useful when you have data that can t simply be represented as key value pairs

1039186
versioning	upgrade
the direction i ve seen many applications take is at start check an xml file that you host for information on newer versioning and typically display a message to the user preferably in a news ticker or non-obstructive manor about a new versioning being released and why they should upgrade

1039192
getter	setter
show how getter setter private fields alleviate the problem maybe move to a typed language if you ve been using json .

1039208
post	get
and in the end if i simply can t get an answer i ll probably have to break down and write a test case where i can just post the entire rendering code here and demonstrate the problem

1039218
unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
often production unix systems solaris hp ux aix etc. have a very plain vanilla install

1039220
x86	64bit
i am guessing you are running the x86 version of dependency walker which when analyzing a 64bit dll will show that it depends upon several x86 system libraries

the connection pool settings is min 50 and max 150

1039669
nexus	artifactory
here are some things off the top of my head that i really like about artifactory keep in mind nexus may have these features too

1039798
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
when i run the site locally on my development machine everything works fine in firefox ie opera and safari all the latest versions - i work from home and i only have 1 machine for personal use and development use except for some css differences between them and when i go to the live site on my machine it works fine also

1039819
post	get
if you want to be able to reference either get post values you can use _request

1039826
post	get
it contains the data submitted via the post method and only the post method versus data submitted via the get method

1039845
post	get
_request yourname contains all the variables that were posted whether they were sent by get or post

1039848
post	get
the two most common types of web requests are get and post

1039848
post	get
in general however any regular link you click produces a get request and any form you submit produces as post request

1039870
disk	ram
i am not talking about ram but rather disk space

1039921
implements	extends
if the class implements some interface or extends an abstract class you can tell jmockit to capture and mock implementations of the base type on demand as they are loaded by the jvm and even assign the created instances to a field in the test class

1039938
int	chars
however this won t work for primitive types like int bool chars etc.

1039938
free	malloc
that means you have to use malloc prefer nsallocatecollectable on leopard or later and free to manage the memory

1039941
put	get
if the number of rows that get updated as opposed to inserted every time you put up a new rowset it not too high then i think you should consider importing the new set of data into a set of staging tables and do an update-where-exists and insert-where-not-exists upsert solution and just refresh your indexes ok ok indices

1039942
lisp	smalltalk
it can be done in smalltalk and in lisp

1039943
sqldatasource	datalist
i have a datalist that is bound to a sqldatasource

1039947
inherited	properties
early in my learning about the little snags of this process i found that a number of the problems i would run into with tframe descendants streaming incorrectly often appearing as forms in the ide rather than frames could be completely eliminated by introducing my own tbaseframe class which inherited from tframe with no chanegs and then use that as the base class to develop components from adding methods properties etc

1039947
put	get
i could put all of my frame based components into one giant package but i d really really prefer not to as i can clearly see that will get too large out of hand over time given the nature of how many sets i plan on developing

1040026
draggable	droppable
check out the jqueryui addons draggable and droppable

1040056
ant	cruisecontrol	nant	cruisecontrol
linux java technologies are in parenthesis but i included their equivalent for the windows readers too i use cruisecontrol.net cruisecontrol visualsvn svn tortoise and nant ant to take care of all of my build needs

1040056
ant	cruisecontrol
when cruisecontrol cc sees that new code has been checked in it will execute a cc project which in turn calls out to the ant script on the build server

1040056
ncover	ndepend
once all of this is complete i like to run some analysis on my code using ndepend ndoc and ncover

1040067
isapi	iirf
i am using iirf - an isapi rewrite filter for pretty url s

1040083
int	double
casting a double to an int just creates the binary number 00001010 10 in binary and that is the value that is memset ed

1040113
int	chars
memset takes a int but casts it to an unsigned chars and then fills each byte of float sizeof float is probably 4 with that bit pattern

1040142
background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position	background-image	background-position	background-image	background-color
the 5 attributes it includes are background-color background-image background-repeat background-attachment and background-position

1040176
inherited	properties
specifies that the setting of the background-attachment properties should be inherited from the parent element

1040176
opera	firefox
note for this to work in firefox and opera the background-attachment property must be set to fixed

1040188
children	parent
this will give only the parent class and nested children access

1040201
post	get
there are two ways of sending data from a form to a web app get and post

1040259
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
as far as i know opera 9 and webkit safari google-chrome do it on pcs and rumour has it that ff3.5 will also be able

1040272

1040634
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the simplest solution is just to use an auto margin and give your div a fixed width and height

1040634
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this will work in ie7 firefox opera safari and google-chrome

1040645
post	get
i can get it to go to the correct controller but it s looking for the idnex method so it looks like it s treating my request as a get request even though the log says its a post request

1040688
width	height
your code disappears because you have block elements with line breaks and height and width inside an inline element no line breaks and no height or width

1040689
children	parent
when you remove an object such as logininterface from its parent s displaylist all of the children inside of that object will be automatically removed from memory as well as long as there are no other objects that contain references to the children

1040719
integer	fractions
you can subtract the integer portion from the value itself to retrieve the fractions part

1040719
integer	fractions
you can then multiply it to get the fractions part represented as an integer at whatever precision you d like

1040719
integer	fractions
mapping the fractions portion to an integer has some challenges - many floating point numbers cannot be represented as a base-10 integer and thus may require more digits to represent than an integer can support

1040780
doc	rtf
i m trying to call a php script from my php page in order to convert an rtf doc to a pdf using openoffice

1040861
hide	show
show and hide work perfectly fine

1040861
hide	show
blargh is hidden when the browser opens and i can show and hide it but clicking the links

1040881
width	height
if the layout you are trying to design is in fact a grid or table rows and columns i suggest either using the uniformgrid control for evenly-spaced rows and columns or the grid with height width set per row column and margins on all elements set to 0 to fully fill its cell

1040888
hide	show
or you could trigger the clicks of the show hide bindings and that way you wouldn t have to change the implementation of a#slick-toggle should you decide to change the animations

1040917
post	get
i wouldn t start passing any user information through post get vars when switching domains

1040917
ssl	https
the answer to your sign up page is that you need to force https ideally from code behind so users can enter their account information with the ssl encryption and see that trusty lock icon

1040937
mouseover	mouseout
or use javascript mouseover mouseout

1040951
int	chars
in the case of primitive types int chars etc. or array types like naming rules defined in the java virtual machine specification for field descriptors are used

1040975
firefox	safari
maybe the most complete package of the bunch and supports testing in ie firefox and safari

1040987
client-side	server-side
sifr is a client-side technique that leverages javascript and flash so is pretty much independent of which server-side language you use

1041002
tapestry	stripes
check out any of the frameworks tapestry spring s web framework stripes struts...they can all do this kind of thing in the dark blindfolded hands tied in the rain with nails on the floor

1041003
aggregate-functions	sum
you may only reference non-aggregate values single-row values in an aggregate-functions or in the where clause so the solution would involve placing your case inside an aggregate-functions in this case your sum

1041012
implements	extends
extends ienumerable so already implements ienumerable

1041019
ienumerable	iqueryable
you re usually not worried what you re really getting if a list a ienumerable a iqueryable or whatever

1041029
ienumerable	iqueryable
well it might be iqueryable instead of ienumerable

1041083
superclass	subclassing
here you re doing the reverse - you re attempting to reference an instance of the supertype in a variable of the subtype assuming decal is the superclass and transactiondecal the subclassing

1041092
bazaar	git
there are a few popular versions git mercurial and bazaar

1041146
getter	setter
the linq to sql and other data sources models use a traditional object model of add remove getter and setter and update to commit the changeset to the data backing

1041151
range	minimum
the idea there is that the minimum and maximum of the range stays the same as the input but the middle is bent like you have in your graphs which i might note is not the circular arc which you would get from the cosine implementation

1041202
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff
in particular this library support wav au aiff mp3 csl sd smp and nist sphere files

1041214

1041400
min	max
i know the bounding box extents of the environment min xyz max xyz

1041448
chunked	transfer-encoding
the response is being sent as a transfer-encoding chunked

1041513
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1041524
prng	random
in fact performing any additional actions from a number returned by a prng doesn t really increase its randomness and in fact the number can become less random

1041524
prng	random
therefore in operations where the high-end is discarded and the low end is returned the value can become less random than the original value returned from the prng

1041539
apache	nginx
thus using keep alive on the apache side is pointless when using nginx in front of it

1041539
apache	nginx
because though nginx doesn t implement keep alive it should drop the connections promptly as it will have no intention of reusing them so you shouldn t suffer if you do forget to turn of keep alive in apache when using nginx as front end

1041594
subtraction	addition	subtraction	modulo	addition	modulo
similiarly addition subtraction and modulo are exact

1041677
cdr	cons
a cons cell consists of two parts which are called car and cdr

1041677
cdr	cons
a list is a series of cons cells where each car holds some value and each cdr points to the respective next cell the last cdr pointing to nil

1041677
cdr	cons
when you write cons a-list x this creates a new cons cell with a reference to a-list in the car and x in the cdr which is most likely not what you want

1041707
int	chars
moreover it will also work for other types so you could use it on an int a short a chars etc

1041716
children	parent
this will mean your linq to sql queries become less intuitive querying against entity.right and entity.left isn t quite as pretty as parent or children ... but you can do in one query what might take hundreds or thousands in the literal recursive approach

1041763
post	get
sort of what register_globals does to the post get etc vars

1041766
folder	directory
i m using a directory structure folder because the are a natural example of hierarchical data

1041815
railo	jrun	jboss	resin
i ve tried combinations of jboss railo war apache jkmount resin jrun etc

1041819
post	get
there s a post here that will get you started

1041832
put	get
it will usually come out in the same order it was added but there are no guarantees and once you get a lot of rows in your table there s a reasonably high probability that they won t come out in the order you put them in

1041847
for-loop	arrays
i then explode it and put the ids names into an arrays and then use a for-loop to echo them out

1041858
width	height
makte your grid the same size as your layout grid and remove width and height properties for the user control

1041882
railo	jrun
here is a blog post on setting up railo in jrun

1041883
ftp	telnet
it does not matter whether you use wcf dcom ftp telnet or anything else to connect to windows server

1041903
console.readline	console.writeline
i use console console.readline and console.writeline for input and output

1041915
folder	directory
rather than constantly push to two different folder locations i figured i can push to one location and have a virtual directory on each website point to the single folder on the webserver

1041920
postgresql	mysql
i do not know about mysql but i know that where i work we use a stored procedure on our postgresql databases to do this

1041928
getter	setter
then set your delegate to be this new manager set your vertical field manager to be the middle field you ll probably want a designated setter your button field to the bottom field again designated getter

1041961
post	get
when people realize that it can t do everything they get angry and post that it s dead to their blogs

1041995
r5rs	r6rs

1042110
cout	cin
in c++ using cin and cout is too slow

1042139
rsa	dsa
update the pgp module does not provide ways to generate keys but presumably these could be created with the lower level rsa dsa etc

1042139
openssl	m2crypto
also if you know how to generate these using openssl command line commands it should be reasonably easy to convert that to m2crypto calls

1042169
distance	polygons
to answer your original question as to how to generate the smaller polygons you can find the centroid of each polygons and offset each vertex by a percentage of the distance to that centroid point of the polygons to get the smaller polygons

1042174
post	get
if i have try to use the updatepanel on a project that was originally a .net 1.1 project upgraded to 2.0 now recently upgraded to 3.5 i can t get partial post backs for anything

dlsym	dlopen
this comes handy while using dlsym and dlopen for calling such functions

1042315
width	height
important overide when i need to use custom width height

1042324
min	max
in general probably the easiest would be to put the logic into a trigger that would check to see what value is being inserted and change it to your max or min if it s out of bounds

1042339
wordpress	joomla
for php i am using codeigniter joomla and even wordpress

1042381

you should mock stub with one of the mocking apis jmock or easymock and inject the mock into the class-under-test

1042896
inherited	properties
imo you need only to inherited your interface from ienumerable message so you do not need special properties to get messages because ienumerable has corresponding method getenumerator

post	get
here s some instructions on how to get grails working with netbean s couldn t submit the second url in my last post

1042946
toupper	uppercase	tolower	uppercase	tolower	toupper
some characters do not round trip toupper ãÿ is ss and tolower ss is ss but there are some words only distingished by ãÿ vs ss so will give a false positive is matched by mapping to uppercase and which will break assumptions about case mapping not changing string lengths

1042946
tolower	toupper
tolower i is i unless you have working in turkish or azari where the result is ä latin small letter dotless i and toupper i is ä latin capital letter i with dot above

1042946
tolower	toupper
in the past approaches based on toupper and tolower where making assumptions about working in only english text and ignoring the majority of the worlds glyphs and characters

1042961
g++	gcc
550kb is about as small as you can get it because mingw and gcc g++ in general are bad at stripping unused functions

innodb	myisam
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks

1043003
inherited	properties
note internet explorer does not support the properties value inherited

1043024
client-side	server-side
always keep in mind that client-side validation is for the user s convenience and to some extend to reduce network traffic for bad requests but the real validation has to be done server-side

1043132
hide	show
i remember having to actually hide the controls when i launched my popup and show them again when the popup closes

1043142
width	height
you can also place an iframe with 100 width and height which will hide the combobox

1043146
comparator	icomparer
edit alternatively you could sort with a custom comparator icomparer if that s applicable to your situation

1043148
hide	show
an ugly work-arround is to hide all combos when you are going to show the popup

config	ini
we don t have xml or ini config files in some foreign syntax

1043395
hex	binary
bytes when converted to hex are two hex digits or 8 binary digits depending on what base you look at it in

1043395
integer	unsigned
the above statement shifts the high 4 bits down is unsigned right shift and logical ands it with 0000 1111 so that the result is an integer equal to the high 4 bits of the byte first hex digit

1043400
gif	png
for non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much better

1043400
gif	png
also internet explorer 6 doesn t exhibit problems displaying png images with a 1 bit alpha channel which is essentially what gif has too

1043401
gif	png
png afaik will always be a smaller file size than gif because it uses a better compression algorithm

1043408
mouseover	mouseout
i know i can use mouseover mouseout to bind the event with .live

1043408
mouseover	mouseout
which is a good solution if it weren t for mouseover mouseout bad habit to break the event if you hover a child element of the current element the mouseover is bound to

1043408
mouseover	mouseout
or should i just roll over and use mouseover mouseout with live

1043635
svg	vml
in one of the few posts on the subject groups.google.co.in it is explained that for example browsers which doesn t support svg or vml send placemark polygon polyline information to google where the map will be rendered and sent back

1043635
svg	vml
from what i ve found ie6 does not have support for svg or vml and thus not capable of rendering the information by itself

1043653
post	get
server 2 listens on a uri post data get json data convert back to dictionary or orm objects insert into db

pop-up	dialog
jquery as mentioned could get you a pop-up or a modal dialog but would not serve very well to open a new window as the op requested

1043687
int	chars
this functions useful computes an int which i want to be transmitted as a parameter to the constructor variables const chars s

1043687
int	chars
so i am converting the int to a string and then to a const chars data type

1043690
svg	vml
google maps uses vml on ie browsers and svg on the others

1043698
stdout	stderr
you should consume the stdout and stderr in separate threads otherwise you will experience blocking behaviour

1043716
stdout	stderr
also you read the stderr and stdout sequentially

1043716
stdout	stderr
however the read to stderr blocks as there are no errors printed by the application and you don t move to the phase where you read the stdout

1043716
stdout	stderr
you could join the stderr and stdout via processbuilder.redirecterrorstream and then you need only to read stdout

1043716
stdout	stderr
your sample works in some cases because when you are blocked on the stderr the application response on the stdout doesn t hit the size of the communication buffer

1043716
stdout	stderr
when the application quits the stderr loop exits and the loop for stdout is able to retieve the contents of that buffer

1043729
getter	setter
synthesize the setter and or getter

1043757
awt	swing
if i replace the swing jbutton with an awt button like so

you should probably apply ceil or floor before casting to an int

1043786
children	parent
can someone please let me know that if i have a web page that consists of a checkbox parent and on this same web page i also have a iframe that is sourced from another page that displays a number of records which also has a checkbox children against each record if i tick the parent checkbox i would like to cascade this through to all children checkboxs within the iframe as well as disable these children checkboxes

1043796
int	double
i don t think the cast is necessary there is an implicit cast from double to int

1043812
int	double
you don t need to cast double are casted automatically to int if needed

1043812
int	double
when casting double to int the decimal places are truncated and not rounded

1043891
gif	png
we currently have a server side script takes it s input from fields but it s very unstable and only supports jpeg and png and some gif files so we ve been looking for a replacement for a while now but i m having a hard time finding anything

postgresql	mysql
we have developed a design time tool for generating and editing entity framework and linq to sql models with further code generation for oracle mysql postgresql sql server and sqlite for our customers

1044009
implements	extends
a more elegant solution would be to write your own authorization action filter either by extends authorize or implements iauthorizationfilter as follows

1044015
button	checkbox
clicking the button on the parent page will select all the checkbox with the name checkbox on the frame page

we honestly see this as a bug in coldfusion but due to the compatibility requirements we will adapt this behavior and make it optional in the railo administrator

1044678
recursive-descent	lalr
as a matter of interest it is also worth looking into recursive-ascent which is a parsing algorithm directly encoded after the fashion of recursive-descent but capable of handling any lalr grammar

1044749
ienumerable	iqueryable
both iqueryable and already extend ienumerable so it s not adding anything on that front.

1044753
ienumerable	iqueryable
it extends ienumerable iqueryable and

1044779
actionscript	haxe
i already have a strong understanding of actionscript 3 and have not worked with haxe yet but i have read the language reference docs and it seems that haxe has some of the features from my other favorite languages c# and ruby

1044786
awt	swing
plus it will keep your awt swing objects separated so you will know which is which and will be able to avoid combining them

1044812
websphere	ibm
now this is running on my local websphere 6 server which is spun up by ibm rad

1044840
min	max
you could try to use a scanline algorithm - for every line of the polygon so y min y ..max y get l min x and r max x

1044844
opera	firefox
in any browser firefox opera etc. geturl

1044888

1044927
min	max
it s completely blank all white with min max and close buttons

1044969
jobs	cron
for example on many systems i work with users are not allowed to have their own cron jobs - so writing your program to take care of its own timer-ness might be an advantage

1044988
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this in firefox and google-chrome

1045026
equals	gethashcode
also you could change the gethashcode and equals method to ensure you have no duplicate or make the getbehavior method even faster constant time

1045050
firefox	safari
i know there is outerwidth outerheight in firefox safari and other browsers

1045078
rss	feed
rss feed are pretty inconsistent this is the fall through we use

1045103
getter	setter
this type of cross-behavior getter and setter would allow communication when it is required

1045146
post	get
i checked out some other post but i cannot seem to get it working

1045253
hash	md5
first use a simple cryptographic hash like md5 not crc32

1045261
inherited	properties
you could also set the min-height to inherited but then you ll see how the other properties come into play the first child the span in the span before the button has a block layout

1045327
globalization	localization
msdn has a lot of information on globalization and localization and how this works even within the context of clickonce deployment

1045333
folder	directory
the file system directory containing user profile folder

1045354
nsstring	nsdata
nsfilehandle lets you read an nsdata which you can then convert to an nsstring but it s essentially the same process.

1045371
tinymce	freetextbox
on top of my head tinymce and freetextbox

1045398
mouseleave	mouseenter
on a mouseenter mouseleave event i would like to capture the absolute top position of the cell of a table

1045426
persistent	transient
this is really just a case of understanding how your application will be creating an object graph and what entities are transient and which might be persistent or detached

1045426
persistent	transient
i would recommend reading this entire chapter from the hibernate docs to understand fully the terminology of transient persistent and detached

1045434
width	height
it seems that setting the width and height style properties as below do not take in ff

1045456
width	height
a partial solution would be to calculate how much to move my tooltip by finding out if the current mouse coordinate + the tooltip width height and see if it will exceed window.innerheight or window.innerwidth

1045503
unix	solaris
this doesn t work correctly under solaris unix linux using the system gtklookandfeel

1045540
post	get
i sort of a continuous integration process for some javascript code at a former employer that worked off of post commit hooks in mercurial to do various operations like minify compress run yuitest and other steps that were needed to get it ready for production use

1045618
cos	sin
3959 acos cos radians 40 cos radians lat cos radians long - radians -110 + sin radians 40 sin radians long

1045621
mouse	keyboard
so i don t use mouse events but keyboard events which doesn t give me a listviewitem of course

1045629
width	height
when i look at the image object from the toolkit in debug it does say height and width are -1 but the imagedata within the has byte 5144

1045807
httprequest	httpresponse
httprequest and httpresponse pre mvc used to have a getinputstream and getoutputstream that could be used for that purpose

1045849
runtimeexception	filenotfoundexception
you just wrap the filenotfoundexception in a runtimeexception

1045850
illegalstateexception	runtimeexception
if your position is that this is so unlikely and should just end the program use an existing runtime exception even runtimeexception itself if not illegalstateexception

1045865
mouse	keyboard
a keyboard action that depends on the mouse position sounds a little unorthodox

1045865
mouse	keyboard
keyboard actions should normally effect some item that is highlighted focused selected on the screen either selected by previous keyboard actions or by a previous mouse click on that item

1045873
width	margin
if you are adding another column be sure to account for the additional width plus margin and either reduce width on other elements or increase the width of your containing element

1045879
formview	entitydatasource
using a formview i bind to the request data request_det entitydatasource and can see the relevant information for the request for the related tables username requestno but i get the numeric value for the req_status

1045894
children	parent
watch out for the circular reference now between parent and children now

1045938
width	height
this can be expanded for the width and height

1045938
width	height
each of those size attributes can be expanded to show the width and height

1045938
width	height
when the pdf file is rendered via the reportviewer s built-in export function the width and height of each page within the pdf will be determined by the width and height in the report s pagesize attribute you could override this if you used your own custom code for the pdf rendering

1045938
width	margin
your report s body s width plus the report s left margin plus the report s right margin must be smaller than or equal to the report s pagesize s width

1045938
width	margin
for example if my report s body has width 7.75 my left margin is 0.5 my right margin is 0.5 and the width specified in the pagesize is 8.5 my report will always use 2 pages for each 1 page of data

1045938
width	height
as such in my last example i would rather set the pagesize to have width 11 and height 8.5 which is a real letter-size in landscape

1046066
hash	salt
if the hash does not use a salt then there is no sign for that

1046066
hash	salt
the reason for this is so you can have many types of hash with different salt and feeds that string into a function that knows how to match it with some other value

1046068
udp	tcp
let s say i m programming in java or python or c++ for a simple problem could be to build an tcp udp echo server or computation of factorial

implements	extends
i ll point out that in my experience this is why i tend to extends abstracttablemodel or out right implements my own tablemodel interface from the ground up

1046199
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
you likely want to take a look at autoresetevent and manualresetevent

1046214
post	get
note that you use the urlrequest object to specify and get post parameters you want to send so in that case you want to build the urlrequest separately rather than inline

1046234
rss	feed
when you set security with forms authentication in the web.config you then lose the ability to access the rss feed

1046234
rss	feed
i d like to be able to secure elmah but yet still pass through authentication to the axd to be able to access the rss feed elmah.axd rss from a rss reader

1046234
rss	feed
thinking that http authentication would be proper as then i can probably get to the rss feed with the following url syntax i assume you would need to set authentication mode windows on that specific path in the web.config

1046239
put	get
now i have put it on the show event but this seems not to get triggered consistently or before the page is fully created the first time

1046248
distance	polygons
i m looking for a polygons object point object and some operations like union intersection distance and area

1046260
bazaar	git
others popular tools in this category include git and bazaar

i have an oracle database that i have readonly access with no permission to create temporary tables

1046286
httphandler	httpmodule
create an httpmodule that intercepts requests to documents in this file share and presents them through an httphandler to the user

1046303
caliburn	prism
assuming you have picked silverlight then comes the difficult task do you use code behind mvp mvc mvvm prism caliburn slextensions

1046304
width	height
this way you can quickly calculate cell width and height yourself

1046327
touchesbegan	touchesended
to detect the touch in a view controller you could use the touchesbegan and touchesended methods store the touch from touchesbegan and if the touch moved more than some amount to the left or right it was a flick not a nudge to the left or right

1046344
int	chars
if you send it a chars or int it just strips everything above the 8th bit with 0xff

1046370
put	get
i want to be able to somehow put the path of the cd something like d productname prerequisites dotnetfx35clientsetup.exe so it can get it and install it from there

1046373
haskell	agda
if you want something really new agda is the new haskell

1046373
haskell	agda
agda incorporates the many lessons learned from 20-year-old languages like haskell and 30-year-old languages like ml and it pushes the envelope with the very latest work in type systems

1046462
public	protected
the spec states that an entity must have a public or protected no-arg ctor

1046537
width	height
you can control l r and t b screen positions and relative width and height

1046617
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard input audio

1046688
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are transport level protocols whereas bluetooth would be a lower level protocol

1046688
udp	tcp
thus you could use tcp or udp on top of bluetooth just as you use tcp and udp on top of ethernet

tapestry	struts	tapestry	wicket	tapestry	seam	struts	wicket	wicket	seam	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket	jsf	seam
there are lots to choose from spring mvc struts 2 jsf tapestry wicket seam and so on

1046710
stdout	stderr
there are 2 devenv executables one is devenv.com which is a console mode application that handles stdin stdout and stderr proxying for the other executable devenv.exe which is a gui mode application

1046718
tapestry	struts	tapestry	seam
better off starting from a good base with lots of developer expertise like spring struts seam or tapestry

1046721
post	put
therefore to authenticate the request i need to access the raw post or put body content to calculate and verify the digital signature

1046721
post	put
lastly to be nice and restful i d like this to work for post and put requests

1046737
disk	ram
in practice it s even less than that usually 2 gb or 3 gb depending on the os and various linker options. on a 64 bit machine you can have a huge virtual address space in any practical sense limited only by disk and a pretty damn big ram

1046771
int	chars
it s not good enough that a chars can be implicitly promoted to an int

1046814
hash	md5
if you have the opportunity to store the original name in a database i would simply create a file with a random hash mt_rand md5 sha1

1046916
gridview	repeater	listview	gridview
in mvc you really want to avoid data bound controls like repeater gridview listview

1046929
gridview	rowdatabound
i am calculating the total using rowdatabound event of gridview in asp.net with c#

1046935
disk	ram
we thought about using ram disk to help on disk i o if we have to but just wondering if there are any other options

1046946
int	double
in other words an int and an short won t necessarily compare like this nor would an int and a double

1046977
int	double
for strings double int etc it was pretty much baked in but if you used custom objects you could write the audit implementation for them that just had to return a audit object

1046980
post	get
my eventual goal is to get a basic message board going post edit delete user sessions

1047058
jobs	cron
just create your cron jobs to call wget to upload or download your file via ftp

1047075
int	double
1 adt which means basically a new type something like int int or real numbers double or even a new concept like date

1047075
int	double
look at double and int in c++ the int is a sun of double because every int is a double at least in concept

1047128
hide	show
you can of course further re-factor the code to hide show the right view

1047239
keydown	keyup
you can use a keydown or keyup event that sets a function to run in 1 second and if the user types another key within that second you can clear the timeout and set a new one

1047240
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
use django turbogears webpy cheerpy pylons etc etc

1047256
post	get
but i don t just want the post to show i also want some info about the user that posted that one so then i must get some info from the users table as well

1047294
width	height
right now the technique i m using is graphics.measurestring to get a sizef containing the width and the height of my string to compare it to the height and width of my textbox control

1047294
width	height
i can get it to work fine for the width but i can t seem to ge the height right in a multiline textbox

1047319
width	height
i m pretty sure there isn t any browser api i can query but has anyone worked it out by inspecting and comparing certain height width measurements exposed by the dom

1047337
width	height
what about determining the distance between the viewport width and the resolution width and likewise for height

1047339
r5rs	r6rs
in standard scheme r4rs r5rs or r6rs the code should work unmodified

1047368
equals	gethashcode
required override equals object and gethashcode methods

1047386

an alternate approach extending the wtf factor - trying to get around the intptr issue is to just put the intptr into a system.io.stream using

1047407
physx	ogre3d
i m using ogre3d and physx

1047429
apache	nginx
wsgi is the crucial glue between web servers not just the simple one in wsgiref of course -- real ones too such as apache or nginx both with respective modules called mod_wsgi as well as for example google app engine -- that one offers wsgi too as its fundamental api and web applications and frameworks that make it easier to write such applications

1047434
postgresql	mysql
here are the documentation pages related to date time functions for both mysql and postgresql

1047452
stdout	stderr
it is very similar to popen in fact the only difference being that the caller can access the child s stderr stream in addition to stdin and stdout

1047479
pascal	delphi
some examples in delphi object pascal

1047506
aggregate-functions	sum
you can use group by to combine results when using an aggregate-functions like sum

1047520
typedef	typename
you need typedef not typename

1047534
pivot-table	crosstab
crosstab pivot-table workbench

1047595
many-to-many	one-to-many
now in a relational database author would be stored as a foreign key pointing to a user.id and the tags and comments would be stored as one-to-many or many-to-many relationships using a separate table to store the relationships

1047625
postgresql	informix
this is very similar for every db driver i used in python and jython i work with postgresql oracle and informix

1047630
post	put
if you want to keep everything controlled yourself you can put a resize script on a server of yours which takes the url to the raw uploaded image which can be up to 10mb due to http response size limit but you would have to store it as 1mb chunks in the datastore downloads it from your application resizes it and then post s it back to your application

1047638
int	double
therefore b 2 becomes the double 1.0 apparently in this case its value is slightly less than one giving you a 0 as the int value

1047638
ceil	floor
if you want to prevent this use both floor and ceil and compare the values

1047655
dictionary	map
i think what you call map is in python a dictionary

1047659
onmousedown	onkeydown
then you need to handle onmousedown or onmouseclick and onkeydown events and shift state images for needed list item

1047699
onmousedown	onmouseup
you can see i m trying to change the class of the div containing season.png onmousedown and revert it onmouseup

1047700
gridview	repeater
for now maybe you could use a repeater instead of the gridview and render the table row including the id by yourself

1047726
opera	safari
script at least in ff3 ie8 opera safari

1047739
put	get
the constructor will get data from table_student for me and put it in student- data but i won t be able to get the data from table_person and put those two sets of data into one object

it works fine in the latest version of internet explorer firefox and safari

1047906
firefox	safari
this works fine in firefox 3 but does not work in ie8 or safari

1047997
tolower	toupper
as a side note using toupper is more efficient than using tolower so toupper would be the way to go

1048019
superclass	subclassing
use some form of superclass or subclassing subclassing on the group box

1048045
pop-up	dialog
sometimes unhandled exception occurs in the aplication and default abort retry ignore dialog pop-up

1048045
try-catch	exception-handling
so i enclosed all the code in main method with try-catch statement but it didn t help at all - the exception-handling dialog is still shown sometimes

1048045
try-catch	exception-handling	pop-up	dialog
this try-catch clause shoud catch all unhandled exception-handling and the exception-handling dialog should never pop-up afaik

1048168
metaphone	soundex
metaphone soundex sql server fuzzy name search and i quickly found -

1048186
actionscript	mxml
i don t have any experience of flex but as far as i know you are stuck with mxml and actionscript

1048224
width	height
i want the dialog to be of a fixed width but adapt the height depending on how big the text is

1048239
getter	setter
obviously this can be handled by making both the getter and setter of the data synchronised - but for a large web application this is quite an overhead

1048242
tiff	png
the provided formats are jpeg png and tiff however the design allows new formats to be added easily

1048254
min	max
upon changing the the max and min values of a progress bar widget the progress bar appears blank

1048270
getter	setter
testing say simple getter and setter looks like a waste of time

1048273
librsvg	cairo
you can probably use cairo and librsvg to read svg into cairo surface and export to pdf using cairo

1048292
swt	swing
if there are any similarities in your proposal to other gui frameworks forms swing swt comparison are welcome too

1048300
chunked	transfer-encoding
i made test and found out that transfer-encoding chunked is the only one reason of exception

1048316
internationalization	localization
cultural internationalization localization

1048324
toolchain	binutils
if you want to read some well written code gnu s savannah is a browsable repository of the gnu stuff binutils gcc toolchain and tons of others

1048352
for-loop	loops
a while for-loop on a select call without a timeout on the other hand will give you a higher cpu usage as you re constantly spinning in loops

1048374
post	get
after loading the files it would be easy to get the stats from the database and post them in any format needed

1048389
webclient	httpwebrequest
webclient doesn t have this kind of functionality - even the slightly-lower-level httpwebrequest doesn t as far as i m aware

1048428
webclient	httpwebrequest
as stated by jon skeet this is not available in the webclient not httpwebrequest classes

1048459
hash	salt
make sure that the high score is posted with a hash key this needs to be salt and it needs to hash the user name and the score posted

1048473
free	malloc
but it s no worse than things used to be in the bad old days of malloc free

1048523
datamapper	activerecord
you can use datamapper or activerecord or just plain dbi

1048570
inherited	properties
this question along with its answer explains why you can t easily bind a datagridview to an interface type and get columns for properties inherited from a base interface

1048581
let	curry
there s also a macro someone has written that let s you write functions that implicitly curry for you when you call them with insufficient arguments jeffm papers curry.html

1048601
runtimeexception	classnotfoundexception
but when i run my plugin a different version of rhino is used and i get runtimeexception like classnotfoundexception and so on

1048869
disk	ram
after that you have all the data cached in ram it s just parsing and compilation and probably becomes cpu boudn rather than disk io bound

1048900
public	protected
in your case they could help if you are willing to change the privates that your need to test to protected virtual which is not as bad a going public of internal

1048912
perl	tcl
my experience with tcl tk goes back to 1995 but in 2000 or so i discovered perl tk and never looked back

1048912
perl	tcl
and lately the tcl and tkx perl packages give us modern-looking gui s

1048927
gif	png
png transparency works differently to gif transparency - you don t need to define a particular colour as transparent

1048956
getter	setter
obviously this can be handled by making both the getter and setter of the data synchronised - but for a large web application this is quite an overhead

1048964
division	modulo
use the modulo to perform get division remainder

1048968
qfile	qtextstream
assigning a qtextstream to a qfile and reading it line-by-line is easy and works fine but i wonder if the performance can be inreased by first storing the file in memory and then processing it line-by-line

1048968
qbytearray	qiodevice	qfile	qbytearray	qiodevice	qfile
qfile is inhereted from qiodevice which allows me to readall it into qbytearray but how to proceed then and divide it into lines

1049017
bazaar	git
i m not going to give a specific one to avoid potential flaming but the big ones are git mercurial and bazaar all of which are quite good

1049042
qbytearray	qtextstream	qfile	qtextstream	qfile	qbytearray
or you could read all into the qbytearray and qtextstream can take that as an input instead of a qfile

1049052
min	max
daily weekly monthly yearly calculation for max min and average value

1049052
daemon	cron
something simple like set it up set cron or if it has a daemon even better set input enjoy output

1049058
inherited	properties
a workaround is to create a new interface ihaseverything that inherited from ihasname2 and therefore from ihasname1 and reimplements the properties you need in your binding you can do that with the new statement

1049064
hide	show
hide the id column then the grid show

1049081
unix	aix
i have the java code below running on unix both aix and linux but it doesn t work

1049122
subtract	add
and if you want to move the gun in one step you would just add subtract the delta correctly

1049193
getter	setter
you may well want to only put the getter in the interface though - it s slightly unusual to include a setter in an interface

1049193
getter	setter
there are oddities if you want to override an existing or abstract property which only has a getter to add a setter but it s okay to implement a getter-only interface with setter as well i believe.

1049246
3des	aes
so for strong encryption provided by .net you d be best off going for either 3des 168 bit effectively or aes up to 256 bit - the latter is implemented under its original name of rijndael as .net first published this library before the aes selection process had formally ended

1049285
subtract	add
any time you add or subtract angles you can force the result into n bits using a logical and operation angle 0x00ff for 8 bits

1049339
mvp	presenter
this ties the presenter directly to a form ignoring the entire point of mvp

1049369
firefox	safari
other browsers like firefox safari are fine because they usually follow the w3c standard better

1049399
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
we certainly wish we could since we spend tons of time making our pages work on ie6 as well as ie7 ie8 firefox 2 firefox 3 google-chrome safari 2 safari 3

1049413
google-chrome	safari
ie6 is absolute garbage compared to the latest browsers such as google-chrome safari and even ie8

1049419
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
for my personal project i focus on firefox opera safari ie8

1049419
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
result it was able to work in firefox after some third-party components were updated but it is totally screwed in opera safari

1049450
post	get
this blog post gives an idea of how to use the latter to get an nsdictionary from a json string

1049466
min	max
let ymin floor min y1 y2 y3 ymax ceiling max y1 y2 y3 xmin floor min x1 x2 x3 ymax ceiling max x1 x2 3

1049529
postgresql	mysql
same is true for oracle mysql and postgresql

1049558
width	height
i have an image img src img1.png width 64 height 64 - the image is actually 64x64

1049558
width	height
now i have another image img src img2.png width 64 height 64 however the image is not as big as it should be its 32x32 - what happens here is it resizes the image to 64x64 and makes it look like

1049586
post	get
apparently the guy who built this did not believe in the post redirect get pattern and instead serves up a page directly in response to a form submission

1049588
bash	zsh
in both zsh and bash 4.0

1049597
inline	inlining
you can probably convince yourself by thinking through the same scenario with a reference type that inlining has no problems for by-ref params - a change in the original function has the same repurcussions as a change in an inline version of that function

1049644
width	height
set it s width and height to 64 set no borders no spacing no padding and make it align and valign to center

1049646
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview control bound to an objectdatasource which returns a list of objects that look like this

1049679
getter	setter
is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like

1049681
width	height
an img tag with width and height attributes is saying stretch or shrink the image to this size regardless of its actual size

1049693
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
not sure about how this works with objectdatasource but with sqldatasource we set keys on the rows of the gridview

1049708
starttls	smtps
i can t find anything in the ruby api for net smtps referencing tls or a starttls command

1049732
rss	feed
there are other examples of him populating the coverflow from an rss feed on the page linked above but he doesn t include the source for these

1049732
actionscript	mxml
i ve defined some panels in the mxml and set so that the new panel i ve created in actionscript will be added to the coverflow container

1049733
int	chars
that s a relatively common c idiom for converting a number stored as a chars to an int so it should be legible to other programmers who read it

1049748
children	parent
since querying for immediate children of a node is complicated i think it makes sense to also store the parent id in the table

1049880
integer	unsigned
first consider an unsigned integer stored in 4 bits

1049880
subtract	add
the circuits to add and subtract using sign magnitude will be very complex

1049880
subtraction	addition
you can store negative numbers you get rid of the two zeros problem but addition and subtraction remains difficult

1049907
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
wsdl.exe is the only core .net proxy generator other than svcutil.exe

1049918
mp3	flv
i should give the input as frames but in flv i will get the sorenson video and mp3 audio frame after doing some trivial string operations to remove the headers

1050001
width	height
if you want to get width by height information you can use capabilities.screenx and capabilities.screeny

1050001
width	height
therefore each 412x324 pixel image above will appear at 412 1440 29 width and 324 900 36 height of your full screen at your current video setting

1050001
width	height
i ve seen a couple of posts about setting a div s width height to 1in and then querying the offsetwidth offsetheight but that doesn t work any better than screendpi

1050080
bmp	png
textures use apple s own texture2d class from the samples bmp will work but i recommend png because of the platform optimizations

1050109
portrait	landscape
when you switch from landscape to portrait and back on the iphone text reflows

1050123
charindex	substr
for splitting you could use charindex substr and other string manipulation functions

1050146
superclass	subclassing
as we know there is a relationship between a subclassing and its superclass is-a

1050170
webclient	httpwebrequest
given that you generally communicate with couchdb over rest and json i d imagine it wouldn t be too hard to use json.net and the normal webclient httpwebrequest classes to do it

1050201
icomparable	compareto
your class should implement icomparable or in order for the sort functions to know about your compareto method

1050206
comparator	icomparer
as an alternative if you don t want your class to implement that you can also implement icomparer clientworkspace in another class or create a method that matches the comparator clientworkspace delegate

1050207
icomparable	compareto
you can implement the icomparable interface and provide an implementation of compareto method there

1050256
jobs	cron
i know i can set up automated jobs cron for unix and scheduled task for windows but i want it cross platform and i want it in our application s log configuration as a part of our application rather than in separate code outside in os specific scripting languages

1050260
icomparable	compareto
it is not enough to just implement the compareto method since the sorting algorithms will look for the icomparable interface before attempting to call compareto through that interface

1050331
min	max
- obtain values time at max min value fall time etc

1050331
min	max
can the blob be of a packed oracle type so that the values could be read by oracle itself ie to obtain max min etc

1050337
post	get
if you have any question post a comment and i ll get back to you asap

1050392
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox opera google-chrome safari will all display basic svg fine but will run into quirks if advanced features are used as support is incomplete

1050407
mouse	keyboard
two people sit down at one machine they share keyboard and mouse and talk about what they re doing as they go

1050424
hash	md5
you might consider using those values as text to generate an md5 hash or something similar

1050429
redmine	trac
i think some formalized bug tracker trac redmine jira fogbugz etc. could help us

1050435
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
an alternative would be to use nsurlconnection and create a new nsxmlparser and re-parse the data each time some data comes in in the connection didreceivedata method of your nsurlconnection s delegate

1050456
min	max
i have asked this question about using the a linq method that returns one object first min max etc from of a generic collection

1050457
cvs	svn
svn subversion and cvs - simpler to use with fewer resources available

1050461
stdout	stderr
i think the problem is this the program writes all of its output to stderr rather than stdout

1050461
stdout	stderr
so to overcome this it seems like you have to redirect the output of your program unix2dos uses stderr to stdout

1050461
stdout	stderr
the 2 means redirect stderr and 1 means to stdout

1050463
pop-up	dialog
the dialog box pop-up fairly quickly so this works for me

1050501
redmine	trac
we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use

1050534
width	height
ie7 ie8 and ff3 does not accept value 100 as height or width or sl2 object

1050534
width	height
change height and width to px value for ex 800px and that will solve the problem

1050545
actualheight	actualwidth
or you can pass it actualwidth actualheight and you ll get the bottom-right corner

1050660
firefox	safari
this made the page line up perfectly in firefox and safari but in ie the nav column was pushed over to the right too far

1050660
firefox	safari
the placement of this line of css is important if my page is still to look good in firefox and safari

1050660
firefox	safari
firefox and safari will read that line and then it will be over-ridden by the body div#nav selector lower in the document

1050660
firefox	safari
when ie 7 comes along it will act like firefox and safari

1050661
width	height
change width 100 height 100 to width 600px height 800px

1050692
vcard	vcalendar
i want to be able to read vcard and vcalendar data using .net i have something which does this and have looked at the specification

1050692
vcard	vcalendar
these are both stored as plain text filename.ics for vcalendar and filename.vcf for vcard

1050778
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
the graphicsmagick group overhauled the tiff format support with their version 1.2 and it is much faster at processing these types of images than the original imagemagick was

1050794
gridview	radiobuttonlist
the gridview contains a templatefield which contains a radiobuttonlist with listitems defined inline

1050800
put	get
if you re developing some kind of your own array abstraction you can get o 1 if you store smallest added value in additional attribute and compare it every time a new item is put into array

1050826
g++	gcc
however i use gcc g++ for all of my projects

1050842
hide	show
so when the user authenticates successfully i simply hide one div and show the other

1050899
fgets	fread
and i am talking about read here not fgets or fread both of which are buffered.

1050944
put	get
to test that the macro was getting run i put a msgbox statement in that subroutine and noticed that code before document.dte.executecommand edit.collapsetodefinitions ran fine but nothing seemed to get hit after that line

1050961
switching	screens
i was switching between eclipse and visual studio when i tried to go full screens in vs by pressing

1051004
put	get	post	put	post	get
i have read so many articles describing that how to send get post trace options requests but i still haven t found any sample code which successfully performs put and delete requests

1051016
getter	setter
use getter and setter to set the variable and make the default constructor private

1051047
move	drag
i want to be able to click and drag from anywhere on the form and move the whole set of stuff around panning

1051047
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
what i have tried so far is adding stuff to the main form s mousedown mouseup and mousemove events sort of looks something like what this guy shows but they aren t getting called breakpoints in them don t get hit

1051084
x86	64bit
this is why you see a program files x86 folder on your 64bit os to handle a lot of your old 32-bit apps

1051086
x86	64bit
most .net applications should work unmodified in 64bit if they target x86 instead of any cpu which is the vs.net default

1051111
versioning	upgrade
sometimes microsoft will add a method to the libraries and not upgrade their major or minor versioning

1051128
imagemagick	libtiff
tiff compression is available for free with libtiff or imagemagick and built into .net and java

1051181
hash	salt
you can expose a web service to the internet that will do the database access but requests to the service must match a strong hash and salt password which will be secured on the isp s server in the dmz.

1051183
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
look for the iphone versions of nscalendar nsdate and nsdatecomponents

1051204
getter	setter
a dto is a dumb object - it just holds properties and has getter and setter but no other logic of any significance other than maybe a compare or equals implementation

1051217
client-side	server-side
but asp.net is more about server-side processing than it is about client-side processing and what you want is completely client-side

1051273
textarea	textbox
and why so and other websites and software apple use courier-like fonts for data entry fields textbox textarea like this

1051288
portrait	landscape
if the device is in portrait mode then it should display the video but when the user changes the device to landscape mode it should just show an image

1051334
rss	feed
this was easy to set up and solved my problem of being able to authenticate elmah.axd and still be able to subscribe to the rss feed with basic authentication credentials

1051347
ubuntu	linux
my filesystem is currently ext3 on linux ubuntu server edition if it matters although i m in a position where i can still switch so comparisons between different filesystems would be fabulous

1051375
post	put
iam pretty new to these forums and it would be nice if they put the year on the time stamps pet peeve so i know how old the post are

1051403
starttls	smtps
net smtps doesn t look like it supports starttls encryption

1051413
installation	upgrade
this worked on my previous rails installation but is not working since i upgrade os x and reinstalled rails

1051457
imperative	declarative
imperative or declarative - do you dictate the flow of a program or are you writing down properties that need be fulfilled

1051463
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade my browser to safari 4 and find that our website is having some major issues specific to that browser versioning

1051529
firefox	safari
the first alert will pop-up as object xmldocument with firefox instead of object like it does for ie and safari

1051529
firefox	safari
the second alert in firefox will be undefined but in ie and safari it is object

1051541
min	max
examine and see if it s valid for what you think are the min and max values for i

1051550
xslt	xquery
you ll either want to transform it with xslt or use xpath or xquery etc. to fetch particular values out of it

1051564
post	get
reusing it will obviously mean the pre post functions don t get called every time

1051610
dateadd	datepart
the datepart and dateadd stuff are tsql specific but i d assume you d have access to similar functions on whatever platform you are using

1051623
ienumerable	icollection
if the underlying ienumerable t implements icollection t like t list t etc. then the copy step is skipped and the enumerator just iterates over the underlying collection directly

1051636
apache	nginx
we have an nginx load balancer in front of the apache server and i just figured out that safari 4 requires the nginx keepalive_timeout setting to be 0

1051639
octal	hex
you might want hex base-64 octal .

1051711
vbscript	jscript
i ve tried it in both vbscript and jscript and both give me errors

1051720
firefox	safari
just an idea - tested in firefox safari - seems to work if you create an iframe to store the document temporarily

1051722
min	max
you could also output the min and max as custom attributes of the textbox and even namespace them if you want to retain xhtml validity

1051724
glut	glfw
it provides raw opengl bindings as well as glut and glfw - as a beginner i found glfw much easier to use for my simple needs than glut

1051731
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception are subclasses of the runtimeexception or error classes

1051732
serializable	deserialization
our current serializable routine uses bigdecimal.toplainstring for serializable and new bigdecimal string for deserialization - i m assuming there s a better way

1051753
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
errors and runtimeexception are called unchecked-exception because the compiler does not enforce this requirement on them

1051761
hash	md5
i m looking for a c# wrapper to a native md5 or sha1 library to improve hash calculation performance

1051767
vcproj	csproj
i spent several hours investigating the msbuild task solution above and it s pretty good for managed code but i can t see any way to use it for c++ bar converting the vcproj to csproj eek

1051793
hash	md5
this library uses the broken md5 hash and there is even a bigger bug in the random number generation

visualvm	jstat
so the docs suggest i only need have jstat running remotely to monitor in visualvm while the ui is asking for jmxrmi

1051832
maven	pom.xml
as mentioned before you could use maven to deal with jar dependencies and if you like the homogeneous use of libraries define a pom.xml parent maven jargon across all your applications

1051849
google-chrome	firefox
here s a complete example that demonstrates negative margins verified on firefox google-chrome and ie8

1051876
put	get
so i am trying to invoke methods on a page and i know the values that i want to put inside the methods but i can t seem to get the syntax to work

1051925
children	parent
the children will be initialized when you save the parent regardless if children are added or when children are added

1051925
children	parent
if you want it to always be initialized you can do it manually in the parent when you define the children

1051945
portrait	landscape
eg if the orientation is portrait start the mpmovieplayercontroller playing the movie then when the orientation changes to landscape dismiss the movieplayer

1051953
getter	setter
most of their scripts will be arithmetic and logical expressions in some cases they will need to traverse object properties getter setter or contents of a map

1051963
getdate	dateadd
where created_at between dateadd week -1 getdate and getdate --specify the date range to include

1051968
post	put
i see why you might want to map rest url post to save and rest url id put to update but that goes against the meaning of those verbs

1051968
post	put
a put should be the only way to add a new url and post the only way to update a url

1051972
hash	md5
suppose you re using something like md5 the god of hash

1051974
openbsd	freebsd
it seems like freebsd or openbsd with the pf packetfilter and altq traffic shaping would suit your needs

pop-up	dialog
from a visual studio console application i right-clicked on references selected add reference from the pop-up menu clicked the browse tab in the add reference dialog and navigated to

1052070
ienumerable	ilist
you can also use multiple interfaces in a class so a class can be both a ilist and ienumerable in most languages you can on inherit one class

1052085
lisp	scheme
in scheme and other lexically scoped lisp you can make parameterized functions without using eval

1052092
aiff	caf
i am successfully able to record to a caf aiff file

1052093
post	get
you should know basic http like status codes cookies redirects post vs get url encoding and possibly what some of the more important headers do

1052117
post	get
but when i try to use post the body seems to get lost and is never printed out

1052127
post	get
concepts such as sessions caching state management cross site scripting styling client side vs server side programming browser support how http works get vs post how a form works cookies etc

1052127
observer-pattern	facade	observer-pattern	presenter	factories	presenter
learn about the basics such as repository pattern factories pattern facade pattern model view presenter pattern model view controller pattern observer-pattern and various other things

1052145
free	malloc
preferably one that doesn t overwrite new delete malloc or free

1052151
submit	submission
what you could probably do is submit your app with a backlog of in-app purchases five or six days ahead of time then consistently be submission your daily items ahead of when you want them to be available

1052173
onclick	onfocus
dojo does not support custom names for binding to events on dom nodes just the standard dom event names like onclick onfocus etc

1052188
dictionary	map
first regarding the dictionary class that class is considered obselete the documentation recommends using map instead

1052211
disk	ram
i know from oracle is that they insert data in a temporary place both in ram and on disk and do housekeeping on periodic basis the database engine is busy all the time optimizing its structure but in the same time we do not want to lose data in case of power failure of something like that

1052221
free	malloc
valgrind does overwrite new delete malloc free but not during compilation so you don t have to recompile if that s what you mean

1052276
cpu	affinity
my current computer is dual-core cpu i want to set cpu affinity of my program to run on a specific cpu and free another cpu to do some other job

1052286
post	get
you can however have both get and post in the same request

1052315
post	put
check out the attribute - it should allow you to specify the post put delete http verbs too on your method

1052371
vbscript	jscript
also the choice of host language jscript or vbscript is completely irrelevant there is nothing that vbscript can do but jscript can t or vice-versa

1052458
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
i get what is wrong here - addition is swappable 1 + 2 2 + 1 while subtraction is not same goes for multiplication and division

1052504
serializable	deserialization
it is fine for short-lived messages where you know the same version will be used for serializable and deserialization

1052608
int	boolean
uint int number and boolean are not nullable in as3

1052614
config	ini
the entire application is written in an ini for the routing config so i can t switch it over to an array based config or xml for that matter in which 100 of the examples on the internet are in

1052667
many-to-many	one-to-many
for your other question redirect on login based on user group users to groups is a many-to-many relationship so it s not really a good idea to use it like a one-to-many

1052687
ant	maven
what you might consider is employing maven or ant ivy to pull in library jars from a common repository instead

1052716
atexit	main
in the main process an exit handler is registered with atexit module it seems that the handler gets called when each child process ends which is not i expected

1052728
post	get
the reason ist that there is no api in wordpress to get the related post

1052784
folder	directory
i have a website under svn and i want to patch the live website with what s currently in the repository effectively calling svn update on the live website but i don t want .svn directory in every folder on the production website

1052790
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
firefox uses its own certificate stores and i am not sure how flash manages that the flash player is the same for firefox safari and opera if i am correct i have tried to import the self-signed certificates in firefox but still not working for me.

1052880
move	drag
i m wondering if you re inadvertently generating a move drag rather than a click

1052886
put	get
the image package will reduce the number of put get delete operations which aren t free in s3

1052889
uiview	uiwindow
any responder uiview or uiwindow subclass can override the canperformaction withsender method so you could just return no for all the actions you don t want to permit

1052950
hide	show
for example stackoverflow does this when show some options edit delete etc for the user who posted a question or answer or comment and hide the same options to everybody else

1052990
fink	macports
if you haven t installed yet consider using macports or fink to deal with dependency resolution for you

1052991
pull	push
in order to push a lot of data into sql server very quickly there are tools and techniques to pull it off

1053021
unsigned	short
because 8 bits is one byte the size of a char or uchar and 16 bits is two bytes the size of a short or unsigned short

1053039
spaces	delimiter
what i have now within the lucene document is the bedrooms bathrooms price_min price_max date_available fields being spaces delimiter

1053041
xui	iui
check out iui xui and jqtouch as well

1053052
gif	png
weirdly this works perfectly with a png but gives the above error with jpg and gif which is rather confusing

1053058
wordpress	joomla
the reason i am using joomla because i have some components that i need to implement on joomla instead of using wordpress

1053064
width	height
and programmatically if the width height of this control were set the contents of the canvas would also scale within those bounds

1053080
put	get
compared to java or .net host php host really cheap and you can get free one from some websites although they will put some banners hidden thing inside your website

1053086
pop-up	dialog
an external link when clicked will pop-up the confirmation dialog and if it says yes they will be able to get to the external url opening in a new window

1053118
free	malloc
the other thing you should not do is free a pointer allocated by new or malloc from one dll that was allocated in the other

1053134
qiodevice	qnetworkreply
in your in your handler for the finished signal you will be passed a qnetworkreply object which you can read the response from as it inherits from qiodevice

1053134
qstring	qbytearray
you can construct a qstring from that qbytearray and do whatever you want to do with it

1053135
int	double
the problem is in the c code you have the long long filled out right but then you convert the int value directly into floating point rather than reinterpreting the bytes as a double

1053138
postgresql	mysql
support these sqlite mysql postgresql

1053163
post	get
if i have a post having but still if i type i get redirected to

1053168
addclass	removeclass
i m not sure what you re trying to achieve so some combination of addclass removeclass or toggleclass will do the trick

1053192
hide	show
the show and hide jquery commands take only two parameters speed and a callback

1053219
post	get
as mentioned by others there are several libraries and several post available for you to get started

1053253
utorrent	mirc
but there doesn t seem to be any infomation about creating applications similar to k3b utorrent ccleaner and mirc

1053267
vb.net	vb6
however if your moving from vb6 then i d recommend learning vb.net or preferably c#

1053280
vb.net	vb6
if you re coming from vb6 i d recommend c# vb.net or java in that order

1053283
portrait	landscape
i need to implement behavior of my uiviewcontroller subclass like in standart ipod.app when device rotated from portrait to landscape content of uiviewcontroller stay s still and new view add s above it

1053306
int	chars
it takes 2 arguments - an int named argc the number of command-line arguments and a const chars array named argv the command-line arguments

1053318
stdio	gets
that part tells the preproccesor part of the compiler that goes through and gets things ready to be compiled to take the contents of the file stdio in some special part of your computer and put it on top of your source code

1053338
mvp	presenter
but if you break out logic to controllers presenter like the mvc mvp pattern you can at least test the presenter

1053346
actualheight	actualwidth
i would like to bind a scaletransform to a converter passing the actualwidth or actualheight

1053422
mvp	presenter
in the diagram below from this article the mvp model shows all the data moving through the presenter - and this generally isn t the case for well-built cocoa apps

1053458
robocopy	xcopy
after that you could use xcopy or robocopy to copy all the files and subdirectories

1053520
xna	slimdx
if you want to use vb.net then you can go with xna or slimdx

1053524
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
you didn t mention want type of images you loading jpeg png gif bmp of course that bmp is the fastest one since it has not or almost no compression

1053524
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
are your images 256 colors 8 bit w palette bmp gif and png support that format that can load pretty fast

1053566
pascal	delphi
the code is written in delphi pascal but it s basic enough to easily translate into most other languages

1053573
versioning	upgrade
unlike major os upgrade people have been upgrading to new versioning of iphone os very very quickly

1053579
yacc	bison
and 3. i can t suggest much beyond what you already found i mostly use python and pyparsing and could comment from experience on many python-centered parse frameworks but for c++ i mostly use good old yacc or bison anyway and my old gnarled copy of the dragon book -- not the latest edition actually -- is all i keep at my side for the purpose...

1053602
httplib	cookielib
i d go other suggested way but i ve done a hack done for different reasons though which does create an interface between httplib and cookielib

1053626
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
i think you could probably figure out a way to make this work by making scaleconverter descend from dependencyobject giving it an actualsize dependency property putting two instances of it in your resources instead of one and doing a one-way-to-source binding to bind one instance s actualsize to the canvas s actualwidth and the other to its actualheight so the instance s actualsize is always kept in sync with the canvas s width height as the canvas resizes

1053626
width	height
you also need to assign a width and height to the canvas to get that to work since canvas doesn t have a natural size by default

1053626
width	height
the above snippet sets a width and height that would put your ellipse at the lower-right corner of the stretched viewbox

1053673
awt	swing
i ve been messing around with awt swing lately trying to learn how to do applets

1053676
google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie google-chrome all have no problem with this basic square-one feature

1053717
min	max
i m going to stick my neck out and say no i don t think there s any way to make that significantly faster unless inlining the calls to min and max would help but i expect the optimiser will take care of that

1053718
range	max	range	min	min	max
now samples which are already in the current min max range don t need any side effects so let s get rid of the assignments in that case

1053718
cpu	processors
as another answer said this is a very easy operation to parallelise - it should improve the speed nearly linearly with cpu count 2 processors twice as fast etc apart from the cache misses etc.

1053730
children	parent
passing an object around can get old because sometimes you end up only having a link to the object to pass to someone else so i would avoid that approach unless you were just passing from one parent to a few immediate children

1053764
min	max
you might also try inlining the min max calls yourself but there s a good chance the jit is already doing that for you

1053764
min	max
just make sure you don t write to the min max values from multiple threads at the same time

1053764
min	max
don t lock on it either though i would have a min max value per thread and do a final compare between the min max values of each thread task when all threads are done

1053784
put	get
just put your head down and get copy-pasting

1053827
post	get
it not precisely like picasa they decided only to show full rows of photos instead of a partially covered row like picasa but by implementing your own virtualizing iscrollinfo panel reasonably straightforward and ben constable has a great series of post on it you should be able to get the performance you re looking for and the behaviour you want

1053833
rss	feed
i followed along this tutorial for django s rss and atom feed and i got it to work

1053837
intersect	contains
an inverted list that maps a number that appears in the lists to the lists that contains it then intersect those lists to find those that have more than one number in common

1053841
min	max
only finding the max and min of an interval

1053846
equals	gethashcode
also to continue with the small rant i wonder why they did not add the notion of declarative immutable types and make this a possible generic type constraint because this would allow to make sure a key does not change its hashcode during runtime which can happen currently if one implements gethashcode and equals on some mutable object

1053919
free	malloc
it s only called once and i check the address after the malloc call to cplptr and before the corresponding free for cplptr

1053931
int	boolean
you can assume that data are 0 and 1s int string or boolean your choice and output is a single bit

1053933
dao	facade
but the twist is that we selectively expose methods on the dao through a facade and forward only those we absolutely must

1053944
post	put
my frustration is with trying to upload put and or post a new object a photo to an existing bucket

1053992
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
note if you use this you should want to take into consideration that any pageview will create a row in your table so based on useragent you can disregard bots or only count the popular ones firefox ie safari opera etc

1054030
hash	md5
i would md5 sha1 the password if you don t need to be able to reverse the hash

1054033
hash	salt
by representation i mean that you want to hash the password using a salt which should be different for every user and a secure 1-way algorithm and store that throwing away the original password

1054033
hash	salt
then when you want to verify a password you hash the value using the same hashing algorithm and salt and compare it to the hash value in the database

1054038
width	height
however i would like to be able to autosize the height and width of the control based on the number of rows and columns in the control respectively

1054039
hash	salt
as a key-hardened salt hash using a secure algorithm such as sha-512

1054040
hash	salt
the best security practice is not to store the password at all not even encrypted but to store the salt hash with a unique salt per password of the encrypted password

1054045
google-chrome	safari
but in webkit safari 3 + 4 and google-chrome the sub-level ul flashes after the hide function

1054062
lisp	scheme
modern variants of lisp from scheme onwards don t use dynamic scoping a misfeature that was sadly highly visible usually manifesting as hard-to-understand bugs in their code to beginners basically as soon as they started writing functions in lisp 1.5 i once was a beginner in that and can testify to how badly it bit me

1054064
post	put
another table would contain essays with fields for the essay or rebutter s userid the conversationid the body of the post and a post count to put them in order

1054064
post	put
finally i d have a comments table with comment posters userids essayid s to link them to essay post commentid s to put them in thread mode if that s apropriate and of course the comment body

1054069
hash	salt
see how to hash data with salt c# example

1054089
min	max
random.next takes arguments that let you specify a min and a max value so that s how you would control the length

1054135
post	get
first i just changed a post to a get but that resulted in an error that my http request exceeded the maximum size for a get

1054156
client-side	server-side
html css server-side database client-side scripting etc.

1054157
postgresql	mysql
i have some experience with postgresql s built in full text search capabilities but for this thing it s going to be mysql

1054161
hash	salt
what you should do is store a hash of the password with an appropriate salt

1054161
hash	salt
they can merely accept a password and see if it s the right one or not by hashing the input with the same salt you can t reverse a hash

1054225
mvp	presenter
in an mvp pattern you typically create a presenter for each view

1054236
formview	detailsview
and bind it to a formview detailsview or listview

1054248
min	max
if you set both your min max to the first value then if you find a new min there is no reason to check if it is also a new max

1054270
folder	directory
i ve enabled directory listing of a folder under public_html by adding

1054305
free	malloc
just be careful to free the memory that your function malloc s in whoever calls it

1054332
min	max
i want to display today record min time and previous day record max time

1054332
min	max
from the above table i want to display today min time and previous day max time

1054332
min	max
i want to get today min time and previous day max time for the particular person id

1054335
expression-blend	silverlight
the silverlight site also has sample downloads trials of expression-blend and the bits for deepzoom but they re extras and not necessary to get started

1054343
ferret	sphinx
i ve personally used ferret in production sphinx in almost-production and xapian to screw around with

1054359
firefox	safari
this is happening in both firefox 3.0 and safari 4 i haven t tried it in any other browsers

1054365
gdi	directdraw
i found that setting the gdi palette using create selectpalette before setting the directdraw palette using idirectdrawpalette setentries would restore the palette after it became corrupted wm_palettechanged handler

1054386
getter	setter
public members don t require a getter and a setter so you wouldn t have to worry about that.

1054399
arcgis	proj
i am trying to use arcfm with my arcgis proj and i ve noticed a bug

1054413
ironruby	ironpython
i m using mac os x to develop with silverlight 3 using ironruby and ironpython and textmate

1054453
versioning	upgrade
you can also set a setting of needsupgrading to true by default and set it to false after performing an upgrade so that end users who are not changing versioning numbers every time the app is started will not be upgrading all the time

1054463
createelement	each
i mean yes i could through and use createelement for each element and setting each attribute separately but that seems like a lot just when this is so simple

1054464
bash	zsh
maybe the problem with job control had to do with some bug in zsh that doesn t even exist in bash and maybe it is no longer relevant in zsh either

1054484
hash	md5
for example take the md5 hash of the username then treat the last 8 bytes of that as a long

1054492
filesystems	ntfs
i forget exactly how this is done now and it will only work for ntfs filesystems but it s possible

1054504
datamapper	activerecord
you might want to look at using datamapper or sequel for your orm if you re finding that activerecord lacks the expressiveness you need for complex queries

1054517
spaces	delimiter
for more attribute pair within the same table just append them to the end spaces delimiter

1054530
bmp	png
a library that converts a bmp to png and only has a save file option - no in memory function

1054564
disk	ram
these libraries often just accept a filename as input not an ostream in this case though not really being a programming solution you could set up a ram disk

1054578
post	get
generally you are following the right approach but this can get nasty quite fast if you need to do queries on more than one cluster - your friends recent post type queries

1054579
stdout	stderr
by refering to stdin stdout and stderr streams

1054595
folder	directory
if you delete a folder extension from the extensions directory it has the same effect as uninstalling it

1054640
serializable	deserialization
just because you can or is there a real need like a profiling session confirming that serializable deserialization takes most of the time

1054665
rss	feed
i was writing a generic class to read rss feed from various source and to consolidate in one collection of object in vb.net

1054665
rss	feed
basically the function - using linq to xml - is working properly but i have a problem when the rss feed i am trying to read does not contain one of the node as you know many of them are optional

1054681
width	height
this uses the nsstring method sizewithfont constrainedtosize linebreakmode to calculate the frame height needed to fit a string then sets the origin and width

1054698
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i ve found that a lot of scripting languages tend to wrap one of three free image libraries imagemagick imagescience and graphicsmagick

1054700
lisp	scheme
emacs lisp - scheme or cl didn t have enough performance at that time

1054738
gridview	repeater
the repeater does not have built-in pagination like the gridview or other complex controls so it does not offer events such as the pageindexchanging

1054782
lisp	prolog
lisp prolog ai

1054789
bmp	png
it is certianly possible to find a png - bmp converter that can work in memory

1054805
post	get
have a post method for users to get to their own profile and test the profile id w the form s hidden values or redirect not your nose go away

1054820
autofac	castle-windsor
i think castle-windsor autofac and structuremap are at least as good or better

1054937
uilabel	uibutton
in interface builder there are layout options to send to back or send to front any elements such as uibutton uiimage uilabel etc.

1054995
mouse	keyboard
between the user and the ui the ui events mouse and keyboard

1055022
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when using a uiviewcontroller the normal way pushing it on a uinavigationcontroller it adjusts its view s frame

1055025
opera	firefox
neither javascript itself or any webbrowser ie firefox opera ... are xquery capable or have support build in

1055039
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
but you d be better off to use the uiviewcontroller and push this on the uinavigationcontroller

1055073
children	parent
if your nodes link to their parent and the children of a node will always be enumerated in the same order you can trace your steps without having to save them

1055116
innodb	myisam
the standard suggestion of bumping key_buffer or innodb_buffer_pool for myisam and innodb respectively still applies

1055140
width	margin
give your .navigation ul a width and use margin 0 auto

1055145
lxml	beautifulsoup	lxml	elementtree	elementtree	beautifulsoup
beautifulsoup lxml and other python libraries elementtree etc. make dealing with xml more easy

1055149
width	margin
doing that you can remove the float left from the list items and you don t need to have a fixed width for the navigation bar as you would if you used margin 0 auto

1055151
width	margin
well to use margin 0 auto on something it must have a defined width

1055183
youtube	vimeo
should we upload the video to youtube or vimeo and embed

1055191
youtube	vimeo
uploading to a service like youtube blip.tv or vimeo is good but you ll have to settle for them tossing in related videos or other ads on your content and you ll be forced to stick with their player branding

1055211
post	get
instead use your page controllers to parse input such as get and post instanciate the correct business logic objects and call the correct methods on those to do the actual data crunching

1055212
firefox	safari
this uses the video tag if it s supported but as firefox and safari both support different formats ogg and mp4 you need to have a couple of different versions of the video files

1055212
opera	google-chrome
this works on every browser from ie6 to the iphone and from google-chrome to opera including everything in between

1055213
accessor	properties
class extensions can also be used to redeclare a publicly readonly properties as readwrite prior to synthesize ing the accessor

1055217
boost	stl
i am unsure about what boost has but some stl implementations like sgi have hash_map

1055219
firefox	safari
ie will use an object tag generally with an id and firefox safari etc will use the embed tag and since you aren t supposed to be the same id on two elements people generally use the name attribute instead of an id attribute on the embed tag

1055251
smartsvn	tortoisesvn
you can use any of the free ui applications to access the source control repositories such as tortoisesvn smartsvn etc..

jsf	seam
possible backends seam jsf spring web .

1057558

1057606
gif	png
the loader class only works for jpg gif png swf

1057684
put	get
i don t know what you are trying to get with this sql but you can either put the and filter on the correct on after e.eid d.eid or you can change the tables used to filter in the current on so one of the fields belongs to managerdetails

1057724
for-loop	loops
obviously if the iterator is advanced past the last element inside loops the comparison in the for-loop statement will evaluate to false and loops will happily continue into undefined behaviour

1057732
vb6	vba
this works with vb6 and i m fairly sure it works with vba

1057748
matplotlib	scipy
python + numpy + scipy + matplotlib are the right combination to start

1057773
google-chrome	safari
this wonâ t count as a valid answer because i donâ t know how to actually fix that but the problem is that most browsers besides safari and google-chrome perhaps load javascript sequentially because itâ s necessary to wait for the previous script to finish executing as it may change the document

1057903
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it is supported in ie9+ firefox 4+ google-chrome safari 5+ and opera

hex	binary
thus debugging tools image processing tools to create icons and bitmaps hex editors to check the contents of binary files xml editors to change xml files etc

1058095

i have a blog post and some sample code in one of my books that cover alarmmanager though they are all covering the cron scenario where you want to get control at boot time and set up a repeating alarm

1058364
integer	unsigned
a good alternative approach is to read the header whatever into a buffer and parse from three to avoid the i o overhead in atomic operations like reading a unsigned 32 bit integer

1058404
innodb	myisam
if you re prevented from using innodb i believe you ll have to resort to changing source code to adapt how myisam works

1058434
getter	setter
these integers are mapped internally by getter setter functions to the original flag strings

1058471
processors	hyperthreading
all our machines have 2 processors hyperthreading with 4gb of physical memory and 4gb of swap space

however i can t seem to find an easy way to make it pop up during the build then hide itself when done which is similar to the current option in visual studio show output window when build starts

1058506
int	boolean
and use them with boolean logic to store the flags in only one int p.e.

1058510
ant	maven
use automatic builds ant make maven

1058522
pop-up	dialog
i have an application which is deployed as an xbap which contains some embedded winforms pop-up modal dialog - it s a combination of legacy code and some new stuff and we don t have time for a complete re-write

1058524
getter	setter
if for some reason i couldn t afford the numpy dependency e.g on app engine which doesn t support numpy i d use the standard library array module - it only supports 1-dimensional arrays but it s just as space-efficient as numpy for large homogeneous arrays and the getter setter routines you mention can perfectly well linearize a 3-items tuple that s your natural index into the single integer index into the 1-d array

1058573
cpu	processors
you look at the process category performance counters to get per process cpu memory io or at respective categories processors memory physical logical disk counters for overall system performance

1058613
put	get
the hashset object don t allow duplicates too but the get method put and contains too runs in constant time o k so it s a good way to check for duplicates

1058742
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested on google-chrome firefox safari ie7

five simple variables 4 int and one boolean

1058863
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
because the list can get long we have a series of checkbox and dropdownlistfor at the top that act as filters

1058863
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
problem is this seems to break the viewstate on the dropdownlistfor and checkbox

1058863
button	checkbox
now when they go to the detail page and hit the back button to get back to the selection page - the selected values in the checkbox and drop-downlists are back to their initial defaults

1058915
innodb	myisam
finally if you are using innodb you can specify a clustered index that actually sorts rows on disk myisam tables are basically heaps

1058961

for the on-line algorithms for skewness and kurtosis along the lines of the variance see in the same wiki page here the parallel algorithms for higher-moment statistics

1059163
variance	kurtosis
if it is normally distributed i would use the population sample mean variance skewness and kurtosis as maximum likelihood estimators for a small subset

1059196
firefox	safari
then create your site as you would normally - ideally coding for firefox initially as there are hacks you can use for safari and all versions of ie

1059196
firefox	safari
check your site in ie 6 7 8 use ie tester if you have to firefox and safari simultaneously

1059225
sudo	passwd
the first two lines allow the deploy user to run sudo without having a tty or re-typing the passwd -- which means it can be run straight over ssh without any further input

1059258
put	get
that said some people have put together a few reference tables and calculators that may get you started

1059266
aggregate-functions	sum
usually group by is used in conjunction with some aggregate-functions like sum say to compute the result set by one or more columns

1059272
centos	linux
there is a process size limit on linux seem to remember on centos was around 2.5gb and is configured in the kernel a recomple to change

1059323
width	height
just remember that every glyph varies in height and width so this is a very rough estimate of size

1059327
button	checkbox
example of this one is below i m checking to see whether a checkbox is checked before enabling the button

1059362
for-loop	loops
also instead of the for-loop you could use a while loops that stops switching images when a condition is met such as a button press

1059380
post	get
you can talk between middleware and flash in many different ways - standard get post xml json and a flash specific data exchange format called amf - all are supported by php

1059382
3des	aes
-- note if running sql server on xp the aes algorithms are not available you must use 3des

1059396
google-chrome	firefox
this also happens in google-chrome 2.0.172.33 firefox 3.0.10

1059522
hide	show
this code would essentially show the list bind a click handler that finds the next list element relative to the one being clicked on if it finds one it hide itself and show that one and then outside the click we show the first one to get things started

1059559
punctuation	words
i have text with punctuation and i want list of the words

1059559
punctuation	words
so i have all words with the punctuation after i split with whitespace

firefox	safari
once you get it to the point where you re happy with it in firefox and safari use conditional statements to pull in the appropriate ie stylesheet

1059678
opera	firefox
fixing their session cookie settings and clearing the cache don t help but they can login if they use firefox opera on the same computer

1059714
versioning	upgrade

1059732
versioning	upgrade
galileo came out the other day and even though plugins under eclipse are imo just a little bit easier to deal with than netbeans it would still be really awesome if there was a simple way for me to upgrade to the new versioning and take my plugins with me

1059733
maven	pom.xml
creating a maven pom.xml file to create a war is almost trivial and you can easily override the the default locations for your src conf and web content to match you existing src directory

1059733
maven	pom.xml
you initial maven pom.xml file will look something like this.

1059753
clang	llvm
i ve found clang llvm very useful...here s the guide i used

1059802
firefox	safari
i think it only works in firefox and safari not so much in ie

1059808
int	boolean
you need a boolean to determine if 1 was the previous value and a int to count the number of times you don t see a 1 when the boolean is set

1059847
ftp	telnet
it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each

1059855
short	base
in short not the kind of thing you would base a new technology on

1059862
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox 2 and 3 opera safari google-chrome and other gecko and webkit based browsers support it whereas trident based browsers internet explorer do not support it

1059873
nsurl	nsstring
the problem in your case arises because you re trying to treat nsurl objects as nsstring objects â â and the dictionary is trying to get the length of the supposed string by calling -length which exists for nsstring but not for nsurl

1059886
free	malloc
why not malloc x in main so you wouldn t forget to free x later thus creating a memory leak

1059942
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
speed should be acceptable even in ie6 although you will general get better performance in a recent version of safari google-chrome or firefox

1059997
int	chars
the int will be faster for joins than a 64 chars string primary key would be

1059999
getter	setter
where coordinate is a defined as setter getter left out for readability

post	get
further i switched to using a post rather than a get to keep ie from caching my results

1065798
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
for me mstest comparing to mbunit nunit and xunit.net is sufficient in terms of features

1065829
coalesce	nvl
using nvl or coalesce is not an option as i d like to log the rows causing the errors so that the data can be corrected for the next pass

1065854

1065854
rss	feed
i m trying to transform the xml into an rss feed using the following setup feed.xml + rss.xsl

1065854
sorting	filtering
when i try to view the output of feed.xml in firefox all of the filtering is applied correctly sorting out items that shouldn t be published in that channel but the page outputs as plain text rather than the usual feed-detection that takes place in firefox

1065857
actionscript	mxml
i m only interested in debugging actionscript and java no mxml javascript or ajax

1065897
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
xpath might be able to do everything that queryselector can do i think this statement is a bit suspect but that is beside the point but queryselector and queryselectorall are not supported by all browsers so really we should be comparing xpath to native dom querying methods getelementsbytagname getelementbyid queryselector standard traversal and filtering methods etc.

1065952
ubuntu	centos
i d probably go with centos or ubuntu for that reason

1065994
kde	gnome
matchbox is a lightweight and highly-customizable fullscreen window manager and would be much better suited for this task than any of gnome s or kde s full-featured window managers

1065999
cfstring	nsstring
nsstring and cfstring support reorderable positional arguments

1066014
ubuntu	linux
if you are new to linux then i defiantly recommend ubuntu

the problem i have is that when the click me button is clicked i need to traverse thru the tree view and if a checkbox is checked perform some function

1066034
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
depending on what you want to do you may want to use viewwillappear or viewdidappear instead

1066035
children	parent
if you want to have an unidirectional association that the children can t navigate to the parent

1066035
children	parent
if so you fk column should be nullable because the children will be saved before the parent

1066138
accessor	properties	subclass	accessor
one of the best ways to generate correct accessor in your nsmanagedobject subclass is to bring up the contextual menu on a attribute or properties in the data modeling tool and choose one of the following commands

1066174
super	implements
and if child implements and hides the parents nonvirtual it is super easy to not get the what many might consider expected behavior of calling child nonvirtual

1066179
versioning	upgrade
but it s entirely possible that phpunit was upgrade to emit a different format in newer versioning or sir-vestnik could be running an older versioning

1066213
put	get
edit - i just want to get a list of all the products from the xml doc and put them into a generics list

1066241
int	chars
so while i m no llvm expert by any means i would guess that if eg you wanted to represent some 8-bit chars set you d use an array of i8 8-bit int or a pointer to i8

1066254
extjs	gxt
if the added overhead of all the extjs libraries are too much for you in gwt-ext then the gxt project from extjs may be more your speed

1066274
inline	inlining
also consider not directly inlining the css but rather use some sort of object similar that will generate the css inline for you

1066343
ant	maven
maven is another build system which exists because it tries to solve the problem of projects with multiple dependencies and inter-dependencies which can get ugly using only ant

1066344
jtree	jtable	sorting	filtering
glazedlists a gui adapter framework for viewing editing navigating filtering sorting binding lists of objects with a jtable or jtree

1066359
hide	show
rather than hide and show since they can take a speed parameter for fancy animation

1066367
hide	show
if you instead made a string with all the ids seperated by comma you could select and hide show them all in one action

1066390
put	get
here s some code i wrote this weekend to get an image from a twain device via windows image acquisition 2.0 and put the data into something i can shove in a gtk based ui

1066409
overwrite	preserve
the purpose of the overwrite list more commonly called the clobber list is to inform gcc that as a result of the asm instructions the register s listed in the clobber list will be modified and so the compiler should preserve any which are currently live

1066417
gwt	cssresource
there may be other ways to accomplish the same effect in gwt but the power of the cssresource can be leveraged for more things than what i ve gone over here

1066423
typedef	struct
extern is used to say i know a variable of this type with this name will exist when this program runs and i want to use it. it works with variables objects not classes struct unions typedef etc

1066452
pop-up	dialog
what is the best cross browser way to open a download dialog lets assume we can set content-disposion attachment in the headers without navigating away from the current page or opening pop-up which doesnt work well in ie6

1066454
post	get
i know it can be done using ajax cookie session or post variables but i really want to use get variables

1066455
getter	setter
think about it - your getter and setter are really doing something

1066455
getter	setter
you can t bypass them without changing the semantics completely and i wouldn t expect a setter to run just because i changed something in what the getter had returned

1066481
hide	show
one way to handle this scenario would be to hide the overlay window in the application.ondeactivate event and to show it on the application.onactivate event

1066486
junit	testng	junit	easymock	testng	easymock
junit testng and easymock for testing there are many others those are the ones we use

1066486
junit	easymock
junit allows you to easily create methods that run as part of a test easymock allows you to create mock or fake objects to pass in that will respond in very specific ways which you can use to test a method that relies on a framework or running environment that isn t there during testing

1066532
client-side	server-side
from the kss project description kss has both a client-side javascript library and server-side support

1066532
client-side	server-side
however there are facilities in kss for binding kss client-side events back to server-side callables in a python web framework

1066561
organization	naming
i believe that wpf kept this organization and naming convention for compatibility with silverlight where vsm was first implemented

1066584
min	max	min	median	median	max
scan the dataset for the min max median mean

1066629
tostring	string.format
in the case where tostring is called on something statically typed as an interestrate as in your example or in certain related cases where an interestrate is cast to object and then immediately used as a parameter to something like string.format you could conceivably detect the problem with static analysis

1066644
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
ie6 is one of the obvious ones but then there are all the released versions of mozilla firefox opera safari etc etc

1066651
direct3d	directx
i ve been experimenting with the dxut functions for direct3d applications in the march 2009 directx sdk

firefox	safari
on the following page the orange buy topo map link will open a page in ie7 and firefox and safari but not in ie8

1066729
firefox	safari
xmlhttprequest - in firefox and safari but not in ie it can be used for long-pull page loading that enables to handle fragments as they appear on each readystatechange event

1066730
gridview	detailsview
users can then fill out these forms in a detailsview-like control thereby creating documents. the documents can be shown in a detailsview or certain fields of several of them can be shown in a gridview

1066730
gridview	detailsview
the problem is that gridview and detailsview seem to be specifically designed to access properties on objects that come out of a datasource

1066737
int	double
for anything that is a primitive type int double float you don t need the asterisk

1066757
pop-up	dialog
the browser will usually forget the old value pop-up another user pass input dialog and if users then press the abort button they are logged out

1066787
ssl	https
that said https http over ssl is a good starting point this will allow you to authenticate the website to the device or browser and is ubiquitous

1066818
facade	mediator
the facade pattern and the mediator pattern perform similar tasks to what you are describing

1066818
facade	mediator
your use of the middleman moniker implies the mediator pattern over the facade pattern as a middleman is responsible for negotiating between two entities with neither entity needing to know the specifics of how to communicate with the other

1066818
facade	mediator
you can use either of these patterns to reduce coupling for the client class which needs to use the system the mediator or facade is masking

1066820
versioning	upgrade
so a person from telligent suport suggested an upgrade to the current versioning 2007.1 sp2

1066885

make sure you re using a textarea element - you should be able to put padding 5px or whatever you want on the container element then put height 100 and width 100 on the textarea

1066896
pop-up	dialog
if i do pop-up the dialog when not needed it shows briefly then disappears which has an annoying flashing effect

i don t have a way of dynamically sizing the textbox but if you enclose the textbox in a div assign the div a height and width and set the margins of that div to auto margin auto

1067094
formview	detailsview
the detailsview is not very customizable so you should take a look at the formview

1067203
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this includes ie6 7 8 firefox safari webkit opera etc

1067216
createfile	deviceiocontrol
i can call createfile successfully on the dvd device but when i try to call deviceiocontrol with the control code ioctl_dvd_start_session it returns a success code but i don t seem to get the sessionid value back successfully always returns 0

1067248
googletest	gmock
we use googletest and it s companion gmock

1067253
getdate	dateadd
most databases have a getdate function and a dateadd function that you can use to create the offsets you re looking for

1067253
getdate	dateadd
store the result of getdate in a variable then use dateadd to create your range relative to the current date

1067258
dateadd	sysdate
change dateadd day -7 current_date syntax to whatever the sysdate minute 7 days syntax is in your databse flavour

1067303
haskell	scheme	erlang	scheme
we ll collectively be happy to help with any questions that should spring from these attempts i m personally unfamiliar with f# or scala but would be happy to help with haskell any ml-family language scheme or erlang -- and similarly for the other groups

1067346
dlsym	dlopen
for this purpose i am using dlsym and dlopen to use the api in the shared library

1067515
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
- void tabbarcontroller uitabbarcontroller controller didselectviewcontroller uiviewcontroller viewcontroller

1067520
profiling	debugging
and always profiling the release build - profiling the debugging build is generally a wasted effort

1067627
dlsym	dlopen
your question and answer are both very confused if you can link your executable directly against libdrmaa.so then there is absolutely no good reason to also dlopen that same library and presumably call dlsym on its handle as well

1067719
vsto	add-in
i m programing an excel add-in with vs2008 and vsto c# over office 2007

1067732
profiling	instrumentation
from xcode 4.2 choose product- profiling and when instrumentation launches choose zombies

1067749
sorting	grouping
the signature has the property that sorting will grouping

1067844
put	get
if i don t put it in i get the annoying lingering icon in the tray until you move the mouse over it

1067877
put	get
with the inner join as i put you ll get list of employees that have at least one project

1067883
public	protected
you have public protected internal including but nothing more granular at the inter-type level

1067922
bash	zsh
this works in zsh and in bash 4 after you run shopt -s globstar

1067928
implements	extends
i would go with having models that extends an abstract class and that one will implements an access to either zend_db_table or another class that you later might want as your data provider

1068007
vmware	virtualbox
which technology is best suited to this - vmware virtual pc server or virtualbox

1068016
opera	firefox
only working on firefox opera ie8

1068019
versioning	upgrade
at the very least you should get something out of your automated build that you can run without tweaking on your production server to upgrade your database to the new versioning when you are upgrading your program

1068044
hide	show
the trick is to use css and show hide with javascript

1068067
junit	testng
of course there is more to that and this where test frameworks junit testng dunit nunit ... will come in handy they will take the little pains away and only leave the coding part of the test

1068098
versioning	upgrade
i believe the firefox team have fixed this bug - upgrade to the latest versioning of firefox to resolve the issue

1068113
width	height
that does not set it s width and height though

1068128
wav	ogg
ogg theora ogg vorbis and wav

1068137
for-loop	loops
foreach is elegant in that it has no concern for the number of items in a list and treats each element equally i think your only solution will be using a for-loop that either stops at itemcount-1 and then you present your last item outside of loops or a conditional within loops that handles that specific condition if i itemcount .

1068152
freebsd	linux
migrate to enterprise linux or freebsd postgres works much better on unix type systems mdash

1068162
post	get
gets you can have the get page auto-submit the post - kind of a loophole around that bit of the rfc but legit and you dont require the user to double-optin and you re not bugging him.

1068178
children	parent
your problem is that you want to affect the rendering of a parent tag based on the number of its children of a particular type

1068240
boost	stl
but if you want best performance compatibility functionality ratio you will probably have to look at boost library part of it is stl anyway

1068283
mouse	keyboard
my understanding of this kind of application is that when multiple users log in to the same vnc server they share the keyboard mouse and desktop so only one person can actually use the computer whilst the other users can watch what is happening

1068358
shibboleth	opensso
opensso opensaml and shibboleth seem like the major options

1068368
super	self
the pageviewcontroller initwithnibname method has been uncommented and is just the default setting self super initwithnibname nibnameornil bundle nibbundleornil

1068410
next	except
creating classes that do nothing except extending already existing collections seems like multiplying entities beyond necessity but would make my code more clear especially when there are next levels - like map of allconnections by month and so on

1068446
searchable	luke
i recommend to use luke to inspect your generated index to see what tokens are actually searchable

1068501
phpunit	simpletest
write automatic unit tests with phpunit or simpletest since you re using php or any other unit-testing framework available for your language of choice

1068530
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
is there a way to do this that is common across most linux distributions but ubuntu fedora and opensuse would be the priority

1068571
ubuntu	debian
the former covers ubuntu debian variants and the latter red hat variants

1068571
kde	gnome
you will have to deal with gnome and kde menu management and also different distributions lay out their menus differently

1068571
kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
i don t know if it is possible for a single .deb to handle both gnome and kde menus systems for ubuntu and kubuntu respectively but i imagine the capability is there to reduce duplication of effort for ubuntu

1068578
youtube	vimeo
i let users embed videos from youtube google vimeo etc

1068608
spaces	delimiter
i believe you try to separate an input string in words trying various delimiter - spaces comma semicolon etc

1068620
serializable	deserialization
it allows you peak at the message headers control serializable deserialization return status codes etc

1068683
hide	show
you can very well hide the table borders to show the text alone

1068745
ubuntu	debian
for ubuntu debian the .deb i would add that you do not send it to people but you create a repository and have the users add that url to their etc apt sources.list then you get a easy way to update the software as well

1068858
rss	feed
i am developing an app which parses an xml or rss feed of a magazine..the thing is i have to include an offline capability ie save the previous results which were displayed in each cell similar to the new york times app and then display the saved ones when there is no network connection

1068879
int	chars
therefore a row that contains just one int value might contain over ten chars just to describe that one value

1068918
ant	maven
it can even be used as eclipse plugin or ant maven script

1068945
haskell	ocaml
functional programming ocaml haskell scala

1068999
division	multiplication
this avoids any computationally expensive functions such as log or even multiplication or division

1069024
user-controls	elementhost
so create a wpf user-controls and set it up for virtualmode true and host that user-controls on your winforms client with an elementhost container

1069061

debian linux

1069190
imperative	declarative
sql is not an imperative language its a declarative language

1069223
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome safari are great including the latest version of ie i think but ie 7 does not show the scroll bar or page down

1069251
integer	unsigned
things get quite simple once you start looking at an ip address as a 32-bit unsigned integer

1069272
cvs	svn
vcscommand plugin is really helpful in this case and it woks seamlessly with svn cvs and other repositories also

1069310
children	parent
parent contains a collection of children which is large and lazy loaded

1069310
children	parent
assume session-in-view is not an option as the fetching of the children collection would only happen after the user has viewed the parent and decided to view the children

1069367
std	ostream
regarding the error ostream is part of std namespace and not part of the global namespace or the namespace the class you re refering is part of

1069371
firefox	safari
the problem is that this event occurs before document is fully loaded in firefox safari

1069376
std	ostream
you also need to change this into std ostream because c++ standard library names are within the namespace std

1069385
children	parent
i m making some assumptions about what the user is looking at but it seems like you only want to retrieve the children if the user has already viewed the parent and really wants to see the children

1069405
google-chrome	firefox
everything works perfectly in ie firefox and google-chrome

1069405
websphere	ibm
however when i deploy it to our development portal ibm websphere it doesn t quite work in ie

1069405
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome when a user is on the detailed information page they can hit back on their browser and it loads a cached version of the search results

1069455
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
the benefit of this was that you could just uninstall and reinstall a new versioning of the software and it would automatically upgrade the existing database to the latest versioning

1069455
installation	upgrade
installation upgrade and maintenance was a dream

1069455
put	get
if you can get away from having your business logic in stored procedures and put them in the entity classes then the benefit is that they re strongly typed

1069471
put	get	post	put	post	get
i have written routines to connect to a server using sockets and post put and get commands combined with cgi or php scripts and have read extensively about the ajax paradigm which i see as the way forward

1069483
hide	show
you have to put a textblock or a contentpresenter behind the textbox bound to the same value so when you hide the textbox the textblock becomes visible and show the selected value

1069520
concave	convex
the intersects method checks if the convex hull of the shape intersects with the provided shape so in the case of the concave curve this is functional but not accurate

1069573
inherited	subclassing
when using table per class or table per subclassing inherited a table for every subclassing class will be created

1069627
hide	show
i understand that i can make the property nullable or use a bool called propertyname specified to determine whether the property is serialized to xml but i would like the auto-generated examples to hide these elements in one method s definition and show them in another

1069634
int	double
note that you can use x y to initialize them disregarding of their type that s then value initialization and usually yields a proper initial value 0 for int 0.0 for double calling the default constructor for user defined types that have user declared constructors ...

1069799
hash	salt
store your passwords in a salt hash so the original text is unrecoverable and thus unbreakable by anything short of a brute force attack

1069826
postgresql	mysql
currently i m using mysql but would like to switch to postgresql later on so ideal solution would be db independent

1069892
3-tier	n-tier
in the classic 3-tier n-tier world the database is an independent storage of company information

1069904
inherited	properties
of course selector and combobox don t have all the properties that you could possibly bind to either you ll have to traverse all the way back to uielement to find most of the inherited properties

1069912
inherited	properties
best way then is just to have one class inherited the other and add the column properties

1069990
versioning	upgrade
that worked great until i had to upgrade the rdp client to versioning 6 in order to access server 2008 boxes we were using versioning 4 or 5 not sure which

1070012
hide	show
you can show hide the normal way and based on the current row in focus change the innerhtml of the div in focus

1070098
vb6	vba
the easiest and most efficient way is to move your vba code to a vb6 compiled com automation addin

1070110
width	height
if you add another div inside the video wrapping around the title and define a height and width on this with overflow hidden it should standardize and stop the issue of some blocks being different height to others

1070135
int	boolean
testing for equality to true can lead to a bug at least in c in c if can be used on int types not just on boolean types and accept any non-zero value

1070135
int	boolean
i d think that an optimizing compiler should optimize away any difference because there is no logical difference assuming it s a language with a true boolean not just int type

1070141
vb.net	vb6
i have spent the last day or so writing a simple control library in vb.net to be used in an existing vb6 project

1070178
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
and what s even more annoying is that i can t get it to show up in ie6 7 or firefox or safari or opera etc

1070193
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
since the data is static and never or rarely changes you are free to take a different approach and pre-generate the 50 000+ xml-formatted records into 50 000+ static files and then serve up this static content using apache or better lighttpd or nginx

1070199
elf	coff
if the function was loaded dynamically or is an extern reference to an exported symbol what you really get is generally a pointer to some fixup code in the plt a unix elf term though the pe coff mechanism on windows is similar that then jumps to the function

1070231
jobs	cron
this question will probably only make sense if you know about the whenever gem for creating cron jobs

1070231
jobs	cron
the cron jobs still have rails_env development

1070238
hide	show
in that formula you need to check against the record count variable i forget the exact name and return a boolean in that formula to show hide the given section

1070260
jqmodal	blockui
check out blockui impromptu jqmodal plugins

1070397
switching	screens
this might sound long-winded but the two layers mean you can switching the xsl out to change the way it looks on screens whilst keeping the code that arranges what you want displayed separate

1070434
background-color	transparency
so a simple fix is to assign the a element a new attribute style background-color transparency

1070446
width	height
to get the height and width this is what i would do

1070469
int	chars
if you use types that stray from the ordinary voids structures etc you will have to do some extra work to get it right but for the average api using int s chars s etc it s fine

1070492
int	chars
most of the time when i have run across this it was the result of either data that was longer than expected trying to fit a 60 chars string into a varchar 50 field or it was a number where precision might be lost fitting a 26.5 into an int field or a 26.55 into a number field that only allows for one decimal place

1070497
hex	binary
for example the hex string 0000000a which is 00000000000000000000000000001010 in binary and 10 in decimal

1070558
gmail	hotmail
just need simple grab contacts from gmail fb hotmail etc

1070591
maven	pom.xml
if you are going to use maven for your war file builds you should be adding your dependencies inside of the pom.xml file

1070677
spaces	delimiter
obviously i can t explode the string into an array using a white spaces delimiter which has me kind of stuck

1070686
implements	extends
now if you wanted to do something like you have above you could either have both a and b extends an abstract base class or implements an interface and type both of your instance variables as either the abstract class or the interface

1070707
rss	feed
ive removed the extra quick search at the top including the rss feed div so that it validates in the w3c check but still no luck every other browser works just fine

1070715
spaces	delimiter
this is traditionally why query strings use as the delimiter and not spaces

1070724

moq	typemock
anyway rhinomocks moq and typemock do not work on .netcf

ienumerable	ienumerator
a yield return statement can be used only if the return type is ienumerator ienumerable or

1071037
stateless	stateful
the reason you can t find examples it s not best practice - it s turning something that should be stateless web services into something stateful and something that will not load balance well at all

1071040
pylons	turbogears
pylons and the new turbogears based on it

1071040
turbogears	cherrypy
cherrypy and the old turbogears based on it

1071040
pylons	cherrypy
however i think that pylons and cherrypy may be a better answer to your question

1071058
django	turbogears
i agree with paolo - django is pretty small and the way to go - but if you are not down with that i would add to turbogears to the list

1071106
kerberos	ntlm
the reason i have always assumed this is coz i always think of them as being very similar to authenticating a windows client with an ad in which case the client server will either employ ntlm or kerberos for authentication where the passwords are always encrypted

1071129
pylons	cherrypy	web.py	cherrypy	web.py	pylons	django	web.py
things like web.py django pylons cherrypy etc as others have mentioned

folder	directory
indeed - having the finder concealing the fact that i do have .svn folder i neglected to check this out and these directory most likely contained the missing link

1071180
innodb	myisam
is the answer the same for myisam and innodb

1071199
innodb	myisam
this is the same for myisam and innodb and is generally true for all storage engines that at all supports indices

1071206
innodb	myisam
the primary key is implicitly indexed for both myisam and innodb

1071277
turbogears	toscawidgets
i m using turbogears 2 with toscawidgets 0.9.7 forms and mako for templating

firefox	safari
i am using firefox 3.5 and safari 4 on mac and when i am embedding svg in a xhtml i do not have at all the same result

in my svg the width height and viewbox are defined

1071330
oledb	dataadapter
adapter pattern in the dataadapter used with various data sources such as oledb sql and oracle

1071352
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
his recommendations also include using checked exceptions for exceptions that can be recovered from using unchecked-exception runtimeexception for programming errors and avoiding the unnecessary use of checked exceptions

1071365
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i m trying to solve is unwanted logouts on ie6 8 but not firefox google-chrome

int	chars
strchr const chars s int c

1071596
int	chars
i dynamically create a chars array and then for each array index i want to fill that element with an int

1071596
int	chars
i tried casting the int to a chars but that didn t seem to work

1071615
put	get
if you wanted to put a function in there that doesn t get evaluated until later you d have to use some kind of lambda

1071631

running with min max heap sizes at 1 2 2 4 4 5 6 6 increments

1071631
visualvm	jprofiler
i have also unsuccessfully tried jprofiler in offline mode connecting with jconsole visualvm but i can t seem to find anything that will interperet my gc log data

1071649

hash	salt
right now when the user logs in i save the user id the username a randomly generated session id and the hash and salt password for future authentication

firefox	safari
i had previously had similar problems to this in internet explorer but i had eventually gotten this working in safari 3 4 firefox 2 3 and ie 6 7 8

1071694
hex	binary
the characters in ebcdic_to_latin1 are the actual binary values rather than their hex representations

1071696
gtk	xcb	gtk	xlib	xlib	xcb
gtk doesn t have such option afaik you probably want to use the backend xlib or xcb for that

1071715
profiling	instrumentation
you should profiling it in instrumentation to find where the bottleneck actually is

1071760
visualvm	jprofiler	visualvm	jhat	jhat	jprofiler
if yes you could then analyze the heap dump for leaks with jprofiler you already have jhat visualvm eclipse mat

1071790
expander	togglebutton
update got a hold of blend after generating a template for the expander it pretty much just requires going through and deleting the ellipse and path from each togglebutton style

1071790
expander	grid
i m just traveling directly to the grid that contains the arrow and header content instead of trying to find the controls by name so this won t work exactly as is if you are also re-templating the expander into a different structure

1071803
post	get
step 2 url only but you have to change method from post to get

1071815
n-gram	words
and search engines to text pattern analysis too prefix suffix of words n-gram analysis

1071820
trie	tree
if speed is an issue another way to handle this although admittedly a lot more complicated is to get all of the data out of the database and build yourself a ternary search tree also called a trie

1071823
getter	setter
add getter setter and a constructor if appropriate

1071834
richfaces	icefaces
i m new to javeserverfaces and played a little bit with icefaces and i would try richfaces

1071867
subtract	add
this is an appropriate use for a switch statment as it makes the choices readable and easy to add or subtract one

1071887
richfaces	icefaces
you should be able to mix and match icefaces and richfaces just fine

1071898
google-chrome	safari
wkhtmltopdf works great and uses the webkit rendering engine safari google-chrome instead of a cooked up html css parser

1072007
gif	png
alex s solution should work but another way to do it would be to remove the border-left css atrtribute from #content and instead use a 1 pixel wide gray gif or png image on the div containing the submenu items

1072009
onclick	onchange
note that while i used the onchange event for the select an onclick for another element would look like this instead

1072112
hide	show
as the title implies i m using jquery s show and hide functions to hide and show elements

1072112
width	height
however i don t want to scale in the height of the element just the width

1072112
hide	show
ideally what i would like to happen is when the function is called to hide an element the object s width goes from it s original width to 0 and it s alpha drops to 0 then the reverse would happen when i tell it to show

1072145
ready	each
for each ticket a developer will create a branch using savana and when ready promote this user branch back to trunk

1072199
inherited	subclassing
we know that we can have our existing constants class subclassing this new project s constants class and it would inherited all of the parent s static members

1072203
jar	war
this will create a zip file with the layout you have specified in your output directory config package the whole thing as a zip file you can choose zip jar war ... and deploy it in my repository with the rest

1072249
stdout	fflush
if your programs are communicating using stdin and stdout then make sure that you are either calling fflush stdout after you write or find some way to disable standard io buffering

1072251
stdout	fflush
if you re using c calling fflush stdout whenever you want output sent will be sufficient

1072261
pull	push
i recently created a branch and started working on it making several commits and now wish to push the branch to github and be able to pull it to another cloned repository

1072271
put	get
put it in an nsarray category and that s about as good as it is going to get

1072300
inject	interceptor
the critical feature of java.lang.instrument i m looking for is to simply inject interceptor around method calls without changing source attributes on methods classes or rebuilding existing assemblies to inject the interception code

1072385
udp	tcp
may be you can try tools like ttcp which can both test tcp and udp performance

1072401
uiview	uiwindow
the goal is to include the uitableview inside of a parent uiwindow or uiview with other stuff anything really adorning the table

1072414
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
group by clause and working with aggregate-functions such as sum min max etc

1072439
superclass	subclassing
i don t really care if it s a purely virtual class like an interface in java or a concrete class with actual implementational stubs for those methods in the superclass but what i want is to make it deterministically necessary that the subclassing implement certain methods of the superclass

1072468
free	malloc
malloc is not finding next free block coz of previous case of over running and hence not able to allocate for mentioned space and if u give 1024 malloc is finding one block where that much free space is available and is getting allocated

1072497
post	get
but with better libraries like jquery its getting easier to write malicious javascript xmlhttprequest scripts that can do a two step attack a get parse the anti-xsrf viewstate query string extra cookie etc and then submit a post

1072508
apache	nginx
apache s crucial because it s the most popular one but maybe you should also look at nginx which is also deservedly popular though still a niche player compared to apache and focused on one-master many-workers processes architecture

1072515
ant	maven
it s worked great integrates nicely with our build server hudson and the few things that we needed to do that maven doesn t support or fully support we ve basically thrown in a simplified ant build xml that we attach to the build process

1072538
client-side	server-side
only if it s an exceedingly poor token that doesn t check the user session and ip address could a server-side language possibly be leveraged to retrieve it and then combine it with a client-side csrf

1072558
viewdidload	viewwillappear
viewwillappear is called after viewdidload and called before anything is displayed - it gets called each time where viewdidload only gets called when your view objects are created

1072578
hide	show
the animating show and hide methods are mostly vanity methods that display a pretty animation

1072581
ienumerable	ilist
parcel and fundparcel...and i m trying to convert an ienumerable of the subtype to an ilist of the supertype..

1072613
disk	ram
or maybe the os will cache all the data in memory so it involves only access to ram but not to the disk

1072633
folder	directory
listing a directory will only give you the names of the files folder in question so you must manually stat each filename returned to get information about each file itself

1072654
ienumerable	ilist
so if you need to be able to iterate over the collection you take an ienumerable whereas if you need to add or remove you take an ilist

1072654
ienumerable	ilist
if you return an ienumerable then he will not know a priori that he can make an ilist out of it

1072713
firefox	safari
i only get different results in size between firefox and safari on windows when a viewbox is defined in the svg

1072713
width	height
set the width and height attribute in the object tag in html to absolute values pixel

1072713
width	height
set the width and height attribute in the svg file to relative values 100

1072713
firefox	safari
then both firefox and safari show the same behaviour

1072713
firefox	safari
as they are supposed to have transparent backgrounds in safari and firefox

1072723
pull	push
that git repo will represent your submodule but if you modify and push that submodule you will still have to pull from that git repo to the actual hg repo

1072731
put	get
to get more data about the event don t put it in the temp table this will make it slower

1072751
g++	gcc
you can add new directories to the include-search path by passing them to gcc g++ using -i option

1072771
subtract	add
- subtract the min value from the identity value and add 1 if you need to start numbering at 1 and voila you have numbers that restart at 1 for each group

1072854
youtube	vimeo
it s actually working but the problem is i am having different types of video source youtube vimeo etc and there is some delay in ajax response and displaying of video object

1072860
put	get	post	put	post	get
webget as you ve already stated applies to the http get verb while webinvoke can be used to apply to all the other verbs put post delete etc

1072861
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if you want to know if the current date falls between two given points in time 9am - 5pm on 7 1 09 use nscalendar and nsdatecomponents to build nsdate instances for the desired times and compare them with the current date

1072861
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
create an nsdatecomponents object with and nscalendar and your nsdate and compare the hour components

1072917
ubuntu	linux
if you choose linux then i suggest going with ubuntu as that has one of the best automatic hardware configuration i have seen

1072919
touchescancelled	touchesended
you ll have to do some simliar work within touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent to make sure the other views get the appropriate messages

1072920
wordpress	joomla
i tried wordpress and joomla

1072922
ubuntu	linux
the more practical thing to do is to get an easy to use linux distro ubuntu suse mandriva and familiarize yourself with it while doing some programming projects

1072922
freebsd	opensolaris	opensolaris	bsd
then when you are more familiar with how things work so you can manage to solve issues by yourself with ease and to get a feeling about a different flavor of os try opensolaris nexenta or some bsd flavor for instance freebsd

1072939
ubuntu	debian
the major distros ubuntu debian fedora suse and many others should all have a good variety of c c++ perl development tools available because c c++ perl apps are a core part of pretty much every distribution

1072969
maven	pom.xml
but when i update my maven dependencies i get only the jar and pom.xml from the repository

1072981
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
however if you need items count don t forget that there is another layer between ienumerable and ilist - icollection

1072989
getter	setter
it generates the python class with all methods setter and getter export to xml import from xml

1073063
kentico	umbraco
i suppose the complexity of learning somewhere between kentico and umbraco

1073087
umbraco	dotnetnuke	kentico	umbraco	kentico	dotnetnuke
kentico umbraco and sitefinity dotnetnuke are meant for developers designers integrators

1073094
akismet	recaptcha
i have a form with a description if it causes akismet to find it as spam i would like the user to be informed and either hit back on their browser to try again or to hold call post data so the user can fill in a recaptcha to bypass the spam marking

1073094
post	get
it would be preferable if it was generic and i didnt need to copy the post and get data by hand

1073100
google-chrome	firefox
i sometimes have the same happen to me when i m inspecting http traffic with fiddler and my computer crashes although in that case its the other way around ie google-chrome etc give me the error message and firefox works splendidly

1073147
hide	show
just show hide with jquery that

1073150
hide	show
if you use javascript to show and hide the controls then because it s on the client side you would not have to postback the form and could do server side validation when the save button is clicked

1073157
free	malloc
the question is about the malloc 0 + free combination not the value of ptr

1073161
ubuntu	linux
these are both capable systems but differ somewhat in their userspace architecture the tooling for the desktop environment and default configuration for system security works a bit differently on ubuntu than it does on most other linux or unix flavours but this is of little relevance to development

1073161
vim	emacs
most unix programming can be accomplished quite effectively with a programmer s editor such as vim or emacs both of which come in text mode and windowing flavours

1073169
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
free frees the memory space pointed to by ptr which must have been returned by a previous call to malloc calloc or realloc

1073175
calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc
free address is ok if address was received from malloc or others like calloc etc.

1073181
opera	firefox
explorer mozilla firefox opera and

1073239
set	bag
is this a case where i should use set over bag

1073239
set	bag
i ve read up a little on bag vs set and to me it seems like set perhaps would solve my unique row issue but still as this is just a join table my biggest concern is to be able to delete connection and remove a contactinfo from a group

1073245
unix	bsd
its a unix bsd based os but with a really slick user interface over the top

1073251
typhoeus	eventmachine
i think it works better with other libraries like typhoeus typhoeus or if you re usning eventmachine em-http-request they both allow multi-request and you should be able to send more than 2 to the same domain at least it does with ubuntu

1073276
getter	setter
next apple for good reasons recommends against using getter setter in your init dealloc

1073276
super	self
next after super dealloc your object is destroyed so you cannot reference self and hence your ivars after that so your dealloc should look like

1073276
getter	setter
further as above apple recommends you should not use setter or getter in your dealloc routine so your deallocation would initially look like

1073290
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i have tested this in ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 3 firefox 3.5 and recent versions of google-chrome opera and safari on windows

1073302
set	bag
reason is that in mnesia you can t set index type and always is duplicate bag

1073316
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
one of the bsds freebsd openbsd netbsd

1073332
submit	submission
note that onclientclick helps to disable to button and usesubmitbehaviour disables the traditional submission behaviour of page and allows asp.net to render the submit behaviour upon user script

1073366
put	get
it works fine until i try to put back the value from the rtb into the webbrowser then i get a

1073392
getter	setter
in c# you can create getter setter in a simpler way than other languages

1073419
emacs	kate
kate s an ok notepad-esque text editor if you want to go that way but i don t see why you d want to get in to vi or emacs apart from the geeky appeal of using something really arcane

1073455
try-catch	exception-handling
if you need to catch an exception-handling from it all surround all the code with a try-catch

1073467
fflush	gets
3 once testing is complete the pre-production environment gets fflush back from live

1073567
fiddler	charles
use something like fiddler or charles not firebug s net panel or anything else that s actually inside the browser to examine what s actually coming over the wire

1073584
min	max
select c.raffle_code min t.timestamp max t.timestamp min t.transaction_number max t.transaction_number

1073584
min	max
having max c.sequence - min c.sequence count -1

1073584
min	max
and max t.transaction_number - min t.transaction_number 4

1073591
goto	break
the one advantage that ab using do break while or while break for this purpose has over goto is that you are guaranteed not to be jumping above the construct -- goto can be used to jump to a label earlier within the same function

1073604
websphere	ibm
this is a bit similar to some ibm rational modeling tools for websphere

1073634
pow	math.h	pow	sqrt	math.h	sqrt
alternatively to using the pow function you could simply define a square function and use the sqrt function in math.h which would probably improve performance a bit

1073646
filesystems	ntfs
the hard drive uses ntfs though i d appreciate knowing how it s done on other filesystems as well

1073671
pascal	delphi
the excellent delphi jedi project has converted most of the windows api header files into delphi pascal

1073681
goto	break
also if you are working to strict coding standards yes goto is likely to be forbidden but often so are break and continue so the loop is not necessarily a workaround for that

1073682
put	get
put simply you can t get the value of the sun.os.patch.level property without throwing an accesscontrolexception

1073692
post	get
i would presume it was get head and post but was just wanting to double-check

1073716
inherited	properties
also the entity diagram seems to require you to add properties to inherited classes just to be able to use them for associations between classes

1073738
getter	setter
it is fine but proper as3 practice is to use the for only internal private protected variables and then write getter and setter without the

1073740
innodb	myisam
make sure you have an index on code if your table is innodb and id is a primary key or on code id if your table is myisam or id is not a primary key

1073760
getter	setter
besides that a property is nothing else than a getter and a setter method from a design perspective a property should never contain any computations other than initializing or validation eg

1073770
width	height
since the tabcontrol has no specific size assigned it should autosize it does that correctly but when you switch tabs it automatically resizes itself to the height and width of the contents of the currently selected tab

1073810
hide	show
you can use a jquery event to detect a click and then hide or show divs

1073886
hide	show
using the hide and show methods

1073886
hide	show
the toggle method just calls show if hidden or hide if its not

1073899
post	get
this blog post by eric burke should get you started

1073903
hide	show
see the jquery online documentation for show hide and toggle

1073921
put	get
i ve always had to put a z-index on .sf-menu li li to get the sub-menus to show up in ie6 7

1073940
integer	unsigned
if n_half is a positive or unsigned integer it halves it

1073955
integer	unsigned
use single-letter prefixes or single letter + numbers for integer types to stop the names getting too unmanageable so maybe u8 for 1-byte unsigned integer a for array r for struct as in record

1073960
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox safari google-chrome opera etc

gif	png
for the background image if you are not using inline styles in your actual code and depending on your background image and acceptable loss of quality you can save the png as a gif and use

1074018
button	checkbox
for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined

1074084
superclass	subclassing
most ides can be configured to show a warning if you refer to a superclass constant via a subclassing and i d guess static analysis tools like findbugs can do it too

1074093
ant	maven
i ve got an ant task using the maven task set up to automatically download all my java apps dependencies and consolidate them into a lib directory but i cant see a way to tell intellij to basically treat everything in that dir as an external lib - i have to manually add them all to my project

either way you can always push pull changes from one repository to another so the changes made in the clone aren t lost in your main repository

1074145
hide	show
i am using js to show hide process

1074241
int	double
by doing the division by a double amount 2.0 you end up doing floating point division instead of int division

1074273
fgets	fgetc
perhaps instead of fgets one should use fgetc since fgets captures through to the newline

1074278
hide	show
remove the margin from the container div add a wrapper div with the same margin value but as a padding attribute and simply show hide the container div

ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux	opensuse	linux
i ve been playing with linux recently ubuntu 9.04 and opensuse 11.1 with focus on web services

1074312
mouse	keyboard
my thought is that the device should be a keyboard with a built-in mouse capability so the second person can operate without having a desktop surface

1074317
icefaces	woodstock
at least not as mainstream as icefaces woodstock and the other jsf components

1074359
post	get
check whether your php configuration has magic_quotes_gpc activated in such case the php server automatically adds slashes to get post cookie values.

1074360
dbvisualizer	toad
dbvisualizer is not a free tool but the price is fair maybe even cheap when compared to toad

my initial thought was svn as it is really close to cvs but i m a bit tempted to use something like mercurial

1074412
put	get
put succinctly the book explains that as programs get bigger they get harder to manage understand maintain develop because there are more things to think about

1074443
hide	show
you can specify that certain fields only show up on edit new or display pages and only for certain groups or to hide them completely

1074491
ant	maven
doesn t have a maven plugin that i m aware of so i m trying to build the parser using an ant java

1074491
ant	maven
i tried replacing the ant task with a maven plugin by writing a ratsmojo class that invokes xtc.parser.rats directly and replacing the plugin element above with

1074529
put	get
i tried to put the new query statement in every possible way in the existing but it doesn t work at all i do not get an error though so the code is valid but i still get an unfiltered list as return.

1074531
submit	submission
what makes my case is different that this form is on a domain and i am submission it to another domain name so can t use ajax submit due to cross script security issues

1074534
multiplying	subtract
multiplying by 31 is fast because the jit can convert it to a shift left by 5 bits and a subtract

1074544
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
however runtimeexception were supposed to be programming errors that weren t supposed to be handled directly - such as nullpointerexception which only occur if methods take invalid arguments or don t check for such cases directly

1074556
folder	directory
i need to monitor and report on all changes folder and directory added permissions changed registry entries added that are made during the installation of a software program

1074559
button	checkbox
if you want the user to click on a button to perform the action then what you need to handle is the click event of the button not the checkbox changed event.

1074559
button	checkbox
when the button is clicked just go through all rows of your datagridview and perform an action on rows with a checked checkbox

1074576
mouse	keyboard
still it would allow you to attach a second keyboard to this one and if this second keyboard has a build-in mouse or if you add an usb hub then two people could work at the same time

1074577
ready	each
we want to be able to assign build qualities to each branch dev - ready for test.

1074614
ubuntu	centos
i ve been getting more and more comfortable using vi on a daily basis but one thing that bothers me is that when i use it on ubuntu it behaves differently than when i use it on centos and probably other places

1074614
ubuntu	centos
in centos insert mode there is a big bold notice at the bottom that i m in insert mode but in ubuntu there is no notice so i can never tell which mode i m in

1074614
ubuntu	centos
in centos insert mode i can use the backspace key and it will delete the character that is before the cursor but in ubuntu i just hear a beep sound and nothing happens

1074678
wordpress	joomla
i tried wordpress and joomla

1074689
mouse	keyboard
there s a company adesso that makes some nice products that integrate mouse and keyboard functionality into one

1074732
imperative	declarative
msbuild property evaluation is pretty complex since it mixes declarative and imperative styles

1074753
hash	md5
is there a reason you don t want to do something like an md5 hash of the two files and compare the results - here is an example of some code that seems pretty common

1074753
hash	md5
how do i generate a hexadecimal md5 hash

1074761
inherited	properties
i believe i need to create a custom eventargs class that inherited from eventargs and has my custom properties

1074788
junit	jmockit
i regularly run junit tests that use jmockit with and without the -javaagent jvm argument in debug mode and never had any issues

1074789
width	height
set the width and height properties to auto

1074808
post	get
this really becomes a problem is say i am trying to get a count of all post items for a room and i want that method on the room class

1074815
disk	ram
if it s from l2 it takes a while longer if it s in ram then it s longer still and finally if it s on disk it s a huge time

1074818
int	double
although the hash of the double are int the double could mess up the hash

1074845
direct3d	gdi
alternatives would as you mentioned be direct3d or you could consider regular gdi with system calls

1074845
direct3d	gdi
gdi can be relatively easy once you figure out the basics direct3d is a bit more complex

1074877
temporary	tablespace
that means you need to store these values somewhere be it memory temporary tablespace or a permanent tablespace

1074879
doxygen	docset
my problem is that when i create the documentation no matter how i modify my doxygen config file exclude_parameters etc... the first time it creates the docset for the documentation it is fine

1074936
cvs	rcs
cvs was originally a set of scripts over the file-oriented rcs and it never escaped its history

1074936
cvs	rcs
a cvs repository is a collection of rcs files arranged in the directory structure you want when it s checked out plus some lock directories

1074936
cvs	rcs
so no the cvs revision of a file is the rcs revision in the repository and has nothing to do with any other revision number

1074959
jsfl	fla
if you want to code against a fla the most straightforward method would be to use jsfl - it s just javascript for controlling the flash ide

1074971
maven	pom.xml
some jars that can t be added due to license reasons have a pom.xml entry in the maven central repo

1074972
post	get
or if it s just a search result try to live without the post and use a get which also has other advantages

1074987
maven	pom.xml
the referenced jars aren t available on the maven2 central repository so unless you have an additional repository declaration in your pom.xml or an active profile in your settings maven will not know where to obtain the artifacts from

1074987
nexus	artifactory
another alternative is to use a maven repository manager like nexus or artifactory to manage maven s interactions with external repositories though that is almost certainly too much information if you re just starting out

1075011
xslt	relaxng
if you are then you might want to fit in with xhtml xslt svg xproc relaxng and the rest

1075026
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
argumentexception and argumentnullexception are both used for validating arguments eg

1075037
width	height
the proportions of the width height are the same as the ones in the original image

1075055
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i personally use argumentexception or argumentnullexception in conjunction with testing parameters passed to routines like this

1075055
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
i would recommend using argumentexception or argumentnullexception for parameters passed to routines rather then local variables

1075127
put	get
i m kind of a javascript noob and i m trying to use the new geolocation api in firefox 3.5 to get an estimation of the user s coordinates and put that into a text box in a form

1075139
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a wpf tabcontrol that has a couple of buttons in the tabitem header

1075148
cpython	ironpython
although for cpython this is the address of the object this is not guaranteed i believe and may be different on other implementations like ironpython

1075150
coalesce	isnull
it should be noted that with two arguments isnull works the same as coalesce which you could use if you have a few values to test - coalesce in_my_field1 otherval null

1075151
rss	feed
i ve written an rss feed parser using nsxmlparser in under half an hour

1075175
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested it on ie 6 8 firefox 3.0 google-chrome safari and they work

1075184
free	malloc
others have answered the question as written but i d like to suggest sticking with malloc free for such allocations

1075184
free	malloc
if you know that you just need an arbitrary block of memory using malloc and free is perfectly reasonable

1075232
persistent	transient
when nhibernate checks whether the child is transient the trigger responds that it is transient and a save happens which marks the child as persistent

1075247
serializable	deserialization
i don t want to serializable the java object implementations in the data file itself i just want a way to look up the proper classfile on deserialization

1075250
int	chars
for subsequent comparison the system should use this hash being an int or a long the comparison should be a single operation rather than iterating through each chars of the string until a mismatch is found

1075271
postgresql	mysql
in mysql postgresql sql server try running

1075277
bmp	png
also note that without compression also image size is just 30kb for rgb image and if you reduce size to 60x60 pixels image size would be only 10kb without any compression i.e you can use bmp images and if you want lesses sizer but lossless compression you can choose png

1075327
tabcontrol	tabitem
however we d have to set that on each tab so instead we can create a style for the tabitem in the tabcontrol like so

1075340
int	chars
this will work fine up to 6 chars in a 32-bit int

1075341
freemarker	velocity
the same will apply when using velocity and freemarker

1075367
accessor	properties
if you look at the properties accessor in the generated code in settings.cs you ll see that they re marked with an attribute containing the default value of the setting that s in your app.config file. if you change a setting by editing the app.config file directly settings.cs won t be updated but the new value will still be used by your program when you run it because app.config gets copied to foo.exe.config at compile time

1075391
jobs	cron
we have several cron jobs that ftp proxy logs to a centralized server

1075423
hide	show
in the past the way i ve handled this is to have the user not leave the login page and have an asp.net panel show itself with the oh hey you need to change your password bit and hide the rest of the page

1075423
post	get
if i have it post to another action view then i run the risk of either having to log in the user or have the change password page be not protected by authentication since unlike the change password bit you get provided with i don t want them to be authenticated when they see the page

1075426
websphere	ibm
ibm seems to frequently reorganize its website so the above link might not work if you check back here after a long while but the supportpac can be found easily by doing a search for saveqmgr on the websphere mq page

1075444
free	malloc
you should also take care of declaring such large arrays if you need big arrays you should use malloc free otherwise you will exhaust your stack

1075499
int	chars
if you really want to avoid the lookup and just unse auto-increment you can create a function that turns an int into a string of seemingly-random chars with the ability to convert back

1075518
jobs	cron
your cron jobs should tell that they re finished

1075518
jobs	cron
we have our cron jobs that transport files just write an empty filename.finished after it s transferred the filename

1075565
post	get
maybe someone else can post some better information on it but here s a link to one approach to get you started

1075599
inherited	properties
it s a way to implement properties inherited

1075684
width	height
i want to have an anchor with a specific height and width

1075706
udp	tcp
my program runs fine locally but overseas sites are having issues and i am wondering if sql might be using a tcp or udp port that is still blocked

1075784
addclass	removeclass
following that with yet another operator and passing that operator the string removeclass or addclass gets you the removeclass or addclass jquery method

1075824
realloc	malloc
realloc should be used for memory allocated with malloc - like functions

1075854
rss	feed
i ve used squid before to reduce load on dynamically-created rss feed and it worked quite well

1075860
post	get
i found this post which looks similar but can t quite get it to work with my approach because i need to deserialize an interface which is xmlserializable

1075863
inherited	properties
i m writing a custom .net data provider modeled on sqlclient and have to implement the isnullable properties in my parameter class which inherited from dbparameter

1075870
addclass	removeclass
addclass removeclass step

1075870
addclass	removeclass
again based on n it will either call the addclass or the removeclass method passing it the appropriate class name

1075889
put	get
put as an answer to get the formatting of the code..

1075897
realloc	malloc
clarification you cannot realloc part of allocated memory - only the whole malloc ed chunk

1075902
hide	show
i am using a datagrid in expression blend but i just need to show only the registries and hide the columnheader

1075981
inherited	properties
as multi-table inherited defines a properties on the parent instance to access a child instance this is all pretty straight forward

1076002
getter	setter
use the property - any logic that may be encapsulated within the setter and getter ought to apply even within the class itself

1076002
getter	setter
if there is no logic within the getter and setter it is still not safe to use the fields themselves because if at any point you wish to add logic around the access to those fields you will have to refactor much more

1076014
post	get
the only ways to pass this data would be get post values cookies flat file or storing the data to the database

1076020
accessor	properties
while in this particular example it really doesn t make much of a difference the get set accessor offer the ability to do a bit more work when grabbing a properties

1076020
accessor	properties
for example many of our properties get accessor perform some lookup within a more complex data structure or set default values if nothing has been defined

1076030
post	get
the only difference i see is that getjson performs a get request instead of a post

1076041
subtraction	addition
this will allow you to perform operations on monetary values - not only basic addition subtraction and so forth but possibly also currency conversions between usd and say euro

1076052
post	get
the simpler way will be to use post rediret get pattern

1076133
folder	directory
you can set webcontent as the content directory main java and main resources as java source folder and you can add the jars from libs to the build path or simply put them in the webcontent web-inf lib directory

1076185
width	height
override the set height and set width functions in the parent mc you could do scalex and scaley as well

1076185
width	height
set the scalex for width or scaley for height of the child mc to 1. scalex width or 1. scaley height

1076241
inherited	properties
also since it is an inherited properties you can just set the attachedproperty directly on the tabitems you don t need to assign it specifically to the content

1076283
youtube	vimeo
i m not sure about vimeo but the youtube player has a javascript api and when you enable it the player will call a javascript function onyoutubeplayerready when the player is loaded and ready

1076326
pop-up	dialog
select the project in vss - right ckick on the project and pick show history - in the dialog that pop-up select the version you want and then click get

1076350
icomparable	compareto
i wrote the method compareto in the myobj class per the icomparable interface but when i use the it returns false when it should be true

1076384
portrait	landscape
in stating the as we run the app it should be in the landscape mode and in this mode if we orientate the phone in 90 angle than it should play some video than problem comes video play by default in the landscape mode but we need it in the portrait mode than for playing video in the portrait mode we put the code

1076443
google-chrome	firefox

gridview	sqldatasource
working on setting up a sqldatasource connecting mysql database to a asp .net gridview

1076463
hash	md5
results of hash functions like sha-1 or md5 and guids tend to become very long which is probably something you don t want

1076666
width	height
cliprectangle x 128 y 290 width 250 height 200

1076725
scapy	libpcap
it was written by the author of pypcap a different libpcap wrapper but it shouldn t be too difficult to get it working with pcapy to see if it s faster for your purposes than scapy

1076764
many-to-many	one-to-many
suppose i have a one-to-many or many-to-many association between entities person and event such that a person class in java contains a

1076798
metaclass	subclassing
if you want to make absolutely sure that subclassing of a override size you could use a metaclass for a that will raise an error when a subclassing does not override it note that a is a new-style class here

1076818
postgresql	mysql
the requirements for the project i m working seem to point to using both a relational database postgresql mysql in combination with a key-value store hbase cassandra

1076820
google-chrome	firefox
i cannot view the error from my computer on firefox ie and google-chrome but yet i see the error up top when browsing from another computer s browser

1076833
chunked	transfer-encoding
not quite sure how to do this in asp.net haven t tried it before but in general if the http client supports http v1.1 as indicated by the version of its request the server can send a transfer-encoding response header that specifies chunked and then send the response data using multiple data blocks as they become available

1076866
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
did not work on safari 3 firefox and opera ie is not enable to draw svg

1076912
777	tmp
tmp is usually 777 rwxrwxrwx

1076920
mouse	keyboard
the job of gtk_main is pump events -- it detects low-level events such as keyboard mouse input and os timers converts them to higher-level events and passes those onto the application code

1076944
short	base
if you want short urls and predictability is not a concern you can convert the auto-incrementing id to a higher base

1077008
width	height
you can get pretty in depth with the actual layout of the grid column row spanning width height etc

1077056
profiling	debugging
it is freeware and very good for quick debugging and profiling

1077072
profiler	aqtime
my profiler list includes ants dottrace and aqtime

1077078
updatepanel	ascx
my ascx control inside a container updatepanel does a full page refresh when one of the controls inside it is clicked

1077085
width	height
create a subclass of movieclip and override the get and set methods for width and height

1077085
factors	matrix
since you are using a matrix override the get and set matrix functions set the scaling factors with your new functions and set them to not scale before calling super

1077085
width	height
use scalex scaley instead for getting the width height and multiply by the width and height values for 0 rotation 1.0 scale

1077089
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
after installing you can use mysql in the standard .net way using mysqlconnection mysqlcommand mysqldatareader and so on

1077103
outputstream	inputstream
you d want to get the blob as an inputstream and dump its contents to the outputstream

1077106
getter	setter
for whatever reason javascript getter setter for custom objects seem to work with any browser but ie

1077145
draggable	droppable
here is a example that does some other thing but makes use of droppable and draggable objects maybe it can help you understand how it works

1077157
ant	buildr
then i would create build targets for all these script in ant nant buildr etc

1077207
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
btree sortedlist inserting special nodes in the sorteddictionary could all be useful

1077228
width	height
your margin-top + height 24px + 1px 25px and your margin-left + width 16px + 9px 25px

1077233
width	height
that makes that if you don t define the width and height of the pictures explicitly it becomes 25x25px

1077233
width	height
fix it by adding width 24 and height 16 to your images

1077281
win64	windows
technical quibble you can avoid com but you can t avoid interop twain is a native win32 or win64 dll that is not part of windows proper and is unknown to the clr so at the bottom either in your code or the component you use there are interop calls to unmanaged code

1077282
lua	scheme
my palm has a lua implementation that allows you to do reasonable guis a fairly useless old python 1.5 a superb forth which allows you to produce compiled apps and a scheme that allows for copmlete gui dev

1077319
width	margin
also without setting an explicit width the auto margin trick doesn t work too great

1077325
getter	setter
resig s post references his env.js implementation being the first time he uses the getter and setter methodology you are looking for

1077325
getter	setter
to handle browser compatibility as well as focusing on an aspect that javascript does very well use closures for your getter and setter methods to protect object properties

1077337
google-chrome	safari
i cannot make any claims about the efficiency of safari s webkit konqueror s kjs ie s proprietary engine or google-chrome s v8

1077344
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if you need to block threads refer to the manualresetevent and autoresetevent classes

1077359
puts	gets
however i ve run into a snag when trying to query mbeans for specific caches within a cluster which is where i can find stats about total number of gets puts average time for each etc

1077377
mouse	keyboard
using the keyboard to browse through large source code is much easier than manually scrolling through text highlighting text and fumbling through an ide with a mouse

1077380
awt	swing
i haven t tried it before but swing is built on top of awt and the robot class had a way of sampling specific pixels in the awt

1077400
pop-up	dialog
the tooltips created are not linked to the dialog pop-up directly - they re not created as child widgets of the pop-up

1077405
width	height
if the width and height are set using inline styles including those created by javascript you can override them by using the

1077428
mouse	keyboard
currently i could use mouse click to choose the selection i d like to add keyboard control to allow autocomplete control

1077454
hash	salt
in sites i have previously created i made use of a user_id and a salt hash of the user s password

1077454
hash	salt
the primary reason i used two fields to authenticate a user is because it saved me the trouble of adding another table and thus complicating the database design. with the user_id also being stored in the cookie i could do an indexed look-up in users table and efficiently match the salt hash to the user

1077477
ant	maven
for me it turned surprised when the experienced programming talk about the difficulties of maven when i saw ant in some project maven showed me a miracle

1077484
ant	maven
i think maven suffers from a relatively high barrier to entry compared to tools like ant

1077488
perl	tcl
- and has the theoretical advantage that it can also wrap c or c++ code for use from java perl tcl etc -- but if you only care about python it s hard to see anything to make it stand out

1077489
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest organizes a web application into resources like a twitter user or a flickr image and then uses the http verbs of post put get and delete to create update read and delete those resources

1077489
put	get
likewise if you use a restful web service to update your twitter account information you can put the new information as many times as it takes in order to get confirmation from the web service

1077492
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
online example rendered neatly in firefox google-chrome safari and ie

1077513
metaclass	subclassing
of course this way you ll get the error only when an instance of a subclassing of a which doesn t override size actually tries to use self.size the metaclass approach has the advantage of giving the error earlier when an errant subclassing of a is created

1077520
ant	maven
so i can see why people would backoff from maven coming from ant for example

1077520
ant	maven
maven for an ant user has a lot of magic properties and behavior that creates an uncomfortable aura of uncertainty that does not sit very well with the typical build master paranoia we get when we start deploying apps to client and want stable versionning

1077520
ant	maven
also if maven is not acting the way you want you can always revert to ant and then integrate in the maven bigger picture

1077521
firefox	safari
i get this on firefox 3.5 and safari 4

1077547
ant	maven
in my experience the introduction of maven to projects that were previously built with ant has invariably created more problems than it solved

1077547
ant	maven
in one case maven started to take up so much of our time that we eventually migrated back to ant again

1077581
treemap	treeset
but it d be fatal inside a treeset treemap

1077588
websphere	ibm
i have a page that gathers environment status from a couple of ibm websphere servers using iframes similar to this

1077627
ant	maven
maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known

1077627
ant	maven
most existing projects do not conform to maven s convention and hence many projects are simply not bothered to spend the effort to migrate their already well-crafted ant build system into another especially if maven does not offer anything that their ant build can already do

1077643
ant	maven
i switched an ant build over to maven because i had a whole slew of projects with interdependencies

1077643
maven	cargo
like this guide to using cargo starting external process during integration testing in maven which i found not from the maven-cargo plugin website but just because i happened to be trolling through stackoverflow

1077645
width	margin
save the hassle and do margin auto along with the set width

1077682
accessor	ivar
if you explicitly want to access an ivar the right thing to do is to make it an accessor

1077684
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested it on my end on google-chrome firefox and ie unless you define the button itself it will maintain the default size

1077768
postgresql	mysql
for your purposes the sqlite version that comes with mono see here seems perfect no much how wonderful postgresql or i guess even mysql

1077859
hide	show
i see this all over the web but was wondering if anyone has the javascript code for the easiest way to show input value on blur but hide in on focus

1077869
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i tested this with firefox 2 firefox 3 opera 9 opera 10 google-chrome safari ie6 ie7 ie8 even wget

1077875
xmltype	clob
if you really want universal container then you always can serialize anything as for example xml and store it as text clob in this case you can store it as xmltype

1077939
pdfsharp	itext
yes adding security to a pdf which stops people from being able to edit it is quite easy using a variety of different pdf toolkits itext pdfsharp quick pdf library etc

1077979
scrollable	panels
this panels allows the user to type into the search box to control the items of the scrollable checkbox list in real time

1078006
vim	emacs
there maybe more that i don t know of and it s fully possible that vim and emacs have some sort of plugins for this

1078013
profiler	yourkit
an option would be to use a profiler like yourkit switch makes a pretty good stab at calculating the retained size of a reference

1078062
cvs	svn
if you pretend its just a more modern svn or cvs you ll get frustrated by the lack of improvement in your coding workflow and you ll become annoyed by the multitude of commands

1078062
tortoisegit	svn
all the typical guis that i ve seen eclipsesvn tortoisegit svn all preselect your recent changes as being part of the commit you re about to make whether those changes are ready to be committed or not

1078069
python-mode	ropemacs
from what i understand python-mode has the several dependencies so i need to install rope ropemode and ropemacs

1078088
width	height
width height will change as you rotate the clip

1078109
int	chars
i think caching in the worst-case hit every value couldn t take up more than 250kb 17576 possible values sizeof int 4 + sizeof chars 3 + string overhead 2

1078205
super	implements
it s not particularly super safe but active directory is usually implements with lockout after a few bad attempts so that s no so bad

1078218
int	double
count is an int x is a double

1078237
crypt	md5
openldap offers crypt md5 smd5 ssha and sha according to my man page

1078244
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	salt	md5
openldap for example supports the schemes salt sha1 crypt os dependent md5 salt md5 and sha1

1078244
kerberos	ldap
ldap comes in handy when you have to connect different clients to a central authentication system proprietary software email servers or if you have to integrate it into some kerberos or sasl authentication scenario

1078307
getter	setter
i also tried jquery.extend with a simple value getter setter object on the air.urlloader but no success

1078323
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but i was wondering the reason why google-chrome and safari btw completely refuses to render this page works 100 ie and firefox

1078324
maven	m2e
all modern ide s eclipse only with 3rd party plug-ins m2e or q for eclipse support importing maven projects directly so you do not have to adapt anything

1078332
versioning	upgrade
i don t see what this new versioning offers to justify upgrading and working through possible issues after the upgrade

1078341
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
maybe because safari and google-chrome are using webkit to render webpage but firefox uses gecko and ie trident

1078352
google-chrome	safari
i believe it s because you re using a very old and tag and i don t think webkit the rendered in safari and google-chrome handle that tag

1078373
google-chrome	safari
fix the issues and it should render correctly in google-chrome and safari

1078381
versioning	upgrade
if anything upgrade for the bug fixes but make sure to check compatibility a few things have changed in this versioning goto namespaces parameter parsing mhash etc...

1078401
uitableview	nsindexpath
i have overloaded - uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

1078451
width	height
i also tried setting the height and width to 0 or setting visibility to hidden or collapse but none of those worked

1078451
google-chrome	firefox
the solution should at least be supported in ie6 up firefox 2 up and google-chrome latest

1078466
webkit	gecko
webkit is stricter than gecko

1078470
hide	show
you can either set class hideme to hide your control or class showme to show your control

1078491
hide	show
you can set the display to none if you want to hide the element and display to block or inline if you want to show them

1078501
google-chrome	firefox
i ve implemented functionality that has been tested to work in internet explorer 6 7 8 firefox and google-chrome but what about other browsers

1078516
post	get
hi if you use get method instead of post then we can t the form filed values

1078520
ubuntu	linux
my server being linux only ubuntu 8.04 lts i am wondering if installing mono in place of the .net framework is a good idea for production use

1078532
put	get
get webclient to do the work for you with its downloadfile method which will put the data directly into a file

1078677
debian	linux
i ve a question about the memory management in c and gcc 4.3.3 under debian gnu linux

1078680
getter	setter
i was hoping to pass in the checkbox s checked getter setter as follows

1078680
getter	setter
i m fairly certain that the checkbox getter setter returns a bool

1078690
free	malloc
if you ll have additional malloc calls after the free - chances are that the old contents will be lost

1078705
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
use the touchesbegan withevent and touchesmoved withevent methods

1078718
getter	setter
my dto data transfer object which is simplecar.java contains the variables id type color and their respective setter getter

1078743
cherokee	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd	nginx	cherokee	fastcgi	scgi
if instead you are having to use fastcgi scgi or ajp adapters for a server such as lighttpd nginx or cherokee then you need to use flup package to provide a bridge between those language agnostic interfaces and wsgi

1078746
ubuntu	centos
in centos vi is an alias for a different program vim but in recent versions of ubuntu vi means just vi not vim

1078774
hibernate	gilead
if you are talking about gwt rpc returning model objects from the server such as hibernate objects gilead as mentioned elsewhere is probably worth looking at - though i ve never had any personal experience

1078781
cpu	processors
also it might be worth seeing if you can check the cpu flags as there will either be the intel vmx flag or the amd svm flag if the processors supports virtualisation extensions

1078785
folder	directory
if your page for example default.htm lies inside the virtual directory website1 then you can create a folder for images say images and can point to an image inside the images directory by using images image1.jpg

1078787
folder	directory
put the files in a directory that is in the same folder the html file is in

1078807
jobs	cron
by the way i m using windows pycron for my cron jobs

1078839
width	height
i also had to change my webpart to derive from microsoft.sharepoint.webpartpages.webpart with the attendant changes to how i handle the width and height of my webpart

1078899
floating-point	integer
snufflesmodel has integer coordinates but snufflessprite has floating-point ones

1078941
pdfsharp	migradoc
there is this migradoc stuff which comes with pdfsharp but i hardly found any proper doc faq for it

1078969
width	height
i have used jquery for a small animation work a table #photos contains 9 photos and i would like to increase the width and height using the animate function on mouseover

1078997
profiling	debugging
just like with debugging profiling is a task best done by the perl interpreter itself

1079006
getter	setter
then you could access the getter setter of your singleton from anywhere in your program

1079008
valgrind	gprof
using gprof valgrind oprofile .

1079208
free	malloc
free and malloc are not from gcc

1079208
free	malloc
i particular after you use free you are releasing the memory block malloc gave you

1079219
jobs	cron
i will say that the framework i created for my own use i generally found that cron jobs needed enough different processing that creating dedicated controllers made more sense than trying to hang them on the outside of existing controllers

1079239
junit	mockito
this is my testing class i m using junit 4 and mockito

1079251
multiplying	add
if the order is important you can instead multiplying by a prime number and add

1079264
mockito	jmock
jmock doesn t do anything special for final classes other than rely on the jdave library to unfinalize everything in the jvm so you could experiment with using jdave s unfinalizer and see if mockito will then mock it

1079275
minimum	max	min	max
maximum and minimum referred to getting the max and min id when grouped by date and account_id

1079293
versioning	upgrade
i am using nant to get latest versioning of source upgrade versioning of the libraries and application build the application build the setups.

1079329
mouseover	mouseout
i originally started using the .live method with mouseover and mouseout however this has massive cpu implications when moving the mouse over the parts of the page without the grid as the event is delegated to the document mouseover

1079342
put	get
however when i put exactly the same expression in the .hgignore file i get this

1079373
nginx	lighttpd
you could use a different web server such as lighttpd or nginx

1079379
post	get
another thing that may be more difficult is having a post get the post that have tags in common ordered by the number of common tags so i could get similar post to this one in some way

1079419
int	chars
if you wish to avoid unsafe code then you can use bit masking techniques to pull out individual bits from int and chars if dealing with strings with not too much extra hassle

1079441
pop-up	dialog
alternatively you can use a javascript framework which has many other styles of modal dialog which are equally if not more useful than the ajax modal pop-up extender

1079453
folder	directory
replace that folder with a file of the same name minus .xpi if that s part of the name and inside the file place the full path to your source directory of the add-on

1079475
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to pop-up dialog from run method it gives me exception that looper.prepare not called when i call the same method i dont get any exception but there is no pop-up dialog shown on the console

1079538
titlebar	window
the titlebar is customizeable on the command-line and i intend to allow window positioning too

1079626
gridview	linqdatasource
i drop a linqdatasource and a gridview on a page enable update and delete for both and i m on my merry way

1079716
icu	gettext
i would highly recommend using icu instead of gettext and the locale stuff offered by the standard library if you are developing a commercial application

1079767
getter	setter	public	protected
i would recommend having a disposed property on the base class with a public getter and a protected setter

1079784
post	get
i suggest you start doing this and post a question when you get stuck

1079808
dlsym	dlopen
to avoid this i have replaced the api calls with function pointers obtained using dlsym and dlopen

1079814
int	chars
also note that i use an int in the loop in main just to be able to iterate over the whole range of unsigned chars

1079830
inherited	properties
you would check at runtime for the existence of methods or properties that are required to fulfill your needs regardless of inherited hierarchies

1079919
getter	setter
when an event is dispatchen the main class either does something or retrives a variable or sets a variable in the loaded swf with the getter or setter function

1079929
calloc	malloc
you could also use calloc instead of malloc since calloc gives you zeroed memory

1079940
onresume	onpause
in any case you ll definitely want to move the acquire and release methods into onresume and onpause respectively

1079940
onresume	onpause
your best bet is to construct the wakelock in oncreate as you have acquire the lock in onresume and release it in onpause including the call to isheld

1079944
nullreferenceexception	objectdisposedexception
other methods that attempt to use _comobject after dispose will get a nullreferenceexception or ideally those methods would check the _comobject field and throw objectdisposedexception

1079978
vsts	tfs
in tfs 2005 and when you open from the client side from vsts the source control explorer and you create a workspace

1080017
post	get
so assuming you do want to post instead of get your .ajax call might look like this

1080019
g++	gcc
any .l files will get passed through flex and gcc any .y files will get passed through bison and g++ and any .cpp files through just g++

1080047
puts	gets
three specific issues i can think of are efficiency of your gets and puts write contention and exploding indexes

1080049
int	chars
in this case the chars are int values obtained by calling integer.parseint

1080065
put	get
i d say that the workflow of sign up get e-mail click on link in e-mail is now fairly ubiquitous and wouldn t put off the majority of users

1080103
versioning	upgrade
the force is to upgrade older versioning

1080136
bitarray	bitset
bitset or bitarray

1080166
opera	firefox
for me your code works without problems in ie6 firefox 3.0.11 and opera 9.64

1080274
uitableview	uisearchbar
i ve got a uitableview with a uisearchbar as the tableviews.tableheaderview

1080331
post	get
as lavinio said above post the complete exception and maybe you ll get some help

1080331
post	put
you should put a try catch block around the code having the problem catch the exception in for instance ex then post the result of ex.tostring

1080381
bufferedreader	gzipinputstream
i though of creating my class which extends the reader or bufferedreader class of java and use gzipinputstream as one of its variable

1080388
sorting	grouping
edit your grouping and go to the sorting tab

1080510
versioning	upgrade
you should be on the very latest versioning of ruby on rails and upgrade frequently

1080532
firefox	safari
both safari mac and firefox mac move cursor at the very beginning when iâ m pressing the arrow up key

1080553
post	put
still interested in any improvements on this there may be a bit too much code to post really so just put some snippets in that hopefully illuminates

1080628
g++	gcc
cc gcc -m32 cxx g++ -m32 linux32 rpmbuild -bb -target i586 package.spec

1080640
glut	sdl
i could try using glut or sdl but i m not sure i want to include those as dependencies.

1080644
subtraction	addition
i d like to have a class a with a for example sortedlist collection srtdlst property and inside this class a allow the addition or subtraction of srtdlst items

1080644
subtract	add
but in a instance of the class a only allow to get or set the content of the items not to add new items or subtract the existing ones

1080677
width	height
this will make the height and width of the actual image 0 but will expand the box to fill the size of the image with padding

1080685
printf	atoi
but what i recommend you do is atoi their input and then printf cmd levelplayer.exe 03d lvlinput_as_integer

1080742
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
only firefox 3.5 safari all versions and google-chrome 2+ support it

1080742
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the article says it works in ie only however it works in google-chrome 3 what i m using firefox 3.5 internet explorer and safari

1080748
integer	fractions
with each decimal expansion of the fractions you end up with a remainder which if multiplied by the current decimal place is an integer

1080753
getter	setter
i can make the setter or getter private internal

1080769
n-gram	words
instead of writing another n-gram search or improving the one in whoosh we now keep a words index retrieve all entries that have at least one correctly spelled words in common with the query and use difflib to rank those

1080775
getter	setter
you can t create truly read only property because you have to define both setter and getter

1080792
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i want to rotate a single word of text by 90 degrees with cross-browser ie6 firefox 2 any version of google-chrome safari or opera support

1080812
firefox	safari
for firefox 3.5 or safari webkit 3.1 check out -moz-transform and -webkit-transform

1080885
submit	submission
please test your regex before submission it rather than submit what should work. for example i tried the following first

1080905
decoder	encoder
edit 2 the custom message encoder that you mentioned looks like it both encodes and decoder messages

1080909
fortran	ada
i m talking about things like mixing c++ with fortran or ada with haskell etc

1080919
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
in the past i ve used dotnetzip ms-pl sharpziplib gpl and the 7zip sdk for c# public domain

1080934
getter	setter
properties are really just two methods a getter and a setter of type and so you have to write different things do deal with the setter and the getter

1080959
sorting	filtering
it s offline in the sense that it is self contained that html is carefully generated and the js inside it is carefully crafted to allow the user to browse thousands of images sorting or filtering by a number of criteria

1080981
put	get
so i m willing to put the effort in now to get it set up right for the long term

1081007
folder	directory
i say to some extent because for some odd reason the microsoft demo app displays blank file and folder names though it can upload download files and traverse directory just fine

1081015
codeigniter	cakephp
you should also look into frameworks like cakephp and codeigniter that do some things like this for you automatically

1081019
codeigniter	cakephp
lastly if this is your first big use of php and want to implement something like mvc you might check out something like cakephp or codeigniter

1081024
put	get	post	put	post	get
i output an anchor tag that was the id of the post and passed it through post or get or within the post based on what the user was clicking so that when they navigated to the page again my code would put in the anchor

1081033
mp3	wav
i use a combination of wav files for sound effects and mp3 for music which seems to work fine

1081038
cakephp	kohana	codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	kohana
definately check out some other frameworks like cakephp kohana codeigniter if you need more details and code examples

1081045
atomic	compare-and-swap
spoiler uses atomic compare-and-swap cas operations if not available in ruby you could emulate them with locks

1081076
width	height
but if i draw the component at 500 450 and the texture width and height are 100 i would expect to only see the whole width but only half the height of the component

1081099
kde	gnome
also it sure would be different under kde gnome fluxbox whatever

1081132
min	max
my current solution is to simply track the center of the particles by finding the min max of the x s and y s and make the viewport s middle follow that

1081214
int	chars
perhaps byte is closer to chars than to int

1081237
subclass	abstract-class
i would add a pure abstract clone method to class person which definitely looks like it should be an abstract-class existing mainly for the sake of being subclassed -- if you need a concrete none of the above kind of person it s best done via a separate concrete subclass otherkindofperson rather than as the base class itself

1081300
nyromodal	jqmodal
i ve been trying to create my own firefox toolbar with commands that will open and close a modal dialog using either jqmodal or nyromodal

1081305
versioning	upgrade
they suggest that i upgrade crystal reports to versioning r2

1081317
vb.net	vb6
similar to vb.net having a bad rap due to vb6 history

1081328
cairngorm	puremvc
you might want to use a framework like puremvc or cairngorm for separation of model and view

1081363
nant	cruisecontrol
how do i configure nant cruisecontrol etc

1081380
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to layout an html table it s tabular data and it is rendering differently in firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 2.0.172 edit and ie7 - which renders the table like google-chrome does

1081403
postgresql	mysql
i sort a lot of data and if sqlite cannot sort naturally i suppose the solution is to head back to postgresql or mysql

1081431
min	max
there is the slightly chance of your code producing an overflow and languages like java will jump from max int to min int and you get a very big negative number

1081434
post	get
i know subsonic is built for a single db but i ve read several post about switching the connect string in the default provider to get multi database support

1081445
public	protected
normally i add a java doc to each public method and to some private protected methods

1081448
public	protected
every method - private protected public - should be documented describing what it does

1081450
implements	extends
look in each directly implements or extended interface in the order they appear following the word implements or extends in the method declaration

1081530
put	get
while each very useful and usable don t let you get anywhere as close to the machine as c++ and c allow simply put all of those languages impose on you a higher level of abstraction.

1081580
width	height
if i set width and height attributes on my window element that sets the non-client outer size which isn t useful

1081580
width	height
i can set width and height on the window s content element a in this case and then set the window s sizetocontent attribute to widthandheight

1081599
width	height
you can remove the window width and height attributes in xaml and add sizetocontent widthandheight

1081640
put	get	post	put	post	get
in fact many violate key aspects of rest such as using get for manipulation or post for retrieval and there are disagreements over fundamental usage post get vs post get put delete

1081655
post	get
if you post some more details we can see if we can help you get around it

1081681
post	get
many developers stick to get and post in which case the last one might be

1081696
verilog	vhdl
once you know verilog it will be easier to bridge the gap to vhdl

1081696
verilog	vhdl
i started out with vhdl then learned verilog and am now pro verilog

1081706
folder	directory
this assumes that your media_root media directory contains the admin media folder which is what i understood from your question

1081743
ssl	https
transmitting in ssl https provides encryption over the wire

1081777
daemons	systemd
in nix like systemd a daemons will normally create a pid file at somewhere to indicate its existence

1081787
nunit	mstest
it uses rhino mocks again but nunit instead of mstest

1081808
udp	tcp
an understanding of the network protocols differences between tcp udp and capacity is important to the architecture and the performance of the system performance in this scenario being hugely significant

1081820
integer	unsigned
for example if the largest offset of a starting integer is only 12 000 and the largest range is 9 000 long then you can use a 2 byte unsigned integer for all of these

1081848
spaces	delimiter
unlike the english language which uses a as the delimiter between words in a sentence chinese does not use spaces between words

1081974
hash	md5
it s a good idea to create an md5 hash to make it possible for clients to check the integrity of their downloads

1081996
filtering	grouping
suppose i need to fill no of people living in city based upon city id and there is another condition of filtering like business grouping service grouping students

1082023
rsa	aes
aes symmetric algorithm and rsa public key encryption are both there and widely accepted

1082049
client-side	server-side
on server-side i ll use java very likely spring framework depending on what i ll be using client-side

1082088
getter	setter
they have their uses but for me small functions like getter setter are not one of them

1082100
versioning	upgrade
however it means that each of the applications using that library must use the same versioning and unless backwards compatibility is ensured must upgrade at the same time

1082107
inline	inlining
of course the compiler may still inline the function if it thinks that will be efficient but it s not the same as an explicit inlining

1082118
postgresql	mysql
you could try either postgresql or mysql

1082128
cassini	iis
for my webapp the integrated visual studio server cassini ist much slower than iis

1082182
folder	directory
usually the source code goes into an src directory and the documentation goes into a docs folder

1082183
postgresql	mysql
i would recommend using javadb for the first one and then one of the other db - oracle mysql postgresql etc

1082205
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button are on off switches that may be toggled by the user

1082209
innodb	myisam
deprecate myisam innodb is the way to go

1082212
innodb	myisam
foreign keys are only supported for innodb tables not for myisam tables

1082219
udp	tcp
can anyone help i trying to figure what i need to do i have been given the tasks of writing a server and a client in tcp udp

1082219
udp	tcp
i am looking for soome good examples with c# for tcp or udp

1082219
udp	tcp
as far as i know there is udp and tcp .

1082219
udp	tcp
if in fact a connection is needed again going back to tcp udp

1082221
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp codeigniter and others are only focused on rad development

1082240
width	height
the google ads are not showing correctly in ie7 i tried applying css properties display block and also tried with inline specified width and height specified position relative so what should i add to css to get it correctly positioned with floating element above it

1082273
udp	tcp
it sounds to me like you re not clear on the distinction between tcp and udp

1082273
udp	tcp
i d consider your requirements and familiarise yourself with the limitations and features of tcp and udp

1082279
inherited	properties
create a wrapper class around customer either inherited from customer if possible or create an entirely new class that holds a customer object and exposes further properties

1082290
error-handling	exception-handling
the point of exception-handling is to separate the ideal flow from the error-handling flow

1082293
openssl	libcrypto
just for clarification you can do encryption and decryption using libcrypto which is a part of openssl

1082309
rar	zip	rar	gzip
algorithmss for text - zip bzip gzip rar 7zip are good enough to compress

1082321
accessor	properties
however outside of -dealloc or your initializers consistently accessing the properties via its accessor is a good idea

1082322
ant	maven
either let this be a maven project or ensure it works with ant ivy

1082364
postgresql	mysql
for most projects you will be fine using either mysql or postgresql

1082364
postgresql	mysql
at a later date you may decide you need to use an object-relational-mapping tool like hibernate but i would not worry about that now either just get familiar with jdbc and either mysql or postgresql

1082376
pecl	pear
the http pecl extension can do it also pear http_client snoopy and many many other libraries classes

1082394
udp	tcp
you shouldn t even consider udp if you re considering tcp too

1082394
udp	tcp
if you re considering tcp means you are thinking in terms of a stream exactly once in order messages and using udp will put the burden of fragmentation retry and acknowledgment duplicate detection and ordering in your app

1082394
udp	tcp
will be much harder to change your code base from tcp to udp and vice versa if you made the wrong choice using raw .net socket components

1082400
innodb	myisam
in general for me the most important point is that innodb offers per row locking while myisam does look per table

1082412
post	get
you very rarely want to actually press the submit button rather than making get or post requests to the handler resource directly

1082412
post	get
look at the html where the form is and see what parameters its submitting to what url and if it is get or post method

1082424
fadein	fadeout
also you may wish to consider using the fadein fadeout functions as these are designed to properly apply opacities over a range

1082433
int	chars
what you can pass from c# to c++ are types like bool int and chars

1082443
nunit	mstest
i ve only used the basic features of mstest so far and they have satisfied my needs and i don t really know anything about nunit

1082448
jtextfield	jeditorpane	jtextfield	jtextpane	jtextpane	jeditorpane
the listener approach will work on a jtextfield jtextarea jeditorpane or jtextpane

1082452
nunit	mstest
here is a nice blog which lists out some differences between mstest and nunit

1082462
int	double
the int double conversion is not even related as it is not a class cast but a conversion telling the compiler to store whatever is in x in y which happens to be a double

1082469
int	double
the int double is unrelated

1082469
int	double
that is a conversion not a cast - there is no relationship between int and double

1082472
jruby	mri
the following code will run forever in mri and jruby

1082472
jruby	mri
it s very important for people reading this thread to realize the whole issue is exclusive to jruby â in mri the built-in hash is sufficient

1082476
superclass	subclassing
for the first question you cannot cast a superclass to a subclassing because a subclassing adds members that the superclass doesn t have

1082507
pop-up	dialog
when a user clicks the search button a user control containing a search form should be displayed in a jquery ui dialog pop-up

1082528
int	boolean
but it should be possible for simple types like int or boolean

1082632
icomparable	compareto
then instead of using the operator you could use the compareto method of the icomparable interface

1082649
keydown	keyup
i have just discovered that while i can capture keypress in javascript i cannot seem to capture keyup or keydown in javascript

1082707
libusb	pyusb
on pc side you are using pyusb wich wraps libusb

1082753
children	parent
i m sure it would be a good example for others out there - the statement is trying to pull products that have a many-to-many relationship with product categories and the categories have a hierarchy of parent children

1082771
ready	each
each spring controller has the ability to call an init method you could have each controller add it s name and url to the controller url map in the init methods so it would be ready to use when the controllers go live

1082775
versioning	upgrade
it isn t compulsory to install the full versioning of visual studio 2008 to upgrade to service pack 1

1082869
easymock	jmock
if this is for test purposes you should look at mocking frameworks like jmock and easymock

1082891
width	height
call g.drawimage with the old image and the overload to specify width height

1082901
int	chars
so i m trying to figure out how to use file io to read the numbers into a chars array that i will later convert to int

1082979
for-loop	loops
boldewyn i believe you can also use a for...in loops instead of a regular for-loop to shorten the code a bit

1083028
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
my question is what would be the most painless way to practice these graph algorithms not just limited to bfs but will also come in useful when i want to implement dfs dijkstra floyd-warshall etc

1083034
mouseover	mousemove
but that means the mousemove events will go to the command button so you ll have to have its events do the mouseover actions

1083036
public	protected
a nested class can have private protected and protected internal access modifiers along with public and internal

1083178
mouse	keyboard
however i notice that once the frame is not in focus as it is when its iconized the mouse and keyboard trapping that normally works when the frame app is in focus no longer works

1083178
mouse	keyboard
i am aware that i could write a c++ program to create a message queue hook and trap all mouse and keyboard events at the os level but id rather not roll up my sleeves that far

1083180
postgresql	mysql
i m pretty sure i ll be using sqlite for this project but does anyone think postgresql or mysql could perform better with a pretty big join like this

1083183
pthreads	fork
as for why the kernel can t just find a bunch of free memory well if you want someone to do that work for you either use fork instead or use pthreads

1083185
pthreads	fork
unless you have very good reason to use clone stick with fork or pthreads

1083207
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this should work with safari firefox and opera

1083217
mouseover	mouseout
you could chain the mouseout to the mouseover

1083286
free	malloc
i ll bet 0.02 that it s crashing somewhere inside malloc or free in which case the problem is plain old heap corruption and there are many heap-checker tools available to help you catch it

1083291
imperative	declarative
sql being declarative and set based any workaround you may find that tries to force sql to do imperative row oriented operations is unreliable and may break

1083304
int	double
it can be stored freely int double etc

1083313
unix	solaris
you can then host on either windows or unix linux solaris mac

1083315
coldbox	model-glue
mvc frameworks mach-ii or model-glue because i m familiar with them although i m open to checking out coldbox

1083319
multiplying	subtract
the second is to subtract the integer portion then iteratively multiplying by 10 and again subtract the integer portion until you get zero

1083414
firefox	safari
also i m using both safari and firefox to debug

1083465
stdout	stderr
then you can use tricks to have that .com be a proxy for the stdin stdout stderr and launch the same-named .exe file

1083471
post	get
sendredirect sends a 302 but the correct code to use to transform a post into a get is 303

1083471
post	get
most browsers will treat a 302 just like a 303 if they get it in response to a post however

1083508
int	double
the goal would be to allow one to store int int float or double values in the data type

1083567
versioning	upgrade
if you have an earlier versioning either upgrade or remove in the snippet above

1083610
vb6	vba
in that case you have few options because event handlers cannot be shared in vba vb6

1083671
validationsummary	customvalidator
customvalidator markup you can place this anywhere sensible such as next to the validationsummary control

1083732
webclient	webrequest
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest

1083733
actualheight	actualwidth
yes i ve done this in the past with the actualwidth and actualheight properties both of which are read-only

1083733
width	height
so the view model has width and height properties that are always in sync with the observedwidth and observedheight attached properties

1083733
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
ergo the width and height of the view model is always in sync with the actualwidth and actualheight of the usercontrol

1083749
google-chrome	firefox
you could use the file usercontent.css lying within the directory named google-chrome in your mozilla firefox profiles directory

1083755
google-chrome	safari
in this url i have rounded divs that appear to be rounded in ff3 but on safari and google-chrome the rounded corners are not there

1083769
cart	oscommerce
here is an example application built in delphi which acts as a front end store manager for oscommerce shopping cart

1083773
swt	swing
also swing tutorial or check out swt if you prefer faster and more native looking ui

1083836
dns	spf
the best advice is to ensure you re sending list is clean ip address has a good reputation reverse dns spf records good unsubscribe and bounce handling on the campaigns spam check on content and get recipients to add you to their address book

1083939
photoshop	fireworks
i have tried creating the resource in illustrator photoshop and fireworks

1083939
firefox	safari
the problem is the same on firefox as in safari

1083964
typedef	struct
you would use a typedef so you do not need to specify the struct keyword when declaring variables of that struct

1083980
typedef	struct
in c++ this is not so useful because c++ was designed to make definition of new types easier and more complete than c at least at the beginnings of c++ and the typedef is not even necessary to refer to a previously declared struct or class

1084008
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie6 ie7 firefox google-chrome safari and even in my mobile web browser se p1

1084036
bash	tcsh
i found unix power tools o reilly to be an awesome resource to learn any of the popular shells bash and tcsh are what i use

1084060
post	get
this will make all get request direct requests etc. use the new action and the post request the create action

1084106
inherited	properties
it could inherited from tab control for the bulk of its functionality and properties for the datagrid and whatever else custom you need

1084119
lxml	libxslt	lxml	elementtree	lxml	libxml2	elementtree	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
i typically uses lxml that exposes an elementtree around libxml2 and libxslt

1084126
gif	png
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif

1084130
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
object has four public methods tostring gethashcode gettype and equals

1084136
pecl	pear
also keep in mind any third party libraries extensions pecl pear zend framework drupal wordpress or custom written that you re using that may not work on 5.3 yet for any given reason

1084148
width	margin	margin	text-indent
the width is to allow enough room in the displayed select box when not active the margin does what it always does text-indent is used to feign padding between the left boundary of the select box and the inner-text

1084170
comparator	comparable
sorted would imply ordering according to an implementation of comparable or comparator

1084173
sortedmap	sortedset
sortedmap and sortedset are sorted collections which means that iteration through the collection will happen in a sequence derived from the elements themselves

1084174
public	protected
protected constructors can be useful when you are providing it along with some public overloads to provide some more functionality to derived classes

1084202
post	get
please post the error messages you get they say everything you need

1084205
multiplying	subtract
what you probably want to do is negate the numeric value just multiplying it by -1 or subtract it from 0 as you suggested and reflect that change in the interface you mention a text box

1084290
division	exponent
it might be more efficient to do repeated integral division than to cast to a float perform an exponent then floor and cast back to an integer but the basic idea remains the same

1084301
division	modulo
if you really don t want to do that though you should use modulo which gives the remainder of a division

1084316
serializable	deserialization
see serializable and deserialization to learn the differences between this class and the datacontractserializer

1084323
sorting	filtering
if all you re looking for is sorting and filtering then just use a dataset and create a dataview referring to the table you ve filled in

1084327
spaces	linefeed
the problem with textarea component is that it works in plain text with no html tags included so you need to replace each linefeed with a br and each additional whitespace with the white spaces html entity

1084338
cout	cin
the easiest is probably to move out of a direct cin cout loop and to use std getline instead

1084395
min	max
you can also use min and max

1084437
division	modulo
however for your specific task of removing leading and trailing digits these calculations modulo and integer division are very simple and much faster than converting the entire number

1084481
post	get
basically the method property defines whether you are doing a http get or http post

1084481
put	get	post	put	post	get
the object you put into the data property is the data that will be added as a query string in an http get or added as the message body for a http post

1084492
stdout	stderr
the technique uses tricks to have that .com be a proxy for the stdin stdout stderr and launch the same-named .exe file

1084514
mouse	keyboard
i d like to write a program able to use other programs by taking control of the mouse keyboard and being able to see what s on the screen

1084544
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine in google-chrome but in firefox when i try to start dragging it fails

1084607
post	get
get to grips with get and post requests the http protocol why many web applications need rdbmss etc

1084629
pdfrenderer	icepdf
as well as pdfrenderer there is icepdf and jpedal

1084656
lisp	scheme
have a look at peter norvig s tutorial on good lisp programming style though you would have found the answer to your particular question in any scheme lisp book

1084686
int	chars
that last reason doesn t hold so strong for c# anymore where a chars is 16 bits and not implicitly convertable to int

1084729
subtraction	addition	operands	decrement
the increment ++ and decrement -- operators as well as the addition assignment + and subtraction assignment - operators are overloaded for a variety of numeric types and they perform the extra step of converting the result back to the operands s type when returning the result

1084744
tabs	tabpanel
i have a rich tabpanel with several tabs in it

1084755
ant	maven
many of the reasons they re against maven are basically it s not ant or i can t do x like i can in ant

1084773
mouse	keyboard
it lets you fake keyboard and mouse input nicely at a system level ie not just posting events to a single application

1084794
required	placeholder
default is just that - a placeholder and no links are required for it.

1084816
ubuntu	linux
update i m seeing the same problem on my linux machine ubuntu 8.10 running git 1.6.3.2 and svn 1.5.1

1084839
many-to-many	one-to-many
i know this doesn t address the error you re getting but i d suggest using three one-to-many relationships instead of one many-to-many relationship

1084846
tcplistener	tcpclient
but i have to use ssl as well and the only way to do that seems to be to use a tcplistener and then grab a tcpclient from the begin end accept method and then get the underlying network stream and layer the ssl stream on it using the beginauthasserver

1084860
post	put
i put up a detailed post on how to do this a couple weeks ago so i ll just refer you to it

1084861
firefox	safari
it does work in firefox and safari it does not work in ie

1084968
punctuation	words
if i give you a sentence the dog rover ate his food. the first thing you do is break it up into words and punctuation

1084975
lisp	scheme
writing a scheme lisp processor is a project of this type

1084997
width	height
however when i access the position top left and dimension height width properties of the form it would appear they are wrong

1085080
itunes	iphoto
i will be changing the view with some buttons at the side as show in iphoto itunes and generally most mac apps out there

1085088
public	protected
i also didn t know if the point was to make the profile method behave like ruby s public protected private keywords

1085111
mouse	keyboard
if you are comfortable with pascal a really powerful keyboard mouse screen-reading program is scar name scar it can do ocr bitmap finding color finding etc

1085125
getter	setter
each member in the model must be a property with a getter and a setter

1085151
accessor	properties
obtaining a properties value using the get accessor would have an observable side effect

1085153
int	double
boxing is the term for turning a value type int double float guid etc. into a reference type system.object system.string etc.

1085201
emacs	jedit
you can use a modular system like jedit or emacs

1085237
vsto	add-in
as i know we can use com add-in or vsto to develop our own plugin for ms outlook

1085282
cvs	svn
you can t beat the shell integration you get with svn cvs git etc

1085282
vim	emacs
vim emacs but never under-estimate

1085288
chown	chmod
i want to give people the option to use chown and chmod

1085290
multiplying	multiplication
but convolving is the same as multiplying in the fourier domain so repeated application of the filter is like repeated multiplication in the fourier domain and here you can see that things will either blow up or go to zero

1085306
width	height
when jquery is animating either the height or width of an element it will automatically set overflow hidden on the element while the animation is happening

1085335
cvs	svn
the sql to create your stored procedures should be in source files as part of a project in some source control system cvs svn etc.

1085340
chown	chmod	chown	passwd
full chown chmod in a web app is equivalent to just pasting your root passwd on the page

1085351
concave	convex
the maintaining the topology of the features block of colour gradients convex and concave curve will be more important the exact size shape and colour of those features

1085356
ironruby	ironpython
i d be astonished if that was the case in an overall system that supports dynamic languages as .net now does such as ironruby and ironpython -- maybe if c# won t let you go around accessibility limitations via introspection the dynamic languages could serve

1085379
ctrlp	auto-indent
vim will do auto-indent and some autocomplete ctrlp

1085477
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
perhaps you should look at the php commands chmod chown chgrp and fileperms

1085498
gmail	hotmail
hi can somebody tell me how to import all of my contacts from gmail yahoo hotmail and so on

1085528
hide	show
as we all know there is no way to hide or show some tab pages on the tab control

1085561
range	max
edges above 2 the max radio range have been culled from the list

1085584
x86	64bit
c# - how to get program files x86 on windows vista 64bit

1085609
accessor	ivar
if it isn t the above it is probably either specified an observer on an ivar or are using object serialization and don t actually have an accessor method for it and thus throws an exception

1085641
put	get
and how to get console out put from this class

1085680
maven	pom.xml
it is now possible to import maven projects directly without mvn eclipse eclipse and it turns out that the root pom.xml is also imported as a project which is excactly what i wanted

1085697
ant	maven
i made ant script for it that can be used in maven

1085764
post	put
i was thinking i could generate a random number check if there is a current session tag with that number push all the post data into a an object put the object into ses randomid obj

1085788
networkstream	sslstream
then i created an sslstream object by using the constructor that takes networkstream bool remotecertificatevalidationcallback

1085803
firefox	safari
this works fine in safari and mozilla firefox

1085853
folder	directory
this technique will only work with inline code if you wish to compile your code then you would create the site as normal and then add an application folder within the virtual directory of that particular site for example my site is called intranet

1085873
free	malloc
however this tends to trigger crashes on windows since it s not unlikely to happen that the object is new ed in the plugin dll but later due to a deref call on the shared pointer deleted in the main application - and afaik this malloc free mixup is a no-no on windows

1085888
post	get
if i get some time i will try and post a small groovy script for doing the same

1085896
scrollable	panels
also if i were to build such a control does there exist a convenient built-in control for making like a list of custom controls that is scrollable - maybe panels

1085902
filesystems	ntfs
for example you d be much better off building something that supports fat32 rather than ntfs because the former is a much much simpler filesystems

1085932
post	put
another option would be to build a usercontrol that is able to display one post and put that control into a vb.net repeater control which ships with the vb.net powerpack

1085936
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard actions to windows

1086016
chunked	transfer-encoding
all of them mentioned that the long-life http response should be transfer-encoding chunked

1086073
cvs	svn
the vcscommand plugin provides global ex commands for manipulating version-controlled source files and it supports cvs svn and some other repositories

1086106
folder	directory
when you create your own custom virtual folder and set it inside the iis it s highly possible that the user account who run the application pool of that particular iis virtual directory is currently set to nt authority network service

1086107
spweb	spsite
take note of the need to dispose of partially unmanaged objects such as spsite and spweb if you take this route

1086118
button	checkbox
on the other hand if you need some functionality that is not available in the datagridview for example you would like 5 different button at the bottom of the tweet and 3 checkbox on the right then the custom control would do you better because you could build practically everything you wanted

1086187
int	double
the only constructors being called implicitly are value types structs like int and double

1086217
tripledes	rsa
just so that you know - rsa is asymmetric tripledes and rijndael are symmetric

1086250
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1086253
ienumerable	ienumerator
you don t need to use ienumerator and ienumerable although it generally is a very good idea to do so

1086264
camping	ruby-on-rails
i like _why s camping now maintained by the community which has to be the lightest of them all for recent info v1.9 see the camping links on the camping wiki eleanor mchughe s going off the ruby-on-rails or v 1.5 jeremy mcanally s going camping slides or these camping screencasts this camping podcast and nathaniel talbott s why camping matters but read the camping mailing list for current version info changes and evolution and try the latest blog example

1086264
merb	camping
there s also a ruby-forum discussion about camping and merb that also covers alternative orms

1086288
uitableview	uisearchbar
first make sure to add the uisearchbar to the tableheaderview of the uitableview so that it gets scrolled with the table s content and isn t fixed to the top of the view

1086311
lxml	beautifulsoup
that looks fine and beautifulsoup is useful for this although i personally tend to use lxml

1086339
int	boolean
if the number of boolean attributes does not change you could put them into a single int field and mask them as mike chaliy suggests

1086343
int	boolean
i have seen people doing things like having a 32-bit int field thus allowing them to store their 17 boolean values using bitmasking and leaving some room for additional fields

1086366
for-loop	arrays
just build the arrays in your for-loop

1086373
min	max
i m wondering if during the time elapsed between the first call to get_time and the next oracle s internal counter rolled over from its max value and its min value resulting in an overflow when trying to subtract one from the other

1086478
ssl	https
if i configure the four ports http and https to have different values and none of the https values is the value of the ssl port configured and certified in iis i get the following exception on service call but both services are started in the wcf service host

1086478
ssl	https
if i configure the first service to use the ssl port 443 then only the second service is started the one with the wrong https port

1086500
getter	setter
it s better practice to initialize variables via constructors and getter and setter method of the class

1086540
width	height
for instance assuming you only care about properties you might have an array stylename width height ... and you can maybe use the array like this

1086615
asihttprequest	cfnetwork
otherwise i d recommend using the asihttprequest library which provides a great high-level api to the cfnetwork apis including the ability to use self-signed certificates

1086661
firefox	safari
it renders the intended way in firefox although as expected its not good on safari

1086670
jar	war
the solution i use is to put only web resources into the war and to put the war s class files into a seperate jar inside the ear

1086693
integer	unsigned
this may or may not help you but in your c# code you use uint32 32-bit unsigned integer for tssl_connect.sock and in the sslclt_connect prototype whereas the delphi header defines it as integer 32-bit signed integer

1086695
post	get
reason being is my bank requires that i open there payment gateway and pass my values by post and not get

1086706
dbml	edmx
one such tool is my add-in huagati dbml edmx tools

1086735
post	get
one idea is to get and save all posted data 1 on the captcha page and then recreate a middle white page with this form data and automatically make a new post to the previous page

1086904
hide	show
but basically you can bind some value trough a valueconverter to the uielement.visibility property if what you want is to hide show any uielement

1086919
vsto	add-in
they range from building a macros in outlook using vba to building full blown vsto add-in

1086950
udp	tcp
i need to intercepts all tcp udp packets and potentially filter or substitute them with new ones

1086981
libpcap	wireshark
wireshark uses libpcap

1086990
width	height
it is important to give each panel a width and height otherwise it will only show one element in the coverflow or no elements at all

1087013
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
with wpf and wanting to grow with the window the magical starting point is to set the margin to 0 and avoid setting width and height

1087046
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
you have to import the avfoundation and in an object that stays loaded the whole time your app runs or view or the app delegate you have initialize a avaudioplayer give it a file to play and set it to preparetoplay it.

1087054
put	get
i get an error saying can t find dependent libraries unless i put the path of the other dll on the system path variable i m on windows xp

1087066
calloc	malloc
the intent is to have operator new implementable by calling malloc or calloc so the rules are substantially the same

1087186
post	get
note get it from the latest download package for tswa sp1 not the ctp linked in the blog post

1087218
put	get
put an id on the tag you want to get its data from

1087227
ssl	https
i need to write a script that connects to a bunch of sites on our corporate intranet over https and verifies that their ssl certificates are valid

1087227
ssl	https
python by default just accepts and uses ssl certificates when using https so even if a certificate is invalid python libraries such as urllib2 and twisted will just happily use the certificate

1087237
int	double
they re more like int with a scale than float double types

1087315
inherited	properties
since the .text properties is on a control inherited from webcontrol it can be set read manipulated during any of the events following the control s load event wherever whenever you load the control inside the page but the text cannot be directly read used manipulated by the code-behind without referencing some other control to get to it like a containing div s innerhtml properties

1087360
post	get
i want to get an edit token via a http post command

1087421
mockito	easymock
you need to provide expectations for each method that is called with the expectation on any concrete methods calling the super method - not sure how you d do that with mockito but i believe it s possible with easymock

1087478
range	max
the maximum number of steps possible the max range essentially is different from row to row though i highly doubt any of them will get into the hundreds so in 99.9 of cases the maximum should never exceed 20 or 30 and i d be surprised if it ever got anywhere close to 100

1087501
subclass	abstract-class
instead i suggest defining a non-abstract subclass of your abstract-class in your test

1087523
implements	sealed
here is some code that appears to work for me to implements your own commandcolumnseries i stole a lot of it from the source for the columnseries sealed class

1087556
swt	swing
you realize of course that swt is not portable the way that swing is

1087567
width	height
this is called sof0 and contains height width bit depth etc

1087567
width	height
then there will be two bytes for height two for width and a single byte for the number of components

1087574
put	get
according to the kigg sample mvc web project you can get it from the official asp.net they put extension utility classes with a subfolder under root

1087625
getattr	setattr
for many tasks i ve seen people ab- use exec and eval for python s powerful built-ins such as getattr and setattr indexing into globals c provide preferable and in fact often simpler solutions

1087637
width	height
also the components will all the be the same height and width

1087676
width	height
i created a new view xib in xcode and in the size inspector the width and height are disabled and grayed out to 320 by 460

1087717
decoder	encoder
for exmaple maybe you have an image encoder decoder

1087734
multiplying	subtract
to get the minutes figure subtract the whole number portion so you only have the amount after the decimal then multiplying the fraction by 60 to get the minutes

1087775
ready	each
i was thinking about writing an application that for each file in the site searches all the other files to see if they referenced it then corrected any casing errors but thought on the off chance it may already be done and i can just download a ready made solution

1087844
swt	swing
in java desktop land you have 2 major choices swing or swt

1087883
stdout	stderr
data from stdout and stderr until

1087885
children	parent
now when a parent component moves its children just move along without any properties changing or move events being dispatched on the children

1087950
folder	directory
if your wanting to use the compressed folder option you will need to modify the directory flags on the directory handle

1087986
google-chrome	firefox
then after you have checked the stuff josh and malcolm above has told you to check and fix make sure it works with firefox and google-chrome

1088010
put	get
although it does work when i put the html files out of views folder but i get page not found 404 when i put those in views folder

1088010
folder	directory
i am also unable to browse the views folder by setting directory browsing option in iis

1088012
width	height
create a new image with the same width and height but a different image types

1088033
hash	salt
at least you have to use a salt for generating the hash

1088043
hash	salt
to securely authenticate a user via hash code so you avoid sending the actual password across the wire first generate a random single-use salt value on the server

1088043
hash	salt
send this salt value to the client and generate a hash code from the salt version of the password the user has input

1088043
hash	salt
send the resulting hash code to the server and compare it with a hash code generated from the salt version of the stored password

1088043
hash	salt
the reason for the single-use salt is to prevent anyone listening to the conversation from capturing the hash code of the users password which when you use hash code comparison is just as good as having the password itself

1088046
put	get
the deploy directory contains only those executables and dlls that are needed for the actual app ie testing dlls don t get put there

1088052
hash	salt
note that in order for this to be secure the hash must be salt with a string provided by the server and the string must be unique for every request

1088129
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller does not neither does the uitabbarcontroller

1088209
firefox	safari
interestingly enough it hits the error event in ie but not firefox safari and the rest and i don t know why this code works great and renders my data just fine in firefox and the rest

1088272
versioning	upgrade
a little late but i just upgrade from isapi rewrite versioning 2 to versioning 3

1088387
vim	emacs
given what i just said what productivity advantages does vim or even emacs have over a gui text editor aside from that fact that it is installed on every computer

1088387
vim	emacs
i d like specific tasks that are better faster on vim emacs or that are just not possible with existing gui text editors

1088417
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	h.264	webm	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
as well there s some fight over which codecs to support for the videos - firefox google-chrome and opera all support both ogg theora and webm while safari and ie are shipping h.264 though either can support theora webm with proper codecs

1088417
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
to add support for ie 8 and earlier and other downlevel clients like older versions of firefox safari opera etc just put your standard video embed code inside the video tag below the source elements

1088429
mouse	keyboard
i actually ended up going lefty on my mouse at work because it let me move my hand less to reach for the mouse my keyboard at home doesn t have a number pad so i can keep it on the right

1088439
mouse	keyboard
basically with a small lead-time you can learn ten or twenty keyboard shortcuts that mean you don t have to keep shifting your hand to grab the mouse

1088460
put	get
here are some of the errors i get the whole stacktrace is too big to put here

1088485
accessor	properties
at least one properties accessor if

1088540
organization	naming
organization s own internal naming

1088575
accessor	properties
creating a properties and assigning it outputfolder simply results in another item group not a properties i can reference with the accessor

1088585
width	height
a column width or row height of 0.0 is an indicator of whether or not the range is hidden

1088600
superclass	subclassing
i have a table of electronic devices that serves as a generic superclass and then separate subclassing tables for phones laptops cameras etc

1088626
unix	sunos
we have a small daemon application written in c for a couple of various unix platforms this problem is happening in sunos 5.10 that basically just opens up a serial port and then listens for information to come in via said port

1088657
maven	pom.xml
write a maven pom.xml build file for each project

1088705
vim	emacs
a tabbed interface is not as nice as the windowed interface that vim emacs give you

1088728
public	protected
protected is somewhere between public everyone can access and private only class internal can access

1088743
coalesce	isnull
the coalesce is ansi standard and isnull is not

1088811
versioning	upgrade
in versioning 2.x we are using auto-generated msi packages with major upgrade as recommended by wix3

1088815
gridview	repeater
i currently have a gridview nested withing a repeater the repeater displays the plan in a label and onitemdatabound i call a method to populate the gridview

1088815
gridview	repeater
i m not opposed to handling this a different way as in loose the gridview and or repeater if someone has a better idea

1088850
ubuntu	linux
i usually use putty to connect to my linux box running ubuntu and for some reason the arrow-keys maps to a b c d in insert mode and the whole color support issues

1088854
filtering	grouping
the where clauses of receive are restricted to conversations and conversation grouping and this is as a means to help application leverage the conversation grouping locking concept not to filtering our certain messages

1088865
put	get
so whenever you want to manipulate elements especially a query to get all the elements that have a title you definitely need to put the code around this special event

1088904
post	put
i assume you are responding to a put or post request on your blog post resource

1088906
button	checkbox
it also occurs to me that perhaps what i really want is a button control that looks like a checkbox maybe an invisible button with the usual animated checkbox on top which i bind data to the graphic of

1088916
hash	md5
so is there anyway to get md5 to hash via a specific key that would be consistent to both

1088918
pop-up	dialog
i have a button which event is handled serverside and when i click lthis button i want to pop-up a dialog where i can show my custom web control or any web control lets make it generic from the start

1088933
hash	md5
md5 is not encryption - it s a hash

1088933
hash	md5
md5 is an unkeyed hash function - there is not key in use at all

1088933
hash	md5
you would then md5 the string or file and compare the hash you computed with the hash they sent

1088933
hash	hmac
a hmac is a keyed hash function

1088937
vim	emacs
in my experience the main productivity gains which vim and emacs i m a vim person myself but emacs is surely similiar provide are

1088937
vim	emacs
i don t know why that is or maybe i m just lucky but maybe people who took the barrier of getting accustomed to an old tool like emacs or vim have the right dedication and contact to other people like that

1088937
vim	emacs
maybe it s an indirect effect of these editors but hanging out with other vim or emacs people on irc turned out to be quite interesting since the same people were also quite interested in all kinds of software engineering or computer science issues

1088940
hash	md5
md5 is a hash function and strictly speaking is not used to encrypt a string

1088946
hash	md5
tom s right md5 is just a one-way hash you can t decrypt it

1089025
button	checkbox
the biggest advantage to this would be inspecting each cell for checkbox button etc

1089025
button	checkbox
i m looking for a generic solution whereby i can get the table s dom structure thereby utilizing the table.rows and table.cells that is already done inspect each cell to remove tags i don t want in the excel such as button checkbox etc and write that out to the user with the response type set to excel

1089077
base	fractions
the values that can be finitely represented depend on the number of unique prime factors of the base so base 30 2 3 5 can represent more fractions than base 2 or base 10

1089088
versioning	upgrade
as well it handles things like flash player versioning detection player upgrade downloads and displaying alternative content if the user does not have want flash

1089142
dictionary	map
the primary structural difference between them is that dictionary relies on chaining maintaining a list of items for each hash table bucket to resolve collisions whereas hashtable uses rehashing for collision resolution when a collision occurs tries another hash function to map the key to a bucket

1089158
hash	md5
use a persisted md5 hash column

1089194
int	chars
it is 3 reads for an int the depth of the b-tree built on an int column vs 4 reads for a chars the depth of the b-tree built on an chars column

1089204
integer	unsigned
according to the 1999 iso c standard c99 size_t is an unsigned integer type of at least 16 bit see sections 7.17 and 7.18.3

1089204
integer	unsigned
the standard also recommends that size_t shouldn t have an integer conversion rank greater than long if possible ie casting size_t to unsigned long is unproblematic if the recommendation is followed

1089205
gridview	radiobuttonlist
if i have an asp.net radiobuttonlist within a templatefield in a gridview which is tied to a data control i can get databinding on page loading like so

1089261
onkeyup	onkeydown
onkeyup onkeydown and onkeypress are the events to look at

1089341
serializable	deserialization
i only consider using xml if there s some part of the xml ecosystem i need validation transformation automatic serializable deserialization etc

1089349
versioning	upgrade
even if you were to pick only one exact versioning to support and force everybody else to upgrade downgrade it s not true that flash is the same everywhere the flash plugin for ie and flash plugin for everybody else aren t even the same binary and yes it matters they access the network in different ways which was part of the cause of my ie7 f9 bug

1089392
addition	multiplication
in each case the values that we worked with had a finite representation in binary and so the values output by the basic multiplication and addition operations also produced values with a finite representation

1089393
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also don t forget html5 which now has integrated video element supported by major browsers including firefox google-chrome and safari

1089414
uiview	caanimation
this means to do what you want you would at least have to try a uiview animation block and most likely actually create a caanimation

1089427
children	parent
parent children

1089442
stdout	stderr
being able to redirect stdout stderr of arbitrary commands to those same log files

1089443
jar	war
you can try using jruby to package it up in a jar or war

1089464
decimal	ieee
for 6.1 we must use another representation like decimal representation or ieee 854 that allows base 2 or base 10 for the representation of floating-point values

1089490
folder	directory
i was then hoping to add an include directory pointing to that folder relative to the workspace but eclipse won t do that it seems to only want to point to thinks in home user workspace myprojectnamehere

1089507
g++	gcc
i would suggest installing cygwin and gcc g++

1089512
min	max
obviously you d want to package this up in a function that drew the plot using open close min max tuples and you probably wouldn t want to randomly assign your opening and closing prices

1089514
put	get
you get out of it what you put into it

1089548
put	get
and pretty rarely you ll get a fixup error when the address of foo doesn t fit where the linker wants to put it

1089552
cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
xcode supports use of version control - cvs svn and perforce

1089552
cvs	svn
but for a new project you should be using svn instead of cvs anyway

1089570
maven	pom.xml
i am downright annoyed because the quartz release i m importing does not have a proper pom.xml file deployed maven repo

1089584
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
i ve got an application a daemons inside library startupitems to be precise running as root that occasionally launchd another process using systemd open applications myappname.app

1089585
nexus	artifactory
you can run repository manager such as artifactory or nexus locally

1089641
ivar	subclassing
you should probably subclassing uitableviewcell and make the mapviewcontroller an ivar of that class

1089644
folder	directory
the user s directory is now c programdata myfolder and that folder is created as read only genius

1089645
mkmapview	mkannotationview
using mkannotation mkpinannotationview and creating a custom mkannotationview in an mkmapview

1089649
jsf	seam
i am running a seam web application with richfaces for the jsf implementation

1089649
jsf	seam
the problem i am having is seam jsf do not like the redirect here for some odd reason

1089741
ubuntu	linux
i m a bit new to ubuntu gcc linux so i ve started off like this

1089745
post	get
if you post the specifics of your proc i bet you will get some good suggestions for how to do what you need with a single stored proc call and no cursor

1089749
button	checkbox
to make it run queries serially edit the dataset that runs the sp click the ... button next to the data source dropdown and check the use single transaction checkbox at the bottom

1089804
daemons	launchd
you should make your daemons a proper launchd daemons stick a plist in library launchdaemons

1089804
daemons	launchd
you probably shouldnâ t be launchd the second daemons directly from your daemons

1089804
daemons	launchd
however as i said you shouldnâ t be launchd your second daemons using open or launchd services

1089804
daemons	launchd
for example itâ s often best to have your launchd daemons launchd on demand rather than have them running continuously

1089900
uicontrol	uibutton
uibutton and uiimageview are distinct subclasses of uiview and uibutton is a subclass of uicontrol so the only things they have in common are uiview methods

1089901
maven	pom.xml
maven already such that a pom.xml

1089920
post	get
on the post back of view 2 you then do updatemodel wizard object again to get the 1st 2 fields and then the email

1089920
hide	show
what you can do is use javascript to hide and show elements of the wizard so that all entry fields are on the same page

1089939
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
use a sqldatasource instead of a linqdatasource and put your select statement into the selectcommand property

1089953
folder	directory
to the .profile or maybe the .bashrc - i m not at my mac now and cannot check which one file in my home directory and put all those scripts into the bin folder in my home directory

1090021
getter	setter
traditional object or bean with getter setter

1090027
put	get
the best optimization you can get is to not put the test into a function

1090060
gdal	ogr
geos for the geometry model and gdal ogr for a spatial data abstraction library which supports rasters and vectors

1090060
wgs84	utm
to find distances in meters you can transform from wgs84 to something that uses meters like utm

1090123
put	get
if you put in the corresponding html and used you would get your newlines

1090158
awt	swing
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing -

1090158
awt	swing
some people prefer the native look of awt over swing s not quite there platform skins

1090158
awt	swing
there are better 3rd party native looking skins than swing s implementations btw lots of people preferred using awt s filedialog over swing s filechooser because it gave the platform file dialog most people were used to rather than the weird custom swing one

1090191
disk	ram
there are better ways to scale a web app than moving to c++ and most of them involve reducing the time your script is waiting for data from the db or disk such as sharding your db or moving data into a ram cache

1090202
width	height
problems encountered using screen.availheight and screen.availwidth as the height and width params in window.open causes the browser size to include the taskbar and positioning at 0 0 ignores the possibility of the taskbar being up there

1090210
hide	show
then just iterate over the returned array to do the show hide logic

1090238
post	get
this is what i did when i had to develop a midlet twitter app that calls a wcf service to get friend updates post tweets etc.

1090361
int	boolean
public deflater int level boolean nowrap

1090385
width	height
i want to change the view size for iphone 3.0 but i find that in ib size position section the width and height for view was set as fixed values

1090393
stateless	stateful
using a creation hook here isn t really the right way to go because you are trying to add stateful data and those hooks are really for stateless behavior

1090430
gridview	detailsview
this issue is somewhat confusing compared to other controls and applies to gridview and detailsview controls

1090438
vbscript	jscript
to quote the feature list vbscript jscript delphiscript c++script or c#script. note it says c++script not c++

1090441
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
above code worked for ie7 ie6 firefox 3 google-chrome opera 10beta but not safari 4

1090455
pascal	delphi
most of the multithreaded work i have done has been in c c++ python or delphi object pascal

1090519
folder	directory
what i m trying to do is if the files already exist in the directory where the files are being dropped i want to rename the files folder being copied in ahead of time so that there s no collision

1090573
post	put
use whatever client side language you want a java app flex etc. and push to the server with http put no flex or post

1090573
put	get	post	put	post	get
my application does something similar to the above--we regulate both up post and put and get down stream bandwidth

1090604
postgresql	mysql
i want to know which database is more secure mysql or postgresql

1090613
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

1090621
dreamweaver	fireworks	photoshop	fireworks
at work i see one colleague designing a site in photoshop fireworks i see another taking this data slicing it up and using dreamweaver to rebuild the same from scratch

1090621
photoshop	fireworks
i know that photoshop can output a tables based html and fireworks will create divs with absolute positioning

1090621
width	height
photoshop s tables by themselves are pretty much useless i agree but surely we can take this data and then select a group of cells and say right this is a text div overflow auto or these cells are an image block style it with the same height width as the selected area

1090637
debian	centos
i can tell you that debian centos and zend server all use this option by default

1090658
postgresql	mysql
and as far as security is concerned well it is mostly in your hands than in mysql or postgresql

1090663
sorting	grouping
sometimes you may not want additional roundtrips to a database especially if you want fast response times when grouping sorting

1090726
button	checkbox
besides id s won t work for checkbox and radio button because you ll probably have several controls with the same name but a different value while an html element s id attribute has to be unique in your document

1090800
implements	extends
by extends the application class and implements it as a singleton you get an object that will exist whenever any of your application components exist providing a centralized place to store and transfer complex object data between application components

1090830
mp3	wav
im reading a audio file for ex wav mp3 etc and get a

1090838
cvs	svn
it will be used by extremely non technical people on windows so i have ruled out svn cvs git etc

1090867
punctuation	words
i used instead of s incase the words is followed by some punctuation

1090886
division	subtraction
you will want to take care to ensure that the operands to subtraction and division are popped off the stack in the correct order

1090887
cvs	svn
if you do then be aware that nearly all source control systems like cvs svn git etc

1090945
integer	unsigned
this meant that a 32-bit unsigned integer could only represent a span of time less than 829 days

1090945
integer	unsigned
later the system time was changed to increment every second which increased the span of time that could be represented by a 32-bit unsigned integer to around 136 years

1090953
put	get
for a start flexibility around where to put the iis apps is seriously limited you get one virtual dir and the user can only choose the name you cant have multiple instances

1090953
pop-up	dialog
ultimately you can add as many custom steps as you like and they can pop-up dialog and whatever they like

1090962
getter	setter
in particular for use with xmlserializer it must have a public parameterless constructor and all the properties must be public with both getter and setter

1090981
comparator	comparable
the reverse order comparator is simply going to be flipping the sign of the output from the actual comparator or output from comparator on the comparable objects being inserted and i would therefore imagine it is very fast

1091022
post	get
i do not need the proxy to simulate logging in instead the login page html should be displayed to the user normally and all the cookies and http get post data to flow through the proxy to the server so the login should be authentic

1091063
superclass	subclassing
basically you use the new modifier when the subclassing method has nothing to do with the superclass method

1091072
getter	setter
as i see it the setter and getter of the class has to be clean of all extra logic as the jpa implementation uses these to build up the objects

1091072
getter	setter
would it be better if the generic setter and getter be private for jpa and the classes would have a separate public transient api meant for the developers

1091073
try-catch	exception-handling
if you are writing a constructor which could throw an exception-handling you had better make sure you clean up anything you need to by using using or try-catch block

1091119
bazaar	git
i would recommend you one of the distributed version controls out there like mercurial git bazaar monotone and so on

1091127
processors	hyperthreading
increment decrement operations on 32-bit or less integer variables on a single 32-bit processors with no hyperthreading technology are atomic

1091127
processors	hyperthreading
on a processors with hyperthreading technology or on a multi-processor system the increment decrement operations are not guaranteed to be executed atomicaly

1091144
dreamweaver	aptana
no cms but a light weight tool you have a person or two who are comfortable with the basics of html you site is mostly static and it is already built but you need to update - you can consider any number of tools from yes it is true dreamweaver aptana visual studio webexpres

1091156
disk	ram
the prices start out at 0â for the 4â gibyte disk 1â gibyte ram 1 cpu version

1091156
monticello	gemstone
for example the gemstone engineers have created an adapter that allows you to load monticello squeak s version control system packages into gemstone s also they generally make sure that seaside runs.

1091156
disk	ram
in gemstone all vms in a cluster share the same object memory and it lives on disk not in ram

1091179
post	get
if the website whose html code you want to see only supports web login as an authentication method you will need to simulate login by sending a username password via post get as the case may be

1091179
kerberos	ldap
if the website will let you authenticate yourself in other ways like ldap kerberos etc then you should do that

1091184
google-chrome	firefox
this is work in firefox well but doesn t work in google-chrome

1091207
getter	setter
literature about jpa calls them data access objects daos ideally the jpa business objects are just pojos plain old java objects with getter and setter that don t have any logic and the daos implement operations like

1091237
stdout	stderr
you have to consume both the program s stdout and stderr concurrently to avoid blocking scenarios

1091271
explode	substr
if your code uses substr a lot then i suspect that it ll just cause your memory requirements to explode

1091425
google-chrome	firefox
the problem seems to be with on firefox because it works on both google-chrome and ie

1091465
ubuntu	linux
i ve set up teamcity on a linux ubuntu box and would like to use it for some of python django projects

1091475
accessor	properties
yes the properties class itself provides accessor methods for convertions

1091478
addclass	removeclass
the original example was wrong as the elements in the collection are regular objects and as such they don t have the removeclass and addclass methods

1091513
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
tested on firefox 3.0 ie 6 safari 3.1 and opera 9.50 on windows xp pro sp3

1091518
gif	png
notice that it doesn t have an extension gif png jpeg but it s mimetype is set properly image gif image png image jpeg

1091519
explode	implode
an alternative is using implode and explode

1091530
rss	feed
i want to khnow is there any way we crawl a rss feed then customize the parse data so that index can hv different fields from rss

1091530
rss	feed
suppose the rss feed hav a field source in item

1091544
sorting	filtering
it has all keyboard support in it you can use paging sorting filtering etc

1091549
width	height
so you should better use the available window width height

1091557
pop-up	dialog
i receive them as expected from dialog buttons toolbar buttons accelerators and pop-up menus but i do not receive them from the main menu

1091574

1093958
public	protected
you can think of c++ as having a very primitive access control system - either you can access all members friend or member function or you can access only public members everything else except... or you can access public and protected members ...special rules for inheritance

1093958
public	protected
on the other hand clearly friend can be used to completely break encapsulation by naming every other class you can think of as your friend like making all your members public or package protected in java or making all your members public in c++

1093974
innodb	myisam
if i must switch to innodb - how do i configure innodb so that it behaves as similar to myisam as possible think no transactions logical file structure etc.

1094008
width	height
you could wrap that div in another div that maintains the proper width height to keep the layout consistent

you may ask then what is different between a type defined by using the class keyword or struct keyword or typedef â but that is a matter for another discussion

1094649
intersect	contains
the two queries will produce the same results but there may be a difference in performance as the first query may perform slower than the second query in some instances when table 1 contains only a subset of the elements in table 2 as the left join will be executed first - and only then intersect with table1

1094655
matplotlib	scipy
i know that scipy has some signal processing tools for wavelets in scipy.signal.wavelets and a chart can be drawn using matplotlib but it seems i can t get it right

1094661
extjs	smartgwt
the difference being that if you run an extjs gwt application in hosted mode and attach your debugger you can see what extjs gwt is doing but with smartgwt you ll just see lots of idispatch calls where it disappears into native javascript where your debugger won t be able to follow

1094682

i m using the dataset datatable dataadapter architecture to mediate between the database and my model objects which have their own backing they aren t backed by a datarow

1095033
google-chrome	firefox
i see the same thing as validome.org with firefox google-chrome and wfetch--that last of which blindly reports the text obtained from the socket similar to curl or wget

1095042
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox opera and google-chrome the center pane has the intended scrolling behavior when the class list exceeds the height the center pane has a scroll bar

1095045
firefox	safari
so for example you would create an application on the iphone that has the embedded safari browser however any website the user visits with this browser wouldn t know you were on safari on the iphone it would think you are on something like safari on a pc or even ie firefox

1095050
getter	setter
i don t see how there can possibly be any harm in defining getter and setter

1095056
getter	setter
if you know you are changing the value from outside the class and only then provide a setter if you don t know make the variable private and if you need access later maybe provide a getter or a setter

1095056
getter	setter
having a getter and a setter without thinking about it for every member breaks encapsulation and is not a good design choice

1095066
getter	setter
many times have i been saved from the pain of rewriting a class just because i left a getter or a setter open to overriding

1095070
getter	setter
it depends on what you use your getter and setter for

1095070
getter	setter
in that respect i really use getter and setter as an interface layer between this class and other classes that might need access to its data

1095070
getter	setter
i tend to write my internal code such that it knows how to handle data private to this class so accessing it with its own getter and setter is generally unnecessary and undesired

1095070
getter	setter
it all depends on how you use your getter and setter though

1095074
getter	setter
my rule of thumb is that if they do anything more complex than just set or return the value use the setter getter

1095086
getter	setter
i would say that using getter and setter internally is not an anti-pattern or a pattern

1095091
hash	md5
to handle that i d name each file there with by appending the date and username to the original file name and taking the md5 or sha1 hash of that string

1095116

1095120
getter	setter
have getter and setter

1095135
getter	setter
it sounds to me like some people are interpreting this question as being about getter and setter that are used externally

1095150
folder	directory
an alternate approach is to start with a directory in your project with some files drag it into xcode and have it create the folder references for you

1095161

inside the projects directory create another folder called build_output

1095462

mp3	wav
i ve written a windows service in c# that converts wav files into mp3 and then stores them on a remote server

indexers work much like properties they have a getter and a setter and you can perform just about any function in the getter or setter

1096288
codeigniter	cakephp

you need to create a uipickerviewdatasource and uipickerviewdelegate to supply the data and configure the appearance of the picker view

1096436
google-chrome	firefox
i am using mozilla firefox and google-chrome in both its not working

1096439
udp	tcp
android s java.net package is pretty much the same as java s so you can use socket s and serversocket s for tcp communication or a datagramsocket for udp

1096474
installation	upgrade
upgrade an installation to the next

1096596
hash	md5
if the first 64 bits of the md5 constituted a hash with ideal distribution the birthday paradox would still mean you d get collisions for every 2 32 url s

1096612
int	chars
chars string_mult int n

1096632
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
if you do want to do it by hand you would use nsurlconnection to download the data and then whatever you need to parse the output nsxmlparser for xml a bit harder for json

1096643
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
the properties and synthesize make the accessor declarations and implementation for the already declared ivar

1096670
post	get
i need this to encode parameters for get and post requests with yahoo.util.connect

1096670
post	get
it turns out yahoo.util.connect has a setform method to serialize a form but that still leaves me out cold to encode parameters for get requests or the 4th parameter of yahoo.util.connect.asyncrequest to pass post data

1096718
for-loop	loops
you can t possibly get any reasonable performance increase if you change say for-loop to while loops

1096729
onmousedown	onmouseup
you can also solve this independently of the drag function you re using by making the click function be a onmousedown followed by onmouseup

1096741
folder	directory
the root directory but all my index pages are inside their language folder

1096772
nsstring	nsobject
now to give an example of a different use let s say i have an instance of nsobject where i would like to determine if i have an nsstring or nsarray

1096804
free	malloc
in the linux kernel for example the standard memory allocation functions malloc nmalloc free etc

1096942
mouseover	mouseout
i have a menu in a masterpage which uses images and mouseover mouseout events for design purposes

1096962
rss	feed
despite rss is a specific specification some search engines allows rss atom feed to be submitted as simple sitemaps

1096962
rss	feed
however if you submit a rss feed you won t be able to take advantage of all sitemap features such as the priority attribute

1096962
rss	feed
also rss atom feed can only be compared with classic sitemaps

1097028
winpcap	libpcap
winpcap is a windows version of libpcap on unix

1097043
versioning	upgrade
for example it allows you to run different versioning of the database simultaneously on the same system or it allows you to upgrade specific database or automatic storage management instances on a system without affecting other running databases

1097066
int	chars
my gut tells me you ve got either some chars set conversion going on unintentionally or that the corruption is due to moving between raw bytes java byte primitives and java int primitives

1097130
int	chars
on left shift of chars 0xff by 8 and casting it to int we get -256 or 0xffffff00

1097172
width	height
i m getting problem with the rotation of image.i want to create a new image with height equals to width because rotating by 90 degrees.but new image created change dimentions but do not place data in image accurately

1097172
width	height
new height equals to width of origunal image

1097175
width	height
by default this property is usually 0 0 width height

1097185
for-loop	loops
previously i used a for-loop and a do-while loops

1097185
for-loop	loops
i used the for-loop as a counter and the do-while loops as a comparison for end of time

1097213
int	chars
when i first looked at the problem my initial view was that the chars c should be shifted left 8 bits - all 8 bits being discarded the empty chars would then be cast to an int of value 0

1097213
int	chars
therefore the chars c is converted to an int first then shifted left giving the answer you see

1097250
google-chrome	firefox
i tested with a very short snippet if this works in ie firefox and google-chrome - and it does

1097270
inherited	properties
when dealing with custom exceptions i usually inherited from exception and then add some fields properties to my exception class to store some additional info

1097316
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter and its fork kohana

1097324
folder	directory
3 make sure the image s haven t been added multiple times from different directory and or to different group folder

1097365
profiling	debugging
if you don t have sql profiling available you will need to download the source and use debugging to see the actual sql statement that it is trying to execute

1097421
unix	solaris
solaris unix apis are sometimes different than standard unix functions

1097453
implements	extends
create a class that extends implements sprite

1097457
vsto	add-in
the solution found was to create a standard vsto add-in add a ribbon xml to it and then using the commands node to disable buttons

1097479
int	chars
also for the first call of g 1 i should have one call of f chars followed by two calls of f int and for the second call i should get three calls of f chars

1097509
profiling	benchmarking
later if you have performance problems benchmarking and profiling to pin-point where they are occuring

1097511
getter	setter
a property defines a getter and setter the setter is optional interface

1097513
width	height
width 2490px height 3515px so it represents a4 paper in 1 1 measure this is a4 paper resolution if print is to be 300dpi

1097639
udp	tcp
actually doing this by hand has its pitfalls when you have to handle a truncated response and need to switch from udp to tcp

1097729
superclass	subclassing
t needs to be either a subclassing or a superclass of system.int32 for casting to work without any additional operator overloading

1097849
google-chrome	safari
seems like it is dockable in safari and not in google-chrome both based on webkit

1097853
mouse	keyboard
i.e without clicking the mouse i need to invoke this event just by hitting enter on keyboard

1097854
udp	tcp
if it helps apple events are sent on port 3031 via tcp udp

1097891
serializable	deserialization
i m going to correct myself on this marc gravall pointed out the first iteration has an overhead of bulding the model so i ve done some tests taking the average of 1000 iterations of serializable and deserialization for both xml and binary

1097897
terminate	timeout
even in cases where the program is expected to simply wait for a set amount of time i use a wait function on a semaphore with a timeout so that i can end the thread immediately by releasing the semaphore if something somebody asks my program to terminate

1097913
post	get
will post some code when i get this implemented..

1097914
int	chars
you are not asking it to display a value indicated by a chars sized pointer you are asking it to display a hexidecimal int x using the contents of a chars pointer

1097915
int	chars
the expression is of type signed chars and it is being promoted to a signed int while being passed to printf

1097915
integer	unsigned
later on you print it out with x which means unsigned int in hex which causes you to print all the 1 s as opposed to correctly interpret them as a part of a 2 s complement signed integer

1097915
int	double
if the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a prototype the int promotions are performed on each argument and arguments that have type float are promoted to double

1097943
post	get
in the handling for search whether post or get one would normally run the query in the back end and if there was only one search result or one overwhelmingly relevant result you would redirect to that result otherwise to a page showing links to the top n results

1097972
for-loop	arrays
we could put each type in its own arrays and do a good old for-loop and access the objects with indexes but that would mean creating named arrays

1097986
move	drag
in my application i have two sliders and a chart that move when i drag the sliders now when i have the following positions

1098005
free	malloc
flashcards 1297 0xa0690fa0 malloc error for object 0x4fd78a0 pointer being free was not allocated

1098005
free	malloc
flashcards 1297 0xa0690fa0 malloc error for object 0x4fdc200 double free

1098078
rss	feed
as you notice in the comment it just says a rss feed may contain elements not described on this page only if those elements are defined in a namespace

1098080
ienumerable	icollection
because gridviewrowcollection implements the non-generic ienumerable and icollection interfaces which are not strongly-typed like this but its item property is strongly typed and returns a gridviewrow

1098115
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
from this faq it states that all of the latest browsers ie firefox safari and google-chrome support a client retry sometimes called browser retry

1098152
short	base
the code is quite short and well-written so this might make a good base for when you decide what you want to crawl

1098154
versioning	upgrade
as i understand it that is there specifically so that code with statements that have been made illegal in later versioning will survive an upgrade and continue to run

1098211
mp3	wav
can cygwin call a media file like a mp3 or wav file

1098219
width	height
my issue is not so much the scrollbars but that i do not know how to tell the child divs to occupy the width or height remaining to them rather than the full height or width of the parent

1098247
children	parent
it has the tree nodes children collection parent prev next sibling etc

1098259
stdout	stderr
then you can use tricks to have that .com be a proxy for the stdin stdout stderr and launch the same-named .exe file

1098292
getter	setter
the best method seems to be using a hibernate formula mapped to the getter and setter of my bcount attribute in the class a

1098295
min	max
it would be nice to be able to create sub-hashes based on the min max and avg keywords which is why i want to split on the last whitespace of each heading

1098302
folder	directory
this will update your working copy with the contents of the chosen repo path including all the parent directory up to the start of the checkout working copy thus mirroring the folder hierarchy of the repository in your working copy

1098305
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
in your example you can t the 5px margin is added to the bounding box of div#two and div#three effectively making their width and height 100 of parent + 5px which will overflow

1098311
disk	ram
16 bytes so if you have lots of rows and lots of non-clustered indexes the clustered key gets added to each and every entry in each and every non-clustered index using a guid will unnecessarily bloat your space requirements on disk and also in your machine s ram

1098318
width	height
setting a dimension height width and overflow to auto or hidden on the parent element causes it to contain any floated child elements

1098357
int	chars
also for the first call of g 1 i should have one call of f chars followed by two calls of f int and for the second call i should get three calls of f chars

1098357
int	chars
both of int and chars do not have argument dependent lookup an thus all the function calls you do will call f chars after you removed the d++ line

1098357
int	chars
as you see you will have to change from int chars to some user defined type enums or classes too see the effect of lookup in instantiation context

1098363
cpu	processors
i ve already mapped the bottleneck to cpu - but want to optimize the script s performance before taking a hit on processors costs

1098397
unsigned	short
53328 cannot be nicely stored in short use int instead as it allows you to store unsigned value up to 10 9

1098418
sum	coalesce
if your query is returning null you can use one of the coalescing methods coalesce sum ... 0 will return the first non-null value in the list.

1098459
profiler	shark
since you re using a mac you might try apple s shark profiler free download from adc which has java support and apple s performance group has put a fair amount of time into the tool

1098465
hash	salt
if an attacker knows the salt the hash password and the hash algorithm then they can mount a brute-force dictionary attack or rainbow attack

1098480
junit	testng
from junit 4.7 it s now possible to run tests in parallel without using testng

1098499
hash	salt
to successfully attack an account an attacker needs to know the salt for that account and every account s salt should be different the hashing algorightm used and the final stored password hash

1098499
hash	salt
if it s a bad salt too simple or short this can be made much faster because the program can use rainbow lookup tables to match the final stored password hash to the string that was hash and then just subtract the salt

1098502
serializable	deserialization
it might provide some insight into whether the problem is occuring during serializable or deserialization

1098603
division	modulo
i don t use linq to entities but if it supports .year .day .week as well as integer division and modulo then it should be possible to work out the week number using zellers algorithm congruence

1098616
dictionary	map
values in the dictionary you pass to translate as opposed to keys which must be ordinals can be unicode ordinals arbitrary unicode strings or none to remove the corresponding character as part of the translation so it s easy to specify ignore a certain character for sorting purposes map ã to ae for sorting purposes and the like

1098621
folder	directory
caveat if you want to keep these files which you appear to want you must manually remove the .git directory from the submodule folder

1098686
aggregate-functions	sum
the above doesn t work because you can t have the aggregate-functions sum in the where clause

1098702
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

1098733
getter	setter
then you have getter setter without the _ to give them public access

1098737
disk	ram
the big way that a lot of people speed sql up is to give it enough ram so that it never has to write to disk - this will probably be your bottleneck in the end

1098775
post	get
if not please post the results you do get

1098807
move	drag
in map user can move the marker to position it after drag finished it will return the city state and zip

1098815
ssl	https
you can use an http to https proxy or an ssl proxy like stunnel in front of your java server

1098866
maven	cobertura
is there a way to show the icon for maven site documentation if using a freestlye project i switched to a freestyle project rather than maven2 project because of certain bugs - cobertura graph not showing up on front page double unit test coverage counting when running cobertura

1098883
equals	gethashcode
if you are finding that the results are empty when they shouldn t be you might want to check to make sure your image class implements equals and gethashcode properly so that they can be effectively compared

1098897
udp	mtu
given the minimum mtu on the internet is 576 and the size of the ipv4 header is 20 bytes and the udp header 8 bytes

1098933
webrat	cucumber
we re bdd tdd ing with rspec and cucumber which is using webrat for webpage testing

1098944
postgresql	mysql
if you are looking for in-memory datasets for the speed they provide you may want to look at in-memory table storages mysql and postgresql do it and others can be tricked into doing it by setting the table storage space on a ram-disk for instance

1098950
daemons	launchd
i ended up installing a tiny flash policy daemons and setting launchd to provide it inetd-style

1098955
inherited	properties
or if you want to particularly test for properties of the object instance and not inherited properties use hasownproperty

1098965
post	get
if the site is a html and reports can be requested by a simple post or get then urlib urlib2 and cookielib python modules should be enough to fetch an excel document

1098970
put	get
when i run this i don t get an error or anything but the program just ends when put into the command prompt

1099028
des	rsa	des	aes	rsa	aes
cryptographic algorithm aes des rsa md5 ...

1099040
put	get
if i move the code around and put the select from the lead table i get the leads right bot 0 on all clicks

1099073
int	double
unsigned will enable you to have a larger double the size int id column

1099118
ati	nvidia
there will also be offerings from nvidia ati intel etc

1099120
min	max
i want the min startdatetime and max enddatetime for each category

1099120
min	max
using min max with a group by category doesn t seem to work

1099120
min	max
i also tried two inner joins on a sub-query for each min and max statement however it seems to be excluding some records

1099130
interpolation	splines
you can simply sample the finger location at set intervals and then interpolation the sample points using something like a catmull-rom splines

1099147
implements	extends
there is an opportunity to implements the features in ddaviesbrackett s words that we want netbooks to have other than by extends a 1970 s time-sharing os

1099152
persistent	transient
fluency seems to me much more important when your objects are subject to persistent focused attention than when they are transient and ancillary to the core logic

1099192
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
however this seems to be causing my application issues as it can get called several times dealloc didreceivememorywarning and viewdidunload

1099195
rss	feed
it s part of this rss feed

1099249
integer	unsigned
if it was an unsigned 32 bit integer you probably would need to use a long in java to capture all the possible values since java does not have unsigned types

1099263
post	get
this returns a parameter value with a given type post or get which is optional

1099264
post	get
the code gets the value from the get and post data arrays

1099271
post	get
looks like some insane way of making sure you re getting the correct get post vars

1099272
post	get
the code is a function that takes a parameter s name and the http request type it s expected to be found in get or post then looks through the current and and deprecated and request variable arrays for a value matching that name

1099356
migrate	upgrade
there used to be an utility called scptxfr.exe which was part of the standard sql server 7.0 and 2000 install.its original purpose was as part of the upgrade process that allowed sql server 6.5 databases to be migrate to sql server 7.0 and 2000

1099388
hide	show
i am using the jquery method for one of these sections to hide show the section if the use clicks an html link.

1099392
getter	setter
within the quad class definition the scale attribute can be a property with proper getter and setter functions

1099401
temp	tmp
i find myself using w meaning working as a prefix instead of temp or tmp for local variables that are just there to jockey data around like

1099416
put	get
you want to put the reference itself inside in order to get at the whole array

1099464
profiler	shark
shark is a memory profiler that comes with the apple developer tools it can be used with both iphone and mac applications

1099494
profiling	instrumentation
you ll want to use instrumentation to profiling your app

1099499
phpmyadmin	sqlbuddy
phpmyadmin and sqlbuddy have functions to import export the entire database

1099500
slideup	slidedown
i have it working except when my mouse goes over the trail-text area that area bounces slidedown slideup repeatedly a number of times

1099501
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation provides memory profiling tools allocated objects leaks etc... and can connect to the iphone simulator or a remote device to profiling iphone apps

1099520
mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
the problem is that the mouseover and mouseout events bubble upward which means they fire every time the mouseenter or leaves any element within your div

1099529
put	get	post	put	post	get
rest is the idea of having resources addressed with a global identifier the uri in the case of http that are accessed in a crud way using post get put and delete in the case of http .

1099616
hide	show
i have some divs that i am using jquery to hide and show using the toggle function

1099669
awt	swing
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they require tended to require too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash

1099672
udp	tcp
since tcp guarantees packet delivery and thus can be considered reliable whereas udp doesn t guarantee anything and packets can be lost

1099684
opera	safari
i tested this properly recently in a few non-js browsers and disabled js completely in fx safari and opera and got exactly the results i was hoping for

1099692
udp	tcp
that is why these types of applications use udp instead of tcp

1099695
udp	tcp
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp

1099698
udp	tcp
you want to use udp over tcp in the cases where losing some of the data along the way will not completely ruin the data being transmitted

1099712
udp	tcp
since udp does not involve connection establishment there fore applications like dns where connection establishment delays needs to be avoided udp is preferred over tcp

1099718
udp	tcp
udp is also used in situations where the expense of creating a connection and syncing with tcp outweighs the payload

1099732
super	implements
not only is simple to implements it is super simple to implements 2s complement hardware that supports both signed and unsigned arithmetic since they are the same thing

1099734
udp	tcp
udp can be multicasted to multiple hosts whereas tcp cannot do this at all

1099771
inherited	properties
to the variable test you have now constructed a new object that inherited all the properties and methods from the gmap constructor class

1099801
children	parent
parent can have also other children

1099807
udp	tcp
a big thing that people forget is that udp is packet based and tcp is bytestream based there is no guarantee that the tcp packet you sent is the packet that shows up on the other end it can be dissected into as many packets as the routers and stacks desire

1099807
udp	tcp
so the term udp packet makes sense but tcp packet doesnt necessarily

1099807
udp	tcp
tcp has its own re-try and ordering mechanism that is hidden from your application you can re-invent that with udp to tailor it to your needs

1099870
udp	tcp
there are other cases where udp is preferable to tcp

1099870
udp	tcp
one unique case where you would want to use udp instead of tcp is where you are tunneling tcp over another protocol tunnels virtual networks etc.

1099870
udp	tcp
hence one generally prefers to tunnel tcp over udp or some other stateless protocol

1099871
subtract	add
if you just want to get the size of your in-memory state instances at any given time you can use an application-level counter and add subtract every time you create remove an instance of state

1099897
post	get
that suggests to me that you are trying to take advantage of the register_globals feature in php which makes your get and post variables accessible via regular variable names

1099906
udp	tcp
udp when speed is necessary and the accuracy if the packets is not and tcp when you need accuracy

1099923
vsts	tfs
edit the other big benefit of going the fxcop route is that vsts code analysis is fxcop--and i believe though haven t done it first-hand that you can use your custom rules with tfs 2008 s gated check-in feature to help keep non-compliant out

1099963
udp	tcp
i m a bit reluctant to suggest udp when tcp could possibly work

1099963
udp	tcp
the problem is that if tcp isn t working for some reason because the connection is too laggy or congested changing the application to use udp is unlikely to help

1099998
ssl	https
as a side note unless you re very familiar with generating ssl certificates and sending them via https posts you ll save yourself a whole lot of trouble by using the desktop model of communication and not the hosted model

1100009
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
the intellisense only gives me equals gethashcode gettype and tostring as options

1100086
itunes	iphoto
i m thinking about something along the lines of itunes or iphoto where the program manages a whole bunch of files in those cases audio or image files and has a database of metadata so you can organize find those files easily

1100090
integer	unsigned
i am looking for a fast integer only algorithm to find the square root integer part thereof of an unsigned integer

1100096
post	get
the only problem with this is that you re doing a get instead of a post but that s easy to get around

1100109
wadl	wsdl
using soap we can use wsdl but does ror implement wadl or wsdl 2.0 for restful services

1100118
invariantculture	cultureinfo
according to the cultureinfo class documentation an empty string specifies invariantculture

1100125
japplet	jwindow	japplet	jdialog	jwindow	jdialog
for convenience jframe jdialog jwindow japplet and jinternalframe by default forward by default all calls to the add remove and setlayout methods to the contentpane

1100186
maven	pom.xml
maven 3 has a reportplugins configuration section of the maven pom.xml that lets you specified which reports you want to show up

1100211
uiview	subviews	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
uinavigationcontroller from a uiview that is a subviews of the uiviewcontroller mentioned

1100240
mouse	keyboard
depending on your mouse software you should be able to map those keyboard shortcuts to your mouse s back forward buttons

1100243
irix	linux
edit ah irix not linux

1100263
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
python has had several since inception just to name a few zope twisted django turbogears it itself a mix of other framework components pylons a kinda-clone of the rails framework and so on

1100315
onkeyup	onkeydown
use document.onkeypress or the siblings onkeydown and onkeyup

1100319
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome so you begin with a solid base

1100356
postgresql	mysql
i m starting a new opensource project for real estate and wanted to focus on using mysql but would also like to ensure it works in postgresql

1100393
post	get
if you handle post and get data identically then no it doesn t

1100400
post	get
it does if a search engine is crawling the page since they will be making get requests but not post

1100403
post	get
but there are situations where you more or less have to use post instead of get at least for pushing data to the server

1100406
post	get
the client side also matter - as mentioned you cannot bookmark a post d page usually and some browsers have limits on the length of the url for really long get queries

1100409
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 2 and firefox 3.5 do and i assume other browsers as well

1100409
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
tested in ie6 ie7 ie8 ff2 ff3.5 opera 9.6 opera 10 google-chrome 2 safari 4

1100412
union	distinct
i m sorry that i m not able to understand exactly what your issue is but i wonder if your issue stems from the fact that the union operator will eliminate duplicate rows kind of like a select distinct over the combined query

1100423
put	get	post	put	post	get
it works for put as well as post and get

1100424
twig	smarty
there are other template engines such as smarty twig etc. that make the syntax even more concise

1100433
post	get
according to the http rfc get should not have any side-effects while post may have side-effects

post	get
the most basic example of this is that get is not appropriate for anything like a purchase-transaction or posting an article to a blog while post is appropriate for actions-that-have-consequences

1100433
post	get
by the rfc you can hold a user responsible for actions done by post such as a purchase but not for get actions

1100433
post	put
methods such as post put and

1100436
ilist	icollection
however if a class does not provide a value for the contentpropertyattribute and implements any interface of type ilist or icollection a property of name items if present and if of appropriate type ilist is detected trough reflection automatically for the purpose of population trough xaml and that is the case with the class

1100446
post	get
be aware that browsers may cache get requests but will generally not cache post requests

1100454
post	get
by http specifications get is safe and idempotent and post is neither

1100454
post	put
the funny thing is that most people debate the merits of put v post

1100454
post	get
the get v post issue is and always has been very well settled

1100455
pop-up	dialog
more specifically in the image editor dialog accessed from the image property of an existing control i select select from file resource... to pop-up the select resource dialog shown

1100461
filtering	grouping
in the case where it is not filtering the elements are grouping by the value of that condition - the condition is calculated once

1100470
post	get
get and post are quite different really

1100470
post	get
you are right in that normally get is for getting data from the server and displaying a page while post is for posting data back to the server

1100470
post	get
internally your scripts get the same data whether it s get or post so no the server doesn t really care

1100470
post	get
the main difference is get parameters are specified in urls while post is not

1100492
post	get
all get does is post the stuff in the first line of the http request and post post stuff in the body

1100492
post	get
ie a post processes the information then redirects the browser to a get statement to view the new state

1100539
uiview	subviews
these subviews you re talking about are perfect candidates for extraction from your one monolithic uiview

1100543
union	distinct
the two select statements are distinct from each other even though the results are joined together by the union

1100546
public	protected
i know in c# what restrictions access modifiers like private public protected etc

1100552
filtering	grouping
another solution i realized would work is to revers the ordering of my query and perform the grouping before i perform the filtering

1100553
itextsharp	sharppdf
here s the shortlist itextsharp sharppdf report.net nfop and siberix report writer

1100554
union	distinct
the two queries you are union together must be separate and distinct

1100563
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my xcode sdk to versioning 3.1.3 and my iphone os to 3.0

1100569
public	protected
until you discover that it needs to be promoted to protected or public

1100748
visualvm	hprof
to analyse a hprof memory dump you can use quite a number of tools such as eclipse memory analyzer included with eclipse 3.5 galileo visualvm or netbeans

1100797
innodb	myisam
depending on your database storage engine innodb myisam etc you may be able to lock the table while a person is modifing it

1100800
udp	tcp
i work on a product that supports both udp ip and tcp ip communication between client and server

1100800
udp	tcp
wild guess coming up the udp to tcp code ratio is probably about 80 20

1100800
udp	tcp
we have extra overhead with the udp communications because we have some of the same stuff that you get for free with tcp ip checksums sequence numbers etc.

1100800
udp	tcp
for example wireshark showed that a request for the next set of records was 80 bytes with udp and 84 bytes with tcp

1100803
int	chars
this is done in delphi 5 where pchar is chars alias and i simply cast it as int int in delphi

1100817
mockups	balsamiq
start with visualizing the project in something like balsamiq mockups so that you can see how each piece of the puzzle will come together

1100844
inherited	properties
i would like to create a simple control that inherited from headeredcontentcontrol and has some basic dependency properties called title subtitle icon

1100866
versioning	upgrade
functionality that should be in a nice library where it can be easily upgrade with each new versioning of the framework is instead spewed out in generated model and controller code where it ll end up intermixed with your code

1100868
udp	tcp
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides

1100910
metaphone	soundex
you should also investigate metaphone or soundex but to support that you will need to pre-index your data in a separate table or pre-calc the methaphone or soundex codes for each word in a separate field and index that as well

1100970
width	height
gotoafter 1 gotor oauthtwitter gotop action 3dwindowend oauthtwitterrequest menubar yes location yes resizable yes scrollbars yes status yes width 800 height 400

1100998
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
inotifypropertychanged and inotifycollectionchanged are not the only aspects to be considered.

1101020
getter	setter
it turns out that i had some properties tagged as datamember that had getter but no setter

1101023
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere 3.5 failed on me a long time ago while tomcat would propagate the message just fine

1101050
getter	setter
if you consider properties as getter and setter i don t believe it will break encapsulation

1101069
post	get
writing a suite of iis hosted wcf webservices both get and post and i need to be able to read a cookie for an authentication token so i know the user has been auth d previously

1101072
width	height
say the height and width is to be laid out in 3 bytes each with some id and length for the wire format you make something like

1101083
inherited	properties
this will give you the count 3 message when you hover over an instance of your inherited list in visual studio and a view of the items in the list when you expand the root node without having to drill down into the base properties

1101088
goto	break
break understands the semantics of the block scope while goto is oblivious to it

1101129
public	protected
is it possible to restrict an attribute usage to just protected and public variables

1101171
boost	stl
you should consider avoiding c-style file i o entirely and using c++ streams and boost serialization library instead - it supports stl collections out of the box

1101212
width	height
in wpf if the user control has a default width or height the user control won t strech even if you use the enumeration for stretching

1101212
width	height
the solution was to remove from the usercontrol xaml the default width and height and the control behaved the way it should

1101213
width	height
with the height and width explicitly set the usercontrol won t respond to attributes like horizontalcontentalignment

1101217
fixed-point	fractions	integer	fractions
this one goes beyond just the integer result and calculates extra fractions fixed-point bits of the answer

1101259
ienumerable	ienumerator
fundamentally all an ienumerable promises is that it can return an ienumerator which itself provides a simple contract that happens to have a fancy language construct to make it easy to use foreach

1101265
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
as a quick answer i would say change memberexception to an unchecked-exception extends runtimeexception and see if you get the same results

1101298
ubuntu	debian
specifically ubuntu debian

1101305
daemons	launchd
i have a pair of launchd daemons one of which is a true daemons runs as root and one of which is a gui agent that runs as a per gui session basis session type aqua

1101377
spaces	delimiter
you could take the beginning delimiter of the match and the string length and use that to append the correct number of spaces but i don t see the point

1101380
hide	show
rather than having this feature fail when it is used and then show an appropriate error message to the user i d prefer an ability to silently check if root is available first and if not hide the respective options in the first place

1101397
emacs	aquamacs
as a long-time emacs user i would recommand against exotic versions of emacs aquamacs falls in this catagory but this starter kit thing as well and let me try to explain why just for the sake of finger-training and brain-training also

1101406
postgresql	mysql
let me see if i understand your point but starting your hsqldb you can consider as a normal database like mysql postgresql

1101414
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception
where applicable you should throw exceptions of the correct type eg argumentnullexception or invalidoperationexception in .net

1101424
emacs	aquamacs
for the subset of emacs that i use there s very little difference between using aquamacs and gnu emacs on a linux box

1101458
super	implements
if it is not implements in x check in the super class

1101462
super	extends
in one of my projects my pom extends that super pom and i would like to add an additional resource

1101475
rss	feed
oh also remember to export your rss feed before you upgrade

1101515
folder	directory	config	ini
the last time i had that kind of problem i made an include directory out of my public_http root folder and added its path to the include_path ini config

1101537
maven	pom.xml
remember that your super pom.xml is inheriting from maven s default pom.xml and pretty much any plugin that you define in your pom.xml effectively overrides the setting in the default pom.xml

1101580
firefox	safari
firefox safari will work just fine but ie will fail to set a cookie if it comes from a domain with an underscore

1101599
int	double
conversion to and from int float double

1101632
portrait	landscape
my app has to switch to portrait mode sometimes because the uiimagepickercontroller doesn t work in landscape mode so i use the following code in my view to re-set up landscape mode.

1101637
min	max
it shouldn t be too difficult to screenshot and extract the necessary graphics to create your own nearly-identical min and max track images

1101642
public	protected
the getresourcefilename method is protected so we will have to wrap it in a public method to expose it to the outside world

1101663
gprof	shark
the general consensus over the past few years seems to be that apple would rather you use shark instead and they ve been very lax about fixing bugs and such with gprof

1101686
class-method	delegation
you ll need to keep a reference back to the app delegation object in your mainviewcontroller - currently you re only dealing with static class-method

1101706
cvs	svn
we are currently determining if we would move cvs and vss projects to a single svn server

1101706
cvs	svn
i ve been using svn for a long time now but is forced to use cvs and vss for work stuff

1101706
cvs	svn
and also what the benefits of moving from cvs to svn would be

1101716
cvs	svn
there are tools to convert cvs history to svn and other tools to migrate vss history - so you can use them in your case of moving to a better system

1101716
cvs	svn
for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it

1101721
cvs	svn
svn versus cvs is simple

1101721
cvs	svn
svn was developed as a new software to be used instead of cvs to correct some issues with cvs

1101724
rss	feed
i m writing some ruby on rails code to parse rss atom feed

1101741
nhibernate	llblgenpro
nhibernate works very well with oracle in my experiences as does llblgenpro not free but has a reasonably priced per-developer license for the entity mapping designer

1101830
cvs	svn
there are many reasons to upgrade to svn from cvs

1101830
cvs	svn
the biggest benefit of svn over cvs has to be true autonomous commits

1101830
cvs	svn
we used the open source tool cvs2svn to pull over all our cvs projects to svn

1101853
cvs	svn
my usage history is vss -- cvs -- svn

1101888
post	get
looking around i can t name a single web application not web service that uses anything besides get and post requests

1101907
post	put
the way it works for browser applications is people design restful applications with put and delete in mind then tunnel those requests through post from the browser

1101907
post	put
edit by the way if you re curious about why put delete are missing from browser based form post it turns out there s no real good technical reason

1101920
implements	extends
in the jsp world the extends functionality is not part of vanilla jsp and is implements using third-party libraries sitemesh or tiles

1101921
post	get
quite simply the html 4.01 form element only allows the values post and get in its method attribute

1101923
vb.net	vb6
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008

1102004
entity-relationship	diagram
an excellent technique you can use is called entity-relationship diagram

1102004
entity-relationship	diagram
a very useful rule-of-thumb to remember when using entity-relationship diagram is that most of the time almost always a box in the entity-relationship diagram is a table in the database

1102049
int	chars
we re using the same amount of memory in both cases 4 byte int s vs 4 byte chars arrays so it can t be an issue of padding

1102129
mockups	balsamiq
for web design wireframes i would suggest balsamiq mockups - it is great for doing rough sketches and most of the functionality is available in the free version you can also get a free license in some cases

1102130
post	put
the restlet java framework lets you tunnel put and delete requests through html post operations

1102131
accessor	properties
is the customerwrapper collection stored in a field or do i create customerwrapper instances on the fly in the get accessor of a properties maybe

1102141
spaces	delimiter
you need a spaces between delimiter and

1102143
int	boolean
if you need a array of boolean i suggest using an int or several int then use mask and bit wise operations to access modify flip each bit depending on number of your chromosomes

1102146
spaces	delimiter
as an argument to the delimiter command so not having the spaces there may be confusing it

1102170
textarea	textbox
if you look at the editor here in so you write normal text inside a textarea and it is then transformed in the box below it so you ll see the asterix inside the textbox but in the box below it ll transform special characters by regexing them with tags

1102206
mockups	balsamiq
for cheap free web design i d go with balsamiq mockups

1102209
pull	push
you can push and pull specific branches too so that no one ever need know you re working on both of them at the same time

1102216
width	height
ps i m aware that the substance laf allows to scale the font size at runtime but that way only the height of my controls are scaled not the width

1102245
factories	presenter
so we created factories crating pair of view and presenter which is matched to given id string or guid

1102253
post	get
here is a blog post telling you how to get your background images working for the body

1102306
hex	binary
any such apis which do exist will almost certainly be doing the encode to a byte array perform appropriate binary operation decode opaque binary data to hex base64

1102306
hex	binary
that makes me wonder whether it wouldn t be worth writing a utility class which could take an encoding a and an output format such as hex base64 - that could represent an arbitrary binary operation applied to a string.

1102322
daemon	cron
with background_job the worker was kept running via cron so there was no daemon management

1102326
setinterval	settimeout
as for timers if you re using settimeout or setinterval as far as i know they aren t considered references either

1102336
subtract	add
so if you just add and subtract for example without doing anything which would skew the range of digits required too much adding a very very big number to a very very small number you will end up with easily comparable results

1102369
maven	pom.xml
i saw this question and it motivated me to look again without success at maven configurations for an alternative way of declaring configuration so it is appended to the parent pom.xml s config instead of overriding it

1102369
maven	pom.xml
in a maven pom.xml if configuration declares the same elements as in the parent it overrides the parents configuration

1102389
apache	nginx
this is because some of my apps use _server server_name and it does not have the same meaning in nginx as in apache

1102425
innodb	myisam
also make sure you are using innodb tables - myisam is not optimized for writes

1102456
consistency	acid
acid - atomicity consistency isolation and durability

1102470
explode	implode
if it s always the first part of the domain regardless of whether its www you could use explode implode

1102470
explode	implode
explode implode 2.472

1102515
postgresql	mysql
it supports mysql postgresql and oracle

1102520
folder	directory
concerning source files my project directory structure is flat no source code is in sub folder this is the default when you manage code with xcode only

1102526
width	height
for a div to scroll it must have at least a height and or a width specified depending on which dimension you want it to scroll through

1102562
post	get
the form data is send in either the url get or the http message body post

1102619
width	height
i can only draw rect in integers to a region in integers the width and height and top left point of x y are all integers

1102728
google-chrome	firefox
i came up with the following code which works just fine in ie and google-chrome but not in firefox

1102815
post	get
don t use a post request to get the next page as it looks like you might be unless you are just using the wrong terminology

1102819
min	max
using a regular min a and max a query would be too slow on large tables

1102820
cifs	smb
i want to know if there is any free tool to test the performance of a smb cifs network share

1102835
folder	directory
traverse a large unix directory path file folder structure

1102867
client-side	server-side
whilst it s true that asp.net webforms do use a certain amount of client-side code to do their work this is mostly related to communicating ui events to the server-side so that they can be processed

1102904
codeigniter	cakephp
i am developing a web app with cakephp with oracle backend on windows box the development was initially done in codeigniter and recently we decided to migrate to cakephp

1102911
min	max
if you index the column then min a and max a should be very fast as in this example where t1 has 50000 rows and is indexed on object_id

1102911
min	max
the result is the same if you select the max instead of the min

1102911
min	max
however if you select the min and max in a single select statement the result is different

1102940
inherited	properties
you re adding a properties to addition.prototype so you keep main s inherited display function

1102945
onfocus	onblur
using the onfocus and onblur events allows you to achieve this i.e.

1102956
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception extend runtimeexception and do not need to be declared or caught

1102960
mouse	keyboard
on top of this unless you are dictating prose to the computer any other type of input is easier and quicker using keyboard mouse or touch

1102970
qunit	jsunit
i know how to use qunit and jsunit but i want to try and get vs to run these tests and integrate the results into my build process

1103052
maven	pom.xml
the problem is with maven we have to specify versions in all the pom.xml files

1103089
uiview	subviews
the thing is that the frame property on the view is set twice possibly causing even more double work if your custom uiview is doing some advanced layout in the setframe method placing and resizing subviews for example

1103116
hash	md5
included are the fips secure hash algorithms sha1 and md5

1103118
x86	64bit
note that multiprocessor not multicore systems on x86 also seem to need memory barriers at least in 64bit mode

1103119
config	ini
now i wondering is there other ways to winapp store config data and to that still be in one nice and accepted ways i looked at ini files but it seems to me like an old app and i considering can i just open app.config as xmldocument and than use xpath to read and write my values

1103231
versioning	upgrade
i m sure there are a lot of people out there that have no idea that their software can be upgrade and i know there are lots of people who hardly ever connect their device to itunes so i would be sure to at least still test with versioning 2.2 and upwards

1103250
versioning	upgrade
when you deploy to the app store you will need to specify what versioning you app is and users who have not upgrade to 3.0 will not be able to install your app

1103262
hash	salt
i have a django-based site not yet launched so there are no real users using plain django.contrib.auth and want to store passwords as plain-text not salt sha-1 hash

1103293
ubuntu	linux
on my linux system ubuntu jaunty i have python 2.5 2.6 and 3.0 installed just by installing the binary deb packages python2.5 python2.6 and python3.0 using apt-get

1103353
int	boolean
in a sql view i have 5 boolean variables and one int variable

1103379
subtract	add
it s all maths and unless you start using add and subtract operators too it starts to look a little inconsistent

1103435
instances	transient
nhibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

1103447
vim	emacs
i typically ssh to another computer to do my development using vim don t post use emacs please

1103520
bitblt	gdi
for example in gdi bitblt is handled directly by hardware

1103562
folder	directory
after having done make to compile python 3.x just move the python folder somewhere and create a symlink to the python executable in your bin directory

1103578
put	get
put a retain on the image view so it doesn t get deallocated before the image is downloaded and cancel the download if the view is not visible anymore

1103692
cvs	svn
the traditional svn structure as inherited from cvs is to have trunk branches and tags sitting in side the main project directory

1103695
getter	setter
a property is an interface consisting of two or one for readonly methods made public by the object namely the getter and setter methods in this case

1103758
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you have a many-to-many relationship with extra data such as nickname then you would model that as two one-to-many relationships

1103831
spaces	delimiter
oh yes and please note if you re using a mixture of classes on any element the above function will return them all delimiter by a spaces like you d define in the html class attribute. if you want to check if a particular class exists do this

1103863
width	height
the window size must not exceed the limit of 720px in height and 1280 in width

1103864
vim	emacs
this is also a good reason for learning vim even if you use emacs as your main editor

1103864
emacs	textmate
for example if you are used to textmate then you may be tempted to map lots of functions to complex 5 key chords of keys but in the long run it is much easier to go with the long sequences of commands that emacs tends towards

1103876
children	parent
however a parent pom must be built before it s children projects

1103876
children	parent
aggregator depends on children dependencies which depend on the aggregator parent

1103876
children	parent
in our build system we solve this by having a parent pom file that is also the reactorizes it s children

1103876
maven	pom.xml
maven dependency resolution allows us to build the top-level pom.xml which reactorizes all children in the correct order with the aggregator project last

1103893
punctuation	words
if you re looking for a number make sure that they only put in numbers if they are inputing a words make sure no punctuation is available

1103909
bazaar	git
i find myself using git branches much more often than i used to do with bazaar specially because my repo is not small and also involves binary files total 180mb

1103932
ncover	partcover
code coverage both ncover and partcover work fine

1103942
cpu	affinity
if you decide that you need specify the core that a particular thread can run on the os will generally provide a mechanism set the thread s affinity to a specific cpu

1103971
itertools	functools
really whether using python 2.x or python 3.x list comprehensions map itertools operator and to a slightly lesser extend functools are my friends

1104003
width	height
it takes an object for the cornerradius value rather than setting ellipse width and height values

1104003
width	height
i m not 100 sure that the cornerradius value isn t converted into ellipse width and height but it seems like it d be something to try

1104063
children	parent
my problem was that i was never explicitly setting the parent reportcriteriabean in the children pkvisits

1104086
postgresql	mysql
included are sample connection strings for sqlite mysql and postgresql

1104106
post	get
as long as you know that dinner.rsvps will be the same on the post as the get i m confident of this in my code then using the rsvp.id will work

1104139
put	get
the main point is that people tend to use the same password over and over again and therefore using plaintext in your site you put your users at risks for an attacker to get to their bank account

1104154
post	get
like in the onsubmit event change the method of a form from get to post

1104171
try-catch	exception-handling
the only way to solve this is to wrap the thrown exception-handling in a try-catch block

1104186
jobs	cron
then just execute these rake tasks with a cron job at whatever interval you require i use whenever to manage these jobs because i m slightly cron-illiterate

1104221
versioning	upgrade
i can only presume the versioning numbers refer to something of significance inside of sqlserver but i m having trouble believing that there have been that many releases patches upgrade to sqlserver since 2000

1104227
pdfsharp	migradoc
i am using pdfsharp migradoc to write tables and charts to pdf files

1104227
pdfsharp	migradoc
please note that i am using pdfsharp migradoc for the first time

1104231
ant	maven
use a build tool to build your application maven ant .

1104256
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the global config for isapi_rewrite 3 is called httpd.conf and per-site distributed configurations are .htaccess

1104264
firefox	safari
i ve put together a small function that yields results in both firefox 2+ and safari 3+ but apparently doesn t even register in ie 7

1104264
firefox	safari
again this works in firefox and safari but has no effect on the same divs in ie

1104265
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome all methods work properly

1104278
mouse	keyboard
i want to trap windows mouse and keyboard input with the help of event given by windows for detecting system idle or not in c++

1104278
mouse	keyboard
anyone can tell me if windows event to trap the mouse and keyboard input is available or not.

1104322
postgresql	mysql
i was having similar problems with mysql and postgresql but no problems with sqllite

1104322
postgresql	mysql
this is how i solved the problem with postgresql didnt test this trick with mysql but id asume it would solve it as well

1104344
mouseover	mouseenter
i have always used the mouseover event but while reading the jquery documentation i found mouseenter

1104344
mouseout	mouseleave
also applies for mouseout vs mouseleave

1104350
mysqlimport	mysqladmin
pl mysqld_safe mysqladmin mysqlshow mysql_tzinfo_to_sql mysqltest mysqlbackup mysqld_multi mysql mysqldumpslow mysqlcheck mysql_upgrade mysqlimport comp_err mysqld myisamchk innochecksum

1104381
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
mouseenter and mouseleave do not react to event bubbling while mouseover and mouseout do

1104401
put	get
i want to get the text of every row and put that text into an array

1104418
superclass	subclassing
you do it all the time the outlet for the view in uiviewcontroller is defined in a superclass you subclassing for each of your view controllers

1104441
sorting	filtering
apple suggests subclassing nsarraycontroller in order to change sorting filtering behaviour

1104444
gridview	objectdatasource
gridview objectdatasource linq paging and sorting

1104455
min	max
i d have a separate table or storage area somewhere that stored the max min and sum values associated with each field in your original query and update those values every time i updated and added a table record

1104471
inherited	properties
i d say you make that an interface which you can inherited the properties

1104479
superclass	subclassing
as far as i know by reading the manuals the parameters of the primary constructor are also implicitly fields of the class so i would end with one array array double in the scala subclassing and another double in the java superclass which is pretty redundant

1104534
hide	show
it includes a menu option to hide show hidden files among many other useful features

1104535
width	height
when you have their position add it to half their width height and you will have the position of their center on the page

1104547
int	boolean
when i define columns in mysql i generally use int varchar 255 text and the occasional enum for boolean

1104571
int	chars
however you can easily get int representations of chars so you can compare chars like so

1104581
post	get
if you want to create a way to directly pass php commands and directions via ajax the only way i could see it is by using a php eval on code that is sent to it via post or get in jquery

1104601
accessor	properties
it raises an error error mc3080 the properties setter inputbindings cannot be set because it does not have an accessible set accessor

1104612
int	chars
you will have to use fixed column types like int and chars some size for text

1104695
superclass	subclassing
is it because the jvm knows that dosomething has a call to super.dosomething or because calling a subclassing method will always acquire a lock on the superclass as well

1104729
post	get
it can only cause the php file to run on the server via a post get call on x url

1104729
post	get
in other words instead of calling the php file update.php for example directly as simple examples show you can call a go-between file call it whatever you like ajax server ajax router etc that uses get post parameters you send to figuere out what method you want to use and what values to pass to it

1104735
rss	feed
i cannot guarantee how much content will be provided per rss feed item

1104756
centos	linux
on my linux centos 5 server php 5.2.10 runkit compiled by hand

1104767
pull	push
the serializable class can either have methods on it that are used to push pull the real object in and out of serialization or you could use a separate data mapping class this might be better if you have serious versioning concerns

1104767
getter	setter
that way your main application object s are persistent ignorant and you don t have to make compromises - like public getter and setter and attributes - just to support serialization

1104786
subnet	packets
if your peer machines are on a different subnet and therefore traffic between you and the peer is passing through a router then there s no way to do what you want -- the mac address of the packets you receive will be the mac address of the router which forwarded them to you as that s the link-layer device you re communicating with

1104786
subnet	packets
if the peer machines are on the same subnet then the incoming packets will contain the mac address of the peer in the ethernet header.

1104786
winpcap	libpcap
if after all that you re still determined look into libpcap winpcap for packet capturing which is the most portable option which comes to mind

1104787
width	height
anything else would be too cumbersome the solutions i can think of off the top of my head would involve actually keeping track of the height and width of every character for the specific font and manually do a whole lot of char by char calculations but another solution would be to look at a containing div with overflow hidden

1104802
httphandler	pagemethods
a simple way to do this would be as you said simply make an ajax call to a pagemethods mvc action httphandler or web service that returns the required value from the session

1104804
folder	directory
in this application i have created a folder in the application directory

1104881
inherited	properties
static properties don t need qualifiers in inherited classes

1104890
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript are two such languages

1104892
pull	push
gethash pull out the whole object so you can just modify it in-place rather than telling push how to look it up again

1104924
superclass	subclassing
if i think that subclassing should have a protected way to take effect on the state defined in the superclass i make a protected setter .

1104973
children	parent
what you are trying to achieve is some kind of a nested set and therefore the easiest way to implement it would be to save the parent id in the children s entry

1104983
width	height
but when i change the height or width of the object mcwhiteborder the drop shadow does not appear at all

1105016
post	get
there s really no reason why something that can be a simple link causing an http get should be emulated by using script to submit a form using http post

1105020
range	max
user audience per application will range from 10 to 6000 max

1105048
width	height
basecanvas - canvas with fixed height and width

1105069
x86	64bit
registration for the 32-bit com dll s will be under a separate location in the registry hklm software wow6432node classes and your com components should live in separate folders 64bit under program files and 32-bit under program files x86

1105098
gridview	onclientclick
subclass the gridview control override the render method then make the href of the pager point to the page you want and copy the original href javascript link to the onclientclick event

1105126
hide	show
i m using javascript to show hide the menus and a ul for each menu inside the same div as the origin link

1105133
hide	show
jquery s hide and show don t work and neither do these methods

1105158
put	get
edit as craig stuntz pointed out you can get the route values in a view via viewcontext without having to put them into viewdata first

1105169
rss	feed
my encoded characters come from a rss feed btw look like this

1105206
hide	show
for example this code hide all elements of the pie class whereas i only want to effect the elements that are currently show and not act on the ones that are currently hidden

1105234
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog change the item and if the user clicks ok save the changes back to the original item and if they click cancel do nothing

1105284
versioning	upgrade
if so it might be an upgrade from an older versioning of sql server

1105297
nsscanner	nsstring
this goes in a category of nsstring uses nsscanner for the implementation and handles both hex and decimal numeric character entities as well as the usual symbolic ones

1105348
128bit	64bit
you can effectively get a 64bit int from 2 32-bit ints or a 128bit int from 4 32-bit ints or indeed any size you require from enough ints

1105359
glut	sdl
you could look at glut c qt c++ sdl c

1105364
inherited	properties
properties are just methods that get inherited like any other.

1105468
many-to-one	one-to-many
the fundamental problem with ui api s is that you re dealing with a many-to-one or one-to-many depending on how you look at it relationship

1105514
google-chrome	firefox
combining them works great in google-chrome and firefox

1105516
free	malloc
i had just completed the section of the course on malloc and free to the general satisfaction of most of the punters when the one cobol guy on the course came over and asked

1105516
put	get
this is actually not too far from oo and i think the basic idea you need to get across is that there will be subtly different types of record with different things you need to do to them and the best way of dealing with this is to put the record and the things that need done together to create objects

1105518
width	height
try adding width 600 height 600 in your options to reduce the window size right down...if no bars are appearing it is more likely a css problem

1105528
cpu	processors
writing a cache line that is shared between processors forces it to become invalid in the other cpu s keeping the caches in sync

1105564
jar	war
maven treats a project as something that creates a single artifact - aka jar file war file ear file etc

1105566
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
doesn t look right in google-chrome safari firefox either so this really isn t an ie8 problem

1105566
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in the future design your site to look good in ie8 firefox google-chrome and safari

1105569
stdout	stderr
i admit that i don t know much about multi-threading but i think what i need is a mechanism to promptly pause input stream threads one each for stdout stderr when an user input is needed and resume once the input is provided to prevent a block

1105582
loops	while-loop
if you really want to mess about manually with loops indices consider using a while-loop

1105633
width	height
i have an image that depending on the screen resolution drops down out of sight in my css flow layout because i have set its width and height to static values

1105636
lisp	scheme
i would highly recommend structure and interpretation of computer programs which actually uses scheme but that is a dialect of lisp

1105642
udp	tcp
it s a voip application that uses a combination of udp and tcp to initially set up the connection and do port tunneling stuff and then uses udp for the streaming data

1105646
range	minimum
to satisfy the request it has to seek at the beginning of the range 2009-05-01 start a scan from this position to extract all the resultid sort them then return the top 1 the minimum resultid

1105658
maven	pom.xml
because there is no multiple inheritance in maven you either have to have a gigantic parent pom.xml with all this content in and some complicated profile conventions or several parents one for each type of project

1105679
folder	directory
delete the file after you have what you need from it presumably after moving it out of the temp directory using move_uploaded_file to the folder from which you will read it then remove it using unlink

1105725
many-to-many	one-to-many
should i instead combine the data from user_organizations and org_user_details into a table like the one in my first post and just tell nhibernate that user looks at it as a many-to-many relationship and organization looks at it as a one-to-many relationship

1105739
put	get
i put in a hyperlink to the mvc page from one of the standard .html pages and i get a 404 response telling me the requested page does not exist

1105760
cdr	cons
learn to love car cdr and cons

1105762
opera	safari
the specs say it does not work for netscape mozilla safari opera and internet explorer for the macintosh. .

1105783
hide	show
basically having some trouble with using hover to hide or show an item

1105783
hide	show
problem is if the mouse hovers over the div and leaves too quickly the show hide div will stay visible

1105788
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
could not find a base address that matches scheme net.tcp for the endpoint with binding nettcpbinding

1105792
udp	tcp
both use openssl under-the-hood and provide similar abstractions for tcp udp and ssl

1105792
udp	tcp
one thing you may need to keep in mind is that ssl is record-oriented instead of the stream-oriented both tcp and udp

1105799
put	get
if you are willing to put up with a small performance hit on inserting these entities you can create a solution to get n of them very quickly

1105808
free	malloc
i suspect an issue is because loki uses malloc free for each chunk as well as when the size is getmaxobjectsize .

1105812
filesystems	fat
for this strategy what you would need is code for your bootloader to mount the nand flash as a drive and have a fat driver so that it can traverse that filesystems and find the image

1105831
xfce	gnome
xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured

1105831
kde	gnome
here s a list of lots of choices basically anything that s not kde or gnome will be smaller

1105865
lisp	scheme
i liked structure and interpretation of computer programs uses scheme practical common lisp paradigms of artificial intelligence programming casting spels in lisp among others

1105869
width	height
bit of a guess since my css is rubbish but since nobody is answering what about setting a width or height or both in the image so that it is a percent of its parent

1105903
opera	safari
it would be a bug in safari or opera if the d handle it differently

1105926
vb.net	vb6
i am upgrading vb.net app that handles the events of a com object possibly written in vb6 from framework 1.1 to wpf 2.0 3.5

1106016
ant	maven
it sounds like you had everything worked out well with the ant solution so what is maven buying you here

1106016
ant	maven
if it is just dependency management there are techniques for leveraging maven from ant that give you the best of both worlds

1106037
kde	gnome
i too think you re asking for desktop environments like kde gnome fluxbox etc or at least window managers kwin metacity tvwm twm etc and not x servers

1106104
for-loop	arrays
since the for-loop iterates n say the arrays length is n times and in each iteration dosomething is executed the overall performance would be o n logn

1106111
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
they would rather use lisp or scheme or haskell or whatever

1106113
hide	show
how about once the option is clicked clone the image and stick it in a div with no style hide your original load div and then show the new image div where you want it to go

1106115
put	get
i hate to put an index hint in a stored procedure but sql server just canâ t seem to get a clue on this one

1106130
keyczar	botan	keyczar	cryptlib	botan	cryptlib
there are several options such as keyczar botan cryptlib etc

1106133
pop-up	dialog
another way to always launch your debugger is to add the following line to your code and it will pop-up a dialog box when called that will give you the correct debugger options

1106188
rss	feed
my django application retrieves an rss feed every day

1106191
mantis	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla
in the latter case you could install a webserver an use tools like mantis bugzilla jira highly recommended trac etc

1106193
firefox	safari
it happens in safari and firefox

1106234
google-chrome	firefox
i can t get firefox to play my stream though google-chrome plays it okay

1106284
width	height
this seems to require the enclosing div to be set to a particular width and height value

1106319
inherited	properties
all of my child forms inherited the same base class and that class just has a properties that returns the my.forms.mdimain

1106335
width	height
you ll need to manually specify the width and height properties to get the image to keep its dimensions

1106339
width	height
where w h are the original height and width in and the new height and width out and maxwidth and maxheight define the bounding box that the image must fit in

1106347
min	max
average the hue saturation and brightness separately while keeping the min max values

1106382
oncreate	ondestroy
oncreate and ondestroy are not good places to load save registry values that affect the positioning of the window

1106384
width	height
divide the screen image into a grid of r-many rectangles in an n by m grid each with width total width n and height total height m

1106444
width	height
more or less if you want the image to resize with the window you can t set the div to a fixed width and height

1106444
width	height
the div must have a width and height also

1106478
for-loop	loops
as per mike sutton what you need is a while loops not a for-loop

1106479
firefox	safari
it just showed a single stationary image on safari and firefox

1106482
equals	gethashcode
for this to work your class must override equals and gethashcode and implement the iequatable of t interface

1106503
ant	maven
the tool is capable as acting as command line tool as well as ant maven and eclipse plugin

1106547
haskell	scheme
i am slowly learning haskell too and i am using the tutorial write yourself a scheme in 48 hours

1106588
getdate	dateadd
select dateadd dd ceiling datediff dd 1 1 09 getdate 14 14 1 1 09

1106607
getter	setter
implementing getter and setter has two advantages in my eyes

1106609
disk	ram
ram if your ram is not big enough to store your complete application image you need to store it on an external disk

1106625
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
afaiu it supports openid and facebook connect ldap ntlm kerberos etc

1106710
pascal	delphi
we have some ancient delphi code might have even originated as turbo pascal code that uses aka iochecks which makes the code use ioresult instead of exceptions for disk i o errors

1106758
actionscript	mxml
i m working in flex builder 3 and i have two actionscript 3 classes abc and xyz and a flex mxml project main.mxml

1106846
cvs	svn
i have to agree with simon - careful comments and manual merges are the only way to keep it with the rest of your svn or cvs files

1106869
mkdir	chdir	rmdir	mkdir	rmdir	chdir
also anything that calls inouterror chdir mkdir amd rmdir

1106877
post	get
i get data in from post and validate it via this standard snippet

1106887
hid	keyboard
depends on the framework api and os but the picolcd states that it should show up as a standard keyboard or hid device

1106894
lisp	smalltalk
alan kay of smalltalk fame calls the original definition of lisp evaluation in lisp the maxwell s equations of programming

1106955
width	height
convert to 640x480 if either dimension of the original is larger or a 4 3 aspect ratio relating to the width height of the original whichever is closer to 640x480

1106974
int	double
so this got me thinking i know that i will be working with numeric types hence t will be any of the following int uint short ushort long ulong byte sbyte decimal float double

1106977
typedef	struct
you have two solutions there declare a typedef or make explicit that you are passing an struct

1107019
width	height	min	max
i started with try and set min and max height width to the actual height width

1107025
int	double
hence t will be any of the following int uint short ushort long ulong byte sbyte decimal float double

1107036
prop	each
as you can see my sql statement is a union of all three and i want to specify which table pet prop or amend each row of data comes from

1107049
ubuntu	linux	vmware	virtualbox
folks mentioned vmware and virtualbox also note that ubuntu s wubi installer lets you install linux under windows without repartitioning

1107049
ubuntu	mint	kde	kubuntu	kde	gnome	kubuntu	gnome
also since ubuntu is so popular that are many versions kubuntu uses kde instead of gnome mint and xubuntu are both lighter weight

1107049
anjuta	kdevelop
in addition to kdevelop there s anjuta eclipse and many more

1107049
vim	emacs
lots of people use emacs and vim for good reasons

1107063
junit	testng
we noticed that when testng test cases extend testcase junit those tests start executing as junit tests

1107066
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
html 5 which is still in development has a canvas element that can be used with javascript to create the kind of thing you are looking for but only the latest versions of firefox google-chrome opera and safari support it

1107085
spaces	delimiter
1 if you know that the rest of your data after the address is exactly 2 fields ie bc and ca you can do split on your string using spaces as delimiter remove the last 2 items

1107105
django	web2py
supposedly web2py platform handles this automatically but unfortunately web2py is not well documented yet but it might be a cut above django in terms of quality of api and is worth taking a look at

1107132
versioning	upgrade
i would upgrade to the latest versioning if the problem persists

1107134
udp	tcp
most of our development that is shared between windows and linux is server side networking sockets tcp ip udp ... and then client side tools on linux and gui apps on windows

1107152
junit	testng
i didn t think either testng or junit required any base classes now that both use annotations to specify test methods

1107152
junit	testng
and why on earth would a testng class extend the junit base class testcase

1107152
ant	maven
it s immaterial whether they re run by you ant or maven

1107200
instances	transient
i guess you can try doing session.lock on your transient instances to reattach it to the session and then session.refresh to refresh it.

1107291
vmware	virtualbox
your choices range from virtual pc to vmware server sun virtualbox and more

1107312
width	margin
else you can divide the margin-left into or increase the width of the to 330px so that it would accomodate the extra margin

1107337
getter	setter
when you define your bindable sources through the use of getter and setter the bindings don t seem to work

1107337
getter	setter
the solution is to declare a bindable event for your getter and dispatch the event in your setter

1107368
mouse	keyboard
iinputdevice - a mouse keyboard etc.

1107373
ubuntu	linux
it is just easy to setup a sun virtualbox on your windows machine and spin up the ubuntu or fedora image and get your linux up and running

1107458
apache	lighttpd
i am in the process of migrating from a django fastcgi setup in apache to one in lighttpd

1107458
apache	lighttpd
this software relies on request.get_full_path which returns a different value under lighttpd than it did under apache

1107458
apache	lighttpd
ideally i would like lighttpd mod_rewrite to have the same behavior as mod_rewrite under apache

1107482
children	parent
in general the configuration elements of children will override those specified in the parent for any given plugin

1107509
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	ondestroy	onstart	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
these methods are likely called from defined in oncreate onstart onresume onrestart onpause onstop or ondestroy

1107509
put	get
if you put a long loop at any point in your program it will appear to freeze because the os specifically the ui thread is unable to get a slice of time

1107545
profiling	benchmarking
i typically approach things in the following order with the help of a profiling and some fixed application benchmarking so i can compare different approaches

1107546
hide	show
however this also posts both the will show and will hide notifications to my view controller

1107596
min	max	min	median	median	max
i m having some trouble returning multiple values in this program that calculates min max mean median

1107666
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the reason for this behavior is that the only unchecked-exception in the java language is runtimeexception and it s subclasses

1107718
cpu	processors
in a multitasking or multithreaded processors environment the usual case for a long time now where there are other operations possible while the desired event has not arrived burning cpu and resource access paths leads to an awful waste of processing power and time

1107718
cpu	hyperthreading
when we have a hyperthreading system like i think you are referring to in your question it is important to note that the granularity at which cpu threads are sliced is very high

1107752
mouse	keyboard
in system preferences keyboard mouse and keyboard shortcuts there s a full keyboard access setting that allows users to configure whether they want tab to enable changing keyboard focus to text boxes and lists only or to all controls

1107769
width	height
this also works in ie however not always so sometimes you might need to set a height or width or do a zoom 1 which tends to fix a lot of ie bugs look up haslayout bug if you want more info

1107773
free	malloc
c++ compilers simply make the default operator new and operator delete wrap malloc and free or other memory allocation primitives that normally don t know anything about objects and types and allocate release raw chunks of memory and thus have to store the size within to know how much to release

1107780
free	malloc
i can t imagine an implementation where it wouldn t since the memory allocation functions underlying new and delete will just be like malloc and free type-independent functions that operate on pointers

1107833
width	height
you cannot set an explicit width height on inline elements so if they must be a specific size then you re stuck with floating them

1107874
firefox	safari
one other thing is that gwt is adding this same support to normal browsers firefox ie safari so you can debug from within them the same way

1107890
mouse	keyboard
last but not least if you do have the headcount budget to hire one more engineer please do but make sure he or she is a software engineer in testing not a warm body banging at the keyboard or mouse for manual testing -- somebody who s rarin to write and integrate all sorts of automated testing approaches as opposed to spending their days endlessly repeating if they re lucky the same manual testing sequences

1107932
hide	show
use the onclick events to call the needed hide or show div

1107941
sorting	filtering
sorting and filtering

1107945
children	parent
this is useful in many cases as disabling children hover animations drag n drop selecting a parent container before continuing checking clicking the child widget etc

1107966
hide	show
to hide and show your div using jquery you could do something like

1108031
keydown	keyup
edit i only added the keydown and keyup events just to prove that the keys presses were getting through

1108052
hide	show
edit#2 moving all tags down at the tail of the fixes well hide this error and the page show normally

1108058
free	malloc
in pure c you only really have one solution allocating on the heap with malloc and making sure to free afterwards

1108073
put	get	post	put	post	get
you can call rest services from delphi using http get put post delete

1108127
ubuntu	debian
it s the default version of java that comes with many open-source linuxes such as debian ubuntu and fedora

1108146
int	chars
like int main int argc chars argv

1108168
x86	64bit
you could compile it for x86 instead of any cpu that way it will run against 32bit librarys on a 64bit windows

1108213
internationalization	translation
it handles very difficult internationalization and translation transformation issues which makes it slow

1108219

junit	testng
looking at the maven surefire plugin info i can t see any way to select a test for testng processing only if it also extends a junit 3 class

1108269
put	get
if that is the case the php script may be trying to send it internally in which case it ll just disappear while the other target emails will get put on to the internet and routed properly

1108337
post	get
you don t ever get the value of user out of the post variable in php

1108337
post	get
in all recent php versions post variables are accessible through the associative array and get variables similarly through

1108379
width	height
the cause of this seems to be because width height is not always set in the xaml-file - only margins

1108403
mvp	presenter
the difference with mvp is it introduces a presenter class which monitors the model on behalf of the view in other words the view doesn t know about the model it only knows about its presenter

1108442
post	get
i want to maintain modelandview when requestmethod is get and requestmethod is post

1108442
post	get
so i made modelandview return type to get post methods

wav files uses the standard riff header format

1108678
sorting	filtering
to make life easier it employs a searchlist another prototype i wrote which allows you to do incremental search filtering and live sorting on the listed items

1108708
cvs	svn
as far as i remember is the scm support in xcode limited to git svn and cvs

1108712
getter	setter
- client side add to business object s getter setter rights checker allowing write display data for particular user

1108714
getter	setter
use attr_accessor to add attributes and you will get getter and setter automatically

1108789
division	modulo
using the modulo gives the remainder of the division rand 100

1108790
min	max
a normal group by query using a min and max groups all the driverids

1108843
min	max
you clearly want to keep journeys separate - the results you say you want for driver 401 involve the first row then min max run over the second set of rows for that driver

1108877
bids	ssis
realising my mistake i changed it to money but bids ssis kept rounding it and treating it as an int

1108877
bids	ssis
it s like bids ssis has a strange memory and the only way round it is to start again

1108926
ubuntu	linux
i am working on ubuntu 8.10 linux os

edit sql server 2008 geographic extensions also neglect altitude information when calculating distance

1108970
mouse	keyboard
our ui supported a normal keyboard mouse combo too the touchable buttons were just standard button controls sized appropriately

1109042

1109055
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
is there a place where you guys upload your personal projects and also svn i think is the most popular but with git bazaar i dont know if it just a hype or distributed version controlling is really the way to go

1109161
pickle	configparser
this could load up data from a specific file which could be text json configparser pickle or any suitable format

1109225
folder	directory
update since you want to do plugin-style dlls you can keep the dlls in a separate directory and copy them into the exe folder on application startup

1109240
mouse	keyboard
we use two distinct ui s one for touch-screen with large bold buttons and one for mouse keyboard entry

1109255
put	get
if you put everything into one c source module you get -

1109268
post	get
get post attributes - but on server side they may be handled in a case sensitive way

1109277
hash	md5
oscommerce stores the password using md5 but also adds a random 2 digit number provided in plaintext to the hash

1109277
hash	md5

1109277
cart	oscommerce
is there any possible way of importing customer passwords from my oscommerce cart to my new cart

1109292
hash	md5
md5 is a hash algorithm which is a one-way function

1109292
hash	salt
you cannot reverse the hash on your oscommerce system to remove the salt and rehash

1109321
super	abstract
here the super class mapping itself is abstract

1109329
hash	md5
do not save plain md5 hash in your database

1109329
hash	md5
plain md5 hash can be reverse engineered quickly and easily using rainbow tables

1109329
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
anyways i want to reiterate that plain md5 hash are easy to crack for most passwords since people like short and easy to remember passwords. use a salt and or a more complex algorithm

1109474
agile	srs
for instance you do not have a software requirements specification srs in agile

1109509
unification	inference
type inference to unification problem

1109522
for-loop	arrays
i fill refresh them with data from an arrays with a for-loop

1109536
distance	polygons
the requirement is that the new inflated polygons s edges points are all at the same constant distance from the old original polygons s on the example picture they are not since then it would have to use arcs for inflated vertices but let s forget about that for now

1109557
daemons	systemd
this can be a daemons app or windows systemd process or it can be a unix-style superserver that s configured to load and run the actual file-copy app when someone contacts the listening port

1109583
jar	manifest.mf
i m able to read the manifest file inside of my java code but i would also like to know if it s possible and if it is how to open up a jar file from the command line and view its manifest.mf file or at the very least be able to specify a property of the manifest.mf file and view it s value

1109587
distance	polygons
the resulting polygons lies at the required distance from the old polygons far enough from the vertices

1109587
distance	polygons
near a vertex the set of points at distance d from the old polygons is as you say not a polygons so the requirement as stated cannot be fulfilled

1109604
youtube	vimeo
posting a video on tumblr.com allows you to just paste the url of the video on youtube vimeo whatever and tumblr automatically does the embedding for you

1109725
cpu	processors
binary code expected to run on any processors either needs to avoid extensions or to detect the cpu type before using them

1109725
x86	64bit
intel s itanium 64bit architecture was completely different from amd s x86-64 architecture so for a while their 64bit offerings were non-compatible and itanium was nothing like x86 whereas x86-64 extended the instruction set by adding 64bit instructions

1109756
httphandler	httpmodule
you ll want to use an httphandler or httpmodule to do this

1109785
min	max
use min max avg or any other function to give you one result for fields that could return multiple values

1109822
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but it only works in firefox google-chrome safari and any browser supporting css3

1109824
folder	directory
svnadmin can write to the root to create new projects and to the project folder to create the trunk branches tags directory

1109951
int	double
for int it can construct them by peasant arithmetic double or double and add 1 for each bit for bits it just provides the appropriate encrypted bit

1109951
int	boolean
we can mix and match boolean and int values in our designs obtaining an if then else that requires evaluating both branches simd style by evaluating cond then + 1 - cond else using 1 as true and 0 as false in cond so you can get away with using the built in arithmetic of your ring to make your circuits more shallow

1109989
punctuation	words
one thing i can think of is that it will count punctuation marks as words if they are surrounded by spaces

1109995
getter	setter
to which extent do the getter setter impact performance function call stack frame compared to a direct field access

1109996
width	height
sticking a transparent 1x1 gif in your image to start will let you scale it to the width and height you need

1110002
ant	maven
speaking of recompilation neither maven and particularly nor ant do a good job at identifying what needs to be recompiled

1110002
jar	war
in fact you use java s jar to generate a scala s jar file from the class files and the maven targets for lift support building war files

1110008
getter	setter
in c++ the compiler inlines the getter and setter

1110011
getter	setter
in c++ when a compiler s optimizations are enabled then getter and setter may be inlined be implemented using the same machine instructions as there would be for direct access to the underlying member data

1110027
youtube	vimeo
i am trying to code a firefox extension that can get the video youtube vimeo property path etc. when a user right-clicks on it on a web page

1110031
width	height
basically in a complex hierarchy of ui controls allowing you to browse the elements and see properties such as x and y coordinates width height id

1110057
getter	setter
setting the email field as private getter setter will not solve my issue since i don t want to store the value at all on the entity and fetch the field from the database - as i said this application needs to be as performant as possible

1110077
children	parent
each row represents the children of the previous row where child categories are attached to parent by their respective positions - they are a child if their position is the parent to the left and the next parent to the right if there is one

1110089
getter	setter
often i encounter classes that are used as data containers which have both getter and setter for each member

1110089
getter	setter
most compilers can optimize trivial getter setter but as soon as you declare them virtual in c++ you pay an extra lookup - often worth the effort

1110101
getter	setter
as far as i know the jvm jit compiler only optimizes heavily used code so you could see the function call overhead initially until the getter setter has been called sufficiently often

1110150
nsstring	nsdata
therefore the nsstring initializer grabs even the bytes after the end of the received nsdata until it reaches some zero byte previously stored in memory

1110158
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
ditto for webkit google-chrome safari and opera

1110211
integer	unsigned
here are functions for reading and writing 32 bit unsigned integers from a stream heeding an arbitrary byte order which is specified by the integer whose representation is the byte sequence 0 1 2 3 endian.h endian.c

1110319
versioning	upgrade
with wpf i ve had rendering issues related to my video drivers and the fix was to upgrade the video driver to a newer versioning

1110324
getter	setter
also d has property syntax that allows you to make something a public field and then change it to a getter setter later without breaking source-level compatibility

1110324
getter	setter
if you want to use trivial getter setter for some reason such as only having a getter and making the variable read-only from outside the class make them final

1110326
getter	setter
however providing a getter and setter for each data member of a class is not a good practice

1110327
perforce	svn
branches are cheap in all of the systems mentioned so far svn tfs perforce git

1110375
int	boolean
i have an arraylist that gets different type of values in it 1st value- string 2nd value- datetime 3rd value-- boolean and 4th value is int how do i find thier type and assign those values accordingly any help is appreciated

1110385
gridview	sqldatasource	listview	gridview
i was thinking of using listview or gridview bound to the database with a sqldatasource that filters the questions for the questionnaire being generated for the data entry

1110407
post	get
i was wondering if anyone can post an example of how to get a selected radio button option from an asp.net radio button list control via jquery on the loading of a page

1110425
for-loop	loops
you will often see this pattern using a for-loop rather than a while loops

1110493
post	get
are you putting the attribute on the get method or the post method

1110498
dbml	edmx
the second tool i know of are the huagati dbml edmx tools which allow update of dbml linq-to-sql and edmx entity framework mapping files and more like naming conventions etc.

1110502
free	realloc
if you want to use realloc i do not see another solution as you initial array was free by realloc

1110502
free	calloc
you can calloc your reduced array copy the nodes then free the old array

1110513
profiler	yourkit
if a method is inlined it doesn t appear in the profiler certainly not yourkit anyway

1110553
public	protected
since private methods must be used by the code which is visible in some form public package protected private methods can be considered to be covered under the tests for the more-visible methods

1110588
textmate	notepad++
but if i open the csv file with notepad notepad++ or even textmate on mac i don t see any such signs and i m not able to get rid of them

1110617
firefox	safari
as usual it s working fine in firefox and safari but it s breaking in ie

1110636
groupbox	panel
the 1st panel in the main splitcontainer has 3 main groupbox which are selected via a toolstripbutton which sets the desired groupbox to visible and turning the others to invisible.

1110717
openfeint	scoreloop
so far i ve found openfeint and scoreloop but i don t really care about the social part or discovering other games i just want a simple system with matchmaking win loss and global rankings

1110746
mamp	wamp
open phpmyadmin if you re using mamp wamp or a server that has it installed and run the following query update system set status 0 where name devel_themer

1110746
mamp	wamp
those should work to disable any module in a pinch. you can also edit the php.ini file in your mamp wamp configuration to give it more memory temporarily though that trick won t work if you re running on a shared host that doesn t recognize php.ini changes

1110765
stdout	stderr
the problem is you catch only stdout and not stderr see standard streams

1110793
inherited	properties
all these pages would inherited from a common base page that would include the properties above

1110801
getter	setter
getter and setter are one of those things that are sometimes useful but you get these doctrinaire people who somehow leap from has proven useful in some cases to must be used all the time and if you don t use it you are a heretic who should be killed

1110801
getter	setter
if you have side effects to a get or set by all means use a getter or setter

1110801
getter	setter
but if not writing getter and setter just clutters up the code

1110801
getter	setter
but declaring a member field private and then creating public getter and setter for does nothing to solve the problem

1110804
stdout	stderr
looking at the documentation it does say there is a stdin stdout and stderr file descriptors that i can directly manipulate but there is a big fat warning that says don t do this

1110809
width	height
the top left corner of the #logindiv is positioned absolutely at a point 50 across the width of the window and 50 of the height of the window from the top-left origin

1110809
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
this is then altered by the margin s moving it 50 of its height up the page and 50 of its width back across the page

1110809
width	height
changing the width height of the #logindiv will require different negative margins for positioning centrally

1110820
decoder	encoder
come up with some kind of csv encoder decoder for the fields and values and populate a collection on every page

1110848
stdout	stderr
you misstate what is going on here -- the object references are passed by value a copy of the reference is made so stdout and stderr do not get modified when you call tidy

1110858
stdout	stderr
no stdout and stderr will not be changed and yes parameters are passed by value

1110862
mouse	keyboard
wrist-rests for keyboard and mouse

1110975
getter	setter
just to be extra clear java 1.6 introduces getter setter like file.canexecute and file.setexecutable boolean for file permissions

1110982
perl	tcl
swig is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

1110986
daemons	launchd
do i have a daemons running looking for a crash or do i wait until my app is launchd next time to report

1111015
calloc	malloc
in a language like c malloc makes no guarantees about the memory being initialized to 0 but calloc does

1111015
free	malloc
now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier

1111105
typedef	struct
as far as which style is preferred i prefer the 1st style with the name in both the struct tag and as a typedef for the struct simply because there are no drawbacks other than a few more characters in the source file

1111105
typedef	struct
my ide s struct snippet drops the name in both places so i always get a typedef struct name along with a struct tag name

1111127
skip-lists	tree
depending on your requirements heaps tree or skip-lists might be appropriate

1111159
onmouseover	onclick
for example an attacker could inject malicious code into the onclick or onmouseover attributes

1111167
width	height
so getting width and height you can calculate an aspect ratio

1111176
post	get
you can post the suggestion to after registering and they should get back to you fairly quickly

1111185
vmware	esx
i ve a ps script which i use to keep track of my vmware esx servers

1111186
post	get
this gives you the ability to go more than just get post more rest-ful verbs using response status codes headers etc

1111261
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups

1111267
google-chrome	firefox
robeez.com works fine in a regular browser like google-chrome or firefox

1111273
perforce	cvs
xcode 3.1 has built in support for cvs subversion and perforce

1111294
onmousemove	onmouseup
the copy seems to be working fine but the onmousemove trigger doesn t seem to fire until the onmouseup trigger has fired

1111321
bazaar	git
btw the same thing applies to other gpl projects â as long as git mercurial bazaar remains under gpl don t hold your breath for apple to ship integration for them in xcode

1111379
put	get
if you put logic like this in inside the storeprodedure and log it somewhere you might get some info about the caller

1111389
getter	setter
it is recommended that you leave this field private and don t specify getter or setter for it as you want the jpa implementation to be singly responsible for this field

1111494
hash	salt
i understand that salt make the same password hash to different values

1111494
hash	salt
so let s say i am attacker here is how i might use a dictionary attack against a salt note in this example i don t write out 128 bit hash or salt for the sake of brevity

1111521
hash	salt
without salt the attacker can generate hash for every word in his dictionnary then run the new dictionnary against your passwords list

1111521
hash	salt
with salt each password is hash with a random string so even with the prior hash dictionnary knowledge he still have to re-create a new hash dictionnary containing the salt for every different salt in your database

1111533
ssl	https
anything sent over https is encrypted using ssl transport

1111542
ssl	https
https is http over ssl

1111543
hash	salt
salt just make it harder by forcing an attacker to hash the dictionary on a per-user effectively per-salt basis

1111568
width	height	subclass	accessor
you could subclass any builtin classes override the accessor for width height x y scalex scaley transform and visible to get most information .

1111568
width	height
the most simple thing really is to watch the width height on enterframe and if they change from one frame to another then redraw your border .

1111599
wav	riff
generally supporting the wav means supporting riff files although adding rifx support should not prove difficult

1111638
nsstring	nsdata
to create an nsstring from an nsdata you should use initwithdata encoding like the following

1111653
cdr	cons
you can share the tiny nodes towards the back of the list but you wind up having to duplicate the largest vlist node the moment you cons something onto the cdr of vlist that is still active

1111683
fortran	ada
this is the case for the c c++ obj-c d fortran java ada and other front-ends

1111744
inherited	properties
with the same kind of technique i can do runtime inherited by having a v-table for name lookup and dispatch function calls base on dynamic runtime properties

1111790
post	get
browse to it with your favorite browser and you ll actually get an explanation on how to post requests to it using various methods

1111868
dpkg	apt
edit this will work as long as you use only apt or one of its front-ends for upgrading installing packages that is as long as you don t use dpkg directly

1111931
put	get
upon launching one of these simple console applications i d like to get the input from a simple text file that i put together

1111980
pop-up	dialog
before starting it pop-up a progress dialog

1111991
profiler	hprof
i need to find out what of cpu is being consumed by the hprof profiler itself

1111995
qapplication	qobject	qobject	qmetaobject
once you have some code running in the target application you can just walk the qobject hierarchy starting from qapplication toplevelwidgets and using qmetaobject userproperty

1112016
int	double
i changed it to pdo param int in lack of a better alternative param double was not an option and got 10 digits precision in the double stored in postgres some progress at least

1112040
put	get
first you were mixing base 2 and base 10 in your question then when you put a number on the right side that is not divisible into the base you get problems

1112054
equals	gethashcode
this was really a pain so here s the code in c# for anyone who has a null datasource and needs to override the gethashcode and equals methods in the combobox

1112085
ssl	https
as the other posts say - https is http plaintext wrapped in ssl on top of the tcp ip layer

1112085
ssl	https
if you get both sides talking with http and everything breaks on https it s time to look at either the ssl session establishment or anything in between the two points that may be interrupting the flow

1112093
opera	firefox
this works on ie8 but not firefox or opera

1112105
hide	show
i want to hide show one of those rows based on a property

1112182
onchange	onblur
i have a web app that behaves a lot like a forms app with fields hitting a server to change data on every onblur or onchange depending on the form element

1112191
asterisk	ivr
what i want to do is that the openser server will receive the calls and route them to the least busy asterisk server which will take care of the rest i have an ivr menu set up in each of the servers

1112197
multiplying	add
multiplying add and abs functions are working as they should

1112204
cvs	svn
use svn or git or hg or cvs or.... and get the job done and done right

1112260
width	height
you omitted your calculations for width and height but assuming they are right you would end up with photo requiring 400x300x3 24bits 360k for the bitmap data itself which is not inordinately large

1112338
maven	m2e
i need a maven plugin preferrably m2e but i cannot find out how to install it

1112366
cck	pathauto
see this article on the acquia site for more including cck fields if you re using pathauto that should create paths on node_save

1112378
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to create a web application project template for everyone to use here at work that will minimize the amount of work that we have to do to create a new application with all our normal stuff and i was thinking that it would be nice to do some setup stuff add some records to a database when the developer creates a new application only if they tell it to and i would like to do it through a dialog like the one that pop-up for unit testing when you create a new asp.net mvc project

1112424
getter	setter
so to answere your question compilers easily optimize getter and setter out

1112438
sharepoint	splist
getting a new reference to the same sharepoint list splist newlist thislist.parentweb.lists thislist.id solved the issue

1112445
margin	height
basically the negative margin should match the height of the footer height 100 needs to be applied to html body and the position relative should be declared

1112467
getter	setter
i think dmd is currently unable to de-virtualize virtual getter and setter

1112498
pop-up	dialog
the most you can do is generate the javascript which will make it pop-up with a print dialog window.print but that wouldnt help you with what you re trying to do

1112516
vb6	vba
official ms support perhaps but still the community is alive for both vb6 and vba here on so

1112520
setinterval	settimeout
you can opt to do the polling completely on the client side though with settimeout or setinterval

1112566
yacc	bison
edit i downloaded the source code for bison the yacc clone used by linux and looked for yy_create_buffer

1112571
stdout	stderr
if it s a good little boy and it pipes it s log info out to stdout or stderr you could redirect the output to a program that you write which could then write the contents out to disk and manage the sizes

1112582
post	put
i know this is an old post just wanted to put this out there for anybody else

1112638
opera	safari
in fact you do not know if the browser is even using separate win32 window handles for tabs as it may just have one handle for its main window and draw everything inside by itself qt and wpf applications do that and i believe that opera in particular does that and probably so does safari

1112638
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i don t see any options for opera safari or google-chrome

1112643
strftime	strtotime
mdb2 has a date type that displays yyyy-mm-dd format but could easily be turned into m d y with strftime and strtotime

1112643
strftime	strtotime
edit obviously you ll have to use strftime and strtotime on each row separately

1112643
strftime	strtotime
if you switch mdb2_fetchmode_object to mdb2_fetchmode_ordered or mdb2_fetchmode_assoc above you can probably use a foreach loop to run strftime and strtotime on all of the rows that need to be reformatted

1112649
width	height
the height and width properties any

all i want to do is highlight random text images or text and images using my mouse in the browser and drag it imagine highlighting this parenthesized statement and dragging it - no need for an actual draggable over to the droppable area

1112989
children	parent
a common design scenario for setting a column to null is if you have a one to many parent child relationship but the children do not have to be present

1112989
children	parent
when a parent record like an account has children that can be deleted like help requests this is a good usage

1113013
inherited	properties
...and a panel textrzpanel which inherited from a raize panel and adds some sizing moving functionality to it along w a few other properties features

1113028
inherited	properties
in other words you can pass parameters either in the constructor or as properties of your inherited class just make sure the parameters are passed before the thread is started resumed

1113043

1113245
g++	gcc
if you have visual studio which i feel is an excellent ide you can try to set it up to use gcc g++

1113270
width	height
the problem is that the height variable gets set just fine whereas the width variable contains nan â 2147483648

1113270
accessor	properties
also the xcode debugger tooltip shows both properties in the texture correctly only after the width gets through the two accessor the number gets garbled

1113271
rss	feed
an rss feed is just an alternative representation of the same resource

1113282

cvs	svn	perforce	svn	perforce	cvs
there are many different source control providers including tfs subversion svn perforce cvs and visual source safe to name but a few

1113435
perforce	svn
tfs svn and perforce tend to get pretty good feedback from their users

1113435
perforce	svn
out of these svn is the only one that is free so if you are planning to do this as a learning exercise i d be inclined to start there actually i believe you can get a free 2 user license for perforce too but i m not 100 sure on that

1113524
put	get
obviously you may want to put it in a function or class so you can get at it from anywhere without having to duplicate the code all over the place

1113702
width	height
you will probably have better luck if you set the height and width of the main surfacewindow in the xaml file

1113702
width	height
at runtime the surfacewindow s height width is set to the surface screen s size but at design time in blend there is no height and width and this can cause problems with designers

1113712
ninject	spring.net
now you can use an inversion of control container like windsor unity ninject or spring.net to configure your development environment versus release environment

1113745
postgresql	mysql
for example i often test using sqlite and use mysql or postgresql in production with no changes in code

1113747

1113803
put	get
i won t touch on specifics of graphic design that seems outside the scope of so but a good place to start is to get a graphics designer to put together some conceptual screens and then as a developer your job will be to build controls to match that

1113806
int	boolean
check out pseudo boolean constraints also called 0-1 int programming

1113814
cvs	svn
hudson can checkout your code from svn or cvs and can run a shell script or ant file as a build script

1113838
subtract	add
an integer literally stores a number which you can add subtract etc

1113849
for-loop	arrays
one way to verify this would be to set up a for-loop that wrote to every element in the arrays and then check the memory usage of the application

1113855
put	get
is it not better if i put all the return codes in an enum as i clearly do not worry about the values it get only the names while checking the return types

1113859

it also means that you can store the passwords in a more secure way a one way salt hash that does not permit password retrieval in any way which if they could be retrieved would be a potential security risk in itself

1113907
width	margin
when you say width 30 or width 70 it implies the width of the content inside the div excluding the padding border and margin of the div

1113920
opera	firefox
tested in opera 10b firefox 3.5 internet explorer 8

1114017
integer	unsigned
i ve seen people use size_t whenever they mean an unsigned integer

1114020
visualvm	yourkit
i used to really like yourkit but visualvm does so much now

1114025
getter	setter
as soon as i write the member variables i like to go to source - generate getter and setter

1114033
maven	m2e
it s also worthwhile mentioning m2e it integrates maven into eclipse and allows you to optionally resolve dependencies from the workspace

1114041
integer	unsigned
in your example i would probably use a typedef for a 32-bit or 64-bit unsigned integer rather than using int or unsigned int or size_t

1114043
min	max
the progress bar itself is easy to use you set the min and max value i ve set it to 100 to repressent 100

1114056
post	get

the unsigned integer types are ideal for uses that treat storage

1114092
listbox	icollectionview
i added an icollectionview to manage the selected item on the listbox

it shows how i split sentences put them in listbox that helps easily get the item count

1114219
button	checkbox
in visual c++ 2008 express edition when adding forms all of the default handlers for button checkbox etc go into formname.h by default

1114235
multiplying	add
there are some really cool and complicated functions that describe how to find integrals and such with computers but because we can t be exact with our answers and because computers are limited with what they can do add multiplying etc there are lots of methods of how to estimate math to a great deal of precision

1114259
profiling	debugging
profiling on the debugging build is usually pretty pointless especially in c++ because debugging heaps have a lot of extra checking that totally changes the performance profiling of a typical application

1114261
codeigniter	kohana
i just spent some time going over the logic for the codeigniter and kohana session libraries and i came up with the following on how each starts and ends sessions for the page

1114296
setinterval	settimeout
take a look at the settimeout and setinterval javascript functions

1114297
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
over time gecko konqueror opera safari and google-chrome each decide to similarly spoof the user-agent of some previous browser in order to manipulate browser-sniffing web pages into correctly understanding their browser s features

1114297
google-chrome	safari
plenty of other nonsense also results like modern google-chrome s user-agent simultaneously claiming to be mozilla google-chrome safari and like gecko

1114321
cpu	processors
when a processors interrupt occurs due to an external device the cpu will save the current program counter and usually the flags register on the stack and jump to the handling subroutine

1114337
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i had tried placing the block of rewrite directives in three places in the part of the httpd.conf file at the top of my httpd.conf file and in the var www html .htaccess

1114338
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
this will return a cgrect which in itself is comprised of a cgpoint called origin and a cgsize called size

1114338
cgpoint	cgsize	cgpoint	cgrect	cgsize	cgrect
however most co-ordinates rely on cgrect cgpoint and cgsize in some way or another

1114387
int	chars
you should be able to convert a hex chars array or string to an int value using the todigit method

1114401
int	chars
public static int digit chars ch int radix

1114424
kde	gnome
you can take a look at the code of the x terminal emulators kterm for kde or gnome terminal for gnome depending of your target platform

1114437
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
i ve coded a basic login system using the jtextfield jpasswordfield and jbutton classes

1114464
hide	show

1114464
hide	show
then you can dynamically show or hide the jpanels

1114487
public	protected
ruby has public private and protected to enforce access instead of pythonâ s convention of using underscores and name mangling

this is best achieved using the directx api waitforverticalblank part of directdraw from v7 onward i believe

1114562
punctuation	words
matching words can be as easy as a simple regular expression but could vary with how you want to handle punctuation

1114630
hide	show
i want get an immediate printout of all project_01 features or bug fixes on a particular project with the option to hide or show developer comments that have been implemented in the last x number of days

1114641
tiff	png
my icon designers typically provide me with a vector file format version of my icon usually an illustrator file a 512x512px tiff file which is submitted to apple for use in the appstore and a 57x57px png which is used as the actual application icon

1114733
distance	altitude
i would suggest that over any distance where using the wgs84 would give you significantly better accuracy that the difference in altitude won t matter

1114794
windows	wow64
wow64 - 32-bit ie on a 64-bit windows

1114795
bazaar	git	cornerstone	git
honestly there s nothing with the polish of versions or cornerstone for git mercurial or bazaar yet

1114796
pull	push
they are roughly similar to csv files or other forms of tabular data--you can pull data into them from a database work with the data and then push the changes back to a database--but they on their own are not databases

1114844
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i have tried in the viewwillappear viewdidappear etc.

1114880
g++	gcc
gcc g++ open source proven refined by years of collaborative experience on many linux and unix systems

1114935
put	get
so...on one hand there is the option of staying organized the way i ve been doing for years and allowing intellisense to be the way that a new user of an assembly quickly gets up to speed with its functionality and just lump it for the includes... the other way is to put everything in one namespace...and write good docuementation on how to get started with the assembly.

1114968
inherited	properties
you can change the button s frame an inherited properties from uiview by adding a method to do so in the view controller .m file that manages the button then adding that method as an action for a control event on the button

1114995
datamapper	activerecord
incidentally this is one area that datamapper kicks activerecord s butt soundly

1114995
jobs	cron
the one thing i don t like about cron+rake is that rake is virtually guaranteed to print to standard output and cron tends to be excessively chatty if your cron jobs produce output

1115002
getter	setter
in as3 you define getter and setter like

1115002
getter	setter
thus getter and setter in as3 essentially look like obfuscated properties

1115010
min	max
when i add gmarkers to a google map i can specifiy the min and max zoom levels at which the marker should be displayed using markermanager

1115042
apache	nginx
nginx seems to have a module for mail servers but i am on apache + php

1115045
serializable	deserialization
i m not sure if i understand your problem but you can try implementing the iserializable interface in your class to manually fine-tune the serializable deserialization processes

1115063
pylons	turbogears
i am considering whether i should use turbogears or pylons for my project

1115076
pylons	toscawidgets	pylons	turbogears	turbogears	toscawidgets
turbogears emphasises integration while pylons emphasises modularity -- with tg2 you re getting such components as genshi toscawidgets and sqlalchemy all integrated and coordinated

1115086
led	electronics
the need to allow space for an ever growing range of peripheral expansions led to the original decision to segment the address space into electronics memory from 0-640k and other stuff input output roms video memory etc from 640k to 1mb

1115119
hex	binary
it s only slightly less difficult and error-prone than modifying strings in a binary executable using a hex editor

1115152
width	height
if you want to scale really everything including font sizes you could probably apply a scale transform to your content and bind it s x and y values to the window s width and height

1115154
versioning	upgrade
by keeping the legacy containers and scheme you can upgrade any versioning to the latest

1115156
width	height
simplify the problem by calculating the width and height of the rectangle

1115157
vim	emacs
i wish there existed color scheme quick setups like both emacs and vim have had for decades

1115167
codeigniter	cakephp
if you want to dig deeper you could check out a framework like codeigniter or cakephp

1115171
superclass	subclassing
sadly you need what i consider a hack making a one-to-one reference from subclassing to superclass restaurant to place

1115206
implements	extends	jinternalframe	jlayeredpane
you could implements your main game display and control panel as the background of a jdesktoppane which extends jlayeredpane and could make the pop ups jinternalframe

1115219
superclass	subclassing
remember that although wildcardbuddies is a reference to a pair of employee subtypes the object it points to is quite specifically a pair of managers and conversion from a superclass employee to a subclassing manager is not allowed

1115225
firefox	safari
my only leads are from safari unmatched embed tag firefox browser pretends chart never loads even though it has ie non-specific prototype.js error

1115282
apache	nginx
if using nginx as front end in front of apache mod_wsgi you could use x-accel-redirect now

1115359
width	height
the second thing isn t as much a problem but something i can t figure out when either the height or width of my rectangle is negative the rectangle is filled in black

1115373
inherited	properties
to explain the loop check first if the properties is a user defined properties as opposed to being inherited from the object object

1115449
ubuntu	linux
i am writing the program for linux i m using ubuntu 9.04 and using gcc

1115462
put	get
if it becomes too expensive to update the data in the mapping table at the same time as the primary table you could put a message on a queue and get a worker role to perform the updates for you asynchronously

1115476
opera	firefox
your only real loss then would be having an improper font-weight for older non-ie browsers like firefox 3.0 and lower and opera 9.2x and lower

1115482
config	ini
ini files is the way i use to store config in zend framework look at the sample config

1115487
getter	setter
use a different serializer such as datacontractserializer which also supports private getter setter or fields but doesn t support full xml control - for example see here

1115497
getter	setter
in this example boo will have id property with public setter and getter

1115497
serializable	deserialization
use boo for xml serializable and deserialization and use foo for handling business logic

1115514
gridview	linqdatasource
i have gridview in my page and i set it s datasource to linqdatasource also i set allowpaging true allowsorting true

1115539
width	height
it can work with either absolute or relative positioning as long as the image width and height are defined

1115602
eurekalog	madexcept
also you have also commercial options for this madexcept eurekalog etc. but these are only advanced error loggers while jvcl besides that s free will give you also over 600 components to play with

1115647
boost	stl
as long as my ide doesn t support view short typenames i m leaning towards using declarations for commonly known symbols the stl boost ...

1115728
stringbuilder	stringwriter
stringwriter stringbuilder you are implicitly using .net s utf-16 string

1115741
vim	emacs
i don t know much about emacs so you may regard the following as off-topic but i work with both eclipse and vim

1115840
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are generally smaller faster and optimized for text editing and navigation

1115862
google-chrome	safari
this code gets the desired functionality to work like charm but only on google-chrome and safari

1115880
rsa	aes
modern symmetric aes and asymmetric rsa cryptosystems are very secure read practically impossible to break in themselves but the way you use the cryptosystem and user behavior changes everything

1115889
implements	extends
also a class can implements many interfaces but can only extends one abstract class

1115910
hash	md5
just ask for the name and calculate a hash such as sha1 or md5 for that name maybe lowercase and strip whitespace first prefixed with some secret text that is hardcoded in your program

1115922
mouseover	mouseout
in the mouseover event or the first method of the hover event you start a timed function that causes the scroll and in the mouseout event or the second method of the hover event you stop the timed function

1115964
int	chars
the thing that is going wrong here is that self.id requires an int and openssl digest.sha1.hexdigest uuid.timestamp_create returns a string with non-numeric chars which would lead to the value 0 being actually stored in the database

1115969
eurekalog	madexcept
both eurekalog and madexcept do pretty much exactly what you re after

1115969
mantis	bugzilla
both give great output and have support to connect into bug tracking systems like fogbugz mantis and bugzilla

1116053
feedback	review
if you re heavily re-writing someone else s code you re effectively taking the time to review it anyway you just aren t providing the feedback which is the worthwhile part of code review

1116053
feedback	review
so sneak the review in under the radar - write a function or three then ask a colleague to look at it and give you instant feedback on whether it makes sense to them

1116116
xna	spritebatch
i will also point out that i am using xna to develop this game but i have almost no grasp of all the classes available yet pretty much only using the game component with some classes that are related to it such as gametime spritebatch graphicdevicemanager but not much more

1116135
versioning	upgrade
i highly recommend memberwing they have a free versioning that is quite enabled and the upgrade is only us 100

1116139
uiview	subviews
remember that uibutton inherits from uiview and so you can add subviews to it just like any other view

1116253
keydown	keyup
you shouldn t use the keypress event but the keyup or keydown event because the keypress event is intended for real printable characters

1116259
valgrind	callgrind
you may be able to use valgrind callgrind with the flag to achieve this

1116281
put	get
simply put the constructor call config values and the call to the start method in the callback function that handles the results you get from the ajax request

1116331
mkmapview	mapkit
the error is not thrown when i import mapkit mapkit.h or when i declare a variable as mkmapview mapview

1116433
converter	multibinding

1116456
disk	ram
more ram and faster disk help a lot

1116527
yslow	pagespeed
use yslow or pagespeed to identify bottlenecks

1116572
int	double
maybe your calculator method can be applied to two different set of parameters say on an int and on a double

1116594
margin	height
this is because slideup works by reducing the height to 0 but it doesn t change the margin

1116597
post	get
bots just sending post or get data without loading the page just get filtered too

1116651
gif	png
one cool feature is the ability to send an array of bytes to a server side script which allows you to save jpg gif and png onto a server directly from flash

1116676
put	get
by the way you could use joptionpane to put up a little gui to get user input .

1116713
slideup	slidedown
jrails redefines slideup and slidedown for some reason

1116802
spaces	delimiter
it is just that your input needs to be delimiter by spaces

1116802
spaces	delimiter
if you input a single number and hit enter there will be no spaces and as you have set your scanner up to be delimiter by spaces it wont find anything

1116806
int	double
there s an overload for interlocked.exchange specifically for float and others for double int long intptr and object

1116831
put	get
now my problem is that if i put the code for read-function before the code for action-function i get an error in read-function saying that it doesn t know what action-function is because the code for it is further down and if i do the opposite well i get a similar error obviously saying that read-function cannot be resolved etc

1116831
put	get
if i put the code for these two functions in the reverse order i will get an error saying

1116860
hash	md5
i m currently using md5 hash but i would like to find something that will create a shorter hash that uses just a-z a-z 0-9

1116870
hash	md5
you could take the first alphanumeric 5-10 characters of the md5 hash

1116871
domxpath	domdocument
one possibility domdocument and domxpath

1116877
domxpath	domdocument
if youâ ve not just a fracture like the one mentioned use a real parser like domdocument that you can walk through with domxpath

1116883
hash	md5
you can decrease the number of characters from the md5 hash by encoding them as alphanumerics

1116937
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
another option is to use progressive enhancement with font-face with your chosen font which is supported by firefox 3.5 opera 10 and i think safari

1116993
maven	pom.xml
if you use the maven plugin m2clipse you can precise the manifest file in the maven configuration file of your project pom.xml in the build section

1117008
hash	md5
you could encode your md5 hash code with base64 instead of hexadecimal this way you get a shorter url using exactly the characters a-z a-z 0-9

1117074
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i am writing an app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontroller

1117138
ienumerable	ilist
a quick look-up on msdn revealed that ilist t s insert method only has a version which takes an index and an object t and does not have a version which takes ienumerable t instead of t

1117163
subtraction	addition
you ll find other such methods for right addition right subtraction etc

1117178
width	height
in the third table width and height are explicitly defined

1117178
width	height
we would like to avoid explicitly setting height and width and so if we could get modify either of the first two tables to match the clickable-behavior of the third that would be fantastic

1117183
debian	linux
if you want something more fancy on linux you can try the classic curses library or if you just want a dialog box you could try the library that the debian install utilities use but i forget its name

1117273
hide	show
how to show and hide div every 1min in jquery

1117289
hide	show
to flip show hide you can do something like this

1117333
folder	directory
i have a directory public_html myfolder and i want my domain www.example.com to point to public_html myfolder as my root folder

1117349
stdout	stderr
on the other hand forms application don t have the stdin stdout and stderr connected and while they can behave as command line tools and process command arguments they have problems when embedded in scripts because the standard input output is not hooked up

1117368
ssl	ntlm	kerberos	ntlm
you can take out the authenticated stream part ssl or kerberos ntlm if you really don t need it and then it becomes

1117409
int	double
for harvey such as fewer casts better intelliprompt linq and better performance if you are using collections of structs such as int and double

1117423
lisp	smalltalk
this practice goes back to the earliest dynamic languages like smalltalk and lisp

1117426
nsexception	nserror
aside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to

1117431
x86	64bit
if you compile normally the clr will run your app as 64bit on x64 windows and 32-bit on x86 windows

1117457
hash	md5
i have a database application that generates a md5 hash and compares the hash value to a value in our db sql 2k

1117457
hash	md5
i realize this may not be the best method to hash but utimately any changes to the md5 code would force us to change some 300 values in our db table and would cost us a lot of time

1117503
post	get
a reset_password get action or a start_reset_password post action it just doesn t really sit right it seems i am trying to make these controllers do too much work

1117507
next	except
as an aside i m also applying flat is better than nested in another way not dependent on any try except which is if i have nothing more to do on this leg of the loop continue move on to the next leg of the loop instead of if i have something to do followed by a substantial amount of nested code

1117517
hash	md5
i don t think the .net md5 hash code have changed in visualstudio 2008

1117520
post	put
send email costly action which you don t want repeated and you do want executed every time the user requests it post or put on any url you want

1117520
post	put
reset password based on token i d consider implementing this as a login-via-token instead but if you re going to do it your way then it has server-side consequences and hence should probably be a post or put

1117531
try-catch	exception-handling
another option that can help is to wrap only the offending code with a try-catch putting the exception-handling handler as close to the exception-handling as possible

1117550
vb.net	vb6
same goes for vb.net by the way - spaces inside square brackets used to work in vb6 but they don t in vb.net

1117577
rss	feed
i have a bunch of texts and images taken from the content tag of a rss feed item that i want to display in my app

1117614
updatepanel	formview
once you get it working normally try putting the formview into an updatepanel and see if the bind still works

1117619
hide	show
you just need to connect to the change on the select check the val and hide show the div

1117623
trie	tree
in that case r b tree or trie s might be the best way

1117627
getter	setter
private is really so that you are not using variables globally so you make use of getter and setter in classes which helps loosen coupling

1117640
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
writing your own code is definitely an option but layout engines ie webkit in uiwebview safari or gecko in firefox is a complicated task

1117688
division	multiplication
the cpu operation for float division is much more complicated than multiplication

1117688
division	multiplication
i would also be careful about always using multiplication of the reciprocal instead of division to gain cpu performance they may not give exactly the same results

1117693
base-class	derived-class
otherwise the problem i m attempting to learn my way through is one of setting base-class member types based on arguments passed to a derived-class constructor using templates

1117693
base-class	derived-class
if there were a way to set the base-class member type t foo-t simply by passing arguments to the derived-class constructor i would prefer that

1117696
subtract	add
think about it in terms of elementary operations that hardware can more easily implement -- add subtract shift compare

1117696
division	multiplication
as you see even at this small size number of bits in the numbers and with libraries optimized by exactly the same speed-obsessed people multiplication by the reciprocal can save 1 3 of the time that division takes

1117702
addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication

1117724
hide	show
one thing you can do is make the height fixed and use overflow css property set to hide to hide the text and use the title attribute to show the whole text in a tooltip

1117741
ubuntu	centos
in our case this development stack is running under ubuntu workstation components eclipse ide maven and centos server components maven nexus subversion trac hudson sonar

1117779
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs filesystems is the most generous in naming files

1117783
hide	show
and some stuff i d like to hide and show in correspondence to clicks on those triggers like so

1117836
redmine	trac
with regards to annotation you might be able to get away with using one of the code review plugins for either trac or redmine

1117847
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
i am trying to do a painting program with qt 4.5 so i am using the qgraphicsview for the canvas and qgraphicsscene to store the items drawn

1117847
qgraphicsview	qpainter
for some reasons i just couldn t get a qpainter context in my own derived qgraphicsview

1117847
qgraphicsview	qframe	qgraphicsview	qwidget	qframe	qwidget
seeing that qgraphicsview is derived from qabstractscrollarea then qframe then qwidget i would expecting that the code would work

1117941
inherited	properties
i inherited the tabcontrol and i added a properties called tabsvisible and corrected it

1117974
for-loop	loops
if you do iterate through the list use a foreach loops instead of a for-loop

1117978
public	protected
private is imo always best at first and then make public protected as the need arises

1118005
inherited	properties
to use it create an instance of the object then set the image properties inherited from uiimageview to the picture and overlaycolor to a uicolor value the blend levels can be adjusted by changing the alpha value of the color you pass down

1118035
super	self
super classwithlotsofattributes self .__init__ args kwargs

1118035
super	self
super classwithlotsofattributes self .__init__ args kwargs

1118050
division	multiplication
any well written program will do the multiplication and division necessary to scale the font properly and in the newest versions of windows the os will lie about the resolution and scale the fonts automatically

1118100
firefox	safari
presently our application is compatible with ie and firefox browsers but we are not able to browse the application in safari

1118182
public	protected
the fields were made private yes you can use private protected with records and added read-only properties to the public section

1118228
django	turbogears
am sure you would have read from plenty of comparison between turbogears and django on web

1118261
getter	setter
if a class contains a variable named blah then the standard getter setter syntax is obviously getblah and setblah

1118261
getter	setter
the first seems to conform more strictly to the pojo conventions but the second type is what intellij generates if i ask it to make a class getter setter and hey intellij has never let me down yet

1118320
getter	setter
only the names of the getter setter are relevant

1118362
maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
if you redirect the output to a file and search for maven-antrun-plugin i suspect you ll see that it is declared in the build section of the effective pom.xml

1118401
vim	emacs
vim and emacs do just fine as well

1118409
rss	feed
i m using .net s syndicationfeed to create rss and atom feed

1118441
post	get
for example i d like to get post ordered by number of postlovers and

1118479
post	get
the iphone app will use get or post to retrieve data from the web services such as to get data for top ten songs for example

1118494
qgraphicsview	qpainter
i guess the moral of this is that there is no qpainter context within a qgraphicsview and you are better off ignoring its paintevent

1118506
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason new data never loads in ie 7 but loads fine in firefox and google-chrome

1118516
jobs	cron
the best option would be to put jobs in a queue and run the shell as a cron job every so often which then processes the queue

1118595
int	chars
a printf in the next line shows buf to be 300 chars in length but int len gives only 89

1118601
debian	linux
on both my cygwin and my linux box debian i m experiencing same issue

1118611
firefox	safari
i ve tested the following in firefox and safari and it works although it s perhaps not the nicest solution

1118670
django	turbogears
in my experience it is simply less hassle to use django compared with turbogears

1118678
folder	directory
check whether folder already exist at the destination in which case move files in that folder over and continue traversing the source directory structure otherwise move the folder wholesale

1118724
button	checkbox
for many controls such as a button or a checkbox setting will suffice to prevent any interaction between the user and the control

1118742
put	get
put all the functions you want to select from into a dll then use dlsym or getprocaddress on windows or whatever other api your system offers to get the function pointer by name and call using that

1118892
inherited	properties
however in c++ inherited is a properties of types whereas const is a mere qualifier on top of types

1118895
expression-blend	silverlight
on microsoft showcase there are a lot of great video tutorial about silverlight and expression-blend

1118909
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

1118936
instances	transient	persistent	transient
the javadoc for hibernate session.persist i know you re not using the hibernate api but the semantics are the same and the hibernate docs are better says make a transient instances persistent

1118997
ant	maven
you can have ant scripts inside maven use maven-antrun-plugin i can provide examples if requested

1119058
min	max
i also know you can do this by fetching the max min value you are interested in in a subquery using min max then use that result as a criterion in your main select

1119124
persistent	transient
since the id type is assigned nhibernate has no idea how to tell if the object is transient or persistent

1119134
free	malloc
i want to know how malloc and free work

1119162
free	malloc
one implementation of malloc free does the following

1119163
free	malloc
this has nothing specifically to do with malloc and free

1119163
free	malloc
this would be true even if you never used malloc and free and allocated the char array on the stack or statically

1119175
free	malloc
when you free memory malloc takes that memory block off the chain.

1119190
free	malloc
malloc and free are implementation dependent

1119190
free	malloc
when you malloc a block is pulled from the free list

1119197
free	malloc
how malloc and free works depends on the runtime library used

1119225
free	malloc
as far as malloc free implementation goes - entire books are devoted to the topic

1119319
free	malloc
there s a sample implementation of malloc and free in the book kernighan and ritchie the c programming language

1119322
pop-up	dialog
returning the message as a string will pop-up a confirmation dialog containing your message

1119334
free	malloc
the more interesting part is how free works and in this direction malloc too can be understood better

1119334
free	malloc
in many malloc free implementations free does normally not return the memory to the operating system or at least only in rare cases

1119334
free	malloc
this is also the reason why managing very small memory elements with the standard malloc free is not efficient

1119334
free	malloc
but since malloc and free must be so universal the standard behaviour is always the fallback when alternatives are not usable

1119334
free	malloc
you know your next free or malloc will crash but you don t know why

1119346
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
if that isn t possible you can write the bytes you read from the inputstream to a bytearrayoutputstream which will grow as required

1119347
webclient	webrequest
i have also tried using the webclient class but i suspect it uses a webrequest internally

1119371
free	malloc
malloc and free don t work the same way on every o s

1119390
integer	unsigned
which is the unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator

1119399
memset	strncpy	memset	memcmp	memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memcmp	memcpy	memset	strncpy	memcmp	strncmp	strncpy	strncmp	memset	strncmp	memmove	strncmp	memcmp	strncmp	memcpy	memmove	strncpy	memmove	memcmp	memmove	memset
in it is used as the type of the parameter num in the functions memchr memcmp memcpy memmove memset strncat strncmp strncpy and strxfrm which in all cases it is used to specify the maximum number of bytes or characters the function has to affect

1119430
inherited	properties
unless specified the color properties basically defaults to inherited which means take the value of the parent element

1119473
iprincipal	iidentity
i have my own iprincipal iidentity and membershipprovider

1119481
inherited	properties
another alternative would be to inherited from toolstripmenuitem and override the set of the text properties to replace with

1119482
lisp	smalltalk
i have read numerous time that learning a language such as haskell lisp or smalltalk will somehow make you a better programmer while you program in other languages

1119483
concave	convex
this code works for both concave and convex polygons of completely arbitrary shape and is able to handle any line orientation

1119484
integer	unsigned
size_t is the unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator iso c99 section 7.17.

1119484
integer	unsigned
its type an unsigned integer type is size_t iso c99 section 6.5.3.4.

1119544
cvs	svn
jira also integrates with cvs and svn

1119557
sml	scheme	ocaml	sml	ocaml	scheme	lisp	sml	lisp	scheme
the list then include lisp scheme dylan ocaml and sml

1119593
width	height
the required memory for uncompressed rgba image is width height 4 bytes

1119623
hash	md5
what you can do is get a secret key that only you know include that in an md5 hash signature typically you can structure signatures as a s tring of your parameters a nd values and the secret appended at the end then take the md5 hash of that...do this both in your client and service side and match the signature string only if the signatures match do you get granted access...since t he secret is only present i n the signature it w ill be hard to reverse engineer and crack

1119626
min	max
set the min and max size of form to same numbers

1119626
min	max
do not show min and max buttons

1119690
gif	png
if you don t know the image type like you want to handle gif and png as well or if you think the extension may occur multiple times in the filename image.jpg.jpg then you will want a template to help you

1119707
gridview	detailsview
i have a master details setup with a gridview and detailsview both in updatepanels

1119707
gridview	detailsview
when the detailsview is edited and updated i want these changes to be reflected in the gridview but without rebinding that data which could change the selecteditem s sort order among other problems it causes on detailsview itemupdated i have the following

1119713
distance	polygons
i would start by bounding all the polygons by a bounding circle and then finding an upper bound of the minimal distance

1119713
distance	polygons
then i would simply check the edges of all blue polygons whose lower bound of distance is lower than the upper bound of minimal distance against all the edges of the red polygons

1119713
distance	polygons
for every blue polygons where distance red s center current blue s center - current blue s radius upper bound of min distance

1119713
distance	polygons
if the blue polygons are relatively small compared to the distance between them and the red polygons then this approach should work nicely but if they are very close you won t save anything many of them will be close enough

1119737
ordinals	difference
i actually found a better way to this it s actually built in the system plus it uses the internal ordinals metadata of the entities which are loaded anyway i haven t tested the performance difference but this should be hell of a lot faster than reflection

1119757
mp3	wav
if it s exactly the same sound but not sample-accurate matching a clip of an mp3 to a wav of the same song for instance you can easily find it using cross-correlation

1119791
zlib	libpng
but you can consider looking at the ones used by fairly portable libraries like libpng zlib etc

1119810
ienumerable	ilist
if your item is acting as a list you may want to implement an interface like ilist or ienumerable ienumerable

1119890
pull	push
it can be used to push put a view into a region or pull let modules declare which region they populate

1119911
config	ini
a common bottleneck is file access - a config file ini file that is required to launch the application can perform well on a developer machine but perform abysmally in different deployment situations

1119950
codeigniter	kohana
makes me think that you might be using codeigniter or kohana

1119955
ssl	https
if you want security transmit your data over https http with ssl

1119956
hide	show
i want to hover the containing the image and then show or hide the element

1119969
hash	salt
basically you take the user s password apply a hashing function if that s the way it s stored on the server then you take a server challenge token and salt the password value for a new hash

1119977
crypt	hash
you should hash your passwords and store the hash password in the database see crypt

1119997
hide	show
i m using a list to build a simple nav menu that show when you hover and hide when you leave it

1120001
post	get
now i have to pass a variable from silverlight to mvc not with get post

1120009
distance	polygons
pick any blue polygons and find the distance from the red one

1120009
distance	polygons
if the minimum distance between the bounding areas is greater than the already found distance you can ignore this polygons

1120009
distance	polygons
find the minimum distance centroid distance between the red polygons and all the blue polygons

1120009
distance	polygons
calculate the actual minimum distance and continue through the sorted list until the maximum distance between the polygons is greater than the minimum distance found so far

1120009
distance	polygons
for the actual minimum distance calculation you could use yang et al s a new fast algorithm for computing the distance between two disjoint convex polygons based on voronoi diagram which is o log n + log m

1120081
mouseover	mouseout
what i recommend you do is to use a javascript framework such as jquery which has cross-browser handling of mouseover and mouseout

1120081
mouseleave	mouseenter
even better it has mouseenter and mouseleave which are special events that are sure to only trigger once per mouse entering leaving of an element even if it has child elements

1120081
mouseleave	mouseenter
see demo of mouseenter mouseleave events in jquery

1120139
post	get
when i submit my comments i get comment post not allowed 400 why missing content_type or object_pk field

1120157
hash	md5
then when the client connects have the client generate another random string append that to the end of the shared string then calculate the md5 hash

1120168
postgresql	mysql
many databases at least mysql and postgresql maybe all has a database called information_schema or something similar

1120186
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
as far as the spinning part goes you just track the location and movement of touches in your view with touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended

1120247
textview	imageview
i put an imageview and a textview within a relativelayout that is used as list items and want the imageview to grow vertically with the line number of textview

1120365
post	get
by the way to get post from a particular category use

1120381
hash	salt
say a user registers for your site you hash the password they have chosen then use that hash as a salt and rehash their password with that salt

1120391
super	self
super unapproveduser self is wrong it should be super unapproveduser cls because in class method you do not have self available

1120431
hash	md5
also you should avoid md5 in favor of a currently-strong hash algorithm such as sha1 sha-256 sha-512

1120436
hash	salt
if they know your hash function but not your salt the salt has protected your passwords

1120436
hash	salt
if they know both the hash function and your salt your data is at risk

1120597
ati	nvidia
until windows vista ati and nvidia supported a feature called horizontal span which combined two monitors into a single larger screen

1120624
rdf	owl
the final thing to keep in mind is what semantic web for the working ontologist modeling in rdf rdfs and owl calls wishful names

1120626
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
therefore code should be written and tested around firefox google-chrome safari which are much closer to proper standards support than ie8 then conditional tags should be used in ie to work around its bugs

1120626
firefox	safari
this is particularly the case seeing as you can use conditional tags to work around ie bugs but if you try to code in reverse it s much harder to write hacks to force firefox safari etc to display the coded-broken html css correctly

1120632
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the selenium ide is a firefox browser extension no ie version available yet but selenium works in most web browsers including ie firefox safari and opera

1120637
cvs	svn
i am pushing for cvs svn

1120637
cvs	svn
wondering how this would integrate with an svn cvs cycle

1120641
ssl	https
by default versions of windows internet explorer that were released starting with the release of security update 832894 do not support handling user names and passwords in http and http with secure sockets layer ssl or https urls

1120641
opera	firefox
if you are using firefox or opera you are ok as long as you configure the iis website directory security to allow basic authentication

1120667
google-chrome	firefox
whereas other browsers such as firefox and google-chrome have the benefit of learning from ms s mistakes

1120684
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
code to firefox work around for ie make sure it works the same way in google-chrome and safari and ignore the rest

1120698
mouse	keyboard
basically it will put an http interface on java.awt.robot so code in any language can simulate mouse keyboard events

1120702
firefox	safari
most important in my eyes you have a claim that it s you can use conditional tags to work around ie bugs but if you try to code in reverse it s much harder to write hacks to force firefox safari etc to display the coded-broken html css correctly. this claim of a lack of symmetry is non-intuitive to my eyes but if true is quite a strong argument

1120830
cvs	svn
i ve used svn cvs clearcase and mercurial

1120844
inherited	subclassing
1 single table inherited you create a single tasktarget table that has every field that every subclassing might want

1120871
opera	firefox
also works firefox 3 on windows and opera

1120928
rss	feed
for example if you want some kind of software that checks rss feed every 5 minutes and makes a little pop-up as soon as a new one comes along

1120935
post	get
for a really simple solution you could even just dump your post get data into a session variable then call it up quickly on the page being redirected to almost making the redirect transparent from a logic point of view

1120951
int	chars
here each single 0 or 1 is actually a bit that needs to be stored as it is in the jpeg file but since we can t write bit by bit into file a total of 8 bits are taken and converted into a int value in base 10 and stored into a 1-byte chars

1120968
post	get
- pass back to the page using get post fine

1120992
firefox	safari
data uris work in firefox 3.0.11 and safari 4.0 and probably other compliant browsers but i can t get this approach to work in ie 8.0

1120995
folder	directory
the problem is that for a subfolder in the tutorials directory say www tutorials abc which contains an index.html using one url displays the page as is whereas the other url shows the folder contents and does not display the index.html file

when drawing the text pass a matrix scaled up by factors 2 and scale down the bitmap by factors 2 .

1121082
getattr	setattr
just like getattr and setattr delattr should only be used when the attribute name is unknown

1121128
width	height
had i been using native c++ i could have used a pointer to the x or y member also width height and so on and passed it in as a parameter so that i need implement each algorithm only once

1121136
post	get
write a little bit of javascript on the page to indicate whether the request generating the view was a get or post

1121140

also note that without a time string slow normal fast or a time in ms 1000 2000 as an argument toggle will simply hide and show the elements without the fading animation you are looking for

1121147
jquery	scriptaculous	slideup	slidedown
the slideup and slidedown methods come from scriptaculous not sure if they re directly compatible with the jquery effect

1121147

this is pretty much pointless since the inline keyword usually does the same thing and function inlining is often a premature micro-optimization anyway

1121309
button	checkbox
that applies to button checkbox comboboxes and any other object in table

1121319
hide	show
run-time dynamic show hide

1121321
ienumerable	ilist

1121338
inherited	properties
so the fact that it looks wierd with this theme has to do with some inherited css properties from the lightword theme

1121342
ant	maven
for building c c++ software from ant or maven you might be interested in terp

1121353

1121790
hash	md5
if you re really afraid of accidental collisions just do both md5 and sha1 hash and compare them

1121791
multiplication	modulo
examining the disassembly shows that in the fast const case the modulo has been turned into a multiplication and shift type thing whereas in the slow non-const case it s using idivl

1121849
margin	height
the height property doesn t apply to inline elements and the vertical margin border and padding act differently

1121883
hash	md5
forging md5 hash is proven by researchers where they demonstrated being able to forge content that generates an md5 collision thereby opening the door to generating a forged csr to buy a cert from rapidssl for a domain name they don t own

1121900
equals	gethashcode
i had to use the usecompositeid method and then override equals gethashcode for the drivers license object

1121941

1122146
cos	sin
the motion of the center of mass cm will just move smoothly along a straight line and the corner points will rotate around an axis through the cm assumed to be the z-axis here so the equation for each corner point parameterized by time t is p v t + x + r sin wt+s i + cos wt + s j where v is the vector velocity of the center of mass

1122158
accessor	properties
the same applies the other way to initializing properties values in init using your properties accessor there would be sending messages to a half- init ed object

1122182
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as daniel was hinting to presenting modal views is a uiviewcontroller behavior uinavigationcontroller just inherits this from its superclass

1122216
abstract-class	superclass
in procedural programming a unit may be an individual program function procedure etc. while in object-oriented programming the smallest unit is a class which may belong to a base superclass abstract-class or derived child class

the ssh connection being tunneled is already encrypted so there s no point in using the heavier aes 3des for the outer layer

1122347
setinterval	settimeout
you can also use the settimeout setinterval functions

1122369
children	parent
this code forks a various number of times the children then attempt to get tuples from the parent using a rinda tuplespaceproxy over drb

1122369
children	parent
the children then return their results with different tuples to the parent which aggregates them

1122388
accessor	properties
however i would not have the properties accessor implement the validation logic

implements	extends
then select a theme to extends from subclass it and implements the methods you care about

1122767

option 2 if x and y are exposed as properties you could have their getter setter access a member array of two elements and then expose the array as a read-only property too

1123086
bash	zsh
however .bashrc is used by default when using a bash shell so if you are using another shell csh ksh zsh etc then your changes will not be reflected by modifying .bashrc

1123087

1123567
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however in every browser i ve tested so far firefox ie google-chrome and safari when i place a # on the url the behaviour seems to be that the browser is downloading the entire swf first and then starts playing it with the end result that it takes a while for the swf to load blank screen the pre-loader kicks at a 100 and then the swf continues to the site

1123574
for-loop	loops

post	get
what i m guessing that you are using is a sms gateway service provider which can route incoming short messages via a http get or post to your destination url

1123756
16-bit	64bit
size_t abstracts the type used to hold the size of objects because on some systems this will be a 32-bit value on others it might be 16-bit or 64bit

1123756
unsigned	short
so if you write your wide character handling code to use the wchar_t type instead of say unsigned short that code will presumably be more portable to various platforms

1123827
vfork	posix
heh but for linux or any posix bsd svr# system vfork has been around for ages and provides simular functionality

1123878
ready	each

1123887
ws-addressing	soap
the first and only one that comes into my mind is wso2 wsf php which features soap mtom ws-addressing ws-security ws-securitypolicy ws-secure conversation and ws-reliablemessaging at the cost of having to install a native php extension

1124084
hex	binary
the wikipedia page for the bmp file format contains an example including all hex values of a 2x2 pixel bitmap image it should be very good at explaining the basis of the binary representation of an image

1124084
hex	binary
in general if you re really curious how the binary looks for a file you could always use a hex viewer and take a look yourself i normally use od on linux to dump the binary information of a file

1124121
width	height
you could always render to a texture that is twice the width and height ie 4x the size and then supersample it down

1124122
grass	proj
you really need to get grass roots buy-in on the need for an improved system before beginning the proj and maintain that relationship during the development

1124341
profiling	benchmarking
if you have performance issue and profiling shows that the queue is the bottleneck which is unlikely benchmarking with both implementations of a queue and pick the one which is better

1124345
getter	setter
both components contain two methods that write new data to the structs in the array or delete array elements and the setter and getter for the arguments

1124345
getter	setter
the components deviate from each other only through theire argument names the number of arguments each init method takes and the number of getter and setter

1124383
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
with me it s similar ie opera do it quickly firefox safari terribly slow

1124449
int	double
the reason 100 doesn t work is that setvalue interprets it as an int but canvas.top canvas.left are double

1124460
hide	show
an easy fix would be to also add a class when you show the item and remove a class when you hide the item

1124461
width	height
one solution is to have a div that takes up the entire width and height of the page with a unique id and then use jquery to make an ajax request that returns javascript to manipulate that div like so

1124533
prepare	execute
for the dbo that the correcture will be execute we must should prepare an rollback mechanism

margin	text-indent
this is pretty sloppy for my tastes but basically it requires text-indent instead of padding or margin to achieve the nesting

1124660
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i ve tested this in firefox 3.5 safari 4 and opera 9.6

1124663

1124871
getter	setter
basic code generation specifically java bean getter setter

1124976
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller

1125280
folder	directory
when i build and run my application i get a directory listing in the browser also happens for sub folder and i have to click on index.aspx

1125307
ubuntu	freebsd

1125307
ubuntu	freebsd
some aspect of ubuntu are better and some aspects of freebsd are better in terms of performance numbers

1125307
ubuntu	linux
it is important when you have to try any application or a new product or a new release it is far easier to install n try on ubuntu than on other linux variants

1125307
ubuntu	linux
and if you wish to move ahead and are suffering from the dogma of a simplified to more complex or geeky linux distro then read this question it made me stick to ubuntu

1125317
subtraction	addition
for this intuitive storage method subtraction is a different operation than addition requiring additional checks on the numbers before they can be added

1125317
subtraction	addition
since you want the most basic operations addition subtraction etc to be as fast as possible you need to store numbers in a way that lets you use the simplest algorithms possible

1125319
subtraction	addition
two s complement allows addition and subtraction to be done in the normal way like you wound for unsigned numbers

1125320
button	checkbox
see this 2 links for jquery plugins for styling checkbox radio button

1125325

this code will run on firefox 3.5 but not on google-chrome using v8

1125353
google-chrome	safari
it may be that google-chrome emulates the safari behavior even though it uses a different engine

1125355
subtract	add
also if you try to subtract 4 from 6 two positive numbers you can 2 s complement 4 and add the two together 6 + -4 6 - 4 2

1125355
subtraction	addition
this means that subtraction and addition of both positive and negative numbers can all be done by the same circuit in the cpu

1125386
swt	draw2d	swt	styledtext	draw2d	styledtext
for example swt s styledtext supports that directly getlocationatoffset but none of the draw2d text figures supports this

1125396
folder	directory
i then use winmerge but have used other merge comparison tools equally well to compare the directory and merge them into the reconciled folder

1125485
put	get
is it something you can parse once at the beginning of the day and put the variables in shared memory so subsequent runs of your main program can just attach and get the needed values from there

1125489
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
use some sort of salt hash md5 sha1 etc

1125545
serializable	deserialization
one use seems to be to call the xml class generator for using xsd schemas for serializable deserialization

1125556
maven	pom.xml
you will need to add references to the google maven repository so the dependencies and parent pom.xml can be downloaded

1125584
disk	ram
however these proxy objects can deal with the raw data being either in ram or on disk

1125585
gmail	hotmail
particularly large email providers like hotmail yahoo and gmail put great stock in this

1125589
folder	directory
i am also copying the actvedirectory folder found in the t4 templates directory to the solution

1125613
postgresql	mysql
both posts use mysql - perhaps you are able to use similar techniques with postgresql

1125619
min	max
i have a jslider with a min of 0 and a max of 10 000

1125627
content-length	content-type
on receipt of such a request the server side code can using zlib pack all the files into a zip file and send the zip file as the http response setting the content-type content-length last-modified etc

1125646
sortedmap	sortedset
if you re really concerned about insertion deletion performance then perhaps a different data structure is appropriate perhaps a sortedset or a map or sortedmap

1125761
vim	emacs
any decent editor emacs vim will abstract this whole nonsense out for you

1125809
client-side	server-side
i think you should do client-side and server-side validation to be safe

1125812
folder	directory
after compilation a folder called generated will be in your application directory or possibly bin directory

1125816
client-side	server-side
actually server-side validation is a must client-side is nice but optional

1125830
client-side	server-side
i ve always thought of client-side javascript validation as a ui enhancement with the server-side validation as the actual validation

1125877
mouseup	mousedown
so far i ve got the mousedown and mouseup events trapped but i m having trouble figuring out how to scale the cursor s movement which is measured in pixels to a change of the selected point arbitrary scale

1125946
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
i am using a uisegmentedcontrol with images that is in a uibutton which is itself in a uitoolbar

1125946
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
however the same does not automatically apply to images in uisegmentedcontrol s that belong to uibutton s

1125974
3des	aes	rsa	aes	rsa	3des
public authentication establishment of secure channel using diffie-hellman rsa aes 3des whatever you configure

1126072
switching	screens
so when a user clicks the button in the uiviewcontroller that owns the button i create the new viewcontroller whose view i want pushed into the screens this is nice because it also allows me to set up data in the view controller and not have to delegate it to some other object or use a singleton to get the data in the new view then i call my toggleview methods and the root view controller does the switching

1126141
put	get
but i feel that i have missed understood something which in my haste to get to working code i have missed the point that there really should be in a put request - and i should collect this from the formcollection

1126173
put	get
mainly i m just wanting to see articles on this so that i can see how other people are teaching tdd and get some ideas for material to put in my presentation

1126251
bazaar	git
i d recommend using one of distributed vcs git mercurial bazaar rather than centralized subversion because it would be easier to create central repository or repositories by cloning than moving your subversion repository to central place

1126271
folder	directory
then copy the contents of the network share deployment folder to a new virtual directory on the web server

1126272
google-chrome	safari
i ran into a problem on google-chrome and safari using jquery to do some calculations using the widths of a strip of images

1126272
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works just fine in ie6+ and firefox but it does not in google-chrome and safari img .width is 0 whether the image is already cached or not

1126311
post	get
i ll let you share your ideas and if necessary i will post the detail of my solution in an upcoming post to get your comments on that approach

1126330
qtp	loadrunner
you can still use qtp as a gui handling client with connection to loadrunner

1126336
pop-up	dialog
i have a screen that pop-up on load with a print dialog using javascript

1126341
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
clearcase ucm is a great tool i like it and think something can be done to add like functionality to svn mercurial git bazaar - not that you can t implement it with hook-scripts but that s a custom one-off for each site

1126377
addclass	removeclass
so thomas must have included both jquery and jquery ui libraries on his page enabling the speed and callback parameters to addclass and removeclass

1126382
equals	gethashcode
in case you consider overriding equals you have to keep in mind that you have also to override gethashcode

1126426
udp	tcp
browser based js does not give programmatic access to udp or even tcp

1126481
mvp	presenter
in my solution the constructor for the presenter took 3 parameters the model the view and the mvp name

1126569
children	parent
you have two children extending a parent but the children classes can t see each other private or public

1126583
freebsd	linux
i ve used that example myself on both freebsd and linux it works

1126596
x86	64bit
also it would be really nice if i could have a unified installer for x86 and x86-64 which installers the correct components eg myapp_x86.exe or myapp_x64.exe depending on if the os is 64bit or not

1126606
post	get
once you get going you ll have follow-up questions which you should post as new questions

1126626
spweb	spsite
although we were disposing our spsite and spweb objects properly we forgot to dispose the binarystream we took of the spfile object

1126639
versioning	upgrade
create upgrade that update the registry and versioning number of your app

1126643
jobs	cron
the server has a few thousand visitors a day and on the night i m running a few cron jobs which sometimes does some heavy mysql work looping through 50 000 rows inserting and deletes duplicates etc

1126663
inherited	properties
my problem is on block 2 the absolute div inherited the width properties from its parent thus rendering the child divs on top of each other

1126663
width	height
the height and width given are arbitrary and can change at any time

1126669
tunnel	vpn
one is local one is offsite and accessible via a secure vpn tunnel

1126680
gif	png
if the referrer is not blank and the referrer is not equal to your own domain and the request is for a resource in the embedded folder ending in jpg gif png then rewrite the url to replace embedded with shared

1126681
codeigniter	cakephp
i would recommend codeigniter cakephp or zend framework

1126690
width	height
if you remove the width and height restriction then the inner divs will occur next to each other as desired

1126713
ncover	nant
many of the tools are difficult to integrate with nant such as ncover and source monitor

1126719
inherited	properties
i have a custom class called userprofile that inherited from the profilebase class and i use this to set custom properties like fullname

1126742
width	height
that uses the current font for the given device context to measure the width and height of the rendered string in logical units

1126806
mouse	keyboard
this event will fire whether the mouse or the keyboard is used to alter the checkbox

1126905
width	height
we wrap all signatures with a the script looks for them and then measures the div s height and width

1126905
width	height
all the script does right now is make sure the signature resides in a particular height width

1126908
ati	nvidia
as you re already aware both the nvidia and ati display cards allow you to create custom resolutions however never in a million years up to 12800 x 8000

1126912
pull	push
well judging from your scp protocol use it seems that it would be a lot easier for you to be using the fuse sshfs which would enable you to have normal filesystem behaviour backing you instead of just a push pull type crud interface

1126929
super	implements
in the rippleview class i ve implements initwithcoder which doesn t do anything other than call super initwithcoder...

1126929
width	height
now for some reason if i try to check the bounds of the rippleview in awakefromnib i get ridiculous values 0 width and 1081171968 height

1126945
client-side	server-side
this of course is a pure client-side approach to something best handled server-side

1126948
width	height
another approach is to omit the height and width attributes in the img tag so that the full image is downloaded then use img.height and img.width to determine the size of the downloaded image

1127031
ati	nvidia
your perception that gpus are faster than cpus is based on the misconception created by a few embarassingly parallel applications applied to the likes of the ps3 nvidia and ati hardware

1127033
getter	setter
you re setting the expectation on the wrong method name - membership_id is the getter is the setter

1127044
mouse	keyboard
for sources such as mouse and keyboard

1127049
cpu	processors
the cpu behavior would indicate that the application is only utilizing one logical processors

1127079
put	get
put a message pragma inside the cpp file to see if they get compiled at all

1127120
rss	feed
most news websites offer rss feed which works fine for knowing which stories to retrieve

1127120
rss	feed
at the moment i have separate newssource classes for each source cnn ny times etc that read the appropriate rss feed s follows each link and strips out the body

1127140
rss	feed
an rss feed of a user s activity

1127140
rss	feed
an rss feed of aiden s profile changes

1127140
put	get	post	put	post	get
i don t mind get arguments personally and think that x y z should refer to a mutable resource and get post put should act upon it

1127144
post	get
hi get post id.

1127238
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this will work in firefox safari google-chrome and any other css3-compatible browser

1127243
inherited	subclassing
edit if you create a subclassing every time you want to modify the behaviour of a ui control you will quickly have an unruly inherited hierarchy on your hands

1127254
google-chrome	safari
for safari google-chrome webkit and mozilla use the following two selectors although mozilla supports the css 3 selector not sure if the other one does

1127298
ati	nvidia
as you correctly noted one major obstacle for the adoption of the technology is the lack of a common library that runs on most adapters - both ati and nvidia

1127328
strstr	strcpy
i wanted to have a look at the implementation of different c c++ functions like strcpy stcmp strstr

1127366
strstr	strcmp
here is strcmp and strstr

1127376
children	parent
in fact you could make it implement and forward all the methods on to the list with appropriate manipulation of the parent property whenever adding removing children

1127392
put	get
i used to put my private stuff at the top too because i came from visual basic 6 before c++ and hated being told my privates should be on the bottom but once you get into the habit you ll wish you changed sooner

1127468
width	height
i have tried setting the height and width manually and this just results in a large grey rectangle on the second tab

1127531
rss	feed
i have a working dnla device xbox360 psp... rss video feed reader in c#

1127531
rss	feed
sometimes an rss feed item will not have a duration value so i am hard coding a default duration value when it doesn t

1127531
rss	feed
i m including an .flv uri from abc news rss feed to use as an example

1127567
put	get
it works fine the first time but when i refresh the page it looses that reference because the control didn t get rendered again so it didn t put the references out there

1127570
hash	salt
i ve tested the hash password and salt - test is the correct password

1127597
range	minimum
these aren t binary yes no answers think more in terms of range and minimum standards vs

1127634
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
provide some links to firefox opera google-chrome later versions of ie 6 whatever making one link more obvious so people who don t know the first thing about different browsers will have a default choice

1127701
versioning	upgrade
however the reminders to upgrade to newer versioning of the tools gets annoying

1127702
post	get
choice 4 post requests need to be used since get requests could be inadvertently sent by a search engine

1127722
versioning	upgrade
i only use tortoise but to disable the upgrade messages you can just right click in explorer - settings - uncheck automatically check for newer versioning every week

1127771
width	height
when i insert records with jquery #table .append .. in a table taking the height and width of the table jquery #table .width or jquery #table height is not updated

1127799
inherited	properties
well this is just working fine the button in window1 inherited properties from both styles and modifying properties in either one does properly affect the button

1127841
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
if you don t use a using block you ll have to explicitly call the .dispose method of the sqlconnection and sqltransaction objects

1127846
versioning	upgrade
the syntax tristan posted is correct in the current stable versioning but it gave me errors when i upgrade my project to a nightly 2.8 compiler

1127860
inherited	properties
if you are implementing a software design tool that allows you to represent classes interfaces properties inherited associations aggregations etc. then at runtime yes each class you place in the designer will be an object instance of the class class

1127879
pop-up	dialog
maybe you pop-up a dialog giving the user a chance to accept the update or cancel it

1127882
jobs	cron
so far my approach has been to set up cron jobs that essentially do batch processing of queued commands

1127887
getter	setter
if so you can think of a virtual event in exactly the same way instead of a getter and setter there s an add operation and a remove operation

1127956
inherited	properties
however i cannot find a properties or method which will return me the generic parameter that was used in the inherited task

1127985
mechanize	hpricot
tools like hpricot mechanize and curl can help you parse the content of pages and send requests but in doing so your system may be quite brittle

1127995
put	get
i m not sure what exactly you re trying to achieve but you can get the path of the current page at any time with code like the following put it into the code-behind of your page

1128009
invokerequired	begininvoke
also in general you do not have to use the invokerequired and begininvoke on the exact same control that you are manipulating in code as long as you can guarantee that the control you are manipulating was created on the same thread in the forms initialization routine as the ui element you are calling invokerequired begininvoke on

1128056
hash	salt
the problem i m having is that some of the key data on it have to be hash and salt before they are posted to a different site

1128125
background-color	font-size
for styles that are purely for aesthetical purposes such as background-color font-size and such you can still attach a class to give the consumer of your script an easy way to change the appearance of your script elements but don t require it

1128202
mstest	typemock
so my plan was to use mstest to create the unit test project and test methods that run against my service and any run-time dependencies would be handled by typemock which would create mock objects for my service to use

1128207
bash	zsh
both zsh and bash go upset of it

1128212
int	boolean
for example one message contains an 8-bit int and 5 1-bit boolean while another message contains a 16-bit timestamped my own class and an 8-bit int

1128221
memcmp	strcmp
if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp

1128226
hide	show
this is used to show hide text from a wordpress post that is longer then the set height overflow is hidden

1128245
put	get
i would like to know if i could buy an ipod touch and thus save some cash and develop iphone apps on it or if i really should spend the extra money and put up with at t and get the iphone

1128251
getter	setter
and there is a third solution - you can use methodbase.getcurrentmethod inside a property getter or setter to obtain the name of the setter or getter method

1128347
slideup	slidedown
try the slidedown and slideup effect methods which should do exactly what you re looking for

1128348
bash	zsh
if you use zsh rather than more popular bash take a look at vcs info in prompts blog post by xana yammering about using vcs_info subsystem developed by frank terbeck for zsh with backend for git

1128355
int	double
string name int period double value string category

1128398
folder	directory
and i m referring to the actual file system not simply creating virtual folder in xcode to organize things because the top level directory of my project will still be a mess

1128492
post	get
if at any time you have form submission consider what would happen if the user altered the get or even the post data

1128506
vim	emacs
i used vim for 10 years leading up to delving into emacs 2 years ago

1128506
vim	emacs
a co-worker of mine though has just transitioned from vim to emacs and he just grabbed the starter kit and he is on his way

1128514
folder	directory
what i really want to do now is to backup each folder within the shares directory so i get something like

1128634
postgresql	mysql
i m new to the oracle platform having primarily used mysql with a little postgresql and sql server as well

1128639
installation	upgrade
write a registry variable during installation this way when delivering an upgrade you can read back the value previously written and default to the users previously selected folder

1128654
gridview	repeater
for any of the common asp __________ controls asp gridview asp repeater etc i always add runat server

1128671
gif	png
if you use a png or gif for the needle one and core animation to rotate it you can specify which goes on top in interface builder with the menu item layout- send forward or layout- send backward

1128693
integer	fractions
sure i could take the easy way out and pass the value in cents so it would be item value 1 but i d like to receive the argument in my view as a decimal data type rather than as an integer and i may have to deal with fractions of a cent at some point

1128698
pop-up	dialog
i have a pop-up dialog modal if it matters that displays a yes no dialog to the user with some information

1128728
int	double
you can now use a stream to check whether an array of int double or long contains a value by respectively using a intstream doublestream or longstream

1128777
post	get
so a get post displays all post and is handled by the index method of the post controller

1128780
min	max
grouping isn t necessarily bad news in sql server -- in fact if there s an appropriate covering index for the query it can perform extremely well because it can just navigate to a particular level in the index to find the grouped values then use the remaining columns of the index to use to min max whatever

1128800
ubuntu	linux
how i can develop and compile command line c++ programs in my linux ubuntu for my jornada 720 that have a windows ce 3.1 hpc 2000 something like a compiler like that for palm or something like gcc and a tutorial of development and compiling will be very nice remember that i want to build command line programs to windows ce programs that runs under the cmd of the windows ce

1128825
udp	tcp
tcp udp whatever socket transmission that is also happening at the

1128826
gmail	hotmail
both gmail and hotmail allow access by secure pop on port 995

1128856
icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	udp	tcp
icmp is a different protocol from tcp and udp as determined by the protocol field in the ip header

1128856
udp	tcp
similarly sockets opened with ipproto_tcp or ipproto_udp respond only to packets whose ip headers contain a protocol field that is set to tcp or udp respectively

1128867
isapi	iirf
i don t know isapi rewrite syntax but on iirf the break out rule is like this

1128891
starttls	smtps
since i donâ t host my own smtps server i tried to use my gmail account to send those notifications but i kept getting â œ must issue starttls command first â

1128907
pull	push
i can t just call some method once the turn is done because it is all need to go to the browser through ajax and i can t push data there only pull

1128927
put	get	vim	emacs
to put it simply i m trying to get scrolling in emacs like in vim and most other editors

1128988
sdl	devil
i have tried everything from sdl to devil and they have all failed for various reasons

1128988
sdl	devil
sdl segfaults for various reasons and devil is having some weird problem where even after i include il ilut.h and linking everything and including the other headers it is not defining the functions i need to load images into opengl textures something about use_open_gl not being defined

1129006
grizzly	netty
there are several high quality frameworks that hide the complexity of nio based network programming mina netty grizzly etc.

1129015
textblock	itemscontrol
two textblock are inside itemscontrol so they are at the same level as commander class of commands observablecollection

1129032
cos	sin	cos	exp	cos	floor	cos	ceil	floor	exp	ceil	sin	ceil	floor
same results for sin cos floor ceil exp and log on 32 bit and

1129033
stdout	stderr
now it requires a little hacking on line 152 of timecodereader.m you need to change the output from stderr to stdout so that applescript can read the result

1129038
stdout	stderr
i redirected stderr to stdout there was still no output when i run it from the server

1129049
actualheight	actualwidth
take a look at the element s actualwidth and actualheight properties

1129053
folder	directory
i tried keeping the international_test.resources.dll in the de-de folder or just put in in my apps directory

1129061
ceil	floor
floor and ceil will be exact since their computation is straightforward

1129061
cos	sin	cos	exp
what you are concerned with is rounding on the last bit for the transendentals like sin cos and exp

1129086
implements	extends
if you want a simple clean design thats fun to implements and extends in the future ill go with asp.mvc and entity framework

1129132
filtering	grouping
you can also filtering the display using the audiences functionality so that it only displays to a select grouping of users

1129148
uiview	calayer
you are correct that uiview does not animate its property changes by default the way calayer does but i don t think this indicates a break in mvc

1129148
uiview	subviews
that said if you had a uiview subclass that managed the layout of its subviews there would be nothing wrong with allowing that uiview to manage the animation rather than relying on a uiviewcontroller to do it

1129159
curlpp	libcurl
apart from libcurl curlpp which is flexible and powerful but i find very...clunky there are two c++ libraries i m keeping my eye on

1129190
maven	pom.xml
it seems that all of them require you to add extra configuration to your build scripts or maven pom.xml for every project that you want to have the reporting done

1129236
free	malloc
since the stack is a contiguous block of memory premanaged by the compiler there s no real concept of allocating and deallocating in the way that there is for heap allocations new delete or malloc free

1129238
temp	corrupt
it is preferable to create a temp file using the gettempfile routines because this creates temp files in predefined locations c temp that utilities can delete if your app crashes or makes corrupt files in

1129263
filesystems	ntfs
although this is less often a problem on windows it is still reasonably possible so long as the parent filesystems is ntfs

1129289
profiler	shark
shark is an incredible profiler included as part of apple s chud tools with xcode

1129302
easymock	jmock	mockito	jmock	mockito	easymock
as you refactor them out you can use any mock framework i ve used easymock and i like it but there are others - jmock mockito

1129304
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation works great for profiling and also has some preset modes that you can use to track down memory leaks view how many instances of various objects have been created monitor your opengl performance etc

1129325
sorting	grouping
- is when you can arrange to walk over the results before grouping rbg in a sorted way -- you actually don t care about the sorting save in the common case in which an order by is also there and just happens to be on the same field as the grouping by

1129370
valgrind	memcheck
and i debug with the tool valgrind it said that valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full --track-origins yes . main

1129374
width	height
it needs to calculate height width even though you specify them ...as you have seen

1129409
post	get
so when i do post to the server files goes to the server but when it s time to get response i m getting null in following function

1129449
folder	directory
the compile task works fine and since i do not specify a destination folder the build files are in the same directory as the source

1129470
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
according to the mdc page on the word-wrap property it is supported in ie 5.5+ firefox 3.5+ and safari 1.0+ but not opera

1129492
stateless	stateful
wicket is good at building stateful pages it requires more work to build stateless pages

1129560
domcontentloaded	onload
if that is the case set djconfig.afteronload true -- the option tells dojo you are loading dojo after the page load and to not wait for the domcontentloaded window onload to fire before triggering addonload callbacks

1129634
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval will allow you to execute some code at regular intervals

1129634
keydown	keyup
libraries like jquery make this really easy with built in support for keydown keyup and keypress events

1129740
readdirectorychangesw	filesystemwatcher
it s possible - you can use readdirectorychangesw function to watch the file and react to changes or filesystemwatcher if your service is implemented in .net

1129744
hide	show
i wrote a code to show a div element shareform when a link is clicked and to hide it when the link is clicked again

1129832
min	max
xpath 1.0 doesn t have the fancy min and max functions so to find these values we need to be a little tricky with the xpath logic and compare the values on the siblings of the node

1129922
firefox	safari
safari and firefox 3.5 both have pretty good support for offline data but again people with older browsers can t make full use of it

1130013
cpu	processors
the processors idle time does not appear in the cycle count as the cpu is halted for this time

public	protected
while this is a contrived example an implementation could use a lookup table also to find the public protected and private sections of a class instance

1130058
datalist	repeater
not in a single datagrid - you need to use a nested repeater datalist listview in order to bind the child rows when the parent row is bound

1130065
versioning	upgrade
so i want to keep a versioning check which notifies the user if the app has been upgrade in the meantime

1130072
filtering	grouping
where is first then you grouping the result of the query and last but not least having-clause is taken to filtering the grouping result

1130098
mouse	keyboard
there is however no access at all to a midi device from silverlight either for input or output so the input would need to come from mouse keyboard and you would need to play and mix the samples yourself

1130117
valgrind	memcheck
cachegrind is a valgrind tool the framework that powers the always-lovely memcheck which profiles cache and branch hits misses

1130183

i can make an explorer bar show hide using iwebbrowser2 showbrowserbar method

1130221
hide	show
i want to use a single button to toggle between show hide

1130221
hide	show
there is a parameter for showbrowserbar to set for show hide

1130240
post	put
creating should be done using a post and so creating a new role for a user should be a post rather than a put i would say

1130240
post	put
it depends if you consider adding a role to be the creation of a role in which case it s a post or the modification of a user then it s a put

1130250
tabcontrol	tabitem
i ve checked your code and it seems that at runtime the contentpresenter of the tabitem does not inherit the datacontext from the tabcontrol as soon the item to display is of type visual or derived from it

1130294
getter	setter
my opinion maybe not so for setter but sometimes i think that getter are valid to be placed in an interface

1130296
exponent	modulo
while i understand how this can be used to send secure data if i m not mistaken this library cannot be used for the client to receive secure data from the server because the public and private exponent and the modulo are transmitted plain-text from the server

1130302
hide	show
this works but when you run the report and select to expand the groups the little icon use use to show hide on the report is a + symbol instead of a - one

1130303
getter	setter
i don t see why an interface can t define getter and setter

1130303
getter	setter
edit the comments suggest that getter and setter imply a simple field is used for backing storage

1130303
getter	setter
fortunately that implication doesn t hold getter and setter are perfectly within their rights to compute things

1130303
width	height
here either the size property or the height width properties are for convenience only - but i don t see that that makes them invalid in any way

1130333
getter	setter
this touches upon the whole getter setter are evil topic which is addressed multiple times on this site and elsewhere

1130351

i ve noticed in the following post that you can get a stack trace out of fastmm to show what appears to be where an object was allocated

1130465
accessor	properties
error mc3080 the properties setter commandbindings cannot be set because it does not have an accessible set accessor

1130505
post	get
did you know that if you use the service installer you can implement this to set the registry settings based on something in your installer without needing to get the user to perform any post operation or running some batch file

1130522
getter	setter
there s nothing inherently evil about getter setter

1130522
getter	setter
so my interfaces will tend to contain getter but not setter there are other benefits - particularly threading

1130531
int	chars
none of the base datatypes provide u to store more than 1 value eg int chars float etc

1130533
google-chrome	firefox

1130698
int	double
update to clarify my object is int uint float double and so on it isn t a string

1130724
int	double
in both the first two cases you ll probably have to handle separately each numeric type you want to support double decimal int - each have different ranges and accuracy for example

1130732
firefox	safari
firefox is happy to print it all out just fine and so does safari but ie 7 and 8 will both show a print-preview of the pages but die during real printing

jquery	scriptaculous
in my rails app i ve already included scriptaculous and prototype and it would be great not to have to include jquery

1131486
width	height
i ve created a layouter that lays out these custom components but to place them correctly i have to know the custom componets width height

1131486
width	height
after all of them created creationcompleted event fired for every i try to laying out them but width height property is still 0

1131486
width	height
so my question is how to create custom uicomponent that placed dynamically and get to know the width and height of it

1131486
width	height
with the use of the mx_internal namespace i can set width and height using the internal width and height fields and it looks like it is working

1131504
serializable	deserialization
it would seems that at this point there would be a proven well defined solution for binary data serializable deserialization between .net and a web client

1131604
uitableview	reloaddata
sure the method reloaddata on uitableview will do the trick

1131611
children	parent
generally speaking if you have parent entity a and child entity b and you are persisting a with some children the correct order of operations is first inserting a into the database and then inserting children i am assuming proper cascade from a to b

1131611
children	parent
and in your case the field- fieldrules is probably invoked which causes the children to be inserted before parent

1131645
children	parent
the xml 1.0 spec does not say anything about the order of elements with equal names as children of the same parent element

1131655
children	parent
children grow and become adults and some adults will also be parent of children students as well as adult students themselves -- they might then drop either role but need to keep the other their child changes schools but they don t or viceversa

1131666
public	protected
now my approach is make it private until you need to make it public or protected -- and even then think hard about whether that s really the right solution

post	get
once i get it finished i ll post the solution here

1131751
subtraction	addition
however i don t quite see the point in doing so as i doubt there are situations where you would perform mathematical operations such as addition and subtraction on portions of version numbers for any purpose besides curiosity or auto-incrementation and even then int and str can be used fairly easily

1131760
hide	show
i m getting an annoying flickering effect in firefox when using jquery show and hide on some div s

1132194
serializable	deserialization
before we had axis1 and when custom objects were passed between the client and the server the client and the server code had to do their own serializable and deserialization

1132208
shadowing	named
so if you were to assign a value to a property on the prototype using this the runtime will actually create a new property of that named and put it on the object referenced with this rather than updating the value in the prototype thus shadowing the original value

put	get	dictionary	map
either the person who tried to get the object out of the map using a value identical to the one they put it in with or the person who can t seem to retrieve their object even though the key they re using is literally the same object that was used to put it into the map this is actually why python doesn t allow its mutable built-in data types to be used as dictionary keys

accessor	properties
basically what i need is a properties that has add and remove accessor instead of get and set

i would tend to believe that in this case a vector graphics editor like inkscape is going to be better for quick mockups and prototyping and the gimp s going to be better for creating the final products

1136752
width	height
first one contains configuration information like width and height of video player

1136758

1136877
inherited	properties
because the button s command properties is a dependencyproperty itself inherited from buttonbase and supports databinding already

1136877
inherited	properties
this way it will still be reusable you just need to ensure that any view model you associate with your user control has a properties createcommand of type icommand and that view model will be inherited down to the button control by default - one of the nicest things the wpf guys thought up

1136915
html5lib	beautifulsoup
alternatively if you need to use translate functionality from python you can directly query the translate page and parse it using xml html libs beautifulsoup html5lib

1136915
html5lib	beautifulsoup
actually i did that once and beautifulsoup did not work on google translate but html5lib did

1136956

1136999
preorder	postorder
consider the situation where you have two lists of nodes of which all you know is that one is a representation of a preorder traversal of some tree and the other a representation of a postorder traversal of the same tree

1136999
preorder	postorder
note2 using only the preorder or the postorder list would be even better but i do not think it is possible

1137025
std	ostream
i replace the old buffer of an ostream like std cout with my own class so that i get access to what ever is written to it

1137025
std	ostream
i also create a new std ostream object with the old buffer so that i can continue to get the output to my console besides sending it to my logger

1137054
preorder	postorder
preorder and postorder do not uniquely define a tree

1137054
preorder	postorder
the same ambiguity is present for preorder and postorder

1137058
preorder	postorder
edit the order of the children is preserved with this solution simply due to knowing the ordering of the nodes via the preorder traversal and then knowing the structure via the postorder traversal

1137102
width	height
one way at design time is to use a label control and set it s height or width to

1137141

1137386
bazaar	git
if i were starting fresh i would look at one of the newer generation of distributed version tools like mercurial git or bazaar

1137408
hash	md5
in light of the fact that googling membership provider hashing algorithm turns up this answer as the first result and the gospel that will be inferred it behoves me to warn folks about using the membership provider like this and using hash like sha-1 md5 etc to obfuscate passwords in databases

1137408
scrypt	pbkdf2
use a key-derivation function like bcrypt scrypt or if you need fips compliance pbkdf2 with a work factor sufficient to necessitate the hashing time for a single password to be as close to 1000ms or more

1137560
awt	swing
and since swing awt apps don t have javascript selenium won t work on them either

1137608

one method i tried was by reconstructing an instance of the subclassing type from the parameters of the superclass so that i would be handling the object with it s actual type thus avoiding typecasting

1137617
rfcomm	l2cap
the bluetooth protocol stack includes its own transport protocols l2cap and rfcomm where rfcomm links use the l2cap layer

1137617

you might look at writing your own analysis plugin to gendarme or fxcop to enforce such requirements

1137732
qtableview	qtablewidget
the problem with the qtableview is that it seems to have no method that returns the currently selected record in the table so i took the qtablewidget class which interhits qtableview

1137732
qtablewidget	qabstractitemmodel
error virtual void qtablewidget setmodel qabstractitemmodel is

1137804
integer	fractions

qtablewidget	qabstractitemview
the method is public at the level of qabstractitemview but qtablewidget has a built-in model which you can t change

1137849
qtableview	qabstractitemview
to get the selection you must call selecteditems which is again a method of qabstractitemview and not qtableview which is why you missed it in the docs

1137883
for-loop	arrays
iterate using a for-loop like you have over each element checking the matching element in the other arrays

1137945

your problem is that you re using mouseover and mouseout functions

1138361
g++	gcc
based on the question use libraries compiled with visual studio in an application compiled by g++ mingw and the msdn forum post i can t mix vc gcc it does not appear you can link a gcc application with visual c++ compiled libraries

1138380
move	drag
essentially the idea is that you override the uiresponder touch methods to analyze what kind of touch the device received and then either move the object to follow the user s finger or give it a speed in a direction depending on whether it was a slow drag or a swipe

1138402
profiling	debugging
when dealing with debugging queries using profiling and ssms its pretty common for me to copy a query from profiling and test them in ssms

1138450
implements	extends
my plan is to implements a new tomcat realm by extends jndirealm and overriding the role methods to call an encapsulated jdbcrealm

1138474

abstract database connector is a c c++ library for making connections to several databases mysql msql postgresql interbase informix bde odbc

1138605
touchesbegan	touchesended
and 2- you throw the object by basically comparing the touch locationinview self.view to the touch previouslocationinview self.view in touchesended could also store a reference to first touch in touchesbegan but i find that less helpful as user may pause using the time stamp of each you can determine the direction of swipe flick and rate of speed and use them to send your little uiview flying around

1138736
uitabbaritem	uibaritem
you can also manipulate the title directly by retrieving the uitabbaritem a subclass of uibaritem and setting the title yourself but this is usually only necessary if one of your viewcontroller titles is too long to display properly

1138761
int	boolean
unfortunately the valid column types are int float datetime date timestamp time text string binary and boolean

1138764
min	max
you re looking for min and max

1138809
hide	show
i know that the following code should show and hide a tiny circular progress bar with the following code in android

1138823
public	protected
the method is protected because you shouldn t call it on object you can and should override it as public

1138823
public	protected
here the protected clone method in object is being overridden as a public method.

1138836
post	get
in the blog comments for so and other blogs i ve noticed a trend in some users posting what the captcha was that they had to solve to get their post accepted

1138882
versioning	upgrade
one way would be to fetch the jad file using an http connection in your app parse for the versioning available on the server and only launch the browser if there is a newer versioning available or after additionally asking the user if the upgrade is desired

1138902
hide	show
i m trying to create boxes of text that hide or show when user clicks on a expand button

1139061
hide	show
i took a slightly different route in that i chose to wrap all of the elements of a given hide show element in a containing div

1139061
hide	show
it allows you to have multiple triggers for one section if you need it and you can add an arbitrary number of hide show elements without worrying about numbering them

1139061
hide	show
it has a few limitations such as the necessity that the hide show body is a direct descendant of the wrapper

1139061
hide	show
it s also nest-able so you can have multiple levels if hide show

1139065
put	get
i think it d be neat to get a bunch of these and put erlang code on them

1139075
pull	push
you could approach this a number of ways but my only comment would be push don t pull

1139083
typedef	using-declaration
typedef names and using-declaration used to specify the types do not contribute to this set

1139200
width	height
byte n x y where x is width and y is height but i don t know what n should be

1139266
junit	jmock
you should use junit to do this and you should use something like jmock or some other mocking library to ensure you re testing in isolation

1139307
queue	fifo
i could of course implement something that keeps a queue in shm with a known key or through a fifo but that s error prone.

1139317
inherited	properties
i did solve this by using a custom column namedgridviewcolumn that inherited from gridviewcolumn and implements a name properties but it would still be interesting to know how to get the x name on code

1139367
jboss	oc4j
with oc4j this seems not to have been a problem but now with jboss i get the impression that everything resides in the same name space or class loader perhaps

1139383
updatepanel	scriptmanager
are you getting an exception from the updatepanel that a scriptmanager is required

1139384
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
you don t have to do the stuff that you re doing with htmlspecialchars and addslashes manually

1139392
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
the htmlspecialchars and addslashes calls in the context you re using them don t appear vulnerable to sql injection or xss attacks

1139394
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
serving static content from apache has overhead so it ll be a better idea if you server it using some lightweight webserver such as lighttpd or nginx and connect to apache using reverse proxy to serve the django based content

1139453
public	protected
assuming that the state of the object cannot be accessed directly no public or package protected fields and is not fiddled with by reflection you can put a breakpoint at the start of all of the object s methods and run through the scenario that makes the object dirty in the debugger

1139461
post	get
i don t have the reputation yet to post comments but do you get the same error running this code

1139464
hide	show
obviously the ui view and controller need to be able to access permissions to show hide components and to handle the permission denied scenario

1139497
codeigniter	cakephp
if you re not opposed to full frameworks i symfony cakephp and codeigniter all have some sort of activerecord implementation

1139499
folder	directory
since the users are active directory users their home folder are not stored in users so i can t simply hard code the full path

1139519
floating-point	integer
then you could safely convert the floating-point into a basic integer

1139523
ant	maven
i can create my own task in ant and replace needed paramaters but there can be possibility of moving to maven and anyway i m not sure about it

1139552

during the process netbeans informed me something about an old client versioning of subversion and now i want to upgrade it

1139737
uiview	calayer
i m struggling with conceptualizing animations with a calayer as opposed to uiview s own animation methods

1139737
uiview	calayer
throw core animation into this and well maybe someone can articulate these concepts from a high level so i can better visualize what s happening and why i d want to migrate uiview animations which i m quite familiar with now to calayer animations on the iphone

1139739
uiview	subviews
a parent uiview with one subviews

1139750
post	get
if it s something else please post the specific message you get from netbeans

1139790
int	chars	int	double
ive tried putting them in as regular int string style with double quotes and chars style with single quotes

1139791
cvs	svn
clearcase snapshot views are basically the same thing you would have if you checked out a repository from svn or cvs - it s a local copy of the source code on your machine with pointers back into the central server for tools to query version history etc

1139811
uiview	calayer
uiview transforms are only 2d and are restricted to that layer transforms however can be 3d and you should use those if you want to do 3d stuff uiview animation will work if you change either the uiview transform or the calayer transform

1139822
inherited	properties
in magicdraw when clicking on the properties on a class you see in different boxes at the same time the own properties of the object and inherited ones and you can even change them which updates the superclass owning the properties

1139835
stdout	stderr
p popen firefox www.google.it shell true stdout pipe stderr pipe

1139843
int	chars
if you want to store a number store an int - or in this case a chars as you also need chars to be stored

1139844
equals	gethashcode
if you only want reference equality i think you re fine to not override gethashcode equals

1139847
nss	gnutls	openssl	gnutls
you need an implementation of tls transport layer security formerly known as secure sockets layer specified in rfc 5246 whether it be openssl gnutls ajisai yassl nss or your own implementation not recommended

1139904
spaces	delimiter
you can use spaces or a symbol as the delimiter

1139940
uiview	calayer
an uiview is always rendered to a calayer

1139940

when you use uiview methods to animate a view you are effectively manipulating the underlying calayer

1139978
inherited	properties
note all my entities inherited from a base class who contains a properties id

1140034
hide	show
if i were to use one generalized view i need to show hide a few fields depending on whether the items belong to a category or subcategory which might make it harder to maintain if category s item structure and subcategory s item structure becomes more different in the future

1140036
tapestry	wicket	jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket
the closest are component based frameworks like jsf wicket tapestry etc

1140048
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
base on my course unchecked-exception are basically a runtimeexception which mostly result of a program bug

1140056
equals	gethashcode
if you have written a class which implements its own equality that is different from reference equality then you are required to override gethashcode such that two objects that compare as equals have equals hash codes

1140056
put	get
you can put an object into a hash table mutate it and be unable to get it out again

1140062
background-image	background-position
if you give the .submit class the background-image property you can set the background-position property independently for each individual button and avoid having to repeat yourself several times

1140083
hash	salt
second a way with in my opinion good balance between effort and effect would be to add an extra column then when ever you change the values concatenate all the values add a secreat password to it better term would be salt run it through a cryptographic hash algorithm and put the result in the extra field

1140109
tinyint	boolean
notice where i have commented subsonic now maps the .net dbtype to the sqllite type boolean instead of tinyint

1140152
ant	maven
before anyone suggests a less frankensteinian build management framework like ant jam maven etc -- we re migrating to jam somewhat successfully

1140165

cout	ofstream
std cout and an ofstream

1140273
width	margin

1140590
x86	mips
i have run it on mips x86 ppc and arm

in the following example i am animating the opacity property to 0.0 when the mouseenter and back to 1.0 when the mouseleave

1140648
google-chrome	firefox
i copied the following code that works in firefox 3.0 and ie7 but not google-chrome

1140656
hash	salt
also like niteria suggested try checking out the sql code in the debug dump to see what credentials are getting checked against the database you can make a call to to find out what the hash password should be once you have your salt applied

1140658
google-chrome	firefox
all right this was actually google-chrome caching more aggressively than firefox and ie

1140699
post	get
this feature causes php to automatically escape get and post data when it loads

1140711
pull	push
branches and tags with git ls-remote and git update show you can pull get or push publish data with git fetch or git remote update git push and if server is configured to allow it you can get snapshot of state of remote repository with git archive --remote

1140714
ostream	istream
i would be fine if the istream and ostream components were locked separately but that is not the case

1140720
children	parent
so it is connecting with set of parent to set of children where there is many to many relationship

1140733
cvs	svn
as for source control the choice is between svn this is right successor of cvs and git

1140788
ostream	istream
i.e. have a separate istream and ostream which you yourself lock when they are invoked

1140794
firefox	safari
strange enough it renders in ie6 ie8 safari and firefox but not ie7

1140826

1140916
g++	gcc
and compile c++ code with g++ command not gcc

1140923
postgresql	mysql
mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql

1140923
postgresql	mysql
i believe postgresql can use row level locking out of the box where mysql will depend on the storage engine you choose

1140923
innodb	myisam
myisam only locks at the table level and thus concurrency suffers but storage engines such as innodb for mysql can and will use row-level locking to increase throughput

1140923
innodb	myisam
my suggestion would be to start with myisam and move to innodb only if you find you need row level locking

1140959
hide	show
bonus points if there s a way to hide the spaces from the show whitespace characters

1141010
post	get
things get a bit more complicated in handling post queries and there are more possible environment variables that may be required

1141015
uiview	subviews
or do i just stick with uiview and adding subviews into subviews etc

1141076
memcached	apc
if you get really concerned about speed use an in-memory cache like apc or memcached

1141099
direct3d	directwrite
directwrite only for windows 7 and vista will provide a higher quality text rendering approach for applications that need high quality text rendering in a manner that is interoperable with direct3d

1141133
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried compiling in firefox 3.5 ie8 google-chrome but all receive the same error

1141147
ncover	nant
we use nant to build our project wix for the installer and nunit and ncover for the unit tests and coverage reports

1141163
firefox	safari
what is confusing me though is the fact that my application works beautifally in safari and firefox yet refuses to work at all in ie8

1141197
direct3d	directx
direct3d hasn t used a type library or cocreateinstance for any of its objects since directx 8.0 almost ten years ago now

1141213
actionscript	haxe
it s small simple and written in haxe which for one is similar to actionscript and above that is a very cool language you should look into .

1141238
implements	modifiers
and i m using a namespace and the internal access modifiers to prevent providing a new implementation on implements classes

1141245
rss	feed
the yahoo boss and rss feed datasources should be useful examples

1141264
client-side	server-side
not all of the reasons given are necessarily valid but one important one is that unless you re google server-side cpu cycles are a lot more valuable than client-side cycles so it s easier to have the client compile optimize what is quite often dynamically generated html javascript rather than the server

1141275
put	get
i think the engines that put together the visual representation and manipulate the dom need to get a lot better um ie i m looking in your general direction...

1141275
google-chrome	firefox
but i do think that speed is going to get better on firefox and google-chrome to such an extent that people really are going to start using it for mainstream application development

1141291
firefox	safari
i d be surprised if other good js engines like those in the very latest firefox and safari didn t do the same

1141305
setinterval	settimeout
you can use the settimeout or setinterval functions

1141349
glut	sdl
if you still long for cross platform compatibility then your best bet is likely sdl which is very much like glut in that it is a fairly thin layer over the underlying abstractions but it provides a slightly richer event system and more opportunities for interacting with hardware such as sound and joysticks

1141349
mouse	keyboard
if i wanted to keep things simple for a program that only needed to display 3-d graphics and interact only by mouse and keyboard then i d probably be totally happy with glut

1141389
post	put
i d suggest that you put together a short and sweet sample app that shows the behavior or even better a unit test - but that might be hard with the keystroke and post to the gl listserv - be sure to include the info of mac vs non-mac

1141390
put	get
it s a service that let s you use things like xpath to get data from websites and put them into an easy to use xml or json format

in that div i want to show hide a list

1141398
firefox	safari

1141549
versioning	upgrade
as previously mentioned i don t keep libs under versioning control but that is due to the fact that we rarely upgrade add new libraries

1141570
g++	gcc
i have been using gcc g++ for my c c++ application development till now and have found it to be amazing

1141575

1141582
hash	md5
using a shared key to create and confirm hash if you re going to use md5 do multiple passes

but instead of what i want i get second and third table whit only one row regardless if i putt something in thier cell or not.i always see only the last string i put in that table

post	get
to also get that going you only need to annotate the repository with the repository annotation provided by spring and turn on exception translation using a post processor

1141641
post	get
all the examples i ve seen for overloading usually have only two methods of the same name with different parameters and one using the get verb while the other uses post

goto	break
the gist of the answers given - that when control leaves the protected region via any means whether return goto break continue or throw the finally is executed - is correct

1141811
for-loop	arrays
write out a for-loop to create you insert statement then just execute the query to save the arrays into a table with key and value columns

not too terribly different than taking an image from flicker they put a clear gif image over the image that you want to view so that when you right click and save you get the shield image however can be defeated by the lowly print screen button

1142269
fiddler	charles
fwiw if i was keen to get your image other than by viewing your page although i can t imagine why i should be i would just grab the bits as they came over the network when i viewed your page using something like charles or fiddler

1142819
fadein	fadeout
when using effects on such hyperlinks fadein fadeout it produces strange effects

1142882
udp	tcp
there is an awful lot of net-code you will be having to write starting with the whole protocols that stratus alone uses and then reimplementing the whole p2p protocol based on udp which secures data much like tcp does and should not be a twoliner .

1142962
postgresql	mysql

integer	unsigned
this solution assumes pid is an unsigned integer of course

1143795
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
now any modern browser ie7 firefox google-chrome safari opera will live with that and garbage collect it while ie6 will think that because there is a listener attached to a dom element it should not garbage collect the dom and the listener itself

1143838
public	protected
object.clone which is protected with a public method

1143870

1143914
ubuntu	debian
apt-get install pngnq # if on ubuntu debian

1143937
width	height
see here for a description of how the box model works in short the everything is outside the width height of an element

getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
theere are dom methods to speed up the other two getelementbyid or getelementsbytagname respectively

1144082
getter	setter
this is a better solution compared with overwriting the default implementation because setter and getter might called when updating writing saving the record to the database

1144115
ferret	sphinx
ferret easy install doesn t stem properly very slow indexing one mysql db sphinx 3 seconds ferret 50 minutes

1144115
ferret	sphinx
one thing that s really instructive is to install 2 search plugins sphinx and solr sphinx and ferret and see what different results they return

1144117
accessor	properties
this properties is exploited in ruby for activerecord column accessor

1144117
lisp	smalltalk

1144282
packets	multicast
the source client modifies the records and then sends out a multicast packets with a payload that something has changed

1144293
vb.net	vb6
since you have vb6 experience you could switch to vb.net easily although i d recommend c# since most of the code samples you ll find are in c#

1144330
ferret	sphinx
you might be interested in a search indexer like lucene ferret or sphinx

1144347
hide	show
i want to hide the from email address and show some text

1144395
int	chars
the simplest way to check to see if the first chars of string is an int and then dispatch

1144453
ostringstream	std
for the record i myself use std ostringstream build the string up and pass oss.str .c_str

1144470
int	chars
in 2007 and 2009 you could change the int variable i to a chars c and use for c in value instead

1144470
int	chars
to test for int only remove the . from the set of chars to test against

1144492
vsto	add-in
nothing seems to work on these pcs and i can t find a common denominator that i can rule out or in that will make the vsto add-in work

1144562
versioning	upgrade
i am using django-0.97 and cannot upgrade -- though the versioning of django being used should not play any part in the cause of the problem

1144609
ready	each
i could of course work out a way to load each frame into a texture discarding reusing the textures once rendered and playing the audio separately through xaudio2 however as well as writing a loader for at least one format ive also got to deal with stuff like synchronising the video and audio components so hopefully there is an eaier solution available or even a ready made free one with a suitable lisence commercial distribution in binary form dynamic linking is fine in the case of say lgpl

1144614
rss	feed
the problem is that the original pipe was parsing an rss feed filled with dublin core tags example dc title dc source etc

1144649
initializer	class-method
by convention there s a difference in how you manage objects that are initializer with -init instance methods versus class-method like +arraywithobjects in the first case you have to release the object yourself but in the second case the object has already been sent an -autorelease message and will be deallocated on the next pass through the program s runloop unless you call -retain on it

1144717
textarea	textbox
i did not create a templatefield itemtemplate edititemtemplate because i was planning on using jquery to convert the boundfield row to a edit field by just converting the text in each cell to a textbox or textarea when that row was clicked

1144731
folder	directory
given that i only want the release mode versions in my utilities directory what switch would allow me to specify that i want all executables from my tree structure but only from within release folder

1144744
google-chrome	firefox
which launches firefox and the ide but i don t know enough about the selenium ide or google-chrome to get any further

1144848
children	parent
this is more efficient than a join since the second query will take but two index scans at most the first one to make sure to find out if a child exists the second one to select the parent row if no children exist

1144866
folder	dir
if i run the above in a folder that has several subfolders containing executables i get a dir list of all of the executables in each folder

1144867
memcached	apc
you can cache to files to ram with apc for instance to a caching server like memcached for instance

1144879
dictionary	map
if you want more you would want a lookup table hash map dictionary etc or some reflection based system

1144886

1145097
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome it works well and as expected however in ie 8 the html code is changed to this

avm2	neko
you could alternatively use haxe which is a high level open source language that allows compiling translating to avm1 bytecode avm2 bytecode php source javascript source neko vm bytecode c++ source .net and jvm are being worked on .

1145120
actionscript	haxe
has been used a lot for web games so there are plenty of resources around you can use like physics engines ape for actionscript physaxe for haxe etc

1145134
post	get
and apart from common misleading information where post is safer than get it is not

1145142
ssl	https
your best bet is to use https ssl

1145232
vsto	add-in
fire up regmon start the office host application and see where it is and isn t looking for the vsto add-in

1145242
wicket	seam
to come to an end i did not yet look at scala but built some simple apps with grails - and i tend to go back to java even reimplementing every app that needs further development in a plain java framework - i think wicket and seam

1145269
gif	png
so i m looking for a command line tool that can convert a vsd file to jpeg png gif or any image that can be converted to an image that a browser can display

1145307
textile	bbcode
html textile wiki syntax markdown bbcode or even your own markup system can be easily implemented.

1145362

uiview	subviews
i have some custom uiview - subviews of a subviews of my viewcontroller s view

1145453
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in ie and opera this works perfectly but in firefox 3.5 google-chrome and

1145471
mouse	keyboard
alternatively you could have a look at jinput as it is designed to cope with keyboard mouse whatever inputs

1145485
inherited	properties
bindings are evaluated relative to datacontext if their source isn t explicitly specified so your binding doesn t bind to your control but to the inherited context which is likely missing the properties you re binding to

1145490
clang	llvm
there is one in the llvm clang project

1145510
webclient	httpwebrequest
continue the download yourself with the httpwebrequest or webclient classes

1145521
xslt	xquery
indeed this feature is probably the main reason to use xslt and not xquery looking at closely related languages

1145540
centos	linux
i m on centos linux with python version 2.6

1145557
folder	directory
when you write the script you could probably have the syntax for running the script be something like assuming the script file is in your python directory with the new file defaulting to a file of the same name and in the same folder directory as the original albeit with a different extension

1145572
public	protected
if you do not want to offer those operations in your public protected interface the solution you have posted declaring another class as a friend and using it as a proxy into your internal code is a fine solution

1145605
dbf	dbase
dbf old dbase format most likely created using foxpro not always though

1145652
serializable	deserialization
however if you re writing a purely-asp.net ui then having a web app call web services that are likely hosted locally has serious performance implications messaging and serializable deserialization overhead

1145672
firefox	safari
safari firefox no problems

1145693
nsstring	nsdata
yourplist must be a kind of nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary object

1145694
put	get
a big problem with popular rpc implementations like soap or xml-rpc is that they use http underneath their own proprietary architecture rather than taking advantage of all the different properties of http like put get delete etc

1145699
versioning	upgrade
do you make it easy for the next upgrade to bolt on a new module or do you weld it shut and worry about adding a plug-in module when you do the next versioning

1145875
superclass	subclassing
the proper way to do it is to generate a superclass subclassing or wrapper class

1145875
getter	setter
i ve written a set of annotations that generate getter setter and other fun stuff

1145875
getter	setter
and it ll generate persongen for you with the fields getter setter and bound property support

1145913
apache	lighttpd
it does set the session variable which was good enough but now im using lighttpd for the site including the confirmation page and apache for the actual uploader processor script because lighttps sucks at uploading large files so the session vars don t get transferred between the 2 server software

1145940
int	chars
if you look at the utf-8 encoding int values 0..127 are the encodings for the original us-ascii chars set

1145940
int	chars
assuming you just want to see what bytes utf-8 chars is made of i suggest you stick to the int output you already have or maybe use hex if that is more sensible - as your 127 bytes arn t valid unicode you re unlikely to get consistent results across different programs

1145973
ubuntu	linux
remember that i m using linux ubuntu intrepid ibex

1145976
cvs	svn
as you do not have merge tracking in cvs you will start to miss it as soon as you are getting used to svn but not at the beginning

1145976
cvs	svn
as you may use cvs alias module this is a feature not available in svn you may want to use externals to get a similar behaviour in svn

1145999
bazaar	git
however for personal projects one of the distributed version control systems git bazaar mercurial might be a better idea as they do not require a server tu run and are more flexible when it comes to workflow choices

1146011
min	max
min would be _get max - 5

1146022
istream	getline
yep and is the string version of getline no the istream one

1146041
min	max
user gives max 53 then min 50

1146115
gmail	hotmail
assuming you know how to save the data to mysql already you will need access to a mail server either your own a webhosts or you could use a free one such as gmail or hotmail

1146117
subtraction	modulo
you can convert the remainder operator into the mathematician s modulo by checking to see if you fell of the bottom each time you do subtraction

1146122
folder	directory
make sure you set tsvn s only load in windows exlporer option and configure it specifically for what folder on your system have local-svn working directory this will greatly reduce the working set for their shell extension

1146131
firefox	safari
then it dispatches the event to the first responder that usually is the control with a blue bezel around its border try to click on the address field in safari or firefox when it s blue-bezeled then it has first-responder status

1146138
int	chars
if you have a look at an ascii table you can see how the int values map to chars

1146146
profiling	instrumentation
profiling is usually not an option for me because i most times troubleshoot live production systems i cannot instrumentation

1146170
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
write it yourself using a fileinputstream a fileoutputstream and a buffer to copy bytes from one to the other - or better yet use filechannel.transferto

1146186
int	double
this has implications not just on performance you cannot unbox an int as a double for example despite that conversion working on unboxed instances

1146214
svg	vml
it uses svg and falls back to vml on msie

1146217
post	put
i d say it would be fine to put a post edit and delete column

1146240
subtract	add
a proper one would be an interface such as inumeric or iarithmetic with methods such as add subtract etc implemented by all primitive types such as int and long

1146259
versioning	upgrade
when there are versioning dependencies between components you can find yourself backed into a non-working situation if you re forced to upgrade one component say for security reasons before a compatible versioning of a dependent component is available

1146263
opera	google-chrome
tested under ie 8.0 google-chrome 2.0 and opera 10.0

1146290
gif	png
exporting to bitmap or other compressed formats jpg gif png

1146307
rss	feed
when you visit the page it creates do you actually see an rss feed with only a single post on it

1146307
rss	feed
if it doesn t then it probably a capability of wordpress because wordpress really only creates rss files for the home feed and category tag feed because those actually update on a regular basis

1146307
post	get
when i go to i get the comments feed for the individual post

1146319
folder	directory
you have your src folder in your build path as such it will try to build anything in your .svn directory

1146334
many-to-many	one-to-many
this works by giving each user a role one-to-many and each role has a number of permissions many-to-many

1146353
folder	directory
on win32 systems subversion creates a folder named subversion typically inside the application data area of the user s profile directory which by the way is usually a hidden directory

1146455
subtraction	addition
a decade or two ago it was worthwhile to write numerical code to avoid using multiplies and divides and use addition and subtraction instead

1146467
nginx	lighttpd
you can also look into lighttpd and nginx

1146472
hide	show
i want to program my mouse button to show hide the finder

1146489
uiview	subviews
you can do this by using uiview s subviews property

1146500
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication	division	addition	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
i can t find a definitive reference but extensive experimentation tells me that float multiplication nowadays is just about the same speed as addition and subtraction while division isn t but not many times slower either

1146516
addition	multiplication
there is probably very little difference in time between multiplication and addition

1146516
division	multiplication
division on the other hand is still significantly slower then multiplication because of its recursive nature

1146518
requiredfieldvalidator	checkboxlist
they show you how to create a validator for the checkbox and checkboxlist controls that works exactly like the requiredfieldvalidator for the other .net controls

1146655
perforce	cvs
so far in my whole working life i have used only perforce and i do not know anything about cvs i read the whole cvs manual but could not find how to do this

1146705
gmail	hotmail
please only answer if you have tried your solution by sending an email to a gmail account from either a gmail hotmail or yahoo email account

1146730
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the same behaviour is apparent in google-chrome firefox and opera

1146751
content-disposition	content-type
i see the lines setting the content-type and the content-disposition but without the content-transfer-encoding you ll get the default 7bit .

1146752
inherited	subclassing
so there proves that the sizer im using wxgridsizer can successfully call its parent class s method inherited subclassing insert

1146760
client-side	server-side
all of this is mostly about doing some or all of the work client-side which intrinsically scales up better than any purely server-side approach -- because by definition you get proportionally more computing power in your users browsers

1146768
for-loop	loops
in a for-loop there is only one iteration variable for all of the loops

1146780
hide	show
so for instance on the form_open event you could use the code doaccesswindow 0 to hide access s interface then on the form_close event you would use doaccesswindow 1 to show the interface again

1146783
pop-up	dialog
sometimes it worked but when it didn t it would pop-up a dialog which said

1146783
pop-up	dialog
but yes enough resources to pop-up the dialog

1146815
folder	directory
then eclipse will know what the .svn folder are for and quit treating them as source directory

1146843
serializable	deserialization
it s not only about whether you would just end up testing the .net serializable deserialization

1146843
serializable	deserialization
you should have static xml data that can be used to compare against serializable output and to use as input data for deserialization

1146882
subtract	add
finding left edge from that is trivial subtract w add 1 as a box from 80 to 80 is 1px wide

1146934
post	get
i want to point my parser at the specific entrie s url and get back clean text of the post itself

1146939
int	chars
should you wish to ignore chars data completely however then in order to account for column values that will not convert naturally to an int you could make use of the isnumeric function to test for column data as being numeric

1146940
multiplying	modulo
many hash functions combine the various elements in the data by multiplying them with some factors modulo the power of two corresponding to the word size of the machine that modulo is free by just letting the calculation overflow

1146999
gitignore	git-add
if you ve already added a file called test.txt using git-add then adding test.txt to gitignore will still cause changes to test.txt to be tracked

1147073
width	height
the imagesource object has a height and a width property but they return the size in 1 96 inches

1147077
uiview	calayer
when you use a uiimageview what happens is the calayer that provides the visual appearance of all uiview subclasses on the iphone has it s content property set to a cgimage object

1147125
dictionary	map
if it makes sense you can format the json data as a dictionary and gwt s dictionary class will map directly to it

1147161
html5lib	beautifulsoup
i used to use beautifulsoup for such tasks but now i have shifted to html5lib which works well in many cases where beautifulsoup fails

1147161
elementtree	beautifulsoup
other alternative is to use element soup which is a wrapper for beautifulsoup using elementtree

1147204

integration with desktop environments kde apps vs gnome apps

1147204
openbsd	netbsd
politics and project leadership issues openbsd vs netbsd glibc vs eglibc

1147215
onclick	onchange
you can change onclick with onchange if you want

1147226
jar	manifest.mf
why do we ever need to create manifest.mf file in tomcat if the jar file in tomcat is enough to handle all the requirements

1147231
maven	m2e
i get stuck with m2e and maven

1147232
int	chars
usually a simple hash function works by taking the component parts of the input chars in the case of a string and multiplying them by the powers of some constant and adding them together in some int type

1147232
int	chars
then if a bunch of strings all having the same first chars are fed in then the results will all be the same modulo k at least until the int type overflows

1147235
yacc	bison
see the chapter parsing sql in lex yacc o reilly in google books lpg pt1 dq bison 20flex 20sql 20grammar client firefox-a hl en pg pa109

1147243
folder	directory
system.io.directory.createdirectory can be used to create the final directory it will also automatically create all folder in the path if they do not exist

1147244
createfile	getlasterror
createfile would fail and the getlasterror function would return error_sharing_violation

1147246
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter
i want to change the background image based on mouseenter and mouseleave events to achieve a mouseover effect for the buttons

1147248
eiffel	ada
apart from erlang most languages followed imperative design-by-contract paradigms ada eiffel c++

1147257
width	margin
otherwise you might want to try tricks like width 100 or margin 0 auto

1147278
super	extends
the most counterintuitive concept i came across is the pecs producer extends consumer super from josh bloch

1147287
implements	extends
lots of portal servers support it and it s more portable across vendors because it s not as complex and it s not a spec for vendors to implements and extends

1147320
int	chars
if the first chars is i j k l m or n the variable is int

1147324
int	chars
if the first chars is i j k l m or n the variable is int can hold a whole number value

1147512
integer	unsigned
i have a string in php came from some data source which represents a formatted unsigned 32-bit integer

1147512
integer	unsigned
i need to store it into a mysql database as a signed 32-bit integer so that later i can retrieve it from php and use it as a possibly negative signed integer constant since php doesn t have unsigned integers

1147512
integer	unsigned
i know how to convert a signed integer into unsigned using mysql

1147567
next	except
and it worked fine well except for the fact that there are extra spaces next to where the quotes used to be but it s hard to know what you want there

1147581
mouse	keyboard
the scroll bars do appear and i can scroll with them but i d also like to be able to scroll with the mouse wheel and the arrow keys on the keyboard

1147634
children	parent
a repository saves the entire aggregate parent and children

1147634
children	parent
for instance having a parent class country with a list of city children

1147642
mouseover	mouseout
i think you need to separate the handling of mouseover and mouseout events

1147642
mouseover	mouseout
presumably you want the mouseover handler to be attached to the top level menu element and the mouseout handler to be attached to the hidden dropdown div with some state code to manage conflicts

1147673
post	get
i m using asp.net page that is fully ajaxified with jquery lib and calling another asp.net callback page to get post data to server

1147768
width	height
there used to be a complex best-practice formula around for how you tested for correct height width

1147772
ubuntu	debian	fink	macports
on a mac you can do that too but macports and fink just don t are the same quality and so updated as debian ubuntu fedora etc

1147791
folder	directory
all you have to do is extract it and put it somewhere i prefer the libs folder in your python directory

1147816
put	get
by autoreleasing the object all we re doing is saying this object will get released at some arbitrary point in the future. that means you can put the autoreleased object into the array destroy the array and the object might probably still exist

1147832
entity-relationship	diagram
i would like to create a entity-relationship diagram based on my database design in db2

1147832
entity-relationship	diagram
ms sql has a facility to create entity-relationship diagram from db schema but db2 doesn t seem to have one at least to my knowledge

1147858
versioning	upgrade
but if you do use the splitter then--yes--you will have to upgrade to a versioning that has a splitter before doing it

1147921
width	height
some users prefer a xterm type emulator which does not have a fixed width height

1147946
nsbezierpath	nsanimation
then use nsbezierpath s element methods to walk along the path and draw each segment along the way on a timer or using nsanimation

1147951
ubuntu	linux
bonus points if it runs under linux ubuntu

1147960
profiling	benchmarking
the best way to answer this question is to actually write a benchmarking profiling of the processing you need to do

1147960
subtract	add
this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle it will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit

1147960
division	multiplication
so for floating point you can generally assume division will take longer because it s impractical to unroll the multiplication which is already a large circuit in and of it s self into pipeline of a multitude of multiplier circuits

1147977
dictionary	map
commonly when people want to do this the correct thing is to use a data structure such as a hash table dictionary map that stores key names and associated values

1148001
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript are standard windows script host languages

1148034
snmp	mib
from previous experiences with snmp and can open i like the idea of object dictionaries or information bases mib as a generic way to describe a device and the fields it sends receives in messages

1148071
rss	feed
i am building a web service that involves parsing of 3rd party rss feed

1148104
rss	feed
pubsubhubbub aims to remedy that -- though both the rss feed supplier and the rss feed consumer will need to support it before it s any concrete use to you

1148106
speex	ogg
speex is not a real transport format -- it has no framing built into the protocol so it is typically wrapped in an ogg stream whose api is unfortunately more complicated than the speex api itself but i digress... so audio x-speex really means speex in ogg

1148112
width	height
i think you should also set the width and height of your inputimage in xaml to 100 x 100 in order to see the image.

1148122
filesystems	ntfs
i ve also tested direct filesystems persistency under ntfs but the performance degrades very fast as soon as it reaches half a millions objects

1148173
width	height
one is to use an ajax request sending the width and height as parameters

1148174
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have tested this on all major browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox 2.x firefox 3.x opera 9.6x safari 3

1148191
disk	ram
doesn t that force the server to keep all uploads in ram rather than buffering to disk

1148219
photoshop	paint.net
paint.net is as a freeware good for bitmaps and icons a mini photoshop

1148222
versioning	upgrade
you have to make sure your local sql instance is exactly at the same build versioning versioning like the hosting provider otherwise your local sql may upgrade the database structure and you ll be unable to restore it back on the hosting provider or you ll be unable to restore in on your local server if your versioning is earlier than the host s

1148251
x86	64bit
also i don t know if this has to be done separately for the x86 version of ie to apply to 32 bit apps and to the x64 version of ie for the 64bit apps

1148255
put	get	width	height
simply get rid of the background and border put the background-url in the input selector and give it the right width and height

1148265
put	get
and once a day or once an hour you get the idea use a batch to parse those files and put the data in database

1148287
lisp	scheme
i still have plain c scheme lisp and scala - and many interesting frameworks - on my to-learn list

1148302
keydown	keyup
the keyboard events are keydown when you push any key down keypress after keydown and keyup when you let go of the key

1148302
keydown	keyup
if you hold down a key the keydown and keypress events trigger repeatedly until you let go at which point keyup fires

1148302
mouse	keyboard
also the enter event doesn t refer to the enter key it refers to anytime you enter that control whether by clicking your mouse into it or moving to it via the keyboard

1148315
int	chars
file.cpp 21 error no matching function for call to â file read int chars int â

1148354
invokerequired	begininvoke
or you can use the invokerequired and invoke or begininvoke methods on the control instance to have it execute code on the ui thread

1148359
pull	push
the flow is do your commits locally push to online repo login to your server switch to the project and pull the changes

1148359
pull	push
one rule of thumb is to never edit project code on the server always commit locally and push then pull to the server

1148468
post	get
afaik ajax.actionlink doesn t allow you to easily get form values and post them with ajax

1148528
width	height
the array is the same width and height than the expected bitmap

1148572
for-loop	loops
whenever there is a chance that a collection will be modified in a loops opt for a for-loop instead

1148593
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
w3c browsers firefox safari opera etc.

1148603
ubuntu	debian
packages submitted to debian will also make their way into ubuntu in due course

1148619
maven	pom.xml
without seeing your pom.xml it s hard to say one thing to check is that maven expects your aspects to be under src main aspect rather than src main java by default

1148639
post	get
you may find you need to use the prg pattern post redirect get

1148672
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby and ironpython dynamic languages in sl

1148702
apache	nginx
thin nginx is very easy to set up compared to apache mongrel and uses less memory

1148721
kerberos	ntlm
for your sso needs you should use proper kerberos spnego instead of the legacy ntlm

1148776
pseudo-class	visited
you could set it for the different pseudo-class separately so visited hover and active as well or for the a tag altogether

1148784
haskell	ocaml
if you like using lists for most things and care about performance use haskell or ocaml

1148784
haskell	ocaml
if you re looking to write threaded multi-core code use scala or haskell ocaml requires you to fork

1148784
haskell	ocaml
none of scala ocaml or haskell have truly great standard libraries but at least you can easily use java libs in scala

1148784
haskell	ocaml
haskell and ocaml have a reasonable amount of 3rd party libs

1148803
rss	feed
naturally the controller should only populate the viewmodel with data and the view itself should format the data according to the target medium dates in rss feed are formatted differently than dates on normal websites

1148804
haskell	ocaml
in my mind there are three viable candidates haskell standard ml ocaml

1148804
haskell	sml
not to be found in haskell or sml

1148818
post	get
i m trying to get my arduino with arduino ethernet shield set up as a server to understand get and post requests

1148890
super	extends
arrayextender is an empty class that extends array and calls super in the constructor

1148892
executable	upx
compress your executable and any dlls using something like aspack or upx

1148903
notepad++	scite
you can edit usertype.dat file for a bit of syntax highlighting but it s nicer to use an editor which has support for nsis files any scintilla based editor - scite notepad++ notepad2

1148907
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it looks like you are trying to implement uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller

1148940
google-chrome	safari
remember that the webkit renderer in safari and google-chrome make all textareas resizable with a handle by default

1148947
put	get
so i couldn t get jquery to do it but plain old javascript as ddkilzer suggested works so i put together this function to apply the autocapitalize off option to all inputs with a specific class

1148964
powerpc	i386
i would like to know how you can support i386 and powerpc architectures for programs at bin

1148966
accessor	properties
a simple option would be to add a properties to your model object with an accessor that normalises the appropriate field short description in this case down to a suitable slug

1148972
post	put
the save method does a create or update but calling put or post is the exact same thing imo

1148980
powerpc	i386
be aware that there is more than just powerpc and i386 although these are the safest architectures to choose for a universal binary

1148980
powerpc	i386
there you can see that a modern osx binary is likely to contain any of powerpc ppc64 i386 or x86_64

1149000
inherited	subclassing
i also want to add that you must catch in order of inherited from lowest subclassing to highest parent class

1149043
client-side	server-side
essentially gwt provides client-side and server-side components

1149059
width	height
however i m looking for a solution to ease the inherent difficulties of string height width calculations and all of that arithmetic to make these uilabels line up with word wrapping nicely

1149069
powerpc	i386
what is going on is an internal implementation detail and may vary from release to release or even between different configurations of the same release 32 bit vs 64 bit iphone vs mac os x arm vs i386 vs powerpc

1149090
gdi	direct2d
if you re writing graphics code for windows 7 you should consider direct2d over gdi which has a programming model that is compatible with but very different than gdi s

1149133
stdout	stderr
an example where this would be useful is some sort of customizable logging routines where you might want to send the output to stdout console.out stderr console.error or nowhere system.io.textwriter.null or anything else based on some runtime condition

1149135
bash	zsh
his instructions assume bash but should work the same for zsh

1149140
daemons	launchd
the daemons as far as i understand it is just a convenient way to bypass having to manually launchd a program at boot

1149151
width	height
take a sample cgsize that is the same width as your cell but with a height larger than the max height you expect

1149154
ostream	istream
add the necessary operators istream ostream equal operator etc

1149158
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
a method for multiplication using only addition subtraction and doubling is called ancient egyptian multiplication

1149172
hide	show
this project uses a lot of rich interaction and show hide functionality based on a complex set of combinations of application states closer to what you would find in a flash flex application perhaps

1149177
post	get
when talking about some of them being more dangerous than others i would indeed separate and as it includes out from as it is slightly harder to generate manipulate a post request than a get request

1149177
post	get
that way you have have already excluded some very easy get drive-by attacks and can now focus on validating your post data

1149186
centos	linux
need to run linux preferably centos but also run windows virtualised for testing

1149205
crypt	hash
instead crypt is used to generate a hash of the password

1149205
crypt	hash
when you type in your password crypt is applied to that and then the two hash are compared

1149205
crypt	hash
essentially the function of crypt is to translate the text into some new text from which the original can never be recovered but which has a low probability of generating the same hash for two different keys

1149206
crypt	salt
the crypt function takes a password key as a string and a salt character array which is described below and returns a printable ascii string which starts with another salt

1149221
restructuredtext	asciidoc
latex markdown with pandoc in mind restructuredtext with pandoc or sphinx in mind asciidoc with docbook tools in mind and docbook with docbook tools in mind--see pandoc

1149233
kde	kubuntu
edit i am running on kubuntu 9.04 i386 using kde 4.3 via backports

1149250
pascal	delphi
delphi refers to both a programming language built around an object-oriented evolution of pascal known as object pascal and its associated rad ide development environment

1149250
pascal	delphi
that s a pretty formal definition though and you can generally use delphi and object pascal interchangeably

1149288
postgresql	mysql
if you want to go open source i would recommend using postgresql instead of mysql

1149295
hide	show
the safest and simplest method is to track when the keyboard hide show

1149369
crypt	salt
without salt crypt is basically just a one-way hashing function

1149369
hash	salt
the salt is usually randomly selected and if the salt are different then the hash passwords will be dramatically different

1149371
ready	each
you can have a field in the database for each image which means my thumbnail is ready so please include me in galleries

1149381
factors	mean
yea as mentioned in other posts gc know when to start collection better than you the factors that no buttons are clicked in your application doesn t mean that it is the time to start cleaning gc is doing some kind of lockings when moving the objects so this may cause low performance if you will abuse gc.collect

1149422
postgresql	mysql
the rails trunk has adapters for mysql postgresql and sqlite which you could base your adapter on

1149453
public	protected
my preferred solution for this would be to provide protected accessor functions to communicate clearly to the class s users that these are not part of the public interface

1149479
free	malloc
of course at this point you will probably want a deallocate function and make sure that this is always called to perform the corresponding free for the new malloc s

1149495
sorting	filtering
i think doing a sql data reader may be the ticket but if i am not mistaken you need to keep the connection open as you iterate which doesn t seem to make much sense the other approach is to just select the page of data return it and offer an iterator over that collection when you get to the end it pulls down next page this would work but means i have to cook up a lot of sql constructs to support sorting filtering and paging but in the end that may be the solution

1149515
pascal	delphi
you should also check out marco cantu s site and look for the essential pascal and essential delphi books

1149611
post	get
i chose this method after reading this post where cheeso has managed to get these two encryption methods to play together

1149624
geocoding	geocode
alternatively you can send geocoding requests directly to the http geocode

1149624
geocoding	geocode
more information on the http geocode service can be found here google api geocoding

1149644
folder	directory
then during the install method you could simply create a folder in the windows directory by using the variables of the environment class

1149659
accessor	properties
all java singleton patterns both this and the standard with private constructor and static accessor have this bad properties that if you to test them or test anything that even remotely depends on them can use this and only this object

1149706
superclass	subclassing
and object-oriented design principles tell us that you can use a subclassing in any place where you can also use its superclass but not the other way around

1149731
hash	md5
md5 or hashlib - calculating hash digest md5 eg to find duplicate files .

1149740
cpython	ironpython
if you like need to use .net framework use ironpython else cpython it s your choice

1149762
cpython	ironpython
use cpython with ironpython you are bound to .net platform which do not have much cross platform support mono is there on linux but still for a cross platform app i wouldn t recommend .net

1149762
wxpython	pyqt
so my suggestion is use cpython for gui use a framework like wxpython pyqt and you would be happy

1149835
fflush	gets
what i would recommend is making a method of signalling that this cached data should be refreshed like a database-stored timestamp that gets looked at when session_start happens and if the cached data is older than the timestamp the cache is fflush

1149848
switching	screens
clicking somehwere else on the screens or switching applications by alt-tab

1149910
base-class	derived-class
note that he does go beyond the usual answers when someone will delete a derived-class object via a base-class pointer and make your destructor virtual if your class has any virtual functions

1149919
int	chars
now i have to supply contents of the list as chars data int length

1149998
wordpress	joomla
i just want to know about the files and folder structure for a site which is a plugin oriented like wordpress or joomla

1150013
allocator	stl
stl containers like std list and std vector have constructors accepting an allocator type

1150013
allocator	stl
this option is rarely used but using your own allocator in a real time environment is a good example of where this feature is useful and proves that the designers of stl did a very good job

1150062
getter	setter
i build in the entity a getter and setter for that collection

1150062
getter	setter
then for example from an ejb i retrieve the collection using the getter add or remove the desired course and finally use the setter to assign the new collection

1150095
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
it s not that hard once you pick a version control utility be it git svn hg bazaar

1150095
bazaar	git
popularity of git mercurial bazaar vs

1150097
ubuntu	linux
oh and skip web development on windows go install vmware server and install any distribution though for ease of use try ubuntu unless you are already on a linux machine mac it will save you lots of development headaches later on though may be a pain initially

1150097
postgresql	mysql
as for your question on databases even though the books may suggest using sqlite try and avoid it and go for something like postgresql instead of mysql the benefits will become obvious to you once you start looking at more advanced sql stuff

1150122
implements	extends
honestly i believe the hungarian notation was introduced with c# because there is not extends and implements keyword like in java

1150122
implements	extends
since php does have extends and implements keywords it makes sense to use the java convention

1150128
trac	bugzilla
svn also integrates with trac a bug tracking system and bugzilla so you can tie your work tickets to code

1150147
user-controls	tabcontrol
i have a xaml code that should load my user-controls inside the tabcontrol

1150150
post	get
observe the login process on the page if it s get or post method and if it uses a cookie

1150151
button	checkbox
i have three radio button and 4 checkbox

1150198
pascal	delphi
i haven t seen a pascal language resource as perfect as the delphi help itself

1150198
pascal	delphi
i hadn t heard about pascal before i got a copy of delphi

1150198
pascal	delphi
i learned pascal from delphi s help system object pascal reference

1150198
pascal	delphi
you will have an intermediate level understanding of pascal language from delphi help

1150245
converter	multibinding
your approach is perfectly valid though i would use a multibinding for the second example rather than a such a specialised converter though by placing all your logic into the xaml you are producing very high coupling between the way the application looks and the way that it behaves because of this you may want to look into the mvvm pattern to separate those things out

1150331
post	get
the accepted answer doesn t seem to cover your post requirement as setting document.location will always result in a get request

1150367
hide	show
i have a flash object that i am trying to show and hide along with the rest of my hidden div

1150371
wxpython	pyqt
i don t know how tolerable wxpython or pyqt are on windows and linux but the further you get from plain cocoa on os x the harder it gets to build and the less pleasant it gets to use

1150422
int	boolean
it preserves the type hierarchy between int and boolean

1150424
profiling	debugging
the .net framework has unmanaged debugging and profiling apis that i assume people companies are familiar with

1150452
int	chars	int	boolean
since native_type and pdo_type return such drastically different values - i am using the len to try to test for strings vs text since everything less than 255 is a var chars int or boolean

1150466
mouseup	mousedown
i used mousedown to trigger dnd but with that for example on windows context menus stop working because they are triggered on mouseup

1150520
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
i also know how to bind a sqldatasource or objectdatasource to a control on a form or listview

1150549
inherited	subclassing
well maybe yes one of the features of oo is subclassing and subclassing inherited is one of the things that s problematic to model store in a sql database

1150555
post	get
if you have any sort of control over the source code of php script on the other server it should be post data and not get

1150555
post	get
however if you have a very valid practical reasons to use get instead of post

1150557
hide	show
if the players still insist on being show you can hide them in the document.ready event

1150585
formview	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	repeater	gridview	detailsview	listview	gridview
for instance a gridview repeater listview formview or detailsview

1150626
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you are probably best off with a sortedlist or even better a sorteddictionary

1150647
width	height
it may not work fine if it is called when the map is hidden using display none since it would have zero height and width

1150650
free	malloc
as an old-skool c c++ developer it seems strange that allocating the normal way using malloc and free is only mentioned in some footnotes

1150650
free	malloc
i know that malloc and free work in objective-c but i m curious if it is common practice or not

1150665
free	malloc
it s perfectly fine to use malloc and free to do your own memory management

1150676
boost	allocator
custom allocator for our memory leak tracking system our instrumenting profiler and a few other systems we preallocate and or pool see boost pool allocs using a provided allocator -- usually for std set or std map but the principle is the same for std list

1150685
pthreads	fcntl
i believe fcntl is a pthreads function

1150687
free	malloc
in many cases it s advantageous to use malloc and free to avoid the overhead of the objective-c runtime

1150706
mouse	keyboard
what s even more i can easily navigate using the keyboard but not with the mouse click

1150758
superclass	subclassing
say you have a simple class hierarchy consisting of superclass a and subclassing b

1150795
inherited	properties
what you likely need is to have a non-generic abstract base class for allocationnew that exposes a properties for the resource as a common base type even if the closest thing is object then have your generic implementation inherited and expose its own strongly-typed properties or for a cleaner approach have it replace the parent weakly-typed properties with your strongly-typed version

1150825
vtk	itk
itk is not built on top of vtk although they are related

1150825
vtk	itk
one can easily process data with itk and then switch to a vtk pipeline for the visualization and interaction functionality

1150825
vtk	itk
we have built fairly large and complex medical image processing and visualization applications experimental surgical planning in python using a combination of vtk itk and wxpython

1150837
rss	icalendar
the free plan provides you with 200mb storage access for two people unlimited repos milestone management bug tracking rss and icalendar support etc

1150843
integer	unsigned
would write my_int as a unsigned 32-bit integer and my_string as a length-prefixed string where the prefix is u16le. to read the file back you would flip the arrows

1150853
maya	blender
as a start hint for how to go about this in your modeling tool blender maya 3ds max etc. you model your avatar and all its clothes you need and rig them to the same skeleton

1150889
config	ini
it has some unique features like database migrations implementation of interfaces differs from languages like java php and others config files are not like ini files you can write code

1150899
g++	gcc
i don t find g++ s asm ugly or hard to understand though i ve been working with gcc for over 8 years now

1150913
irrlicht	ogre3d
a couple of people have said ogre3d i ll offer up irrlicht as an alternative

1150943
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy	cpython	ironpython
it so happens that these specific tactics and heuristics given their clearly-positive tradeoffs have been pervasive in all recent versions of cpython and i believe ironpython jython and pypy as well

1150957
hide	show
ignoring the javascript needed to show it hide it and change its colours

1150957
for-loop	arrays
before you think about the html involved think about how your for-loop would know when it reaches the end of a page in your arrays and how it would start a new one

1150957
hide	show
as you probably know css can be used to change colours when the mouse moves over items and you can use jquery to apply handlers and show hide your divs

1150964
post	get
it s sensible if you post a lot of tweets to use the rpp parameter so that your feed doesn t get clipped at 15

1150981
ncover	nant
about nant integration ncover has its own nant task

1150981
gendarme	fxcop
for a fxcop replacement check out gendarme

1150988
serializable	deserialization
just as a side note in our case as we had other constraints as runtime definition of types and we ended up building our own meta-type-system to build types at runtime a type of variant and then we ended up implementing deserialization for those types boost style so our serializable don t work with basic c++ types but rather with serializable data pairs

1150995
post	get
shouldn t a method such as that below have an http method of get rather than the specified post

1151012
put	get	post	put	post	get
for example our api has the capability to work entirely with post requests because it needs to be called by flash which has bugs with get cannot send request headers and cannot send put or delete

1151029
ubuntu	linux
i am specifically running ubuntu gnu linux with a 2.6.27-9 kernel

1151037
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
there are the openfiledialog and savefiledialog classes

1151038
cimg	magick++	imagemagick	magick++
use imagemagick magick++ or cimg to accomplish this

1151058
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it loads fine in firefox ie8 and opera but fails in google-chrome and safari 4 with a syntax error

1151081
postgresql	mysql	apache	nginx
not very relevant but i also used nginx and postgresql over my usual choices of apache and mysql i have no problem with apache and mysql i just thought i d try something new

1151131
subtract	add
you need only add subtract the offset to the geopolitical time zone offset in the past present or future

1151134
projectile	angle
generate a path given the angle and velocity of the projectile banana

1151161
pseudo-class	visited
the pseudo-class link visited hover active don t do exactly what i want which is to highlight the last-clicked link on a page to be a different color from all of the other links on the page

1151191
xslt	xquery
if you use the saxon xslt xquery engine there is an early implementation of xml schema 1.1 included for experimentation

1151204
subtraction	addition
date subtraction addition could then be built on that

1151266
accessor	properties
using objective c accessor and properties instead of directly setting ivars and using retain release simplifies doing the right thing quite a bit

1151282
subtraction	addition
with the 60-or-so-bit-integer class in hand supporting addition subtraction comparison through corresponding methods or helper functions you can then write a customdatetime class which supports all your required logic

1151306
rss	feed
i would like to install a growl alert for rss feed

1151327
post	get
the biggest problem with is you may be trying to get data from a post d form but might have a get parameter with the same name

1151327

in .net you need that equals object and gethashcode are compatible

1156472
equals	gethashcode
implement equals separately from gethashcode

1156472
equals	gethashcode
implement a greater precision gethashcode64 the overrided gethashcode 32 bits will return int gethashcode64 and equals will return this.gethashcode64 other.gethashcode64

1156486
equals	gethashcode
say you add two objects to a hashset that have the same hashcode then the container will use the gethashcode first to find where approximately in the hashset the object is then use the equals on all the matching objects to find your exact object

1156487
equals	gethashcode
it s a good idea to keep the implementation of equals separate from gethashcode because they do quite different things

1156490

1156524
equals	gethashcode
it s perfectly valid for gethashcode to have collisions but equals must not return false positives

1156524
equals	gethashcode
in fact it s perfectly fine to always return 0 in gethashcode and only implement equals

pop-up	dialog
supports pop-up dialog like alert confirm login etc

1160524
post	get
you can use the webrequest class by setting the method property to post and writing the field data to the stream which you can get using the httprequest.getrequeststream method

1160545
getter	setter
synthesize will generate getter and setter methods for your property

1160545
getter	setter
dynamic just tells the compiler that the getter and setter methods are implemented not by the class itself but somewhere else like the superclass or will be provided at runtime

1160545
superclass	subclassing
uses for dynamic are with subclassing of nsmanagedobject coredata or when you want to create an outlet for a property defined by a superclass that was not defined as an outlet

1160548
implements	extends
public class foo extends java.lang.object implements scala.scalaobject

1160556
folder	directory
we have our web services in another folder in our virtual directory so i tried adding a web.config that did a clear on the namespaces but that did not appear to work

1160569
jdom	xom	jdom	dom4j	dom4j	xom
i would suggest something like tagsoup for java which fires off nice sax events which you can use directly or using an xml module of your choice raw dom jdom dom4j xom etc...

1160577
ftp	telnet
expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip etc

1160580

1160603
scrollable	panels
apart from the appearance panels is scrollable whereas groupbox isn t and groupbox has a caption whereas a panels doesn t

1160608
int	chars
where n is the numeric value of the chars you can just cast the chars to an int and concatenate with a string to get a decimal value

1160614
put	get
the callback appears to be trying to get the nowtime field and put it in a control on the page

1160615
versioning	upgrade
e the correct grails versioning or run grails upgrade if this grails versioning is n

1160620
portrait	landscape
this works as long as when the program is launched the device orientation is portrait but not if the initial orientation is landscape or upside down because self dorotationstuff makes changes relative to the difference from the previous orientation

1160635
post	get
if you want to get data using those examples replace the placholder values in the request with what you are querying from the service and post to it.

1160635
required	placeholder
edit i mean if you really need to replace those placholder values write code in your service to determine when someone does a get implying viewing from a browser and play with the response changing the placeholder values to whatever you required

1160704
spaces	delimiter
spaces is fine as a delimiter

1160707
queue	fifo
this isnt really correct but i thought of an waiting room it actually isnt a queue with a certain scheduling as fifo hrrn or such

1160756
getter	setter
there is another subtlety not yet mentioned synthesize will let you provide an implementation yourself of either a getter or a setter

1160756
getter	setter
this is useful if you only want to implement the getter for some extra logic but let the compiler generate the setter which for objects is usually a bit more complex to write yourself

1160880
hide	show
click hide the first menu item that was open the second show the second menu

1160922
mouse	keyboard
i have tried setting a breakpoint within the beforecollapse event but it not triggered unless the user explicitly collapses the node via the mouse or keyboard

1160937
uiview	subviews
it may well be easier to contain your table in a uiview as a subviews then swap in a loading view as a subviews instead until your data is ready for display

1160940
children	parent
by making your embedded templates children of a parent template you could allow them to have access to the parent s variables at output time

1160946
hide	show
i am using jquery to show hide lists but it takes two clicks on a link instead of just one to show the list

1161004
try-catch	exception-handling
more specifically what if the exception-handling is thrown inside catch block of an try-catch clause

1161017

there are many sites which call a script upon form submit and pass in parameters using http post or get using a web debugger i have found the parameters being passed

1161094
swt	swing
both of them based on the notion of changing bean property values which would work for swt or swing

1161103
vsto	add-in
create a vsto add-in project and add a ribbon xml class

1161186
crypt	salt
crypt is not a reversible algorithm it uses a one-way function which is rendered more difficult to brute force by the addition of salt to the encrypted value

1161202
post	get
place it before your original request the post and add a regex to the get retrieving the token

1161250
clang	llvm
interesting test between gcc and llvm clang for mips

1161266
jlist	jtable
personally i implement them when i m going to use objects in a jlist jtable or other structure that uses tostring or when i m debugging yes eclipse has debug formatters but tostring is easier

1161273
typedef	typename
typedef typename c iterator c_iterator

1161277
crypt	salt
the way that the crypt is salt will pretty much guarantee that what you re trying to do isn t going to work

1161280
children	parent
i am trying to do something when the mouse enters or leaves the parent control but i don t care if the mouse moves into one of its children

1161280
children	parent
i want a single flag to represent the mouse is somewhere inside the parent or children and the mouse has moved outside of the parent control bounds

1161280
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve tried handling mouseenter and mouseleave on the parent and both child controls but this means the action begins and ends multiple times as the mouse moves across the control

1161291
put	get
doesn t work - osx you need to put quotes around the otherwise you ll often get bizarre error messages because it can t cope with spaces in file names

1161306
versioning	upgrade
i said continue thinking that the server versioning would be upgrade as well to support the latest versioning

1161306
versioning	upgrade
it turned out that the server versioning won t be upgrade for some time from now and what that means is that i have to somehow downgrade my local crystal reports versioning to a lower versioning

1161313
ssl	https
asp.net uses an http post to send the data to the server - in order to secure any data encrypt the submission with an ssl certificate and use https

1161322
put	get
if you want to get really paranoid put the time of first request into the viewstate and refuse to use the viewstate after x minutes

1161366
children	parent
this should make your parent div expand even though its children have a float property

1161401
folder	directory
put all shared assemblies into a lib directory under your main trunk folder and reference them into your web site from lib

1161417
crypt	salt
even then crypt 3 traditionally involves 25 rounds of des with slight modifications to the algorithm based on the salt so you d expect it to be at least 25 times slower to brute-force

1161417
crypt	hash
newer implementations of crypt 3 are way beyond brute force since they re based on better hash algorithms than the des-based one that old crypt 3 used

1161515
twitter	myspace
also if you have an rpx plus pro account you can make simple rpx api calls to set a user s status and post activity on facebook and twitter myspace

1161562

you ll want to add the textinput in the create children function the textfield itself is created in button s which radiobutton subclasses createchildren method

1161576
domxpath	domdocument
so far i have been using domdocument and domxpath to query for that node but i m hoping there is a better way that i am missing

1161655
firefox	safari
have tried in safari a couple versions of firefox and ie7 and all look just the way that they are supposed to

1161698
equals	tostring
for example when a field is added or removed tostring should be updated appropriately you should be doing this already for methods like hashcode and equals

1161709
cpu	processors
i would have expected that the drawing would be fast enough even with the cpu just because processors are a lot faster than they were back then but apparently not.

1161714
post	get
the initial passing of a textbox input value to the server happens via traditional get or post variables passed in the http connection it s not related to the postback viewstate functionality of asp.net

1161740
division	logarithm
it is perfectly legal and often sensible to test for exactly zero before a division or logarithm since the answer is well defined for any non-zero value

1161752
accessor	properties
your favoritecolor properties needs to have both a get and a set accessor

1161767
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe

1161918
ddms	adb
you can get to the stack trace via adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse

1162006
xslt	xquery
that however won t fix that you are trying to use xslt defined extentions in xquery

1162006
xslt	xquery
it may be you could somehow get the xquery processor to refer to them but you almost certainly want to use xslt instead of xquery

1162009
inherited	subclassing
nested classed can be inherited in subclassing of the declaring class

1162101
actionscript	mxml
mate handles events using mxml tags swiz handles events by writing actionscript event handler methods

1162105
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
we ve been working on a plug-in for a while it sorta works but you should really use sharpdevelop or monodevelop at this point

1162113
crypt	hash
by design intent crypt is a one-way hash

1162113
crypt	salt
jeff had a blog post on rainbow tables too . salt helps protect against rainbow tables because you would need a table set for each possible value of the salt but the size of the salt used in the classic implementation of crypt is only 12 bits so that isn t as huge a block as might be hoped

1162124
junit	jmock	nunit	moq
junit jmock for unit testing code similar to nunit moq in .net world

1162151
post	get
the client wouldn t invoke doget - it would make a request probably a post rather than a get and your servlet would receive it

1162151
post	get
you could implement an rpcchannel which worked over servlets or get the client to make the http post directly

1162171
ant	maven
you can use hudson together with ant or maven as an continuous integration server

1162171
emma	checkstyle
you can combinte hudson with junit emma findbugs pmd and checkstyle to measure the quality of the code in your repository

1162185
junit	testng
for example you don t have to use junit you could use testng with basically just as much tool support

1162185
ant	maven
in terms of building assemblies jars wars and ears in the java world there are some built in tools in ides for one-man projects and there is ant or maven for a full fledged build tool

1162185
cruisecontrol	teamcity
if you mean continuous integration there is cruisecontrol that is free and teamcity which has no cost for low usage

1162206
postgresql	mysql
we then found out that postgresql 8.2 running on windows is so much slower compared to mysql 5.1

1162228
uiview	calayer
the problem is that somehow that instance variable changes from a uiview to a calayer in the middle of a reloaddata call which causes a crash since the instance has a special method to return it s expected height

1162274
keydown	keyup
you can t subscribe to this event on the richtextbox has built-in handling for the bubbling of keydown and keyup and between them the textinput is generated

post	get
but we accept everyone s situation is different so don t hesitate to post a price question in the aspose.purchase forums maybe you can get what you want

1162357
post	get
the actual link is info http get and http post are disabled by default

1162357
post	get

1162378
unix	bsd
almost all developers work primarily or exclusively on unix linux bsd

1162378
postgresql	mysql
postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance

1162383
maven	pom.xml
jettyconfig in maven s pom.xml this is actually being seen

1162395
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database

1162456
versioning	upgrade
right now whenever rails is updated and i upgrade the frozen versioning in my application by installing the new gem and refreezing it in order to commit it into my repository i need to do two steps first delete the old versioning and second add the new versioning

1162479
udp	tcp
i worked on a project with a 3g modem where we needed a udp ip stack no tcp on top of ppp

1162479
udp	tcp
in summary it was suitably functional for our udp ip and ppp needs but i can t comment on its tcp capabilities

1162572
pop-up	dialog
not exactly sure about your situation but we had a problem with a pop-up window that also displayed a print dialog box when loaded

1162583
equals	compareto
the equals method and for that matter also the compareto method can become a performance hotspot in a high-traffic hashmap

1162747
width	height
you should also note that your x and y were reversed in the original question -- you were offsetting on the y axis by the width and on the x axis by the height

1162834
accessor	properties
using the public accessor to set the properties to nil in dealloc either self setfoo nil or self.foo nil may have unwanted side effects

1162850
stdout	fflush
the real issue seems to be that if a process doesn t explicitly fflush its stdout then anything written to stdout is buffered rather than actually sent until the process is done so as to minimize io this is apparently an implementation detail of many c libraries made so that throughput is maximized through less frequent io

1162850
stdout	fflush
if you can easily modify the process so that it fflush stdout regularly then that would be your solution

1162858
division	multiplication
i need to do calculations division or multiplication with very large numbers

1162882
sorting	filtering
with less than 15 lines of code you ll get what you are looking for and have a huge amount of control over the display - plus filtering sorting and all sorts of other cool stuff when you are ready for it

1162888

we chose this due to our experience with scrum as an sdlc methodology

1162905
post	get
if you can t get that working post the code and we ll look at what s going on

1162929

1163076
int	chars
usually i could jump to the source for java classes using f3 or ctrl+click in eclipse even for classes like string chars int and even enum

1163105
networkstream	binaryreader
alternately maybe you can avoid using a to store data fragments and instead wrap your server-side client socket in a networkstream wrapped in a binaryreader so that you can read the components of your message direclty from the socket without worrying about buffer sizes

1163118
getter	setter
provide getter and setter functions for access to static file scope variables in your module

1163144
hash	md5
i m trying to see if a user logging in has entered the right password which is stored as an md5 hash

1163152
hash	md5
it should be a tinyblob or binary 32 because the results of an md5 hash can be mangled if stored in a varchar

1163181
networkstream	sslstream
if security is important simply wrap the networkstream in a sslstream to authenticate the server and optionally the clients with x.509 certificates

1163262
width	height
but even when the entire document was loaded width and height were locked at zero

1163282
width	height
the window is resizable and is having 350 pixels width and 250 pixels height

1163308
ironruby	ironpython
tier 4 dynamically typed jited languages google v8 ironpython ironruby

1163330
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
it seems that even though the inkpresenter is closest to the user the mousedown mousemove mouseup events are received by the image element

1163330
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
thus it would be the first to receive the mousedown mousemove mouseup events generated by the user however in this case the image receives them

1163341
postgresql	mysql
if you use mysql or postgresql you re still going to have to design your database correctly for scaling regardless of your app language and any tool you use to start clustering mirroring is going to be outside of your app

1163358
gif	png
and unless you require animation i d always recommend png over gif

1163447
post	get
you don t have to worry about decoding on the other side it is standard way of sending data through get post

1163459
int	chars
it seems python is reading them as chars and returning a string which cannot be converted to an int

1163550
uiview	subviews
also removed view because it was gratuitous a uilabel is a uiview you were stacking three view 2 of which have nothing but a single subviews which covers its full frame. and it elided the uiviewcontroller view property in general it is bad to make local variables with the same name as instance variables or properties there are compiler warnings you can turn on to avoid that

1163561
postgresql	mysql
for example postgresql uses a process per connection mysql uses a thread

1163578
division	multiplication
this worked for me except i had to use floor to remove the fractional part of the division before the multiplication

1163578
division	multiplication
i would have expected the division of two long values to result in a long thus removing the decimal part but it resolves it as a double leaving the exact same value after the multiplication

1163580
hash	md5
but once the file is uploaded you should compare the md5 hash of the files

1163580
hash	md5
instead of calculating the md5 hash of a file over and over again you could consider keeping a little database in which you cache the results

1163588
uiview	subviews
when the user toggles the segmented control in the root view create a new uiview in a similar fashion named subview2 and switch it with the current subviews of switchview

if you create a script with a maven invocation for each file and keep it alongside the jars you and anyone else with access can easily install the jars and associated pom.xml files to their local repository

1164559
post	get
when i click in check box its id get post and i need to insert to databse but i am unabale to insert the sub _module id in database

1164569
hide	show
a quick fix is to hide all the dropdowns when you call the modal and show them again when you close it

1164607
post	get
it works fine with all the request methods get post head options delete ...

1164607
post	get
get and post also work when i call a page over https but all the other request methods do not work nothing has changed within in the javascript that sends the requests to the server .

1164607
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
most don t even get to send the request google-chrome got to readystate 4 btw i tested with google-chrome 2.0 firefox 3.0.11 opera 9.63 ie7 ie8 safari 3.2.1

1164611
kde	gnome
wxwidgets uses gtk+ if you want to have it look nice on kde you need to have a gtk theme which uses qt for rendering like qgtkstyle is for gnome

1164634
google-chrome	safari
worth mentioning that safari s javascript engine is still faster than ffx s while google-chrome reigns supreme

1164638
cos	sin
and you can have precalculated sin and cos values for a b ranges ie

1164692
post	get
update ed s post contains the exact error you get system.argumentexception 24200 - so if you can get you data working in geometry instead this might be worth a try

1164746
post	get
so to get each post and its comments we do this

1164757
ilist	icollection
arraylist declares that it implements the ilist icollection and ienumeralbe interfaces

1164757
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
why not only implement ilist because ilist is also derived from icollection and icollection is derived from ienumerable

1164763
google-chrome	safari
so make sure you take a look at webkits developer tools safari google-chrome as well

1164773
folder	directory
pages stored in the layouts folder are application pages and should always only be referenced through the _layouts virtual directory

1164796
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
when checked in reflector classes which in code implement ilist have the same interface declaration list as classes which in code declare implementing all of ilist icollection and ienumerable

1164820
passenger	thin
if this is production use something like passenger or thin so that they re easy to stop the processes or restart the servers

1164858
vmware	virtualbox
i use virtualbox but have access to vmware workstation and would switch if maintenance would improve

1164865
put	get
put larger things in it and you ll get scrollbars

1164875
jquery	scriptaculous
there are plenty javascript frameworks you can use like jquery mootools prototype scriptaculous etc

1164942
google-chrome	firefox
you cannot do that in other browsers firefox google-chrome also so even if you could do it in ie it would have been pointless

1164951
move	drag
the latter depends on the their system settings the window move as they drag versus just dragging an outline

1164954
uiview	calayer
all instances of uiview and classes derived from it have an associated calayer object accessed via the layer property that provides the uiview s visual appearance

1165002
cpython	ironpython
not sure if this matters but i ll be trying to use this under ironpython rather than cpython

1165011
mkplacemark	mkreversegeocoder
mkreversegeocoder will give you an instance of mkplacemark so you ll probably also want to check out the documentation for that too

1165012
range	minimum
you can build res for the maximum or minimum number of digits for a range using a base 10 logarithm

1165013
put	get
i d say you could get that up and running in a couple of hours - then you could put your feet up for a few more hours while it did its work -

1165067
google-chrome	firefox
below works in google-chrome 2 firefox 3.5 and ie8

1165095
post	get
most of the security issues related to php come from using unparsed outside get post cookie variables

1165122
rss	feed
i wrote another quick script which connects and prints out the default response an rss feed of submitted items

1165148
post	get
since someone said that my previous post was off-topic i ll try to compensate - nosql is not and never was intended to be a replacement for more mainstream sql databases but a couple of words are in order to get things in the right perspective

1165196
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i ve never seen any reason to believe that visual studio calls svcutil.exe or wsdl.exe

1165218
int	chars
you tell it ok give me the next chunk of chars in this set or give me the int you find in the string and those start at the current index and move forward until they find something that doesn t match

1165218
put	get
if you really wanted to use nsscanner you could put something like that in a loop and keep checking for a no return value and if you get that you can increment the scanlocation and scan again

1165233
put	get
i disagree with this so i thought i d put it to some other developers to get a third party opinion

1165348
multiplying	multiplication
if an approximation would be valid you could try a multiplication by something like 0.1875 0.125+0.0625 this means multiplying by 3 and shift down by 4 places

1165383
put	get
if you put quotes around the element name with a . you can get it

1165409
inherited	properties
the main point is that with an interface you need to provide the entire contract with every class that implements it with an inherited tree base classes you are only changing adding the properties and methods that are unique to the child class common properties and methods remain in the base class

1165466
for-loop	loops
the only difference between a for-loop and a while loops is the syntax for defining them

1165466
for-loop	loops
actually the for-loop is a little better because the i will be out of scope after loops while the i will stick around in the while loops case.

1165467
entity-relationship	diagram
you should really consider your whole database structure and do a entity-relationship diagram entity relationship diagram first

1165553
ant	maven
i don t use gradle in anger myself just a toy project so far author means they have used gradle on only a toy project so far not that gradle is a toy project - see comments but i d say that the reasons one would consider using it would be because of the frustrations of ant and maven

1165553
ant	maven
experienced ant users find this particularly jarring as maven removes many of the freedoms you have in ant

1165553
ant	maven
maven configuration is very verbose though maven 3 promises to address this and if you want to do anything that is not the maven way you have to write a plugin or use the hacky ant integration

1165553
ant	maven
gradle promises to hit the sweet spot between ant and maven

1165553
ant	maven
so if you ve hit and got stuck with any of the ant maven pain points it is probably worth trying gradle out though in my opinion it remains to be seen if you wouldn t just be trading known problems for unknown ones

1165555
width	height
if that doesn t work remove the width and height properties from the page but keep the scrollviewer

1165563
hide	show
create a single instance of the tooltip and use it whenever you like to show it using the settooltip method and use hide method to hide it

1165594
for-loop	loops
even if the hypothesis of the while loops being faster than the for-loop were true and it s not the loops you d had to change optimize wouldn t be the outer ones but the inner ones because those are executed more times

1165609
hide	show
i would then hide all divs that don t have the selected class and show the div that does have the selected class

1165626
prepare	execute
there is prepare and execute which can run a sql statement from inside a user variable so could probably use something similar to untested

1165665
equals	gethashcode
however one idea that comes to mind is to create a separate class to just represent the key and override its equals and gethashcode methods

1165665
equals	gethashcode
they would use the individual fields using case-insensitive comparison in equals and xor ing the hash codes in gethashcode

1165686
min	max
it should return customer objects ordered by their order dates filtered by a min and max date

1165693
for-loop	loops
usually in a for-loop you loops n time

1165700
google-chrome	firefox
when i hard code the fade works as expected in ie firefox and google-chrome

1165725
mouseover	mouseout
then i want to set mouseover and mouseout event for the image to disp the employee info in a popup box

1165725
mouseover	mouseout
then i need to write some jquery code for mouseover event to get the data from the action and code for mouseout to close popup box if it is showing on

1165733
cpu	processors
you need to have as many threads running as there are cpu cores available in order to be able to potentially use all the processors time

1165795
int	double
however when you copy a value type a struct like int or double a copy of the entire thing is made the value of a value type is the thing itself

1165829
swt	swing
i would recommend sticking to swing or swt and seeing what you can do with their look and feel mechanism but don t expect miracles

1165896
stdout	stderr
i have seen this cause problems for example .delete_on_error rules donâ t always run if stderr is redirected to stdout

1165906
put	get
1 put all the win32 calls used into function pointers and pass them in to the functions or classes depending on how many times they are hit that use them and use this to get mock results

1165919
inherited	properties
so binding to ichild does not inherited the parenttext properties

1165959
substance	jide
some lafs also offer support for widgets substance supports some of jide and swingx

1165959
awt	swing
if you re pure swing awt no problems

1165959
substance	jide
would love to use substance but no jide support

1165967
int	double
i ve run across a number of cases where a pattern for accessing items in a keyed collection like a dictionary is encumbered by the fact that the type of the key is not a simple type string int double etc and isn t something that you would want to promote to an actual named class

1165967
equals	gethashcode
unlike struct s these dynamically generated classes provide an implementation of both equals and gethashcode - which are designed to work well with dictionary and hashtable implementation in .net

1165967
equals	gethashcode
i ve hijacked this feature to create an opaque key - essentially a generic class that allows you to create keys on the fly by providing the types that are part of the key - and using an anonymous class to actually provide the equals gethashcode behavior

1165967
inherited	properties
we can even make improvements by allowing the opaquekey class to be inherited from so that it s properties and constructor parameters can be given more instructive names

1165995
keydown	keyup
try listening for keyup or keydown instead of keypress per this so post

1166021
equals	gethashcode
the equals gethashcode will be fine

1166022
setinterval	settimeout
you would have to make your processing code use settimeout setinterval from the start this code would end up working in both a worker and on a normal web site

1166057
mailmerge	openoffice.org
i m currently trying to do a mailmerge using c# and openoffice.org

1166075
firefox	safari
my current solution is working in safari but in firefox only the end quote displays although the space for the beginning quote is there

1166142
width	height
dockpanel will automatically fill in the remaining space with the last item that does not have a dockpanel.dock attached property specified and a height width specified

1166153
equals	gethashcode
system.array does not override gethashcode or equals so they use reference equality

1166184
portrait	landscape
i am impressed so far but i cannot find out how to set the page orientation in my new report from portrait to landscape

1166199
int	double
you can use it for any ordered types like int s or double s

1166232
versioning	upgrade
so far we ve only been rolling out complete versioning either versioning 1.0 or versioning 1.5 but no upgrade from 1.0 to 1.2 to 1.3 to ..

1166232
versioning	upgrade
so any customer that get versioning 1.0 cannot upgrade to versioning 1.2 or 1.3 or even the latest

1166232
versioning	upgrade
check the table in database that stores the versioning info and depending on it run different script to upgrade database

1166233
versioning	upgrade
this started happening after a versioning upgrade but happens to no one else

1166235
equals	gethashcode
equals the gethashcode methods for the

1166330
hide	show
assuming your using prototype you should use the ajax.responders to do the show hide

1166339
filtering	grouping
the query is just a reference to an implementation of which in turn knows about another along with appropriate delegates for filtering grouping etc

1166351
merb	ruby-on-rails
in that case you would most likely use the system of organization imposed by your framework ruby-on-rails merb sinatra etc.

1166388
qcombobox	qtextedit
the sizehint calculation won t be entirely trivial and will be way easier for qlineedit than for qtextedit which is secretly a qabstractscrollarea but you can look at the sizehint and minimumsizehint implementations for inspiration also the one for qcombobox which has a mode to do exactly what you want qcombobox adjusttocontents

1166388
qlineedit	qtextbrowser	qlineedit	qlabel	qlabel	qtextbrowser
edit your two usecases qtextbrowser w o scrollbars and qlineedit instead of qlabel just for selecting the text in there can be solved by using a qlabel and a recent enough qt

1166429
dictionary	map
another alternative to an if statement is a map dictionary in c# i believe that has a lookup based on the type to either a builder object or the object itself if it is immutable or to an instance of the object that can copy itself

1166493
centos	solaris
while porting old solaris 2.4 code to centos 5.3 i came across an invocation like

1166507
free	malloc
my concern is as follows say there is an incorrect mixup in the use of malloc free and

1166519
equals	gethashcode
if you want something more ad hoc i ve found that the code that resharper generates for equals and gethashcode is fine

1166524
free	malloc
if you find you must use both for instance if you re interfacing with a c library thorough code reviews should carefully scrutinize any uses of free to determine whether or not they correspond to a malloc and whether or not they are being used in a c context

1166527
free	malloc
the same goes for malloc and free

1166527
free	malloc
also new and delete doesn t necessarily use malloc free for its allocations so you might end up corrupting your heap as well

1166536
free	malloc
one thing i ve done relating to this is to reimplement malloc and free

1166537
free	malloc
the easy way to not get them mixed up is never to use malloc then you will never be tempted to call free

1166537
free	malloc
the infrastructure to create to avoid this problem is called code review though in this case a quick grep malloc or grep free on the codebase will probably suffice

1166550
free	malloc
always use delete for things allocated with new for things allocated with and free for things allocated using malloc

1166550
free	malloc
new and new allocate from different heaps than malloc and using the wrong free delete will attempt to deallocate from the wrong heap

1166558
free	malloc
to answer the second question if you control both malloc free and operator new delete you can stash extra information to associate with pointers returned by both that tell you how they were allocated

1166581
free	malloc
never using malloc free in the first place or

1166590
free	malloc
never mix new delete with or with malloc free

1166590
free	malloc
atop of this the use of malloc free in c++ is questionable at least

1166648
profiling	instrumentation
it would do things similar to what profiling tools do when they instrumentation your app

1166712
versioning	upgrade
i really like the idea of red-gate s sql packager which will diff your two database versioning and then create a sql script a c# project or a stand-alone executable to upgrade from versioning 1 to versioning 2

1166729
typedef	struct
typedef struct rsquo

1166760
int	chars
nsthread doesn t take primitives like int or chars so you have to use nsnumber

1166778
typedef	struct
usage of typedef for struct in c is explained here

1166783
typedef	struct
not sure about referring to static functions and typedef in the unnamed struct when you do the definition this way - i never do

1166810
typedef	struct
you must not state that it is a struct since the keyword typedef allows you to actually define a data type in this case person and you pass it this way

1166818
implements	extends
extends the delegate range could be implements via currying and partial function application

1166878
post	get
another thing to check might be the config file - specifically the httphandler declaration verbs get post

1166898
free	malloc
malloc ed buffers or buffers returned from a c api which caller must free must be assigned to a private pointer field of an object

1166898
free	malloc
in other words stick a wrapper around anything that uses malloc free

1166898
free	malloc
then in code review if you see a call to malloc free anywhere else it s wrong

1166938
src	attr
for instance you could call #imgthumbnail attr src value

1166988
profiler	vtune
if it s a native application then the intel vtune profiler is pretty powerful

1166994
src	attr
src is however both a html attribute and you can access those with the attr method

1167010
cvs	svn
to get svn and presumably cvs to work again

1167019
width	margin
the body width is also set to 100 margin 0

1167073
width	height
finally you know the width of the cone at that height so you can see if the point is outside that width

1167108
keydown	keyup
my keydown and keyup method are as follows

1167111
put	get
how can i make it so when you select something from the list the number enclosed in parentheses does not get put into the text field

1167141
min	max
you cannot specify max and min zoom and i don t know of a way to hack it in

1167180
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
as an alternative you could use dataoutputstream to store the int s in a bytearrayoutputstream

1167186
uiview	subviews
from the image i m adding a number of uiview as subviews to my main uiviewcontroller.view the number of views to add varies based on user selectable data

1167186
uiview	subviews
because i want to improve the gui i want to overlay an uiviewimage as the top subviews of the added uiview something like in the image

1167255
strdup	strtok	free	strdup
the older way to work with strtok was to use strdup in the allocate and free later

1167309
cvs	svn
i know there is tortoisecvs but i m wondering if there is an easy way of sucking down source code in a cvs repository just using svn tools without having to install cvs tools

1167309
cvs	svn
since svn seems to have taken the preferred spot in oss i have to believe somebody has written a tool that will map cvs databases to svn repositories

1167309
cvs	svn
based on a few responses while migrating off of cvs to svn is cool mostly i m looking for a way for me to use my svn client to pull from a cvs database with little or no fuss much like you can do with svnbridge a real-time svn bridge to tfs

1167320
width	height
you have page height width and interactive height in report properties

1167320
portrait	landscape
you don t say portrait or landscape

1167322
public	protected	inherited	properties
perhaps you could define a few asp placeholders think of it as zones within your usercontrol and make them available via public or protected if you only want the inherited class to be able to change them properties

1167448
igraph	statnet
igraph and network the latter is part of statnet

1167477
hide	show
still i d much rather just hide the grid and show a no records found message div block

1167524
put	get
you can change this though get the carbonel package then put the following into your .rprofile

1167540
versioning	upgrade
that said once you begin developing your os you may find that you need to upgrade to the full non-express versioning

1167578
folder	directory
isolatedstorage requires less collaboration with your iis admin when it comes to granting ntfs rights to folder outside of your virtual directory

1167587
fpdf	fpdi
i am using fpdf fpdi to build a pdf templating system

1167605
post	get
get and post

1167634
move	drag
you say that your listboxes are all data-bound - which implies that you actually move items from one backing collection to another on drag and drop

1167657
put	get
simply put a template is more specialized than another if you can replace each type parameter of the latter template with some type and in result get the signature of the former

1167677
pop-up	dialog
the problem is when i click the search button the modal dialog pop-up but the databind method never gets called

1167685
post	get
we primary use the framework for updates but the device api is generic enough to be able to build almost anything you need via standard http https get post calls

1167696
min	max
the region could be described using its min and max coordinates as follows

1167760
rss	feed
i m currently running an app that is based on rss feed but i have a cron job running hourly to scour the interwebs for new content but i d love to know more about how to solve the i need realtime problem without overstaying my api call welcome

1167833
put	get
in order to get this to work you must put your code in the same assembly as the aeccpointstyle class

1167839
accessor	properties
in c# 3.0 and later auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the properties accessor

1167839
accessor	properties
they also enable client code to create objects when you declare a properties as shown in the following example the compiler creates a private anonymous backing field can only be accessed through the properties s get and set accessor

1167847
versioning	upgrade
of course you ll need to add a reference and i absolutely hate adding reference to office because you get tied to a versioning of office and i hate updating code every time we upgrade

1167870
folder	directory
if you ignore the gen folder this also means that you don t need to set the exclusion pattern for this directory as subversion doesn t create a .svn directory inside ignored items

1167891
accessor	properties
try making the so object private and create a properties accessor for it that first checks that if the private is set if not set it before returning the private variable

1167944
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ie 8 google-chrome firefox opera

1167949
vb.net	vb6
i am replacing a vb6 application with a rewritten counterpart in vb.net

1168039
treemap	treeset
for implementations of sorted collections like treeset and treemap these use red black trees

1168052
cpu	processors
cpu utilization is oftentimes running at 100 on all four processors now this never happended on the sql 2005 server

1168052
cpu	processors
it appears that whenever i have four processes waiting on this resource cpu hits 100 on all four processors

1168090
put	get
if it is global across all sessions you could put it in a class_variable rather than an instance_variable but that can get messy once you start having multiple rails processes each which will have their own copy of it or if you re running in threadsafe mode you can end up with nasty concurrency bugs

1168108
nunit	moq	nunit	nmock	moq	nmock
i d really suggest you start with a simpler framework such as xunit nunit together with mocking ones such nmock and moq

1168113
sorting	filtering
you can use a derived table for filtering and sorting like this

1168114
post	get
i figured out how to make the web service respond to the http get calls but i cannot figure out how to make it return json data even though the service returns json data when i call it using jquery .ajax with type post when called from the autocomplete plugin it always returns xml

1168114
post	get
fixing autocomplete plugin to use http post and json data instead of get and query string parameters

1168152
implements	extends
you can extends your current service class which implements isearchuser and let it implements icreateuser as well - in that case you could add a second endpoint to your service config

1168224
folder	directory
there should be a sibling directory to your solution directory called testresults which contains the folder used for each test run

1168254
width	height
if i don t specify width and height values for a titlewindow it will be resized to fit it s contents when i show it using popupmanager

1168271
put	get
is there any possible way to get around this or do i just need to limit the amount of items put into a room 2500 was about the limit i found to work

1168287
put	get
if it contains something like .. .. index.php or something like this - you get the idea this could allow someone to put any file they want on your server

1168315
sproutcore	cappuccino
cappuccino and sproutcore are also designed for this

1168327
firefox	safari
now that ie8 is a forced update there should be better support but i can t speak from experience on ie nor firefox or safari etc

1168366
udp	tcp
it supports tcp udp icmp...

1168366
icmp	tcp
it s also very useful if you want to see where along a route that a tcp port is being blocked like by a firewall where icmp might not be

1168397
disk	ram
after making sure you have plenty of ram putting your ide on a speedy disk drive is often one of the best performance upgrades you can make - perhaps even moreso than cpu speed

1168400
pop-up	dialog
checking on every write would be a horrible mess if you re really concerned about the scenario have a timer go off every hour or two that checks the table version and pop-up a dialog warning the user to get a new version

1168412
accessor	properties
inconsistency with the use of the shortcut dot syntax for accessing properties often having to use the full length accessor

1168424
codeigniter	cakephp
search for cakephp and codeigniter and maybe symfony i m not sure all do the rest thing.

1168435
pop-up	dialog
when the current running version is out-of-date and the latest update is required then pop-up a dialog box that requires the user to get the update

1168450
accessor	properties
properties get accessor and the tostring method are assumed pure the program state before and after must be identical

1168451
division	multiplication
shifting bits left and right is apparently faster than multiplication and division operations on most maybe even all cpus if you happen to be using a power of 2

1168453
nsdateformatter	uidatepicker
you ll need to use nsdateformatter to format the nsdate returned by your uidatepicker

1168459
width	height
but this does not just change the height it also messes with the width

1168459
width	height
edit this actually does not interfere with the width of most browsers - it resizes to the previous width and new height

1168459
width	height
i would like something that would be equivalent to setclientwidth int width and setclientheight int height keep in mind that these setters don t actually exist

1168479
g++	gcc
cc gcc -m32 cxx g++ -m32 linux32 rpmbuild -bb --target i586 package.spec

i usually just force the height width of the container to 1 by 1 px.

1168480
width	height
then when i need the flash i will re-set the height width as appropriate

1168509
submit	submission
your jquery form submit method doesn t prevent the actual submission from taking place

1168566
division	multiplication
most compilers will turn multiplication and division into bit shifts when appropriate

1168592
tcpdf	fpdf
the demonstration of tcpdf i saw at the following presentation showed that tcpdf may have more in-built capabilities the fpdf

1168616
multiplying	division
for division by a constant the compiler can often convert the operation to a multiplying by a magic number followed by a shift

1168616
division	multiplication
this can be a major clock-cycle saver since multiplication is often much faster than a division operation

1168624
plesk	mediatemple
the virtualhost solution didn t work for mediatemple because each vhost.conf is already delimited as a virtualhost configured by plesk

1168646
width	height
in wpf c# is there a way to set the tooltip s height and width dynamically meaning in code

1168661
width	height
a tool tip s height and width are based on its content

post	get
if we can t get to a better solution around here and we decide this is a valuable question i ll post this as the answer

1168844
rss	feed
im trying to fix a python script which takes the posts from a specific rss feed and strips them down and inputs them into a text file

1168844
rss	feed
it only prints out the last post of the rss feed into a text not the whole thing as the first function does

1168844
rss	feed
if anyone could tell me why the script doesnt post more than one the last post of the rss feed into the text but the whole thing in the shell and what modifications i need to fix it i would really appreciate it

1168865
for-loop	loops
you should open the file before the for-loop and then put the lines inside loops

1168866
post	get
so you get a single post here

1168883
pull	push
i have set it up to pull rather than push only because that s the way i got past the logins issue

1168889
equals	compareto
compareto compares values and returns an int which tells if the values compare less than equals or greater than

wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
what about wingide it s not free but it s feature list has auto-completion for wxpython pygtk and pyqt

1168918
jar	war
with servlets the compiled classes must reside on the server in order to function war jar files

1168935
cpython	ironpython
note that with this code you can actually use extensions written for cpython from your ironpython code so that s not a discriminating condition any more

1168955
postgresql	mysql
i have downloaded dblinq 3 which is a linq provider for mysql oracle and postgresql

1168957
cpython	ironpython
while ironpython doesn t have the limitations of the gil cpython does - so it would appear that for those applications where the gil is a bottleneck say in certain multicore scenarios ironpython has an advantage over python.net

1168957
cpython	ironpython
cpython probably has better ide support at present than ironpython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other

1168988
ssl	https
transport security using https and a valid ssl certificate works in the same way a web site does it doesn t require additional credentials certs from the user

1169006
ubuntu	debian	profiler	google-perftools
google also has a nice profiler as part of the google-perftools -- which are included in debian ubuntu and possibly other distros

1169034
hash	md5
so even if you hash the password with say md5 the md5 hash is still sent in plain text then intercepted and can then be posted back to the login page by the third party

1169108
glassfish	weblogic
personally i would go with the app server s transaction manager regardless of whether it was websphere or weblogic or glassfish or whatever

1169135
prepare	execute
not too familiar with using mysql in c but according to what i can see in the mysql.h file you should call mysql_stmt_prepare to create the statement and mysql_stmt_execute to execute said prepare statement

1169140
filtering	grouping
a filtering can be used to apply before after logic across a grouping of controllers a uri or to a specific action

1169169
lisp	scheme
there are some fundamental issues that separate common lisp and scheme which make trying to use the former with sicp a pretty bad idea

1169169
lisp	scheme
so in scheme you have a clear separation something is either a list or one of the primitive types of values -- but in common lisp nil is not only false and the empty list it is also a symbol

1169169
lisp	scheme
in addition to this you get a host of slightly different behavior -- for example in common lisp the head and the tail the car and cdr of the empty list is itself the empty list while in scheme you ll get a runtime error if you try that

1169169
lisp	scheme
mutators in common lisp have no specific convention some have an n prefix while in scheme they almost always have a suffix of

1169169
lisp	scheme
also plain assignment in common lisp is usually setf and it can operate on combinations too eg setf car foo 1 while in scheme it is set

1169169
lisp	scheme
his third option -- rewriting functional loops expressed as recursive functions as common lisp loops dotimes dolist and the infamous loop can work for a few simple cases but at a very high cost the fact that scheme is a language that does proper tco is not only fundamental to the language -- it is also one of the major themes in the book so by doing so you will have lost that point completely

1169169
lisp	scheme
in addition there are some cases that you just cannot translate scheme code into a common lisp loop construct -- for example as you work your way through the book you ll get to implement a meta-circular-interpreter which is an implementation of a mini-scheme language

1169169
lisp	scheme
people who are familiar with all of this should not be surprised after all the circularity of the evaluator means that you re implementing a language with semantics that are very close to the host language -- so in this case you inherit the common lisp semantics rather than the scheme tco semantics

1169169
lisp	scheme
for example many common lisp compilers will never optimize this call funcall foo bar while scheme compilers will optimize foo bar like any function call expression because there is no other way to call functions.

1169169
lisp	scheme
finally i ll note that much of the above is very good flamewar material throw any of these issues into a public lisp or scheme forum in particular comp.lang.lisp and comp.lang.scheme and you ll most likely see a long thread where people explain why their choice is far better than the other or why some so called feature is actually an idiotic decision that was made by language designers that were clearly very drunk at the time etc etc

1169185
rss	feed
the thing is i have a script that updates a textfile with the newest posts from an rss feed i got some help from you guys to figure it out

1169246
ubuntu	linux
i m running xterm initialized with utf-8.en.us running ubuntu linux and mono

1169281
int	chars
wc and most unix-like commands deal with chars in terms of the c chars data type which is usually an unsigned 8 bit int

1169281
int	chars
.net deals with chars in terms of its own chars data type which is a 16 bit unsigned int and represents a utf-16 chars

1169306
postgresql	mysql
however i don t think sqlite has rich enough stored procedures to do something like this you would need to use mysql postgresql or similar

1169360
int	chars
example - lets say that i have a string of chars and each 50 chars will increment an int by 1

1169372
cassini	iis
you can find out how cassini differs from iis here

1169382
ant	maven
both ant and maven are okay

1169454
folder	directory
try moving to another isp that will allow you to have a bin directory as part of you application folder

1169470
post	get
the fact is that users can still get access to post parameters and can easily forge their own post parameters

1169478
keydown	keyup
i think you first problem is that you are using the keydown event when you really want the keyup event

1169488
rar	zip
compressing with rar vs zip

1169495
int	chars
the form allows only a single element to be selected using int or chars indices whereas allows indexing by vectors

1169500
verilog	vhdl
before plunging into verilog vhdl or buying an fpga dev kit i d recommend taking an introductory class on digital design

1169502
post	get
traditional means is via hyperlinks which defaults to get unless you use javascript or forms which defaults to post

1169518
int	chars
the only cross-platform way to do it is to read it byte by byte that is chars by chars and build an int out of them

1169539
for-loop	loops
i can imagine doing for-loop for each state then doing the regression inside loops and adding the results of each regression to a vector

1169543
width	height
1.label control where i can fix the height and width of the label so it doesn t grow to long but rather wraps the text inside my fixed width and height

1169543
width	height
2.a textbox control where i can already set the height and width if i set multiline off however the user should not be able to edit the textbox...in fact the textbox should not be able to recieve the focus at all

1169571
accessor	properties
iclass has a couple properties with only get accessor

1169571
accessor	properties
so all of the classes that derive from absclass will also need to satisfy iclass by having the same properties with get accessor

1169571
accessor	properties
however in some cases i want to be able to add set accessor to the properties from iclass

1169571
accessor	properties
yet if i try to override the abstract properties in absclass with a set accessor i get this error

1169580
disk	ram
if your system has faster disk possibly a faster cpu probably or a lot more ram almost certainly then make sure to tune the various parameters based upon that

1169599
accessor	properties
this works the way it does because properties aren t truly virtual - their accessor methods are

pdfsharp	itext
as far as free libraries go from what i ve seen i don t believe that pdfsharp or itext will meet all of your requirements in this case but i m sure someone will correct me if i m wrong

1169817
post	get
the parameters can come from the get uri or from the post body when content-type

1169839
portrait	landscape
even if it s cropped the characters are still rendered too small in portrait mode so you need to switch to landscape mode

1169852
webkit	gecko
hypothetically the first two test cases separated by should render identically which they do in gecko via ff3.5 mac but webkit via safari4 mac renders the before and after segments as inline

1169871

i am an ubuntu linux user

1169939
put	get	post	put	post	get
any model resource can accept a get operation to query its state a put operation for setting its state post for appending to it and delete for removal

1169939
post	get
a view resource can return a representation of a given state in some bare-bones representation or something like with xml via a post operation i guess unless the view s data is small enough to use a get operation

1169939
post	get
a controller resource can accept a get operation for queries and post for form processing

1169941
bash	tcsh
use ps to identify the pid of the shell process bash tcsh etc then kill that.

1169944
pylons	web2py
if you want simplicity use web2py or pylons

1169959
subtraction	addition	subtraction	add
it would override add and sub so you could do addition and subtraction by simply using operators + and -

once you have them they can be ran automatically or manually using your ide ant maven or other build tool you use

1170088
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
if i wrap the socket in a bufferedoutputstream bufferedinputstream life is great

1170088
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
but wrap the socket in a datainputstream dataoutputstream or even have dataoutputstream bufferedoutputstream sock.getoutputstream is extremely slow

1170119
wgs84	utm
the basic idea is to convert gps coordinates which are in wgs84 coordinate system to distance from some point - in case of utm northing is a distance from the equator and easting is distance from one selected meridian

1170171
int	double
you have to have one type of general setter method per type of variable double int ... though

1170172
ready	each
don t forget error handling - each step can fail and you need to be sure your program is ready for that

1170176

typically when you deploy a user control in sharepoint you put your control in the controltemplates folder which is mapped to the _controltemplates virtual directory in iis by default sp has access to this folder

1170274
getter	setter
multiple properties can share a single getter or setter differentiated by an ordinal index

1170345
width	height	inherited	properties
then use the x y width height properties of each control inherited from control

1170365
libs	buildpath
in any other case create either a copy of the libs directly in your project i suggest lib jung.jar and add that libs to your buildpath right-click on libs or create a user libs with the jar s and add that user libs to the projects buildpath

1170375
versioning	upgrade
after we get to a persistence point we upgrade to versioning 2 we need to be able to let the old instances continue to run with the old versioning of our assemblies

1170379
jboss	glassfish
it scale very well because you can deploy it inside an application server like glassfish or jboss

1170390
actualheight	actualwidth
yes you can check actualwidth and actualheight on any frameworkelement to figure this out

1170416
postgresql	mysql
oracle as well as mysql and postgresql and some others can handle multiple transactions and commits basically if you use a database with a website a more secure and stable database would be oracle likewise an application

1170422
width	height
two images one is 300x400 pixels height x width the other is 500x600

1170433
width	height
you can also achieve this via css same principle you set the height and not the width

1170478
width	height
every product has a weight length width and height as well

1170497
vb6	vba
this vb6 code is compatible with vba

1170553

if you want alternatives for commercial distributed solutions you may want to have a look at git mercurial bazaar

1170583
getter	setter
mypluginthatrocks i have a file named myawsomeproperties .properties how can i open it and read it easyly with a sort of getter setter system like or or any other mean in that type if you get what i mean .

1170593
fast-forward	merge
i ve found that this doesn t seem to work if master hasn t changed over the lifetime of the branch â the commits just get fast-forward in with no merge branch message â so it s best add the --no-ff flag to git merge

1170608
vb.net	vb6
performing a complete rewrite to .net is far more costly and difficult to do well than converting vb6 to vb.net semi-automatically .

1170640
folder	directory
each user will upload some files to his profile.should i place all files in a single directory or do i need to create folder for each user and keep the files there

1170698
versioning	upgrade
they may simply need to upgrade their axis versioning

1170707
debian	linux
i would suggest nix based linux would be great if it is possible because you can get the package easier with the built-in package manager e.g apt for debian yum for fedora etc

1170740
folder	directory
once i get the access to this directory i will create a nested directory inside it with different extensions of files but the problem is when i tries to access this folder by unc path it is giving me error like could not find a part of the path comp01 ibc

1170761
fastcgi	scgi
cppcms is traditional mvc framework optimized for performance it has many features like template engines forms processing i18n support sessions efficient caching and so on support of various web server apis fastcgi scgi and cgi

1170835
fpdf	fpdi	tcpdf	fpdi	tcpdf	fpdf
we have chosen to use fpdf over over tcpdf due to compatibility problems detailed on the fpdi website as fpdi is the core component in this dropping fpdi was not an option

1170855
config	ini
searching for ini config gui solutions via search engines returns a lot a false positives

1170879
equals	tostring
i find that automatic tostring generation is not usually what you want when scouring log files and most ides will have tools to allow you to generate hashcode and equals implementations although granted these do not automatically reflect any schema modifications within your class

1170890
google-chrome	firefox
when i visit this url in firefox google-chrome etc the decent browsers all is well the browser correctly selects a plugin such as acrobat reader to render the file within the browser

is there any way to protect loginname and password without using ssl https

1170995
perl	tcl
depending on the implementation chosen there are perl java python along with the original tcl you can then use the corresponding gui toolkit swing to java

1171010
post	get
my aim is to implement an http client in j2me which can only do get and limited post but first i need to understand the http protocol better hence the c# attempt

1171087
idictionary	ilist
are even more options although idictionary k ilist v is not something that is

1171112
webclient	webrequest
otherwise you should just stick to the webrequest and webclient classes

1171122
width	height
if your wrapper doesn t have a width and height on it you may get some strange results as it shrinks once the image element is removed

1171122
width	height
to see add a border and fixed height width around the wrapper

1171169
put	get
if they don t understand i would say that maybe you could put together a presentation on design and get them up to speed so you can have those is this a good design conversations

1171185
hash	md5
as for alternatives to md5 goes i think the sha family of hash functions are considered the de-facto replacements

1171214
git-rebase	amend	squash	branch
you can interactively git-rebase your local branch against the subversion tracking branch which provides you with an opportunity to squash and amend the commit

1171285
hash	md5
an alternative to md5 is would be the md6 hash algorithm but it is not ready yet

1171363
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried to use the mouseenter mouseleave events since they seem to look in detail for the divs they are dealing with as seen here but nothing changed

1171453
put	get	post	put	post	get
i thought i would put an echo right at the top as this will surely work but when i get to this script via post request from a form

1171456
pull	push
you mention having set up the replication as a pull rather than push because it got you past login issues

1171490
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox safari and google-chrome the response is still being returned with the appropriate http 200 code and jsonp content the only difference is that the xmlhttprequest object being used by jquery is setting the status code to 0 and the responsetext to empty

1171490
post	get
to get round this i modifed the jquery library to not set the custom header and change the content-type to text plain instead of application json and firefox finally starts bypassing the options request and just plain post

1171494

1 by richards stevens and i found that there is a third transport layer standard besides tcp and udp sctp

1171555
sctp	udp	sctp	tcp	udp	tcp
summary sctp is a transport-level protocal that is message-driven like udp but reliable like tcp

1171556
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox 3.x and google-chrome

1171581
width	margin
i ve personally always stuck to max width of 1000px centered in the middle of the page via margin left right auto

1171591
hide	show
inside a style tag not linked with a link tag that i want to show hide depending on the state of the page the page works like a wizard using a multiview control on the page

websphere	ibm
i observe in consecutive javacore dumps that the addresses of classloaders are changing in websphere 6.1 ibm jvm 1.5.0

1171672

sctp is born too late and for many situation tcp is enough

1171696
width	height
but i want width and height of the image

1171696
width	height
and please let me know if there is another better way to get the width and height of the image

1171697
postgresql	mysql
for dbi alone we have sqlite mysql postgresql oracle

1171753
int	double
if it won t use them up any time soon go with int otherwise double the key size and go with bigint

1171847
equals	gethashcode
be sure to override equals and gethashcode and define and as appropriate

1171856
equals	gethashcode
be sure that it s gethashcode and equals is based upon the two contained elements

1171874
nexus	artifactory
if you use an internal repository manager obligatory nexus and artifactory references here the overhead of purging the local repository is greatly reduced - you ll just have an increased local network traffic load

1171880
width	height
i have a sprite sheet of images of differnet width and height which i have the coordinates to

1171892
integer	unsigned
to do so cast the pointer to an unsigned integer type longword if i remember it right

1171909
range	max	range	min	min	max
this is a bit hackey but you could also use a range validator that sets the min value to 1 and the max value to some very large integer that isn t likely to be entered

1171961
equals	gethashcode
create a custom key class and implement equals and gethashcode so that any one component of the key is sufficient to find the entire key

1171993
children	parent
i think your problem could be that you aren t setting the child s of profile to now have parent as it s their parent unless children with parent can t also be parent in your system which i do not believe to be the case

1172005
keydown	keyup
i have found the best success when attaching the event to keypress keydown and keyup inputs

1172005
firefox	safari
safari firefox ie all seem to handle special keypresses delete backspace etc. a bit differently but using all events together seems to cover it

1172035
agile	sprint
how do you prevent agile methodology with monthly sprint iterations causing a fragmented design

1172037
wordpress	joomla
if you don t feel like learning then perhaps invest in a framework like cakephp or zend framework or a ready made system like wordpress or joomla

1172056
post	get
then you capture via get or post the user s email and comment and you insert everything in the db

1172115
children	parent
if the result of the move never intends to change the topology of the tree when x becomes the parent of its old parent y it gives all its children to y then the simplest might be to decouple the notion pyramid nodes from the users with one-to-one relationship

1172115
children	parent
since the topology of the tree does not change this would automagically take care of the children having a correct parent

1172125

1172188
temporary	tablespace
if you want to find other temporary tablespace within the database you can do

1172213
versioning	upgrade	pull	push
you could upgrade your spring versioning it s unlikely that you ll have any problems and if push comes to shove you could pull just that org.springframework.transaction.jta.websphereuowtransactionmanager out of spring 2.5 and add it to your application

1173988
postgresql	mysql
sql server express seems to me like the much more natural upgrade path for such an app though it has a 4gb limit on the total size of the database so you re not gaining all that much over jet ace s 2gb limit and one could certain consider open-source databases like mysql and postgresql that are entirely cost-free in terms of licensing

1174239
inherited	properties
attached properties are dependency properties and as such support dependency properties value inherited

1174239

a dependency properties attached or not inherited its value downwards if its metadata is set with the frameworkpropertymetadataoptions

1174239

1174420
jar	war
the tomcat run goal is intended to work with war projects i m guessing yours is a jar project

1174420

note i d recommend having a separate war project to your jar projects then adding the jars as dependencies to the war

1174421
submit	submission
however as many people have mentioned the enter key submission a form is expected behaviour so you can always alter the function to do basic validation on the fields allowing the enter key to submit the form if all the required fields have been filled in

1174422
width	height
should just be able to swap your width and height loops values

1174447
inherited	properties
in other words having properties implementation in your interface would lead to name clashes and from there to other multiple inherited problems diamond

1175737
integer	unsigned
so what you need to do is cast the object to an unsigned integer type before performing the bit manipulation to get the desired result

the same md5 hash there is likely to

1177388
ant	maven
point to ant maven or some other builder you re using we just use ant-scripts

1177391
cassini	iis
if you just don t like cassini fair enough then you are still going to need iis to get it to work

1177393
width	font-size
you can however combine two solutions - first approximate font-size using some character-counting algorigthm for example - assume that characters have fixed width and then correct your calculations with client-side js if js determines that line has been split anyway

1177422
stateless	stateful
i have always advocated the stateless web but would like to know what the advocates of the stateful web are saying

1177544
gridview	objectdatasource
i am binding a gridview to this table via an objectdatasource and have a templatefield like so

1177568
int	chars
you go via the int value of each of those chars to get back to a genuine utf-8 string which you then decode as normal

1177571
hash	md5
both the sha1 and md5 hashing algorithms result in an even distribution of hash values for a set of random inputs

1177571
hash	md5
if the probability of discovering a string that collides with another s sha1 hash is p1 and similarly p2 for md5 the naive answer is the probability of finding one that collides with both is p1 p2

1177618
mouse	keyboard
if you really need this to work like this i would do this to ensure it works by keyboard and mouse

1177629
maven	pom.xml
to make maven work with subversion you need to configure the scm section of the pom.xml

1177637
width	height
in the object parameters where u have width and height just set height to a fixed size in pixels

1177704
integer	unsigned
i encountered an interesting situation today in a program where i inadvertantly assigned an unsigned integer to a std string

1177733
int	chars
because string is assignable from chars and int is implicitly convertible to chars

1177740
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
introduction to abstract algebra this will solidify your understanding of modulo number systems in particular binary octal hex etc.

1177764
int	chars
this operator is invoked by implicit conversion of unsigned int to chars

1177775
uiview	calayer
a uiview has a calayer

1177784
nssearchfield	nstextfield
here s an example of old code that used the latter approach to make a custom nstextfield that looked like a search field back before nssearchfield was a standard control

1177846
opera	firefox
unfortunately this is not supported in firefox 2 opera 9 or any version of ie

1177912
int	chars
will not work because there is no string constructor that takes a chars or int argument

1177930
cassini	iis
cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation

1177978
uiview	calayer
they are different names because uiview and calayer are different and have different terminology associated with them but they are functionally equivalent

1177979
apache	nginx
i m trying to migrate to nginx from apache using passenger in both instances to host a rails app

1178016
pull	push
the reason push won t do it by default is that it s trying to remind you to pull and merge in case you forgot

1178133
accessor	properties
so when you try to create a new movieplayer your properties accessor attempts to send a release message to the garbage stored in movieplayer

1178177
hide	show
in the load handler for the flickr image you would hide the loading image and show the flickr image

1178212
nfa	dfa
the resulting dfa s states represent power sets of the states in the nfa

1178212
nfa	dfa
the states in the nfa are linear to the size of the regular expression and therefore the dfa s states are exponential to the size of the regular expression

1178263
listview	gridview
if this source is databound make sure the databound control gridview listview etc has their datakeynames property set

1178342
maven	m2e
everytime i start with a fresh new workspace m2e downloads nexus-maven-repository-index.gz from the maven central repository

1178342
maven	m2e
or at least download the file once and the copy extract repackage it so that m2e thinks it has already downloaded it and allows me to search for maven artifacts

1178358
freebsd	linux
it has a cocoa-bridge and the user interface is written with it but based on a portable substrate - so the same development environment is available for windows and unix linux freebsd

1178457
put	get
if you don t put a leading then you get the normal rails generated error message

1178470
profiling	instrumentation
the only profiling i can find for wince is the remote call profiling which requires the application be built with the platform builder so the instrumentation hooks can be compiled in

1178472
updatepanel	onclientclick
i would expect that the onload function of the parent updatepanel would never run except on the actual page load and that the button s onclientclick function would be executed on every click updating the child updatepanel

1178631
super	self
because the super s init method may return a separate object from the current self

1178664
getter	setter
the setter and getter methods you have defined above are instance methods

1178665
put	get
put this in mysql.ttinclude to get stored procedures generated

1178666
awt	swing
other stuff like validate invalidate etc. is left over from awt days i believe and revalidate does a better job and was added specifically for swing

1178676
fflush	gets
i like the idea of a cache that gets fflush when a threshold is reached

1178731
width	height
for the tile size you may prefer to give your view a couple of properties expressing width and height in tiles then using the ctm to scale to widthinpoints widthintiles heightinpoints heightintiles

1178768
png	tga
encoding from multiple input image files jpeg png tga etc.

1178773
int	double
bool double int etc

1178794
erd	diagram
most of the architects here feel that creating uml diagram does not justify the time involved although we always have a erd and some informal flowchart kinda diagram for all projects

1178823
pull	push
when you push and pull on that branch it automatically pushes and pull to the remote branch that it is connected with

1178890
put	get
using eval allows you to get the content into your page but asp.net will not be able to put it back into an object for you

1178915
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
the simplest way to do this with recent versions of jquery is to use the mouseenter and mouseleave events rather than mouseover and mouseout

1178966
division	multiplication
this involves multiplication and division but depending on how your numbers are represented you may be able to turn the division into multiplication or bit shifts if you re very lucky

1179017
mouse	keyboard
open system preferences keyboard mouse keyboard shortcuts

1179065
lisp	scheme
new lisp is an easy install from the os x gui installed from a os x package making it the easiest install of all lisp except perhaps for plt scheme

1179065
lisp	scheme
if you are new to lisp and not too picky that it be common lisp you should look at plt scheme

1179099
chunked	transfer-encoding
anyway it s a good idea to use curl or another http library because implementing a protocol with all its subtilities like chunked transfer-encoding in hmtl is a lot of work much more than twice the work to implement a basic protocol handler which will work only on one basic case

1179153
xlib	gdk	xlib	motif
i m not using gdk or qt - just plain xlib xt and motif

1179154
getter	setter
from what i ve read properties and synthesize are used to tell the compiler to to generate getter and setter for various properties of our class

1179193
min	max
i want to display max time and min time for a day in grid control using visual basic from sql database

1179204
getter	setter
by encapsulating the members as a property with getter and setter the implementation details of the field may change while those details are abstracted by the getter setter

1179211
put	get
i can t just put i in there as the counter for the loop and get four instances out named player1 player2 etc

1179276
aggregate-functions	sum
item.name must appear in the group by clause or within an aggregate-functions such as sum or max

1179311
gridview	rowdatabound
if building up with the gridview you can add javascript when the rowdatabound event is raised

1179313
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby and ironpython in silverlight the dynamic languages and silverlight integration let you write browser applications with dynamic languages like ruby and python

1179313
ironruby	ironpython
please visit ironruby or ironpython s websites for using them in silverlight

1179358
hide	show
i can show and hide the tabs by grabbing their clientids and manually setting the visibility and display styles

1179474
filtering	grouping
after that you just need to traverse the list once and filtering into new lists by the grouping column

1179503
put	get
i suppose if you put dashes or spaces in you could even get us a little insight into the customer s purchasing habits

1179563
fdt	swc
well one possibility is to do the majority of your development with flashdevelop fdt or flexbuilder soon to be called flashbuilder and have your output be a swc

1179563
fdt	swc
we build the majority of our flash projects in this manner or sort of in reverse where we build the assets in flash professional output a swc of the graphics and use that swc in a better development environment we prefer fdt

1179572
put	get
also if you put in the form on page 2 with your variables posted from page 1 they should get passed right along

1179588
webrat	cucumber
if i visit it will redirect to but i can t get the cucumber webrat tests i ve written to pass as i always get an error like this

1179617
google-chrome	firefox
update i tried using google-chrome instead of firefox and this particular problem doesn t appear

1179653
boost	stl
it was also supposed to fix the long-standing problem of stl and boost and template libraries in general being hard to use because of lax compile-time duck typing nature of c++03 templates and the consequent troubles with compiler error reporting

1179664
std	ostream
then you can provide your own descendant of std basic_streambuf wrap it in a std ostream and use standard c++ i o on it

1179669
free	realloc
i m aware that there is a realloc function that would allow me to resize the memory block and it s paired with a free function

1179690
puts	gets
this suggests that it only gets messages that are sent sendmessage which calls the window procedure directly not posted postmessage which puts the message in the message queue

1179715
int	boolean
in vb int are converted to boolean automatically 0 - false everything else - true

1179728
bazaar	git
in distributed version control system like git mercurial or bazaar where you have local copy clone of a whole repository almost all commands are performed on client

1179794
superclass	subclassing
if i pass a subclassing object in as a parameter to a method which takes a parameter of type superclass i should certainly be aware of that and know the internally the called method will be working with the superclass aka baseclass object only

1179851
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
on webfaction to save processing power and more importantly memory it is better to serve these from your secondary apache server or even better from nginx or lighttpd without having to go through mod_python and django

1179866
peer	p2p
in a corporate environment yes corporations do use p2p any number of network reconfigurations may take place all without informing the peer about changes in ip address

1179903
free	malloc
you malloc in every loop iteration but only free once at the end

1179908
fseek	fread
i would recommend checking the results of fseek and fread

1179908
fseek	fread
provided that fseek is succeeding fread should tell you the total number of bytes read

1179924
bindparam	bindvalue
to bind those parameters you ve got to use bindparam and not bindvalue

1179927
pdostatement	bindvalue
unlike pdostatement bindvalue the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that pdostatement execute is called

1179927
bindparam	pdostatement
call pdostatement bindparam to bind php variables to the parameter markers bound variables pass their value as input and receive the output value if any of their associated parameter markers

1179974
postfix	dovecot
here is a tutorial for using postfix for sending mail and dovecot for accessing mail via imap

1179992
int	chars
i believe they can be up to 2 31-1 chars as they are held by an internal array and arrays are indexed by int in java

1180023
hide	show
jquery using show and hide would work

1180126
bufferedreader	ioexception
private static function readint bufferedreader reader throws ioexception

1180139
disk	ram
if for some reason you have to touch each entry in the csv file every time you run i might recommend storing it on a ram disk instead of physical disk

1180158
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
right now i am adding the uidatepicker subview with a couple buttons on a navigation bar to a temporary uiviewcontroller and initializing a uinavigationcontroller with that temporary controller as the root

1180161
codeigniter	cakephp
i have looked at zend cakephp and codeigniter and i have not been able to find an intuitive way to accomplish this

1180274
dictionary	map
python s dictionary and set are both unordered containers which map to the basic data structure of a hash table

1180295
width	height
how can i use a canvas to resize automatically and adapted to the browser 100 width and height

1180321
min	max
this will display the min and max time per each user and date

1180340
opera	google-chrome
the browser might be mozilla ie opera google-chrome or any other mobiles device such as sonyericssonk610i samsung-sgh-e370 sonyericssont700 or nokian73-1

1180347
free	malloc
but if you start using malloc then you must do housekeeping be sure to call free at the right time memorize the size of the array somewhere and perhaps even have a size different from the array capacity you allocate more to avoid doing too much reallocs

1180354
jboss	glassfish
i am not sure if this is true for glassfish or not but in case of jboss if you turn on debug you can notice the jndi name that would be used

1180416
put	get
because the only thing that i get is the size of the longest path equivalent to the height and i cant put in the array the values regarding to the height of the bst.

1180423
cng	cryptoapi
in my experience these implementations are rock-solid provide numerous options for example you ve usually got a cryptoapi cng and managed implementations of each algorithm to choose from and you re not going to get it wrong since you re only using the implementation

1180443
post	get
i can get code to be called on a post back for any check box that has changed

1180463
hide	show
that gives you an opportunity for example to hide a spoiler in final page but show it in normal view in the editor window

1180466
put	get	post	put	post	get
extra bonus points if someone can show how to not only get the count but put some conditions too like count of only post which have been approved

1180469
folder	directory
the problem seems to be that eclipse does not realize that the directory src mycompany logging is a package directory --- instead it thinks it s a source folder in its own right analogous to src and that logentry is part of the default package in that folder

1180475
width	height
if you remove the width and height and alignment parameters then the silverlight app should stretch to fit its container

1180477
children	parent
in this case the parent your layer would loop through all children presumable stored in some form of collection and handle updates to all those who say they ve been changed

1180554
trie	tree
to optimize contains you need a tree or trie structure of your positive negative words

1180595
clang	llvm
llvm perhaps using clang but it might not be ready for primetime

1180606
stdout	stderr
warning this will deadlock if the child process generates enough output to a stdout or stderr pipe such that it blocks waiting for the os pipe buffer to accept more data

1180606
stdout	stderr
i do need the return value from the exec and do parse and use both the stdout and stderr

1180607
actioncontroller	activeresource
one caveat of this solution this changes the logger level for all of activerecord actioncontroller actionview actionmailer and activeresource

1180614
uicontrol	uibutton
yes you have to add your own uibutton views or other uicontrol subclasses to the navigation controller yourself

1180627
accessor	properties
yes a properties is just syntactic sugar for the call to get accessor method

1180641
stdout	stderr
if the application writes a lot to stderr and nothing to stdout then your process will sit waiting for data on stdout that isn t coming while the program you re running sits there waiting for the stuff it wrote to stderr to be read which it never will be--since you re waiting for stdout

1180641
stdout	stderr
another simple approach is to redirect stderr to stdout so you only have one incoming file set

1180641
stdout	stderr
this lets you read in a non-blocking way you get data whenever data appears on either stdout or stderr

1180648
ienumerable	icollection
the second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual one

1180648
ienumerable	icollection
this would leave out string but also icollection-of-t because it does not inherit icollection ienumerable-of-t is the only generic collection abstraction that s backwards compatible - it inherits ienumerable

1180674
vsto	add-in
i see how i can do this with vsto as an add-in to outlook but i d like to make it a standalone app

1180727
put	get	post	put	post	get
when i deploy it to an iis 6 site with integrated windows authentication turned on all requests get post put and delete work fine for me because i am an administrator on the box

1180727
post	get
however when a non-admin user hits the service only get and post requests work

1180727
put	get
when they try a put or delete request they get an http 401.3 access is denied error

1180732
button	checkbox
in your submit button s eventhandler you would loop through each table row cell then determine whether the cell s children control contained a checkbox

1180732
gridview	datalist
from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option

1180782
jobs	cron
i would not recommend trying to create and manage cron jobs scheduled tasks from within php

1180782
jobs	cron
if cron jobs scheduled tasks don t work out for you you can also consider piggy-backing on ordinary requests to your website

1180789
inherited	properties
perhaps a properties that returns all of the inherited objects

1180830
put	get
also there are things that get put on the stack that you may not be aware of return address stack frame registers etc. and not jumping past when trying to grab things higher up on the stack

1180860
getter	setter
we re often told we should protect encapsulation by making getter and setter methods properties in c# for class fields instead of exposing the fields to the outside world

1180864
public	protected
so when you have an interaction point with other classes - any public and generally protected member you want to plan for future growth

1180892
hex	binary
use dumpbin all to dump all details of a binary to a text hex dump

1180895
post	get
if not post how far you get and i ll have a another look during the week

1180910
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome though text-decoration none is ignored and the underline stretches unattractively across the bottom of the icon

1180927
xna	spritebatch
basiceffect and spritebatch objects are just shaders that the xna team bundled with the release

1180973
getter	setter
use that only if you have existing code that uses public property and you suddenly need getter setter for it like your example with age

1180973
getter	setter
if you need to execute some code when property is read written make it read-only or lazily fetch from the database then you should use normal getter setter getage setage

1180986
google-chrome	firefox
my current implementation is below which works in firefox 3.5 and google-chrome

1181002
ubuntu	linux
i ve attempted this thus far on my mac os x machine and on a linux ubuntu virtual machine that i m running

1181002
ubuntu	linux
here is the results from the entire build process from my ubuntu linux v9.04 machine.

1181014
bazaar	git
none of the current dvcs i know of git bazaar hg support this well

1181030
put	get
no get variables for a hacker to exploit and a pretty easy to put on another blog or business card url

1181032
struts	wicket
technologies included here are java struts spring mvc jsp wicket and a few others

1181032
put	get
i d like it not to focus so much on patterns and other principles as much as just how to get started and actually put my thoughts in a professional document that i can use to build my project from

1181041
getter	setter
synthesize basically creates setter and getter for you and if you call out retain specifically the setter is going to retain the object passed in to it

1181048
rss	feed
yes this is used to indicate that the url can serve an rss atom feed that can be fed through a reader such as google reader

1181052
rss	feed
number 4 is so that when you go to a page in ff or ie7+ the little rss icon at the top of your browser lights up and you can add that feed to the browser s built-in feed reader

1181065
rss	feed
this allows rss readers to find the feed for a given website basically making it easier to add to your rss reader

1181081
int	chars
so if a signed int was used you d be unable to create strings larger than 2 31 chars

1181135
stdout	fflush
however even when i explicitly fflush stdout the server seems to wait for the script to complete before sending the response to the client

1181198
profiling	benchmarking
in other words benchmarking it and see if the performance is acceptable for realistic input data and if not the profiling it to see where the real bottlenecks are

1181265
ready	each
each of us can freely branch each and every feature we need to work on get it working in a sandbox without interference from our shared repository and when we are ready merge it back in

1181326
post	get
in jquery there s a very helpful ajax function using which you can send get post requests to any webpage and use the retrieved information which can be html in your page

1181346
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i m not sure if i m putting the rules in the right place and i understand that you can do this in a httpd.conf file and not the .htaccess

1181358
put	get
after you get the transformed string you can just use eval and put its value into the residual or f vector in your case

1181373
width	height
how can we increase the the height and width of a cell in list

1181415
width	height
set the cell height and width in the

1181496
int	double
since bool is a value type just as int long double datetime and some other types it will always be initialized to a default value false in the case of a bool 0 in the case of an int

1181503
pull	push
i would like to learn about ajax push and pull concepts

1181521
pull	push
here is a nice a comparison of push and pull

1181524
addslashes	multibyte
with regards to this vulnerability when character set-unaware escaping is used for example addslashes in php it is possible to bypass the escaping in some multibyte character sets for example sjis big5 and gbk

1181524
versioning	upgrade
if you are unable to upgrade mysql to a versioning that includes the fix for the bug in mysql_real_escape_string parsing but run mysql 5.0.1 or higher you can use the no_backslash_escapes sql mode as a workaround

1181529
width	height
if you need to use the input field and have it display inside the entire width and height of the browser window at the time it is seen you need to redo the css like this

1181592
fink	macports
this finds the latest version 1.3.1 at time of writing and i don t use macports or fink installs it nicely with no fuss at

1181669
vim	emacs
emacs vim nano etc

1181683
postgresql	mysql
3 storing or manipulating data mysql postgresql you can say as database

1181744
hash	md5
to hash stings i usually use as3crypto code.google.com p as3crypto - but i know the abode utils package has a md5 and sha-1 implementation

1181759
int	boolean
if you have a primitive type string int boolean you may want to use const instead

1181770
width	height
in my air project i used current state size is width 441 height 358

1181777
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to get a 100 width height canvas element to draw on but i m hitting something of a catch 22 because both google-chrome and firefox create scrollbars

1181796
post	get
using the above statement i will get the thread object and i only want to display lists of 20 items so i will access the post collection property of the thread object which due to lazyloading will fetch all 300 ready for me to handle how i please

1181814
post	get
i am making such query to get count of comments for every post

1181828
post	get
also a single method would be enough to get the paged post collection and the total number of post

1181839
width	height
you re probably being hit by the borders or margins on the body element -- you re asking for document.width height effectively but putting it in an element with a border so the total width of the page canvas.width+ left right borders is then bigger than the width height you originally asked for

1181840
disk	ram
a simple query like this should not take more than some tens of seconds provided you have enough ram to avoid disk thrashing

1181840
disk	ram
if the working set is smaller than your ram it should not be disk bound

1181840
disk	ram
of course adding more ram could help but you need to check if the query is killing the disk or the cpu first

1181864
hide	show
this has a show hide link which i don t want

1181868
rss	feed
i want to show a stylish pop up in c# window application if certain condition satisfy.just like in gtalk .actually iam showing rss feed web page and for every new feed i want to show pop up with some music for notification

1181875
disk	ram
the limits for the current version are 4gb disk per database 1 cpu core 1gb ram

1182018
spaces	delimiter
the w command shift+w moves to the next word delimiter only by spaces not whatever vim is configured to consider a word as unshifted w does

1182072
freebsd	linux
modern operatingsystems have alternative interfaces linux has epoll freebsd has kqueue

1182130
gif	png
it makes creating graphics pretty trivial and has a wide range of output formats including png and gif

1182133
nsstring	nsxmlparser
void parser nsxmlparser parser didstartelement nsstring elementname

1182135
folder	directory
here is a windows batch script that will delete all .svn folder from a subversion working copy directory

1182137
nofollow	noindex
and bing live support noindex and nofollow in the meta directives

1182162
superclass	subclassing
for subclassing where the superclass already has overloaded constructors i would tend to assume that it is reasonable to treat any of the parent class s constructors as primary and think it is perfectly legitimate not to have a single primary constructor

1182195
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
opacity is applied in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie and opera

1182200
sorting	grouping
also by sorting the rules before-hand successive rules in the same grouping may be discarded without even testing for incompatibility with the right data structures

1182205
iwork	keynote
i m working on a cocoa application i d like to use to remotely on the same machine from a different process control which slide is currently displayed in a running apple iwork 09 keynote presentation

1182271
folder	directory
i hosted a domain ipointing to a sub directory of the www folder

1182273
versioning	upgrade
new versioning are published though but i wish we should develop an all time running and self learning software which upgrade itself without going down ever

1182307
post	get
i have read several other post here so i get the idea on the pro vs

1182316
uiview	subviews
this sample employs a container uiview in which you can swap between two subviews

1182381
google-chrome	firefox
however this show effect only occurs in firefox -- google-chrome and ie are confused

1182385
stdout	stderr
so 1 pipes only stdout 2 pipes stderr pipes everything

1182388
postgresql	mysql
it uses jdbc drivers to connect to microsoft sql server 2005 frontbase mysql openbase oracle postgresql and sybase

1182427
width	height
so i placed two dummycubes at the position of the target cube each sized to fit either the width or the height of the viewer with appropriate values for scenescale camera distance and focallength

1182436
int	double
please do note that although some msdn documentation claims that reading to or writing from a value-type int double etc is an atomic operation and hence thread-safe this is seldom true in actual vb code

1182511
mouse	keyboard
as for the second part of your question dealing with mouse keyboard branches this is how i would normally do it

1182511
bazaar	svn
note that i m hardly a bazaar expert but this is the way i ve been dealing with svn repos

1182519
serializable	deserialization
these 2 static classes will handle all of your serializable deserialization needs for string representation of xml in silverlight and any .net

1182548
gif	png
that png or gif that s only 10kb might actually be much much greater in size once the browser loads it in memory

1182606
aptana	radrails	vim	jedit
i have tried aptana radrails vim with ruby scripts jedit with ruby support etc

1182611
children	parent
otherwise just do two queries one for the parent one for the children

1182648
mouseover	mouseout
i solved the problem using hover insted of mouseover mouseout

1182686
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you probably serialized to a stringwriter or directly to a stringbuilder

1182695
yacc	bison
template metaprogramming can be used to easily write recursive descent language parsers and these can be inefficient compared to a carefully crafted c program or a table-based implementation flex bison yacc

1182708
google-chrome	firefox
both of the above approaches work on ie firefox and google-chrome browsers

1182753
versioning	upgrade
obviously you want to try to run the latest versioning to make upgrade less painful

1182779
hash	salt
you might also want to salt the hash properly

1182810
stdout	stderr
however the best way of solving this problem is two create two threads one for stdout and one for stderr which read those respective streams until exhausted and do whatever you need with the output

1182810
stdout	stderr
however this buffers the stdout stderr of the subprocess in memory and you get those returned from the communicate call - this is not ideal for some scenarios

1182810
stdout	stderr
another example is in a package i maintain python-gnupg where the gpg executable is spawned via subprocess to do the heavy lifting and the python wrapper spawns threads to read gpg s stdout and stderr and consume them as data is produced by gpg

1182810
stdout	stderr
data produced by gpg to both stdout and stderr can be quite large in the general case

1182817
int	chars
i was storing getch calls as chars s when they were supposed to be int s

1182829
multiplying	add
if you want to know what the decimal version is multiplying the left numeral by 16 and add it to the right numeral keeping in mind that a is 10 b is 11 etc

1182837
calloc	malloc
i m currently facing the following problem every several hours my server crashes with a segfault and the core dump shows that error happens in malloc calloc which is definitely a sign of memory being corrupted somewhere

1182860
uiview	calayer	width	height
while an uiview has a memory footprint of at least 4 width height pixels i wonder how that would look when i create a calayer only

1182878
google-chrome	safari
mozilla s and safari google-chrome s engines are just trying to make life a little easier

1182888
webkit	blink	google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome and konqueror use webkit although on 04 03 2013 google announced that google-chrome will use its own fork from webkit named blink

1182897
uiview	calayer
so is it any useful to make a calayer only instead of an uiview that comes along with a whole bunch of them all those trees...

1182910
entity-relationship	diagram
my entity-relationship diagram is

1182919
memcpy	memset
examine all memory related functions memcpy memset sprintf new delete delete

1182923
integer	unsigned
uint means unsigned integer which means it can only represent positive values

1182931
margin	height
self.tableview.frame cgrectmake 0 44 + 20 height of navbar + some margin 320 416

1182972
uiview	calayer
you use calayer when you are not getting any benefits from using uiview and when it s not possible to do the thing you want to do with uiview

1182976
gif	png
gif images only support transparent not transparent unlike other formats like png that have full alpha support so you can do things like have 40 transparent pixels

1182996
erd	diagram
viewing the second diagram as the physical erd model - there s no benefit to having two tables with a one-to-one relationship

1183004
post	get
at that point in time abstracting the details of the web with controls and post backs was a great way to get people started

1183019
width	height
mehrdad assumes that the width is one since there is no real way to determine either the width or height from a one dimensional array by itself

1183028
onmousedown	onmouseup
in onmousedown you simply remember the button pressed and in onmouseup just check what buttons were remembered as well as clear the state for the button

1183073
width	height
while an uiview has a memory footprint of at least 4 width height pixels

1183073
uiview	calayer
the memory overhead of a uiview compared to a calayer is just the size of the instance variables of the uiview class plus a few instances of additional classes that will get allocated

1183125
wordpress	joomla
two most important features i m looking for that i couldn t find in any popular cms blogging engine from my favorite textpattern to wordpress joomla and drupal are

1183145
mouseup	mousedown
i would personally use the mouseup and mousedown events for a more cleaner way to handle it and to avoid interop

1183150
versioning	upgrade
if there s a fundamental problem with the upgrade you can keep using the old versioning until the problem with the library is fixed

1183151
int	boolean
i m constantly running up against this when writing queries with linq-to-xml the value property of an xelement is a string but the data may actually be an int boolean etc

1183215
executable	upx
or you can create a single compressed executable with all the needed assemblies that is auto decompressed when started like the popular aspack and upx do for windows executable

1183224
post	get
anders heilsberg s post on this thread is i think the answer to steps #2 and #3 above if i could get the syntax right

1183224
filtering	grouping
optimally the group-by-title step could be done first so the inner grouping first by source to compute the index then by index to filtering out duplicates can operate on small numbers of objects in each by title grouping since the # of documents in each by-title grouping is usually under 100

1183273
rsa	dsa
what this means is do not roll your own rsa dsa whatever encryption algorithm

1183295
sorting	grouping
or sorting and grouping elements

1183337
width	height
i am trying to set up css tabs and i d like them to be the same height and width

1183368
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works across ie firefox google-chrome safari and supposedly opera too but haven t tested that

1183386
stdout	stderr
it handles the complexity associated with invoking gpg which would normally involve creating multiple filehandles other than stdout stdin and stderr among other things.

1183405
put	get
and if you want to skip lines until the closing tag you can do that where i put -- but it s becoming to become harder to read understand and parsing html by-hand might not be such a good idea if you want to get to something complicated

1183409
vb6	vba
not sure how well it works with vba but in vb6 this is what i would use

1183449
post	get
i ll update this post when i get questions to guide what i m looking for

1183459
udp	tcp
i m rather new to the topic of network programming never having done anything but basic tcp udp on a single local machine

1183475
put	get
2 to get put a index in every item you can use the select extension method passing a func selector function

1183554
int	double
my question is whether there s a clever way to derive from the basic types int float double etc

1183578
filepath	unc
i admit it s not like you re off doing network i o in the constructor unless of course a unc filepath is passed in and you re not going to have to wait long in the constructor unless there are networking problems or you generalize the class to be able to read the html from places other than a file some of which might be slow

1183622
postgresql	mysql
don t ignore postgresql -- every bit as open as mysql not in the middle of a muddle caused in mysql s case by acquisition by sun then by oracle core developers leaving forks into drizzle mariadb ourdelta ... and just about as functionally rich and sql standards compliant as ms sql server if not more i miss recursive ctes a lot when i have to use mysql -- both sql server and postgresql have them though just as the sql standards require

1183646
width	height
if you want the links to size up to the same width and height declare the links in the list themselves to show up as block elements

1183646
width	height
otherwise any setting of the width and height will be ignored since it is an inline element

1183646
width	height
now you will be able to set the height and width of the links in the tab list to the size you wish

1183647
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
this method doesn t require javascript doesn t cause to lose cleartype text in ie and is compatible with firefox safari opera ie6 7 8.

1183648
folder	directory
include_once dirname file . directory ... and what this does is if im inside of a folder and im trying to include a file that is one level up into the current page it wont work

1183648
folder	directory
and instead of it using the main root directory it includes the folder im inside as well

1183682
width	height
set the width and height of the td tag using css

1183707
ant	maven
appfuse used ant or maven to build a web application

1183716
accessor	properties
i seem have run into a problem trying to create python properties from some accessor functions i have for methods like the following

1183742
stdout	stderr
it could be that this program is poorly written and outputs its information to stderr instead of stdout

1183756
hide	show
obviously we can enable disable show hide more responding to user s actions instead of enraging users

1183760
kde	gnome
both gtk and qt have bindings for d-bus most desktop environments or at least gnome and kde expose various services via d-bus and many desktop applications can be controlled via a d-bus interface

1183775
folder	directory
otherwise try duplicating the directory and deleting the .git folder in the duplicated directory

1183848
klocwork	coverity
solutions like coverity and klocwork have an extensible rule set where you can write your own rules

1183905
width	height
if you can get a reference to the nativewindow you can set it s size with the width height using actionscript

1183916
stringbuilder	stringwriter
stringwriter uses an internal stringbuilder to write to

1183932
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
- bool tabbarcontroller uitabbarcontroller tabbarcontroller shouldselectviewcontroller uiviewcontroller viewcontroller

1183936
postgresql	mysql
my postgresql is rusty so if the mysql query works on postgresql i d like to know

1183956
postgresql	mysql
by the way i ll be using pylons a python framework and mysql 5 though i m open to postgresql if there are any weird utf8 restrictions i converted the whole database which was previously latin1 to utf8 by the way with iconv

1183958
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop as below which populates this data into an arrays

1183984
webrat	cucumber
finally the pragmatic book on rspec still in beta is a great resource on how to use cucumber webrat and rspec together and drive your application development with bdd

1183989
min	max
finding the min and max is done simultaneously

1183989
min	max
then there is an algorithm that finds the min and max in 3n 2 number of comparisons

1183989
min	max
the larger of the pair should be compared with the current max and the smaller of the pair should be compared with the current min

1183989
min	max
however if one only cares about finding min and max of a few numbers as eric belair does no one will notice any difference in todays computer with any of the approaches above

1184000
min	max
min 0 max 20 name less than 20

1184000
min	max
the association between the product is on the price and the min and max

1184006
pop-up	dialog
i need to detect this mouse click so i can redraw the button in the normal image and if i am using my own dialog as the pop-up menu to hide the menu

1184028
postgresql	mysql
database mysql postgresql sqlite oracle mssql couch

1184041
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that in code below eventlistener not being fired in ie working just fine in firefox and google-chrome

1184093
decoder	encoder
now there is a png encoder in as3 in the as3corelib and i guess there are even others but probably most people considered it pointless to write a decoder since flash does this in its own and also encoding is easier than decoding because decoding means you have to implement the whole format .

1184106
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
safari google-chrome use the webkit rendering engine which incorporates css rendering and the dom i would say it s one of the best rendering engines in addition to opera s - i think it could be of use

1184107
spaces	delimiter
all line breaks are normalized to spaces so just put them on a separate line if the spaces delimiter can handle arbitrary whitespace

1184108
fink	macports
from the documentation it appears that fink and macports install version 1.2

1184139
ggplot2	lattice
lately the author has been doing a visualization series comparing lattice and ggplot2

1184150
google-chrome	safari
same in google-chrome and probably safari

1184162
hash	salt
if storing as files ask for a name salt with current time and generate a hash for the filename

1184167
maven	pom.xml
that file is called pom.xml and provides a definition of your project to maven so it would be able to build it

1184180
hash	md5
modern hash algorithms not md5 can be considered collision-free

1184185
hash	md5
you can also hash the file eg md5 hash but then you can t list the files the user put in not with a meaningful name anyway

1184207
postgresql	mysql
there are some things mysql has and postgresql doesn t replace for example - usually if something is not in postgresql there are good reasons for it and or a workarounds

1184213
qitemdelegate	qpushbutton	qitemdelegate	qstyle	qpushbutton	qstyle
if you want the cells to look like qpushbutton s you should probably inherit from qitemdelegate and implement paint to use qstyle to draw you a qpushbutton something like this

1184241
ia-32	x86
of course all of the following applies only to x86 and x86-64 assembly language for ia-32 and amd64 processors and operating systems.

1184241
thunk	trampolines
this part is generally not portable between oses unless you use trampolines thunk basically another layer of abstraction that has to be rewritten for every os you intend to support

1184241
freebsd	linux
while every os is different most modern oses follow a general pattern you load the number of the system call you want into a register typically eax in 32-bit code then load the parameters how you do that varies wildly and finally issue an interrupt request it s int 2e for windows nt kernels or int 80h for linux 2.x and freebsd and i believe osx

1184260
maven	pom.xml
in maven 2 that model is defined in the pom.xml in maven 1 the file was called project.xml

1184260
maven	pom.xml
maven expects to find the pom.xml in the root directory of the project though this can be overridden

1184260
maven	pom.xml
when you run a maven goal the pom.xml is parsed from pom.xml maven determines what dependencies and plugins are needed downloading them from the remote repositories then runs the plugins that are configured for the project

1184260
ant	maven
if you are familiar with ant have a look at the comparing maven with an t section to understand the differences

1184271
width	height
since you re defining explicit height and width for the boxes anyways it s probably more clear and robust to just use absolute positioning with position relative set on .page1

1184276
folder	directory
poking around a bit in iis and discovered that for whatever reason the scripts folder had been made a virtual directory

1184282
post	put
okay clearly who ever put a -1 vote on my post without leaving a reasonable comment to explain knows very little about virtual machines run-time environments

1184292
public	protected
it differs from having to make a base class and then extending it with a cat and a dog and therefor have to make the sound method protected or overriding the public eat method

1184360
ironruby	ironpython
it seems to me that if i want to provide scripting capabilities in my .net app i can use the dlr and so enable scripting in ironpython or ironruby or whatever other iron languages are available for the dlr or host a powershell runspace

1184406
direct3d	directdraw
aoe 2 is a directdraw application not direct3d

1184419
put	get
after worked on many small addon i want to put those add on on my server so that people can download it and use it so that i can get the feedback from the people ..but when i am downloading it from my server it is a xpi file getting following error

1184421
for-loop	loops
since you are just calling a subroutine from the for-loop there is no way for this subroutine to exit loops directly

1184423
postgresql	mysql
as a secondary consideration clients often have less choice about which db they use postgresql mysql oracle etc than which application language they have available

1184436
postgresql	mysql
for relatively small ones stackoverflow bbc etc a normal relational database should be enough - like mysql postgresql or oracle

1184488
folder	directory
currently i am publishing the application and placing that folder in the server and creating virtual directory and providing windows authentication

1184518
pull	push
now however i want to be able to push and pull from this remote repository without having to specify where i m pushing to or pulling from

1184528
postgresql	mysql
as to skaffman s point you may want to have a look at postgresql if mysql isn t scaling for you

1184528
postgresql	mysql
the time to make the switch is highly dependent on you application environment however if you need clustering and replication to work properly 100 of the time then postgresql will not let you down as mysql has for me in the past

1184546
actionscript	mxml
amf an http-based binary format that performs serialization between actionscript mxml and server side languages

1184549
mouseout	mouseleave
you might want to try stopping the propagation of the hover event to see if that prevents the mouseout on the child from triggering mouseleave on the parent

1184554
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql are very widely used by a huge number of startups because its open source and there is a lot of support out there for people using it

1184569
icmp	tcp
ethernet does not care if it s transporting icmp tcp if they are valid or not

1184634
erd	diagram
i started my first mysql project designing the erd logical and physical diagram

1184634
erd	diagram
however he uses a relational database diagram where he designs interfaces and other parts first before making the erd

1184657
fadein	fadeout
...and you can always use jquery to make it fadein or fadeout

1184680
opera	firefox
if you worry that the onscroll event does not work in opera firefox you can try changing

1184687
margin	height
change the top and bottom margin height

1184724
firefox	safari
safari has one firefox has firebug

1184724
mouseout	mouseleave
mouseout fires when the pointer moves into or out from child element while mouseleave doesn t

1184728
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby donâ t have the same integration to windows as does powershell

1184731
folder	directory
_root is the path to the directory where the application folder resides

1184738
post	get
all this thanks to the excellent post from jomo fisher here linq to sql trick get all table and column names

1184743
getter	setter
now the goal of getter and setter is to provide an interface to properties of a state of an object which might not have anything to do with how it is actually implemented

1184743
getter	setter
granted most of the time these properties are fields in the object and the getter and setter just shallow shells

1184743
getter	setter
on the other hand you have the freedom to change the internal implementation because the getter and setter will ensure interface compatibility

1184743
getter	setter
if however these properties are too related to the actual implementation and not so much with what the object is about then you should consider removing such getter and setter

1184749
post	get
all the new post don t get this hover effect even though they belong to the same class

1184749
post	get
how can i get the ajax-ed post to have a onhover effect

1184759
mouseover	mouseout
unfortunately live doesn t support hover so you have to split your code and define mouseover and mouseout event handlers

1184770
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the navigation bar displays fine

1184806
aptana	radrails
i am trying to install an amazon web service gem into my project i use window and aptana radrails but it asked me to update current ruby version 1.8.5 to 1.8.7

1184808
width	height
you could just use an nspoint and increase it by one until it hits width x height

1184877
int	boolean
even plain int and boolean can cause interop problems and more complex structures like nested arrays with optional values are very difficult to make work across different type systems

1184885
post	get
my initial plan was to use the routing object to sniff out get and post data but that data doesn t always indicate the presence of a form

1184888
post	get
i know at the abstract level that you need to use post or get and some read -function to check the data in the url

1184910
width	height
returned constrainedsize should have correct width height of text

1184930
post	get
however this obviously won t catch get requests and ajax can also generate post requests so...

1184950
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

1184955
mouseup	mousedown
when i mousedown and mouseup over the element i get the down and up alerts however i also get the click alert of the li s event handler too

1184955
mouseup	mousedown
i thought that this should be prevented from by the call to event.stoppropagation in the mousedown and mouseup handlers

1184963
mouseup	mousedown
the key here is that click mousedown and mouseup are distinct events

1184963
mouseup	mousedown
although you might think of a click as being a mousedown followed by a mouseup in reality you might have click events triggered by user actions that don t even involve the mouse as well as combinations of mousedown and mouseup that don t result in any click events at all

1184972
put	get
one way to do this is to make a new table in your database in which a user is put as soon as he logs in to the chat - even non-members can be helped this way as they will probably need to have some alias anyway so when they come into the chat they either have to choose a name or get one randomly - this name can be linked to an id that only goes in the chatroom with which you can easily start conversations to someone

1184982
gridview	sqldatasource
i ve just done a quick test with a gridview and sqldatasource and gave me the new value as expected

1185036
doxygen	tex
when compiling formulas doxygen will take the contents of your latex equations copies the ones that haven t been generated to html _formulas.tex relative to the output_directory specified in the doxyfile attempt to compile the tex file and then copies the result to png files

1185056
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby as well as anything other language targeted for the dlr will likely remain more familiar to the developer audience

1185060
ironruby	ironpython
but we do have a start on that in the form of the hosting apis we ship on codeplex w dlr and ironpython projects and also w ironruby over on github

1185060
ironruby	ironpython
therefore every language more or less has it s own hosting story except for ironpython and ironruby right now

1185067
client-side	server-side
would it be best done client-side or server-side

1185085
getter	setter
- per point of extensibility and generally supply getter and setter methods or properties or whatever s appropriate to the specific language to access and change that instance

1185123
haskell	sml
i would probably recommend sml over haskell if you feel like trying on a functional language for the first time

1185127
move	drag
my page has 2 columns and you can drag items across the 2 colums but now it only drag on the left column and items in the right colum will not move

1185185
post	get
your first query should be entirely unnecessary as facebook always provides the uid to an application via the fb_sig_user parameter post or get

1185198
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
java.util.calendar and java.util.date both seem to cause the xsd datatype to be datetime when rendered in in wsdl xsd

1185260
width	height
if you this when the page is loaded completely not only the dom you can check the width and height of your ad images

1185274
width	height
now i want to know the width height of the the context in pixels

1185384
qtreeview	qabstractitemview
i took a look at the qt source v4.5 though i don t expect much difference between v4.4 and v4.5 for qabstractitemview and qtreeview and i don t think they support incremental lazy loading of child nodes

1185447
wordpress	joomla
drupal joomla as mentioned wordpress

1185455
width	height
the size width height for a single texture is limited by gl_max_texture_size

1185468
hide	show
my end goal is to ensure zoom controls are always displayed on the screen instead of the default hide show behavior

1185478
cvs	svn
versioning system cvs svn ... where developers commit regularly minutes hours

1185490
freebsd	solaris
this feature is only expected to work on os x solaris and freebsd

1185569
fiddler	charles
i ve found fiddler a little slow as well and i ve switched to using charlesproxy instead however if you always have them running and have them logging all browser interactions then they will make your machine slower as all browser requests all go through the fiddler charles proxy system and be logged and use up memory

children	parent
remove the explicit ids you should setup some class-based handler or at the very least target the parent id and find the images to attach to as children something like this

1185631
entity-relationship	diagram
this generated the following entity-relationship diagram

1185652
width	height
and note the data binding for the width and height works fine--all windows show up as the correct size

1185652
width	height
if i create multiple window instances but don t open any windows the width and height properties of all window instances are nan

1185652
width	height
if i then open just one of the instances the width and height properties of all window instance are suddenly valid numbers not just the width and height of the window i opened

1185686
hide	show
that said an even easier method for the functionality you want is just to use hide and show on two already-existing divs

1185703
put	get
by their get first put later nature ndash

1185725
hide	show
in the case where the countryid doesn t match i would hide the select probably clear it s value too and show an already existing input that was previously hidden

1185750
svg	vml
i would take a good look at dojo or more specifically dojox.gfx which allows svg rendering using canvas vml for ie or silverlight

1185755
post	put
try changing the request method to post and put those query string parameters into the request body

1185785
httphandler	httpmodule
but unlike file types such as .aspx and .ashx file types such as .js and .css that you have used in your example are not by default registered with the asp.net dll within iis so when they are requested iis doesn t pass the request through the asp.net pipeline so no httpmodule or httphandler will run

1185799
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome

1185800
pop-up	dialog	sudo	passwd
notes the sudo command will ask for me s passwd and then hdiutil might pop-up a gui dialog asking for the filevault master passwd

1185815
ethernet	wireless
it doesn t know whether it s broadband 3g ethernet wireless or any of the details - just that it s there

1185825
google-chrome	firefox
not sure how it works in firefox and google-chrome since there is no handlearrowkeys function

1185838
hid	keyboard	mouse	keyboard
i am a .net developer and i want to turn my usb hid device mouse dance pad guitar or drums specially drums into a keyboard with few keys i know

1185840
nunit	mstest
i have some class libraries with nunit tests and i want to convert the project to use the vs 2008 mstest integration

1185894
width	height
if you don t set the width and height at all does the window appear in the correct location

1185894
width	height
if all that is true then it sounds like wpf is computing the location of the window prior to getting the value of width and height from your bindings

1185909
disk	ram
as far as you question no you re not likely to get php to execute a modified script without writing it somewhere whether that s a file on the disk a virtual file mapped to ram or something similar

1185980
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i really want to build in all 5 well-known browsers ie firefox google-chrome opera and safari but right now i am having to right click the actual html files and open them in different browsers

1185985
mouseleave	mouseenter
i tried setting staysopen true in mouseenter of popup and staysopen false in mouseleave but mouseleave fires as and when mouse is over winform control resulting in unexpected behaviour

1186007
post	get
if you are unable to get flash to post the cookie then you ll have to identify the user within the upload url

1186053
post	get
here s a blog post from o reilly radar on tips for using mechanical turk to get your work done

1186100
superclass	subclassing
you create superclass to contain common behavior among subclassing

1186100
superclass	subclassing
in some cases the superclass cannot be a complete class because each subclassing must provide an override or extension

1186100
superclass	subclassing
we provide a abstract superclass because we need subclassing to provide the missing features

1186106
getter	setter
at that point you can use a static property and maybe a pair of static getter setter methods

1186107
rss	feed
i m trying to read an rss feed from flickr but it has some nodes which are not readable by simple xml media thumbnail flickr profile and so on

1186111
spaces	delimiter
the article tags is a spaces delimiter string of text values that a user has tagged the aritlce with

1186123
int	chars
int and getc return most chars if i printf c them including multibyte like â or even â

1186143
typedef	struct
however this convention is a remnant of older versions of c where this syntax was required in order to name struct and so nowadays you can simply write something like the following omitting the typedef and the typedef names

1186154
gtk	fltk
use a cross platform library such as gtk c++ wrapper gtkmm qt wxwidgets or fltk that wrap the specific os s api

1186154
gtk	fltk
for the examples given gtk gtkmm is license under lgpl qt is under various licenses including proprietary option wxwidgets is under its own wxwindows licence with a rename to wxwidgets licence and fltk is under lgpl with exception

1186250
int	chars
the reason it returns an int is so that the eof value can be distinguished from any of the possible chars values

1186258
google-chrome	firefox
when view this page in google-chrome or firefox it looks great

1186263
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
one way to handle the user interface you mentioned would be to use mousemove mouseup and mousedown events of the trackbar

1186274
for-loop	arrays
i know i could do this with a regular for-loop by accessing the indeces of the arrays but this wouldn t be as clean

1186292
subtract	add
you could create a class for numeric values but then manipulating it would require methods as add subtract etc

1186327
debian	linux
if you are using a debian based linux .

1186379
valgrind	memcheck
i then used valgrind memcheck tool but the messages it gives are cryptic and not very conclusive it shows leaks in graphical elements of qt which on scrutiny can be straightaway rejected

1186391
subclass	abstract-class
you might want to implement a subclass of mouseadapter an abstract-class that provides empty implementations of all of the methods defined in the interfaces

1186398
curb	libcurl
you rather need something like libcurl or curb on rubyforge which are ruby bindings for libcurl or patron on rubyforge

1186398
put	get	post	put	post	get
these libraries can make a request header as per your liking setting content-type choosing among get put post delete head etc. and obtain the response and probably follow 302 redirections when needed

1186408
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram

1186408
entity-relationship	diagram
i know this is not uml but a good database design upfront is important and an entity-relationship diagram would help you to organise and plan how different tables relate with each other

1186415
config	ini
i m trying to make an install using wix and i need to modify a config file not xml or ini with entries that a customized wix dialog

1186426
width	height
i believe that aspect ratio is width divided by height

1186440
valgrind	memcheck
you said you tried valgrind memcheck tool

1186464
stateless	stateful
since windows forms are stateful opposed to stateless for web forms you can just use a field in your form class

1186470
width	height
width height gets you a decimal converted to a fraction with in place of gives you a ratio

1186547
webrat	cucumber
cucumber generates out some neat webrat regex steps

1186550
put	get
unless you put it in an tag you can not get the visited active etc colors without javascript

1186554
put	get
however if there is a possibility that you will need more this can get wasteful so i agree with other answers you should put them in a collection of your choice and use it to loop through them to see which ones are checked

1186605
boost	stl
before becoming a c# developer i was a hardcore c++ stl com programmer but never really used boost back then apart from playing around with a smart pointers from boost

1186687
rss	feed
i developing a website where i need to read the rss feed from users blogs websites and store it in database

1186715
pop-up	dialog
when you press print in calendar print preview the print dialog that pop-up has more options cross browsers

1186717
stateless	stateful
the straightforward difference is that static methods are stateless whereas non-static methods are stateful

1186726
put	get
selecteditem is the closest to what you re looking for but since it s an object you have to cast it to the type of the items you put in the listbox to get additional properties

1186745
portrait	landscape
i would play around with css and javascript on that print page and see if i can mimic something like that by switching between landscape and portrait using js and css rules make 2 buttons - landscape portrait when user clicks on them you change css rules for your calendar so that it fits given paper size

1186764
many-to-many	one-to-many
this could be one-to-one for private tuition or it could be one-to-many if the students attend classes with the teachers or it could be many-to-many if students attend several classes

1186807
webkit	gecko
as opposed to writing 50-100+ lines of dom scripting to account for inconsistencies of the dom api across webkit gecko presto trident et cetera

1186828
draggable	droppable
from what i understand you have a bunch of draggable that share a common purpose but their droppable need to change depending on which one was dragged

1186828
draggable	droppable
all that s needed is to hook into the start event of the draggable and conditionally change the accept options of the droppable you want them to work with

1186828
draggable	droppable
but instead of hooking into the drag method of the draggable to constantly monitor which element it is over you can simply use the over and out methods of your droppable to add and remove a class to the draggable-helper

1186836
free	malloc
you need to in program.c to for example use malloc and free

1186836
dlsym	dlopen
similarly you need for dlopen and dlsym . if you don t do that the compiler will complain that it doesn t know what those names are and halt with an error

1186836
dlsym	dlopen
one last thing dlopen and dlsym are not the normal method of linking

1186873
jar	war
the structure of a war file is very different then a jar so it doesn t work

1186873
jar	war
the java class files are kept inside classes directory of the war whereas jar directly have the java class files

1186875
jar	war
basically extract out the common functionality make it a library as a jar file and either include that jar file in both war files or add it to a common part of the classpath

1186880
put	get
if you do have a secret code or something you need to hide from people usually as part of a drm or drm-like system one way to made it harder to get to would be to not directly put the code in your app

1186895
width	height
the jpeg format compresses color information in squares of 2x2 pixels by getting an average color to represent all four pixels so if your image width and height are divisible by two you will lose less quality as most of the information removed in the compression is information that was interpolated in the decompression

1186895
width	height
likewise the brightness information is compressed in squares of 8x8 pixels so if your width and height are divisable by eight the grid will align after rotating the image and you will lose less actual information

1187006
wordpress	joomla
wordpress joomla is web based and on a hosted server going from page to page takes time

1187017
profiling	debugging
though not a full blown profiling with a yummy gui you could use windbg + sos to debugging your silverlight app it would require a lot of manual work but you can then walk your managed heap

1187025
wordpress	joomla
you mention that it takes a long time to go between pages on wordpress joomla but think about how much longer than that it takes for your users to load up whatever monstrosity you may have concocted in flex

1187125
unix	bsd
you could use the low level bsd unix style network socket calls but luckily you don t have to

1187130
division	modulo
zerodivisionerror integer division or modulo by zero

1187157
width	height
i ve done all steps to load the texture but when i call getdesc the fields width and height of the d3dsurface_desc struct are of the next bigger power-of-2 size

1187165
cpython	ironpython
ironpython s main strength is in integration with the .net ecosystem - it s not a drop-in replacement for cpython

1187202
rss	feed
for instance i have a single very large statement which converts items in my database into an rss feed

1187216
rss	feed
for creating rss feed i prefer there classes work really well and since you are working with objects it makes generating your output quite easy if you have a dal of some sort

1187236
equals	gethashcode
i d recommend using a struct and overriding gethashcode equals and implementing iequatable structname which is used by dictionary tkey tvalue

1187247
post	get
it s huge though - 24g compressed - you need to get it by post on dvds from ldc

1187257
width	margin
change your window.showmodaldialog options to use width 300px instead of dialogwidth 300px - the horizontal scrollbar disappears and the vertical scrollbar is to the right of the margin

1187280
folder	directory
i have an asp.net web application which has 3 projects to handle 3 different layers of the application ui bl and data access .when i publish the ui project a directory called precompiled will be created in the solution and files will be available there.this folder will have a bin directory which holds required dll s referenced dll s and dll of business layer project dll of dataaccesslayer project too

1187280
folder	directory
so i created a website and under that i created virtual directory for the above sites.i put index.asp of the ui project i had in my solution in the folder which is mapping to one virtual directory and when trying to access i am getting an error like the following

1187280
folder	directory
root folder - bin folder various ui related files folder a folder which is converted to a virtual directory now websitea

1187280
folder	directory
if i copy the bin folder from my root and paste it in each of the virtual directory folder along with the index.aspx its working.but i dont want to have same bin folder for each sites.i want to have only one bin which should be in the root folder

1187290
boost	stl
the most important books i read were all herb sutter books because idioms used in boost and cetainly in stl are pretty well discussed there exceptional c++ more exceptional c++ and exceptional c++ style

1187310
width	height
to fetch the height width

1187323
maven	pom.xml
i m quite new to maven and i don t know how to write the pom.xml file that does this and couldn t find a similar example in the maven book

1187324
post	get
if you get a chance post your answer as i ve recently run into the same issue

1187358
width	height
when rasterizing svg file i would like to be able to set width and height for the resulting png file

1187358
width	height
with the following code only the canvas is set to the desired width and height the actual image content with the original svg file dimension is rendered in the top left corner on the 500 600 canvas

1187358
librsvg	cairo
also documents for librsvg python binding seem to be extremely rare only some random code snippets on cairo site

1187390
innodb	myisam
as each row will take at least 16b you can have up to 250m rows in the table before the table uses 4gb fat32 limit if there is one archive per table which is the case for myisam and innodb

1187426
subtract	add	int	chars
you can only add subtract int from a chars pointer

1187469
fseek	ftell
eg if you are using c language then you can go to the end of the file using fseek fp seek_end and then use ftell fp which will give you the current position of the file pointer

1187549
gif	png
i tried with transparent backgroud images png and gif formats and it always draw something surrounding the star

1187642
children	parent
is there any way we can connect less often and bring back larger chunks of data via the use of multiple result sets we use stored procedures. so instead of each child object loading its own data the parent will fetch all data for itself and its children

1187689
puts	gets	free	malloc
we don t directly perform malloc new free delege .instead we call osa layer s routines and it gets the memory from os and puts it in a list then returns this memory to application. routines xxalloc xxfree xxrealloc

1187744
post	get
i m programming a service for a program that uses http post get requests so i handle all incoming requests with a hook method that takes a system.io.stream and returns a system.io.stream

1187744
filepath	unc
when i return a filepath a windows unc not going to explain why i do that i initially url-encoded the string before converting to a stream and returning it using a return-statement the client seems to get a doubly-coded string

1187765
cvs	svn
install svn cvs git plugin

1187784
int	double
update since you specify a need to distinguish int from double with zero-value decimal portions i think you ll have to do something like the following

1187786
int	double
as you are essentially trying to figure out if a double is an int or not you can create a bigdecimal and test its scale method

1187825
getter	setter
right click then source equally useful with a special mention to generate getter and setter and implement methods

1187844
client-side	server-side
your mindset changes depending on if you re writing code for the client-side or server-side

1187915
pull	push
the hg command push and pull move changes between repositories and update and commit moves changes between your working copy and your local repository

1187926
firefox	safari
for example safari has sqlite support and firefox now has web workers

1187939
versioning	upgrade
wizardby can also be integrated into your build process as well as into your application on each startup in can attempt to upgrade database to the most recent versioning

1188000
shadowbox	lightbox
fyi shadowbox is a javscript media viewer lightbox

1188000
width	height
the swf loads with a width and height of 300x300

1188033
put	get
are you sure the html you get back from your ajax is the same as the code that you are using when you put it in statically

1188034
post	get
you can pretty much google svn dropbox and you ll get all the information you need if these two post are missing anything

1188077
tolower	toupper
i prefer the comparer approach to doing some sort of tolower toupper on everything dictionary-related

1188090
post	get
you can not get post variables through rewriting to different domains like that because it has to redirect the request

1188140
put	get
the other thing you get with the dispatchtimer is that it s tick event is automatically evaluated on the dispatch queue so you don t have to explicitly put it in the dispatch queue.

1188147
profiler	aqtime
aside from the clr profiler i ve used aqtime to pinpoint bottlenecks in my projects

1188189
getter	setter
in .net 2.0 methods including property getter setter would be inlined if they had fewer than 32 bytes

1188192
getter	setter
yes in java you need a lot of lines but i just write my attributes and tell the ide please create getter and setter for me

1188271
apache	nginx
bundled with nginx generally all apache does is cost you resources

1188311
rdf	owl
the core principles would include understanding of rdf rdfs owl and

1188417
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

1188430
post	put
than i wonna put this post inside include tag to render in more detail context

1188449
jar	war
should it be the war file with production settings or a jar of all of the classes and none of the resources

1188465
children	parent
basically i want these events to be propagated to children but not to parent like one way binding

1188555
children	parent
i thought maven would support this as it has info on the parent and the parent has info on the children but i think i was inferring too much

1188580
post	get
you get the id of the insert either with mysql_insert_id or last_insert_id from mysql directly so to post some connected info you can do either

1188580
multi-query	mysql
depending on your language and mysql libraries you might not be able to issue the multi-query approach so you re better off with using the first approach

1188606
packets	multicast
i have a quick and dirty proof of concept app that i wrote in c# that reads high data rate multicast udp packets from the network

1188612
hide	show
make a hidden textarea and upon selecting clicking or hover the div hide the div and show the textarea

1188678
pull	push
people can still push and pull from you because the repository still has all the data about the changesets

1188678
pull	push
you re never going to log in to bitbucket s servers edit your code and commit there -- you re only ever going to push pull clone

1188805
debian	linux
client is running windows based os server that will export him the java web app is running linux debian

1188806
inherited	properties
the case where this is not ok is the case pet inherited from person â in this case the managed object model compiler will generate an error about conflicting properties names when it compiles your model file

1188817
fflush	gets
supposedly a flush.php in a maintenace folder will fflush it s cache which is invconveniently separate from the rest of drupal s cache but trying to execute in browser gets me an error

1188832
versioning	upgrade
i recommend keeping a list of all software that your project utilizes along with their versioning and last upgrade date along with other important information such as licensing info support info etc.

1188832
versioning	upgrade
software on this list with an old versioning date and a newer versioning available may be incentive enough to convince management that an upgrade should be done

1188853
submit	submission
for instance rather than submission the full path c users ericlaw documents secret image.png internet explorer 8 will now submit only the filename image.png

1188910
mantis	bugzilla
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks

1188940
salt	md5
you can md5 or encrypt for better security the client ip using a secret salt + date and pass this as a parameter in iframe src url

1189002
put	get
when i cut out something and put it somewhere else i sometimes get something else like a messed up part of my previous selection or just some whitespaces

1189007
rss	feed
drawing an rss feed into the php the raw xml from the rss feed reads

1189010
qtkit	quicktime
i believe that kmovieloadstateplayable belongs to a quicktime framework and i have both qtkit and and the quicktime framework in my program but i can t figure out why it is erroring here

1189014
pthreads	fork
this did not make sense to me so i tested on the simulator pthreads works fork doesn t

1189029
getter	setter
if you have a public getter and setter that strictly copies the value passed to class field i think that s just overcomplicated approach

1189029
getter	setter
the only situation i can think of where you would want to use getter or setter is when you have to process the value somehow

1189032
folder	directory
right click your project go to properties go to msbuild options tab you will see an output folder by default it should have some path called precompiledweb that s where your output is and you need deploy this to your iis directory

1189045
getter	setter
the right thing to do from a purist oo perspective is create your own setter getter method ideally by overloading php s that makes the relevant data available

1189053
gridview	repeater
i am using a group by key and count which i evaluate in the aspx page for a master detail gridview with a repeater

1189058
getter	setter
just do good oop i suggest you to declare getter and setter against accessing variables directly.. and forget about __get and __set

1189059
google-chrome	firefox
i wrote a function that does this in ie by creating a button object and setting value view but in firefox and google-chrome the button displays with no text

1189063
pthreads	fork
and as you said pthreads work and fork doesn t so its logical it would work on the real one as well

1189073
gridview	sqldatasource
you might also use the sqldatasource and gridview controls they help a lot

1189078
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
i added this new view to a uiwindow after adding the uinavigationcontroller s view

1189102
getter	setter
that s why we have the terror of getter and setter methods

1189114
getter	setter
not only in php but in object oriented programming in general if a class has member variables for which it s not necessary to execute code when they are accessed there s no need to make setter and getter and the variables can be accessed directly

1189126
getter	setter
but note that using getter setter is said to have a cost it costs some cpu when you speak about performance as you have to call a method

1189126
getter	setter
when i don t need to check anything i don t use getter setter

1189126
getter	setter
when i need some special behaviour i declare my variables as protected private and create a special getter setter like getname setname

1189194
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer will allow you to ajax remote domain when running from file but firefox and google-chrome won t

1189209
ienumerable	iqueryable
neither ienumerable nore iqueryable will not work

1189221
many-to-many	one-to-many
many-to-many and one-to-many relationships are modeled with plain collections

1189233
findwindow	showwindow
i realize this has been answered but you could force a window to hide with unmanaged calls to findwindow and showwindow

1189256
filtering	grouping
this only has the option of including grouping of output and excluding files via the filtering

1189260
getter	setter
no further structure or control than getter and setter

1189347
rsa	dsa
dsa doesn t work but using rsa does

1189378
mantis	bugzilla	trac	mantis	trac	bugzilla
from free ones you can use bugzilla mantis or trac which i was able to get running on windows but there are many hostings available too

1189382
getter	setter
getter and setter are great if you want to override the access to your data for example for logging security or returning a value different from the original class

1189390
getter	setter
people do overuse silly getter setter no doubt about that

1189443
nsstring	nsdata
you were creating a ton of autoreleased nsstring and nsdata objects and converting strings to data every time just to append data bytes

1189479
getter	setter
this allowed auxiliary tools to be built which were based on at the time novel ideas like specifying exactly what the name of getter and setter were and an expectation that specific methods would exist without needing to ascribe to an interface

1189514
linqdatasource	detailsview
i am now using a detailsview that has a textarea as one of the fields and uses a linqdatasource as its datasource

1189523
ramaze	merb	merb	ruby-on-rails
which i believe is a syntax that is used only by ruby-on-rails not by merb sinatra or ramaze

1189572
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
imagemagick graphicsmagick gd

1189599
dynamic-languages	compiled-language
one benefit is it allows you to prototype your applications in a dynamic-languages and then optimize them in a statically compiled-language

1189660
mp3	speex
the problem is the gui only allows for some encodings mp3 nellymoser raw etc but not speex

1189697
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
safari google-chrome and even firefox do support it

1189725
getter	setter
a bean property is usually defined by a variable declaration with matching getter and setter methods

1189729
isnull	nullif
easier to isnull or nullif in sql to deal with empty strings and other such

1189733
getter	setter
getter setter are ugly but are embedded into so many tools that make assumptions about class method field names spring that aside from their obvious value for encapsulation they ve effectively become a near requirement unless you re working in a very limited and private context

1189738
codeigniter	kohana	symfony	kohana
i agree with tom -- you should look into using a framework such as zend cake symfony kohana codeigniter ez-components or seagull

1189797
daemons	systemd
your pylons controller makes a systemd call to your 2nd process passing whatever data is needed and the 2nd process immediately becomes a daemons

1189879
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a button gridview and sqldatasource at the top of the page and another button gridview and sqldatasource with the second query at the bottom

1189917
tcpclient	networkstream
when i read from the networkstream object that i get from the tcpclient class the networkstream read method does not block if there is no data available

1189942
post	put
when i make a post or put http request

1189942
post	put
and the post or put creates a change to the google app engine database

1189942
post	put
after the post or put request returns

1189942
put	get	post	put	post	get
put simply i wish to know if when i get a response from a post or put if there is a guarantee that all future request to the datastore will have indexes reflecting the changes that the post or put made

1189972
cos	sin
a rotation would be x cos theta y sin theta where theta is the angular value that you wish to rotate by and a scale would be a x b y with a being the scale factor along the x-axis and b being the scale factor along the y-axis

1189984
ubuntu	opensuse
i m working on a java applet and i was wondering where the heck system.out was going in ubuntu opensuse

1189984
ubuntu	opensuse
in windows i just pull up jconsole but i ve not found this in ubuntu opensuse

1190010
int	boolean
number int uint boolean use the standard string representation for a literal

1190066
post	get
no matter which form i post i always get the same array returned

1190100
post	get
if the css is rendered inline blame ms for that lol post back here and i ll try to get back with a workaround

1190133
hide	show
below is my full code its basic you select a country and it show or hide the correct form underneath problem is it gives an error

1190161
vsto	add-in
i have vs2005 but that plus vsto 2005 se can only do application-level add-in not document-level macros

1190185
client-side	server-side
it includes client-side support for javascript .net mono ios mac os x java silverlight windows phone windows runtime and .net compact with server-side support for .net mono and php

1190248
cobertura	emma
a better approach is to track code coverage using a tool such as cobertura or emma which happens to have a nice eclipse plugin that allows you to see inside your source code what code is being covered by tests and which isn t

1190265
firefox	safari
this sounds like a bug in firefox safari where a flash movie with wmode set to transparent or opaque contained in a floated element doesn t properly register click events

1190322
actionscript	mxml
is it possible to create an instance of the main mxml and use it inside the actionscript class

1190369
google-chrome	firefox
specifically what causes a page to look different in firefox google-chrome ie what are the gotchas when developing how can this issue be addressed in a new project etc

1190371
inherited	properties
even then though you would bind a properties on the mxml file either in an mx script or in code-behind via inherited and then have your textfield bind to the properties

1190395
children	parent
this then makes the actual mdiclient area smaller so we can see what is behind it the bit which hosts the children forms and it is blatantly obvious that the parent form is not painting or something

1190413
cvs	svn
i am trying to perform a migration from cvs to svn on my our new xserve server which is running os x server

1190444
actionscript	mxml
how can i call mxml components inside my actionscript class

1190444
actionscript	mxml
i need to access the username and password fields of mxml in my actionscript class

1190484
post	get
if i get an answer i will post it here too

1190551
ant	maven
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2

1190586
pop-up	dialog
in the dialog that pop-up there s a text box for the location

1190602
implements	extends
when you want a certain task to be executed by another thread you can extends thread or implements runnable

1190603
int	chars
i didn t know you could do that and after studying it i can see that all that happens is the binary value of the chars you re using gets thrown into an int

1190638
google-chrome	firefox
i have one site that is https - it will track visits from ie but not from firefox or google-chrome

1190638
google-chrome	firefox
i tried replacing their piwik.php with a simple file of my own that just writes a text file - this works from ie from firefox and google-chrome it doesn t even create the file

1190654
filtering	grouping
i usually think of a vm as a filtering grouping and sorted collections of model classes

1190656
setinterval	settimeout
this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right

1190662
memcached	apc
even when i store the object explicitly in apc or memcached the time to unserialize it and load all of the classes takes almost as long as creating the object in the first place

1190687
int	chars
using a chars literal in an enum is essentially the same as assigning a chars to an int â it s totally legal and can be quite useful in many situations

1190742
cvs	svn
port install git-core cvs cvsps svn if necessary

1190742
cvs	svn
now add the cvs git repo to svn repo

1190742
cvs	svn
now merge the cvs master branch to the local svn master branch

1190748
maven	pom.xml
as well as the require-bundle form of dependency management most similar to maven s pom.xml dependencies it s also possible to have import-package dependencies

1190751
children	parent
my question is some of the nodes have children and if you click the little + box next to that node it will expand the tree but it will also select that parent node

1190768
folder	directory
typically applications will write their temporary files to temp if they just need temporary non-recoverable file access however you will probably be better off writing them to the users directory in your own folder you have created there

1190768
pop-up	dialog
this folder is typically going to be the same spot that the user would choose when the save dialog pop-up

1190813
keydown	keyup
i tried faking the dispatch keyboard event keyup keydown with keycode 8 and keynumber 8 without success

1190840
client-side	server-side
your server-side code php cannot know about the actions that have been taken on the client-side without having communicated with the browser

1190847
memcached	apc
in general however caching mechanisms apc memcached etc are really trying to remove the db connection s more than improve performance and thereby decrease the overall db strain

1190903
post	get
it looks like you re populating the control only if there s no postback so what happens here is that on post you get your control with no items and obviously no value

1190911
range	min
where range is how many consecutive numbers you want to choose from and min is the smallest of these

1190911
range	min
so to generate a number between 1 and 100 range is 100 and min is 1

1190935
move	drag
currently the drag functionality i have set up is fine and dragging the image does move it around the screen the trouble is that you don t have to drag the image view to move it you can also drag anywhere on the screen and it will move the image

1190937
disk	ram
at that time the disk encryption key is in ram a reboot later the key could be in the bad guy s possession.

1190964
ant	maven
since you re in ant you probably don t want to switch but maven is pretty good at identifying all your dependencies and has several facilities for copying or combining your lib jars together for distribution purposes

1191039
mp3	wav
achieving this with a recording of a horn as a wav or mp3 file or whatever is a relatively difficult programming task especially for someone who s never worked with audio before

1191052
stdout	stderr
for what purpose are there deferr defout and why there is no defin if there are stderr stdout and stdin and also stdin stdout and stderr

1191061
firefox	safari
i ve lost count of the my site looks great in firefox ie safari but it s all screwed up in ie safari firefox. questions

1191085
pdfsharp	itextsharp
i need to add a table using itextsharp or even pdfsharp if it can do it into an existing pdf template at a particular location in the template

1191103
ant	maven
i know that ant would be better for this but i m using maven in my project

1191103
ant	maven
i m not going to switch to ant just for that i m asking how to do this with maven

1191103
ant	maven
there is ant ant plugin but it just generates ant build.xml that points dependencies to local maven repo

1191105
ubuntu	linux
i run a q6600 2.4ghz 4gb of ram 64-bit linux ubuntu 9.04 system and this query can take up to 6.7 seconds to run i do have a huge database

1191107
hprof	jprofiler
jprofiler is pretty nifty but you can get the same information using hprof which was introduced in java 5

1191112
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

1191112
hash	salt
the necessity of hiding the salt for a hash

1191112
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
clients-side md5 hash with time salt

1191113
submit	submission
add a click event handler to the submit button so that it enables all of the disabled dropdown menus before submission the form

1191115
width	height
the width height of r1 r2 r3 and r4 are unknown

1191115
width	height
the problem is that i do not know width or height of the content and thus not of the r1 through r4 s

1191122
hash	salt
why not add a random salt to the password and hash that combination

1191124
hash	salt
many systems will store the plain text salt in the database in the column right next to the hash password

1191124
hash	salt
without the random and unique salt for each password the hash values would be the same and obviously if the password for user a is cracked then user b must have the same password

1191124
factors	mean
the variations in work factors will mean more tables would have to be built

1191128
width	height
if you don t set the width or the height they will naturally form

1191128
width	height
the height is determined by the length of the content and the width if not specified will fill the width of the container it is in

1191145
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are global stream constants default values

1191145
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout and stderr are global variables initialised to the value of the stream constants

1191145
stdout	stderr
i believe defout and deferr were deprecated some time ago with the release of ruby 1.8.2 and current best practice is to use only stdin stdout and stderr

1191158
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
expect string comparison to be case-sensitive is and eq operators are case-insensitive

1191164
firefox	safari
firefox safari will continue working

1191226
vbscript	jscript
finally before you even think about using vbscript go and read why vbscript and jscript msi customactions suck

1191239
division	modulo
as for computing the number of full boxes and the number of items in the last box look up integer division and modulo

1191258
floyd-warshall	clrs
however if you assume that floyd-warshall is the only algorithm for computing such a thing big-theta of |v| 3 then i have a bit of good news for you johnson s algorithm for sparse graphs thank you trusty clrs

1191265
mako	formencode
i m working in pylons with mako and i d like to create forms and validations with formencode for several parts of my application

1191269
int	double
taking the int into floats or double only brings in all the quirks of floating point numbers such as their ability to represent more numbers close to zero than close to one

1191322
hash	salt
random password generation which is basically picking random symbols of a certain minimum length and password storage which in practical terms involve storing a hash of the password with a salt so that the plaintext password can t be discover just by reading the database

1191322
hash	salt
so to protect against that a random per user salt value is added to the password before it is hash

1191331
children	parent
i would like to know how to properly eager load associated children with minimal queries and possibly how to accomplish my routine generically not knowing how far down i need to build the hierarchy but given a parent entity grab all the associated child collections and then do what i need to do

1191348
hash	salt
for example if your users have 4 letter passwords it could probably be cracked in seconds even with a salt and the newest hash algorithm

1191378
jlist	jtextfield
use a jtextfield to enter in the calculations and a jlist to display the old ones and their answers

1191386
firefox	safari
he forwarded it to all his friends and they all use firefox or safari now

1191388
folder	directory
for command-line applications directory rather than folder seems to be the norm everywhere including win32

1191405
hide	show
when you select usa from the country list it hide the othstate field when you select any country other then the usa it hide the usa statelist and show the input field

1191410
folder	directory
if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder

1191416
spaces	delimiter
another problem with your approach above is that there will probably be some delimiter between the words typically one or more spaces for instance you will need to handle read write on these too

1191428
mouse	keyboard
keyboard mouse disks they all just stop and the image on my screens are frozen

1191431
jlist	jtextfield
if you are open to different interfaces you might want to try something like a jtextfield at the top of your view from which you can receive as input your new inputted equation and then below it with the same width a jlist that would scroll to have all of the previous equations and their results

1191446
mouse	keyboard
note that if you actually need to simulate a general click regardless of whether it s performed by mouse keyboard touch input or other method or other high-level interaction with the control you should probably use wpf automation api instead

1191484
put	get
i put all my shorcuts and commands in here and i attach it to the win-r key so i can get to them easily

1191525
gif	png	png	tga
i ve tried png gif tga

1191556
getter	setter
and it s not possible with setter getter function you have to call setlabel bla from the script

1191556
getter	setter
2 properties are basically the same functions as setter and getter

1191585
ant	maven
i have seen this problem often when there was a script ant maven ... that would handle the xmlbeans compilation and another mechanism was used for compiling and running the rest of the code

1191603
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme	lisp	scheme
functional programming haskell scheme ocaml lisp others tend to espouse pure functions

1191646
serializable	deserialization
a good way to figure out how a particular collection is expected for deserialization is to return that collection from a test method and examine how javascriptserializer has serializable it

1191751
google-chrome	firefox
this works for a new tab in firefox and google-chrome doesn t seem to work in ie 8 but this may depend on the doctype

1191757
eurekalog	madexcept
madexcept free or eurekalog paid may help

1191768
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

1191793
cvs	svn
in general i tend to prefer not branching until as late in the process as possible as branching and merging with cvs svn tend to be heavyweight processes

1191820
octal	hex
i see it s stuck in a number of websites but all the characters have been replaced with their hex or octal equivalent

1191829
ssl	https
when you purchase a certificate from verizon instant ssl they will give you some encrypted code using which you could configure your open ssl software and then having https urls will work

1191876
serializable	deserialization
remotely call the rules engine in process - a classic batch style trick to avoid the overhead of serializable and deserialization

1191890
public	protected
note you should make your base classes explicitly public private or protected rather than relying on the defaults

1191892
folder	directory
for example i have html folder and xml folder in same directory

1191908
int	boolean
rbt int is a set of int s rbt bool is a set of boolean etc

1191945
width	height
since opengl requires all textures to have 2 n width and height i basically put the 100 x 200 graphic right into a 128 x 256 image for this

1191955
perl	tcl
i am working with vmd a molecular dynamics visualization package and i want to open vmd from a perl script run a tcl script print the output to a log file then close vmd and return to the perl script

1192000
superclass	subclassing
vtables are another issue and are per-class and not per-instance anyway -- an instance of the subclassing embeds if you will one of the superclass

1192000
superclass	subclassing
say all instance variables are 32-bit ints for simplicity if the superclass has 3 and the subclassing adds 2 more then each instance of the subclassing will allocate 5 x 4 20 bytes -- 8 for its own instance variables plus 12 for the instance variables of the superclass

1192043
ubuntu	debian
looks like you re missing some package like python_dev or the like -- debian and derivatives including ubuntu have long preferred to isolate everything that could possibly be of developer s use from the parts of a package that are for everybody .

1192052
sorting	filtering
you could look at using ibindinglistview if you want sorting and filtering

1192055
google-chrome	firefox
it is not browser specific and happens on ie firefox google-chrome

1192059
udp	tcp
if the server and client are running on networks separated by a hub switch that won t forward udp the most likely case then i have a server instance running on each segment and they forward client requests to each other via tcp - but i need to configure this for the server instances simple but still a pain for tech support. this is the main problem that i need to address

1192083
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
it has no virtual methods that you can override except equals gethashcode and tostring

1192083
public	protected
be sure to read the documentation - this is a very easy class to derive from but you have to realize the difference between the public non-virtual and protected virtual methods

1192094
ubuntu	centos
i don t know if it s activated by default on centos but it might be considering it is on ubuntu which is less entreprise oriented

1192094
post	get
request post get and session vars

1192105
super	implements
you can verify if they are the culprit by setting a breakpoint on them or implements them to call super and breaking on your own code.

1192136
packets	multicast
the clients then send their initial discovery request as a udp packets to the pre-ordained multicast address

1192146
swt	swing
it feels as though swt is waning just an opinion based on literature i can find and swing is surging

1192154
expander	togglebutton
i think you could achieve this by binding a togglebutton which expander uses too internally to the maxheight property of your listbox

1192165
apache	nginx
i m building a website using django + apache and nginx to serve my static content

1192197
implements	extends
extends thread directly is considered bad practice prefer to implements runnable instead

1192201
int	chars
for instatnce in c c++ almost evertying but specialy values defined as chars int long float and arrays of course go on stack

1192201
disk	ram
but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there

1192226
melt	reshape
you can also use melt from the reshape library i think it s easier to use than reshape itself - that ll save you the extra step of having to add the time column back in.

1192236
redhat	fedora
some linux distros for example fedora and redhat disable ec due to patent concerns

1192282
versioning	upgrade
i also display a wizard page where the user can select the versioning he wants to upgrade from

1192282
folder	directory
the libraries can be found in the sdk folder of your wix installation you ll mainly need microsoft.deployment.windowsinstaller.dll documentation is in the dtf.chm in the doc directory

1192290
int	chars
in particular concentrate on every place where the encoding could be going wrong and make sure that whenever you display a string you dump out the exact unicode chars as int so you can check those rather than just whatever your current font wants to display

1192290
int	chars
make it dump the individual unicode chars as int before and after

1192290
int	chars
i don t know the oracle functions to convert strings into sequences of individual unicode chars and then convert those chars into int but that would quite possibly be the next thing i d try

1192295
hide	show
then to show or hide the tooltip

1192312
int	chars
c - the argument is treated as an int and presented as the chars with that ascii value

1192312
integer	unsigned
u - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as an unsigned decimal number

1192391
eurekalog	madexcept
those tools eurekalog jcl or madexcept are needed if you distribute your program among users and want to gather bug-reports about problems on client side

1192395
children	parent
children are not created until initialize is called usually via addchild when the component is added to it s parent

1192408
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
you can try to subclass uiimageview and implement touchesbegan and touchesmoved on it directly

1192417
mouseover	mouseleave
for some elements especially elements with the disabled property set the mouseout-handler hiding a tooltip by setting it s display property to none just doesn t get registered so the tooltip stays visible when the mouseleave the element mouseover does work

1192447
for-loop	arrays
edit to clarify i m obviously familiar with the option of a for-loop however it s not an arrays i m going through but rather an unordered collection

1192464
filesystems	ntfs
the simplest way of doing it would be use the access rights in windows ntfs filesystems

1192477
savefiledialog	folderbrowserdialog
in any case neither the folderbrowserdialog nor the savefiledialog offer any in-built means of restricting the user selection

1192521
udp	tcp
some of the compiler semantics and necessary header files may have changed a bit over the years but the basics of setting up a udp or tcp sockets and doing basic dns stuff discussed are still valid today

1192582
stdout	stderr
if i run the program from the command line everything works there is something written to the stderr and i also tried by using the stdout with the same result

1192596
maven	m2e
i m using m2e and have it manage dependencies for me so i had expected maven to take care of this

1192622
google-chrome	firefox
i have a web page using css and it s run ok in firefox 3.5 but not in firefox 3.1 and google-chrome

1192637
google-chrome	safari
this script will run correctly in safari and google-chrome

1192642
put	get	post	put	post	get
webservice process methods with data recieved via the html-actions put post get delete

1192650
google-chrome	firefox
it behaves as i expect in firefox ie8 but not in google-chrome

1192685
division	modulo
is modulo remainder after division

1192752
opera	firefox
it is displayed fine in firefox 3.5 opera 9.x konqueror 4.3 and internet explorer msie 7

1192810
collabnet	svn
there is a plug-in named ankhsvn available on collabnet is one of the best add-on for visual studio for svn client

1192853
zlib	system.io.compression
use the built in compressing library within system.io.compression or the zlib library which is simple and incredibly good

1192895
width	height
it s grabbing the width and height from the assigned data property so you might need to set variablerowheight to true in your actual list for it to work as expected

1192937
post	put
i need to put the comments inside the table cell of the status post somehow

1192937
post	get
in the image below there is 1 status post and 3 comments for that post what i am trying to do is get the comments to show up in there own table that will be nested in the right side right under the status post

1192943
perl	tcl
in the perl script before calling vmd write the parameters to a file in tcl syntax

1192951
folder	directory
each folder contains data for one day and we will have around 18 months of directory 550 directory

1192996
versioning	upgrade
it should check a field in the database to see what versioning the schema is at and handle the upgrade to the latest versioning

1192998
addclass	removeclass
for dealing with classes jquery has some helper methods addclass class removeclass class and hasclass class

1193008
listview	checkboxlist
within my listview i have a checkboxlist bound using linq

1193093
firefox	safari
both firefox and safari seem to not care about refreshing to reflect the changes

1193140
persistent	transient
org.hibernate.session.update is not for transient objects - it s for updating persistent objects

1193158
getter	setter
a members should be private - so you may get problems using them in derived classes so you have to add getter and setter methods which blow up your interface

1193167
post	get
i reckon francisco is on the right lines tho i d suggest implementing a post rather than a get as you are updating something

1193184
maven	pom.xml
my maven build however runs without even a warning using the following settings in my pom.xml

1193189
min	max	min	median	median	max
min mean + -sd median max

1193203
firefox	safari
40px is the default left padding for ul elements in firefox and safari whereas ie sets a 30pt left margin

1193222
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
when a user is using tortoisesvn and rapidsvn he sees the files as they are on the server and thus has the ability to delete them

1193260
getter	setter
so i wound up with two classes which is more of a pain to maintain but the updates run through getter setter instead of binding which might scale better since it s not waiting on the change event

1193279
installation	upgrade
however you can install jrails then upgrade the jquery installation simply replacing the javascript files except jrails.js in the javascripts folder

1193306
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
here is a working css tested under firefox ie7 safari google-chrome opera

1193316
rss	feed
as a sidenot and not really an answer to your question but zend_feed has some drawbacks like returning different kind of data depending on the feed s format -- rss vs atom for instance

1193316
rss	feed
there will be a zend_feed_reader component which should be more useful when consumming both rss and atom feed

1193364
rss	feed
there might be some services that offer the exchange rates in an rss feed or similar feed

1193382
post	get
have the method you call via post get would work too since you aren t passing any data do the existence check then create a link to a document handler url that does the actual download

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i have tested this in recent versions of firefox opera and safari and ie6 ie7 and ie8

1193403
width	height
imgclient width 784 height 66 and 2

1193403
width	height
imgclientextra width 1 and height 66

1193410
google-chrome	firefox
this is working fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie6

1193419
swt	swing
on the other hand using either your home-grown toolkit or swing is generally a bad idea when working with eclipse as it already embeds the swt toolkit

1193419
swt	swing
the main advantage of swt over swing is that it use the os native widgets

1193456
boost	stl
you could implement the same without stl or boost if it is required

1193470
post	put
you then need to put some logic in your edit post method to pull off the selected value from the formcollection and put it on to your instance before committing your changes

1193498
int	chars
but if you look at those 16 bit chars each one could equally represent an int a pair of bytes a pixel and so on

1193529
exponent	modulo
because rsaparameters have the following members d dp dq exponent inverseq modulo p q

1193547
uiview	subviews
i have added a subclass of uiview as a subviews to an mkmapview when a button is pressed

1193558
exponent	modulo
the public key is identified by modulo and exponent

1193560
exponent	modulo
exponent and modulo are the public key

1193566
post	put
then i want to include automatical a before_filter in every controller which checks if the current request is via post put or delete-method

1193666
getter	setter
make them as hidden as possible and use getter and setter if you need to preserve class invariants

1193725
hash	salt
they may not ask for passwords being stored securely hash and salt because they re not the experts

1193751
disk	ram
my strategy so far has been to create mnesia tables in ram with disc_copies enabled so to have mnesia automatically dump the memory to disk when the log size exceeds a certain size

1193751
disk	ram
a different approach would be to instance two tables one ram only and one disk only and have a process copy from ram to disk every minute or so

1193769
bmp	png
java on windows knows how to export jpg png and bmp as far as i know

1193776
portrait	landscape
you could also stick a rotatebox around the whole graphics include to fix a portrait landscape incompatibility

1193790
post	get
note there will be different limitation between get and post requests mainly the maximum url length and encoding so this may not always work depending on your situation

1193824
stdout	stderr
i made some changes since getstatusoutput duplicates stderr onto stdout

1193824
os.path	shutil
investigate the contents of the os os.path and shutil packages instead

1193856
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
you can use this trick tested on firefox ie6 ie7 google-chrome safari opera

1193892
put	get
do not get confused by the literal english-meaning of the words as they both can be used interchange-ably in the context you try to put them in

1193897
mef	prism
i am currently working on a wpf project using prism cal and am wondering if it is a good idea to use both prism and mef in one project

1193897
mef	prism
i would use prism for modularity and mef for extensibility

1193897
mef	prism
my project is a paint-like application so prism would provide the module-separation toolbox canvas as modules etc. and mef would be used to provide an extensibility point for new shapes to paint ie

1193905
hide	show
hide the content you don t want to show with the css property

1193931
uiview	calayer
and then applying that transform using the appropriate property on your calayer or uiview s backing layer will tilt the layer in 3-d

1193976
hide	show
this code will show and hide an animated gif progress bar while an ajax request is running

1193980
esx	xenapp
xenserver is now free which is a big selling point for us - xenserver v5.5 is a good product and we re in the process of replacing esx server - first as the host for our xenapp terminal servers

1193980
vmware	esx
citrix s offering now makes vmware esx server seem overpriced

1194001
inherited	properties
one use i sometimes have for the new keyword is for poor mans properties covariance in a parallell inherited tree

1194078
spawn	execv
the problem is that i m spawn the pip process from my bootstrapping scripts using subprocess.popen and then waiting for the process to complete but this is happening too early due to the fact that pip uses execv to relaunch itself under the new virtualenv it creates

1194128
sorting	grouping
the sorting and grouping is easy to use and understand for both the developer and end-user

1194160
firefox	safari
the problem doesn t occur in firefox or safari only ie

1194171
jaxp	saaj
after being plaguged with the nightmare that is saaj and jaxp and getting compatible versions working on jboss i m done with singletons and factories

1194226
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
you should then use a repeater or other databound control and then use list controls like the checkboxlist and radiobuttonlist

1194226
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
accessing the chosen answers should then be possible by iterating over the repeater items and finding your radiobuttonlist or checkboxlist controls probably using the findcontrol ... method

1194255
mouse	keyboard
i can use the context menu key on the keyboard to activate the menu but not the mouse

1194280
mouse	keyboard
i am looking for a method that doesn t involve send keys because it locks the keyboard and mouse until the macro completes

1194313
manual	rcs
from the rcs manual

1194318
newid	hashbytes
the stored procedure create a new guid using newid then i use the hashbytes sha1 function of sql server to create the password based on the guid+password provided then i insert the values into the table above

1194352
width	height
there has been some discussion on whether it is possible at all to determine the width height ratio with the information given

1194386
post	get
it s too big of a topic to cover in a so post but the following article will help you get started on custom actions

1194422
ant	maven
i would consider managing these things with the ivy extension to ant which has the benefit of being maven compatible should you ever want to go that way

1194478
google-chrome	safari
some browsers have a bug google-chrome safari where they do not expand the html body background correctly until a reload occurs

1194484
updatepanel	scriptmanager
there is a scriptmanager control i put to root.master in case i can use updatepanel in any page

1194524
free	malloc
you can implement most of it in terms of malloc and free - in fact a lot of c++ memory managers are implemented even if they don t have to be

1194524
free	malloc
you could start with a simple implementation that maintains a log of all allocations and deallocations but forwards the regular allocations deallocations to malloc and free

1194524
free	malloc
implement global new and delete as wrappers that first log the access in the above data structure and then forward the call to malloc or free

1194532
versioning	upgrade
data flow task dts.pipeline the component metadata for component trimcolumnscomponent 1909 could not be upgrade to the newer versioning of the component

1194545
post	get
i ve followed the spring http proxying tutorial as closely as possibly but i still can t get it to work at runtime my configuration is largely identical so unless i ve missed a typo there is no need to post it

1194548
free	malloc
so when the last unicode object is free it isn t returned to malloc right away making all the other pages stuck

1194563
erlang	lisp
you re wondering why a project doesn t write say one component in java another in lisp and a third in erlang and then link them all together as some unified deliverable

1194563
erlang	lisp
if you really believe that you have three components that are best expressed in say java lisp and erlang then it is to your advantage to write those components in those languages

1194568
google-chrome	firefox
however in google-chrome and firefox 3 it didn t work returing the following exception

1194579
put	get
in fact even if you choose not to put the class in the session and to create it on each page load it seems like overkill to get order history

1194594
gif	png
b ends with jpeg jpg gif or png

1194602
getter	setter
if you use attr_accessor to create an attribute ruby just declares an instance variable and creates getter and setter methods for you

1194609
expression-blend	silverlight
there are a lot of other videos that should help to find your way around expression-blend and silverlight

1194627
freebsd	solaris
i ve been looking into solaris servers freebsd servers just using 64-bit windows.

1194628
profiling	debugging
rather than adding extra code for debugging you could use a debugging tool or profiling

1194640
children	parent
so if any of the children close the db connection which will happen when they finish and shutdown it will kill it out from under the parent process

1194660
getter	setter
in this case i use the attr_accessor class method to define the point property along with an implicit getter and setter methods for point

1194667
versioning	upgrade
generally this means that the component was upgrade after the package was saved and so it s at the wrong versioning number

1194685
valgrind	memcheck
also since you mention that you want to make a memory manager that is useful for debugging you may want to consider reading this paper by the developers of memcheck valgrind a wonderful memory debugger for linux

1194782
xrange	enumerate
in some cases you may find loops that can benefit from enumerate replacing the range xrange business

1194812
hide	show
i noticed this occurs only when i use slideup down.if i use show hide everythings ok

1194812
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

1194836
maya	3dsmax
the more i work with level editors though the more unrealistic this whole idea of level building in maya or 3dsmax really seems

1194844
post	get
the get post function is already in use inside the plugin and returns category information

1194852
datatrigger	eventtrigger
eventtrigger datatrigger and

1194854
pop-up	dialog
i want to have an edit link on each row that will pop-up a jquery dialog so that the row can be edited

1194866
ubuntu	debian
simply install ubuntu or debian for amd64 on a suitable machine

1194866
freebsd	opensolaris
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64 bits out of the box and part of default installation

1194925
opera	firefox
after an hour the session times out and redirects me to the error.jsp in ie and opera but in firefox it redirects me immediately

1194926
ubuntu	debian
and as wazoox mentioned installation of debian or ubuntu is a breeze especially with the smaller more focused server flavors

1194985
jquery	jqmodal	jqmodal	thickbox
the jquery dialog will then simply load the controller action in that window i was doing this with thickbox but now use jqmodal

1195061
public	protected
basically you can t start an identifier with an underscore - this violates cls compliant on a visible public protected field

1195067
public	protected
protected public members should be properly cased and named

1195096
folder	directory
directory and folder behave differently

1195096
folder	directory
a great percentage of questions on unix mailinglists but also here on serverfault and on superuser about what to the asker seems to be confusing filesystem behaviour can be traced directly back to thinking about folder when unix does in fact have directory

1195096
folder	directory
so in other words use folder when dealing with folder and directory when dealing with directory

1195126
post	get
sorry for the delayed response i didn t set the question up right so i would get notifications of any responses then i ended up forgetting about the post all together

1195127
nscopying	nsmutablecopying
this can become more complicated if some elements don t conform to nscopying or nsmutablecopying

1195169
int	double
however the use is a little verbose obj.isoneof typeof int typeof bool typeof double and i am wondering about alternative approaches to defining one method taking an arbitrary amount of generic arguments

1195226
int	double
there is no typedef in java as of 1.6 what you can do is make a wrapper class for what you want since you can t subclass final classes int double etc

1195230
mbunit	nunit
if we decide to go the other route in using something like xunit mbunit or nunit then we are most likely going to have some maybe significant cost

1195244
union	distinct
in postgresql 8.3 and below union implied distinct which implied sorting that means order by union and distinct were always of same efficiency since the atter two aways used sorting

1195244
union	distinct
select distinct and union intersect except no longer always produce sorted output tom

1195261
free	malloc
essentially it has custom implementations of malloc and free that provide the debugging

1195324
put	get
on the messages pane and the temp table doesn t actually get anything put into it

1195358
post	get
the reason post was invented was pretty much to get around length limits in get

1195379
post	get
if the issue is just that the client will not send the long get string perhaps you can post to a proxy server which then forwards the request as a get

1195420
mouse	keyboard
edit in relation to the preprocessmessage i believe that is only for keyboard input not mouse

1195429
post	get
all you then need to send retrieve client-side is that session id as well as client generated information get post fields

1195438
put	get
correct me if i m wrong but this will require me to get the definition of the orderstatus class manually via email or whatever and put it in my solution

1195448
public	protected
the property is not cls compliant because it starts with an underscore and is public note protected properties in a public class can be accessed from outside the assembly

1195605
many-to-many	one-to-many
your links table looks like many-to-many mapping table between location and endpoint rather than one-to-many

1195607
winforms	treelistview	treelistview	objectlistview
objectlistview an open source wrapper around .net winforms listview has a treelistview flavour which could very easily be configured to behave in this way

1195617
put	get
i want to put a check if the location given is the any of the partition that is c or d then it should not get deleted

1195677
fileinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
just replace the bytearrayinputstream with a fileinputstream

1195686
listview	gridview
can you just embed the fileupload control in a template field in the case of a gridview not sure about listview

1195707
width	height
in the general case a quadruple a b c d of four non collinear points of the z 0 plane is the projection of infinitely many rectangles with infinitely many width height ratios

1195765
public	protected
however javadoc is only generated for public and protected types

1195778
width	height
i would like to find the height width of an image on disk without opening it if possible for performance reasons

1195778
width	height
the windows properties pane for images contains information like width height bit depth etc. which leads me to believe that it is storing metadata on the file somewhere

1195800
width	height
this will be your width and height

1195803
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to make an action that returns a file from disk to the user via little download dialog pop-up box. i ve got it working great except somehow a newline is being inserted as the first character

1195804
mouseleave	mousedown
i am no expert in this but i think you have to look at mouse button up down events wm_lbuttondown wm_rbuttondown also you may want to track mouse move events so that a mousedown on the button mouseleave the button acts as a release

1195818
gif	png
if you re dealing with only a limited number of different image formats only jpeg png and gif it shouldn t be too hard to read the size from the image header yourself

1195830
put	get	width	height
in order to get the width and height of an image essentially as you put it the metadata you will have to open the file parse some kind of header information and obtain what you want that way

1195926
post	get
i dont mean to just post a link in here but this should get you going in the right direction

1195967
rss	feed
i have a script where i need to pull two seperate and different rss feed break them up assign variables and execute code thats different for each file

1195979
int	chars
the only thing i can think of is overloading a operator that reads a chars at a time and if it sees 0x or 0 at the beginning of the input then it stores the whole input into a string before it is read into an int

1196029
octal	decimal	octal	hex
the i interprets the input as hex octal or decimal depending on its format just like you describe

1196043
apache	nginx
- it is a plugin for apache and nginx that lets you very easily run a ruby app as a virtual host

1196052
firefox	safari
firefox safari and most browser use the opacity property whilst ie uses filter alpha opacity

1196097
put	get
into the sql i get no results when the textbox is blank and ora-01722 invalid number as soon as i put characters in it

1196123
google-chrome	firefox
it runs in firefox and google-chrome but will require modifications to run in ie

1196179
superclass	subclassing
the class hierarchy is straightforward an abstract superclass that encapsulates common behaviors attributes and about half a dozen concrete subclassing that deal with field specific stuff

1196183
post	put
yes you simply put in the date that you want it to be while the post status is on draft press ok and then the publish button should turn into a schedule button

1196195
boost	allocator
regarding shared memory boost variant does not perform heap allocator so you can place it into shared memory just like an int assuming proper synchronisation of course

1196207
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
the runtimeexception s which may be thrown are either securityexception s if the jvm s securitymanager will not allow you to change a field s accessibility or illegalargumentexception s if you try and access the field on an object not of the field s class s type

1196209
internationalization	localization
the other approach i am thinking of is actually performing the whole internationalization process nslocale localization files etc and somewhat at the app startup skip the user s locale and set either language programmatically here i would only need to know is how to skip such default i18n process to set a specific language

1196234
put	get
along with that you might also get stuck with upgrade issues like if apache or iis or some subcomponent your application requires like openssl for example has some update come along to plug a security hole will you then opt not to disrupt your customer s production environment because they re most likely not going to be a victim of that hole or will you mandate that they upgrade or else you won t take responsibility for the consequences even though you whisper to yourself you put them in that situation in the first place

1196275
postgresql	mysql
if you need to do more complex geographical calculations you can investigate postgis for postgresql or mysql spatial extensions for mysql

1196284
post	get
so the question now is how would i get the co-ordinate of a non-active element i.e get the co-ordinates of an element by its id in a page - because as mentioned in my earlier post the code i try only returns me the co-ordinates of the top-left corner of the ie window

1196334
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this script was tested and works fine in ie6 7 8 firefox 2 3 google-chrome 2 3 and safari 2 3

1196433
rss	feed
just subscribe to the rss feed

1196543
uiview	subviews
you can use the touchesmoved withevent method of your container uiview and hit test each subviews aka key with something like

1196595
webclient	httpwebrequest
instead using webclient like kenney you can use httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse and process the result with a streamreader and xmldocument

1196642
for-loop	loops
if in the real code the enhanced for-loop is really worth it then you could add the items to a temporary collection and call removeall on the list after loops

1196656
sorting	grouping
i m looking to access all rows in a view as an array so i can apply some array sorting and grouping functions before display in a display output

1196663
int	chars
i don t know what you consider to be a int or chars valid values but you can try comparing the chars to for example ensure that

1196663
spaces	linefeed
another possible test would be to see if the character is a printable ascii character which also includes punctuation spaces and cr linefeed

1196750
addition	multiplication
and is boolean multiplication whereas or is boolean addition

1196758
post	get
now i ve already read the post regarding uinavigationcontroller and autorotation and i get the sneaking suspicion that i m going about this the wrong way and making it way more complicated than necessary

1196761
apache	nginx
then we front the tomcats with a load balancer like apache or nginx the later which i m favoring recently and use sticky sessions

1196799
post	put
1 method of getting the friends list to know what status post to show to a user is to run this query below and put the results into an array

1196840
min	max
apparently .net 4.0 has a sequence.range min max method

1196853
int	chars
if you want to preserve the base information hex oct dec you will need to store that information separately from the int value itself and it will require you to parse at least the first couple of chars of the input string sscanf strtol etc. won t preserve that information for you

1196885
folder	directory
i m trying to get only the directory of an folder

1196955
datagridview	radgridview
in the application i am working on i have a tableadapter and a radgridview telerik control - their version of the datagridview

1196977
g++	gcc
i suppose the gfortran uses the same back end of gcc and g++ but what of the intel compiler

1197052
webkit	gecko
if you still need to embed a browser you could use gecko mozilla s engine or webkit chrome s engine - i don t have any hands-on experience with them but probably they have more consistency between embedded and stand-alone versions

1197092
vmware	esx
i want to run this code so that the task is executed in another virtual image vmware esx

1197111
int	chars
i have an arduino application well actually a library that has a number of status flags in it - and originally i simply declared them as int well uint8_t so 8 bit unsigned chars in this case

1197130
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller created programaticaly that manages 4 subclasses of uiviewcontroller

1197159
viewdidload	viewwillappear
what you can do instead is create your own placeholder view controller that in its viewdidload or viewwillappear methods replaces itself in the tab bar controller with its actual view controller

1197189
min	max
set the min and max size to the same value

1197194
width	height
get rid of your height and width 100 requirements.

1197196
maven	pom.xml
i put the properties in my maven pom.xml

1197196
maven	pom.xml
so you can see how the log.filename property from the pom.xml is used due to maven s filtering

1197317
sorting	filtering
that would at least isolate you from the sorting filtering issues

1197321
range	minimum
for example if i have a range from a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 10 and an average of 7

1197321
range	minimum
lets say i need to generate a random number with a range of minimum of 4 and maximum of 10 and i want the majority of the numbers returned to center around the number 8 with a natural fall of based on a skewed bell curve

1197324
perl	tcl
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn

1197367
ant	maven
many more than you might think developers are not familiar with build tools such as ant or maven and when they are they only use limited features of those build tools

1197367
ant	maven
creating osgi bundles is best accomplished with eclipse ant tasks or maven bnd plugin vs a script or a manually written manifest for the jar archive

1197405
put	get	post	put	post	get
another positive point on rest is that you use the 4 http verbs get post put delete to manage url representative entities which makes - in my opinion - the code and operations clearer

1197486
folder	directory
the only difference between these two directory i see is that the name of my application in vs and folder is addfiletosql but name i gave this folder under c inetpub wwwroot was afs

1197530
instances	transient
i could serialize the session as a way to estimate how much stuff would be gc ed but that relies on the vendor implementing serializable and marking instances variables as transient appropriately

1197556
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in general you should put loading code that only needs to run once but may run multiple times into viewdidload code that needs to run every time a view is shown in viewwillappear or viewdidappear and code that can run even before the view loads or absolutely needs to only run once into initwithnibname bundle

1197562
hash	salt
i believe it is being salt as none of the hash on worked

1197575
google-chrome	firefox
it appears that the script loads into the dom but it is never executed at least in firefox and google-chrome

1197580
jtextpane	jeditorpane
i need to take text from a source as plain text and display it in a jtextpane or jeditorpane

1197610
lisp	scheme
unlike scheme emacs lisp is a 2-lisp which means that each symbol has two separate bindings the value binding and the function binding

1197627
folder	dir
personally i d likely create a folder structure that uses a users id as its base dir

1197632
put	get
i d like to put timers and set times so i for instance get a popup at 2pm saying don t forget... i know i could make my own notification bubble but i d prefer the wlm one

1197661
super	extends
however since your baseclass declares a constructor and therefore doesn t have the default no-arg constructor that the compiler would otherwise provide this is illegal - a class that extends baseclass can t call super

1197712
post	get
i can t answer but you can probably find an answer on our metastorm bpm forums or post the question there and you can get a quick response

1197724
short	base
i ve inherited a large project that already has a large markup base coupled with a short deadline so a complete rewrite is out of the question

1197729
post	get
httpservletrequest.getparameter string will include the get url parameters even if the http method is post

1197801
getter	setter
overall classes are used to keep things together that belong together keep things apart that should be apart namespacing enable easier consistency checks getter setter validating variables before changing them and more.

1197837
websphere	ibm	jboss	weblogic
also for client-server applications you have an abundance of choices for production-quality app servers that have the same j2ee interface ibm websphere bea weblogic jboss

1197838
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the trick is to make your view controller not be a subclass of uitabbarcontroller but rather uiviewcontroller and implement uitabbardelegate

1197838
uiview	subviews
i created the view for this in ib laying out the tab bar with the proper # of buttons images tags etc. and a placeholder uiview which is used to properly place the subviews that are swapped in and out

1197869
lwjgl	jogl
you are mixing libraries and levels of libraries jogl and lwjgl are both pretty thin wrappers around opengl iirc lwjgl has more wrappers for openal audio

1197875
int	boolean
in c# this would refer to bool boolean int int32 float single long int64

1197875
int	boolean
and in my opinion int16 int32 int64 boolean etc makes a heck of a lot more sense then short long int

1197890

at this point i m not sure what would be the cleanest way of transferring the settings on the child pop-up dialog to the rest of the application

1198215
pop-up	dialog
settings pop-up dialog to show pre-configured settings when it first appears when the user selected the menu option for the first time

i can get the echo to output but i dont get the id and for that no title or post this method is a copy of get_title stripping out everything but the protected part string

1198433

if you implement it yourself you should look into the metaphone or double metaphone algorithms i d recommend them over soundex which is not nearly as good at this type of task to store phoenetic representations of all your words

1198453
yacc	bison
if you don t want to include an external library you can parse your xml with flex bison lex yacc

1198532
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet and ibaction are trivial #defines

1198532
iboutlet	ibaction
so no the existence of the iboutlet ibaction property is not stored and cannot be accessed nor can you add your own properties

1198611
inherited	properties
you could create your own control that inherited from that control and create your own text properties that will fire an event when assigned a new value

1198621
children	parent
delete all children when deleting the parent

1198631
bonjour	avahi
better option would be to use a service discovery protocol like bonjour or avahi than rolling your own as they have solved a lot of problems already

everytime i release a new versioning for bug fixes or minor upgrade

1198671
versioning	upgrade
in the setup project properties i increment the versioning number and change the product code i always leave the same upgrade code

1198671
versioning	upgrade
i am wondering is it possible to get back the original upgrade that was used to install those versioning

1198709
getter	setter
the problem is that the custom class has public access for the properties and also it has getter setter methods

1198718
tstringlist	tlist
only use tlist or tstringlist if you need lots of size changing flexibility

1198767
mockups	balsamiq
i use balsamiq mockups and their site has a good collection of mockups you can look at

1198792
initializer	class-method
in plain c++ templated class-method are only initializer if they are actually used within the linkage scope

1198818

1198872
swt	swing
the problem is that jfx script can t be embedded into swing nor eclipse swt

1198934
public	protected
if you need or want to use inheritance for whatever reason at the very least make it private or protected inheritance so you don t inherit publicly from a class with a public non-virtual destructor

i ve given the fieldset a width and height so it haslayout hope this helps

1199184
post	get
this post could get stupidly long so i ll provide a link to the web page rather than post the html

1199195
required	placeholder
1 the way i think i would do this is to not put any content in the designer that required the scriptmanager and to put placeholder where such content needs to go

1199254
versioning	upgrade
in reality clickonce upgrade only leave the previous versioning behind and versioning before that are cleaned up

1199301
organization	naming
depending on the name of a person the naming scheme used by their organization and their domain name an address can easily exceed 20 characters

1199338
integer	radix
if the index is the integer where gang lookup is used you might look into radix trees

1199378
stdout	stderr
output to stderr or stdout don t count as tool

1199398
maven	pom.xml
to update the release version activate the release-profile in the maven super pom.xml when you do mvn deploy

1199428

my polygons are non-convex so i need to find the concave angle in the polygon

1199563
notepad	textpad
the solution open in notepad or textpad - save as.

1199597
post	put
unfortunately the http date header is only sent for put or post messages and even then it s optional

1199651
google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie firefox google-chrome

1199671
solaris	aix
if i ve got test a that executes on aix linux all and 32 bit windows test b that runs on windows 64 linux 64 and solaris and test c that runs on everything but hpux and test d that runs on everything.

1199793
post	get
when i use google chrome to make an ajax post request i get extra empty parameter _ on server-side

1199861
xetex	xelatex
you should probably use xetex xelatex as it has been created to support unicode

1199863
django	turbogears
look into the likes of turbogears or django

1199882
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i test the code in ie7 firefox google-chrome safari and this problem occurs in firefox only

1199892
children	parent
that is somefunc t1.id would be random but would always return the same result for a given value of t1.id keeping all the children with the correct parent

1199915
firefox	safari
by that i mean if firefox renders exactly in the same way on win mac linux and safari on.

1199951
filtering	grouping
i d split that up so that you don t have to use string operations on the game column and also put indexes on the new columns so you can filtering and grouping them properly

1200005
getter	setter
- second prefer to have something readable first inlined setter getter using bit masking internally would do the job be efficient and be readable

1200047
folder	directory
am trying to reload apache 2 via init.d apache2 reload command in terminal but i get a command not found error and when i look at the etc directory in finder i can t see any init.d folder

1200051
pop-up	dialog
i would look into using jquery ui dialog for the pop-up since you are already using jquery

1200078
restrict	shared
sometimes they are restrict due to historical unsupported reasons i m developing on windows using zend studio on a samba shared on a linux box and something in that mix means i keep reverting to cp1512 instead of utf8

1200078
hash	md5
sometimes you don t need to use utf-8 for example when storing a md5 hash in a database you only need the hexadecimal range 0-9 a-f why make it a utf-8 field which will take at least a byte extra storage instead of normal ascii

1200100
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
personally the teams of developers i ve worked with have never regretted switching from svn to git sorry stack overflow won t let me put in the link or bazaar

1200144
width	height
you should use control.getpreferredsize method to calculate width or height needed for control linklabel in your case

1200175
stdout	stderr
so all the log statements are correctly appended to the file but i am losing stdout and stderr

1200232
gif	png
in any case you probably should see better performance using png instead of gif

1200232
gif	png
png was designed as a modern replacement for gif and no graphical browser in use today has problems displaying pngs without an alpha channel

1200232
gif	png
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

1200312
submit	submission
for submission a form normally check out the submit method to at that site

1200321
stdout	stderr
you can reassing stdin stdout and stderr using java.lang.system class

1200340
int	boolean
all-in-all i m expecting there will be 50+ preferences of this type for each user the data being mostly boolean and int

1200347
submit	submission
i have also used the following to submit a form without actually submission it via ajax

1200383
kerberos	ntlm
for example if the fiddler trace shows that the attempt to authenticat is not using ntlm then its using a kerberos authentication check that the server and client have clocks set within 5 minutes of each other and the domain controller

1200402
ubuntu	debian
installing ubuntu or debian possibly in the server version can be done in a few minutes

1200419
setinterval	settimeout
javascript has timing sources settimeout setinterval that tick only when javascript is idle

1200477
free	malloc
if it is allocating memory with malloc then you should free it when you re done

1200496
free	malloc
if it malloc s dat just for you then you are indeed responsible for doing the free

1200516
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
bind the nstreecontroller s managedobjectcontext directly to the managedobjectcontext property of the appdelegate and remove the whole nsarraycontroller

1200516
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
nstreecontroller can add remove items from the managedobjectcontext but not from the nsarraycontroller s arrangedobjects as it is read-only

1200520
telerik	radcombobox
previously i had used telerik s radcombobox but i m not sure how to make this work in mvc or if it even can be made to work

1200532
int	boolean
i use at the moment int 2 to signal that the datatype is boolean because the program does not allow me to type boolean to the datatype -field

1200594
std	ostream
it will hide all other custom s defined for unrelated classes though again only inside the class and it s subclasses unless they can be found with adl or are members of std ostream already

1200696
set	bag
the where attribute on set or bag looks perfect for this

1200726
cpython	ironpython
i need to port some code that relies heavily on lxml from a cpython application to ironpython

1200726
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
lxml is very pythonic and i would like to keep using it under ironpython but it depends on libxslt and libxml2 which are c extensions

1200768
debian	centos
also i read somewhere that on some operating systems you can t store thousands and thousands of files in one single directory is this relevant to centos or debian

1200851
pop-up	dialog
then click on discover in the dialog that pop-up and you should be able to find your wcf service

1200871
spaces	delimiter
- this tells the processor to loop albeit only once and take out the first token that is returned default delimiter of spaces and tab apply from the running of the command in the parens and put it in the var a outside of a batch a single will do

1200899
ostream	istream
the standard defines it for all functions and operators dealing with istream or ostream

1200901
udp	tcp
isn t tcp the same thing as ordered reliable udp

1200913
uiview	subviews
first off uisearchbar is a uiview and the cancel button is also a view which is added into the search bar as a subviews just as you would expect

1200913
portrait	landscape
there only seems to be one -- this could change... you could be doubly careful and look for one that is in approximately the correct position differs in landscape and portrait

1200950
accessor	properties
so the properties accessor really should have get and set

1200950
getter	setter
updated my pseudo code to show setter as well as getter

1200959
udp	tcp
tcp is a stream-oriented protocol whereas udp is a message-oriented protocol

1200967
udp	tcp
that s why bit-torrent use udp for control messages and tcp for data sending

1200986
udp	tcp
there s much more of a difference between udp and tcp than just reliability and sequencing

1200986
udp	tcp
at the heart of the matter is the fact that udp is connectionless while tcp is connected

1200986
udp	tcp
tcp - udp comparative analysis

1201043
post	get
what this means is that anything placed in post or get or other similar locations is automatically escaped so that beginning programmers don t have to worry about it as much

1201084
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve done the exact thing with jquery and the image map area mouseenter mouseleave events but not with 70 areas

1201087
put	get
i really need it and i can t put it to work properly all i get is a striped funny coloured square on my original texture

1201202
client-side	server-side
i avoid viewstate client-side entirely by putting it server-side

1201260
pascal	delphi
consider the following delphi pascal code

1201287
many-to-one	one-to-many
the players on the match mapping would be references many-to-one referencing different playerids in the match table and the matches on player would be hasmany one-to-many

1201334
folder	directory
i typically will have a processing folder that way i can grant proper permissions just to that directory

1201337
memcpy	memmove
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions

1201343
memcpy	memmove
memmove can handle overlapping memory memcpy can t

1201352
goto	break
what you are actually doing is using break as a goto

1201371
implements	extends
if you are able to extends from the abstracttexteditor you might want to do so to avoid having to implements this yourself

1201503
instances	transient
it can be in an instances variable and a transient one at that if your logger is not serializable

1201638
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the following example was tested and works in both firefox and ie and i would assume to work in google-chrome safari and opera as well

1201679
memcpy	memmove
memcpy will need approximately twice the amount of memory to perform the same task but memmove could take significantly longer than memcpy

1201679
memcpy	memmove
of course creating a new pointer to point at the 2nd item in your list will achieve the same effect of dropping the first item from your list but the example shows the differences in memcpy and memmove well

1201679
memcpy	memmove
yes the implementations of memcpy and memmove probably don t differ in memory usage i really don t know but how you use them will greatly effect the memory usage of your program

1201679
memcpy	memmove
that is what i meant by practical differences of memcpy and memmove

1201685
hash	salt
i have a database of hash passwords that had no salt added before they were hash

1201711
hash	salt
just add a salt to the existing hash and hash it again

1201712
hash	salt
you could add a column consisting of a flag showing whether the user has an old no salt or a new with salt hash

1201714
hash	salt
as a quick fix you could create a salt column in the database and when a user logs in correctly matching the old hash you can then use that password that they entered with a salt and create a new hash

1201721
hash	salt
of course the best way would be to migrate to a salt hash table

1201732
hash	salt
whenever a new salt hash is added set the salt field to true

1201737
pop-up	dialog
one thing i ve found is that 90 of users will never read anything in your pop-up dialog

1201737
pop-up	dialog
if they click a button in your app labeled do foobar and you pop-up a dialog i guarantee you will get many support calls from people saying why did foobar remove all my baz

1201745
getter	setter
2 if your bean is just a value object with nothing much more than getter setter equals hashcode then consider using an aop framework i like spring to wrap the object with advices used to implement property change events support

1201753
ilist	icollection
it could or could not be generic such as ilist or just arraylist thus why i am looking for icollection or icollection

1201777
hash	salt
if you are storing the salt inside the hash it should be fairly straight forward to determine if a salt is included by checking the length of the hash

1201777
hash	salt
if there isn t a salt just hash the password if there is a salt hash the password + salt

1201803
pop-up	dialog
modal dialog to be implemented using divs and css see yui have all the benefits of presenting an interface that users recognize from desktop applications and won t run afoul of pop-up blockers

1201828
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
thrift has generators for delphi c++ c# erlang haskell java objective c cocoa ocaml perl php python ruby and squeakr

1201925
int	chars
a is an int in c a chars in c++

1201979
put	get
i checked my code outside of the notebook and the event handling works but when i put my widget in the notebook the event handler doesn t seem to get invoked when the event happens

1202062
portrait	landscape
i have an application that rotates between landscape and portrait mode which works great

1202073
twitter	myspace
i want to make an app that gets your friends profile pics from say your facebook myspace or twitter account and makes an image out all of them

1202100
disk	ram
the bulk of my ram tends to be 8-10gb java heaps that i never want paged to disk ever and the cruft that is available are processes like mingetty but even there the glibc pages in those apps are shared by other apps and actually used so even the rss size of those useless processes are mostly shared used pages

1202101
getter	setter
you can still write setter and getter where they are needed to interact with other code but in an app like you are talking about most of the fields are pure data that is never specifically manipulated most code accessing fields is general copy and paste not really specific to any field

1202117
width	height
i don t love this solution it requires a separate page and extra code to determine the optimal height width of the iframe .

1202121
versioning	upgrade
as you upgrade to new versioning of .net you need only modify the msbuildpath property

1202121
spaces	delimiter
line is used for parameters that need to be delimiter due to spaces

1202182
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
the qmodelindex parent passed is not valid and m qabstractitemmodel is null

1202202
gif	png
in the thickbox module the main .js file thickbox.js does not account for image urls created in drupal via image view 2321 preview instead of image.jpg or gif or png

1202202
gif	png
if thickbox.js does not see the file name itself gif jpg png jpeg in the link anchor tag the a href ... tag it will treat the image like another mime type that is not an image

1202202
shadowbox	lightbox
this causes thickbox to spit out god-awful garbage on top of your page instead of a cool shadowbox lightbox effect

1202220
width	height
the container div has a fixed width but no fixed height

1202238
nstimer	nsrunloop
the nstimer actually just periodically fire events into the enclosing nsrunloop which each thread has or should have

1202238
nstimer	nsrunloop
so if you have a child or background process running in a different thread the nstimer will fire against that thread s nsrunloop instead of the application s main nsrunloop

1202238
nstimer	nsrunloop
accessing the main application s run loop is done with nsrunloop mainrunloop so regardless of which thread you re in doing nsrunloop mainrunloop addtimer nstimer timerwithtimeinterval 20.0 target self selector selector timerfired userinfo nil repeats no formode nsdefaultrunloopmode will always schedule the timer against the main runloop

1202285
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

1202296
imagemagick	im4java
if having imagemagick installed on your maschine is an option i recommend im4java

1202307
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
in both cases the trick to getting it working in ie opera safari and google-chrome is to replace the on the page

1202315
hash	md5
you can split your cache dir effectively by getting the md5 hash of the filename taking the first 1 2 or 3 characters of it and use it as a directory

1202319
hide	show
when you add a web reference to the paypal web service visual studio will create a file in a sub-folder of web references called reference.cs which is the proxy class by default vs 2008 hide it -- you have to show all files to see it

1202357
tcpclient	networkstream
looks like you get the networkstream from the tcpclient using getstream then call the read method on it

1202398
ubuntu	debian
look on one of the debian or ubuntu admin forums -- things like fai et al have long used preseeding for debconf questions

1202399
vbscript	vba
in vbscript the code looks like this adjust as necessary if you re using vba vb.net or another language

1202400
folder	directory
however i am not being able to browse the files in the test folder it s showing a directory listing denied message

1202412
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
in my testing it seems that using the selectedviewcontroller method of uitabbarcontroller to set the current view does not update the selectedindex property the new view is displayed but the selected uitabbaritem is not changed

1202439
iboutlet	ibaction
yes iboutlet and ibaction are just thrown away by the parser at the precompilation stage so there s nothing in the compiled output

1202439
typedef	struct
you d be better off creating your own class or struct typedef to hold the additional information you want

1202479
children	parent
you could have groups with a parent group and a list of children groups and each group containing a list of members or something similar

1202486
profiling	debugging
the use of java 1.4 is a minor issue here since 1.4 s debugging interface is not great but some profiling still support it

1202527
post	get
you can t get a new window with a post and a user can turn cookies off

1202539
junit	easymock
that s likely to be my fault as i m quite new to erlang and quite addicted to junit easymock and java interfaces.

1202603
x86	64bit
also note that x86 dlls cannot be loaded on 64bit process

1202603
x86	64bit
if x64 version of the dlls cannot be obtained the alternative is to run x86 dlls on a 32-bit wow64 process and do interprocess communication ipc back with the 64bit process

1202623
post	get
however if i make the simple change from method get to method post on the form

1202683
debian	linux
you can check the source of linux file command git git.debian.net git debian file.git

1202708
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox opera and google-chrome use these

1202758
cakephp	qcubed
i d recommend you take a look at an existing mvc framework - i use qcubed there are others - symfony zend cakephp

1202770
put	get
if you need a finite degree of precision ie two decimal places for fields that represent money store it as an integer anyway but multiply it by whatever factor of 10 you need to get rid of the decimal when you put it into the database and divide by the same when you pull it back out

1202806
margin	height
notice in the body i am setting the height to 100 as well as the padding to 0 and the margin to 0

1202828
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux	openbsd	solaris	openbsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd
but it depends on what you mean by portable it supports archtectures x86 and ppc oses linux freebsd openbsd solaris and macosx but .

1202830
typename	auto
2 yes a concept with typename members can be auto

the radiobuttonlist and checkboxlist controls end up throwing a nullreferenceexception during rendercontrolinternal obviously not my contribution

1202857
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
ie firefox google-chrome safari at least don t know about others directly will modify this to be

1203019
tiff	png
if a tiff is anything like a png the stream does indeed need to be seekable

1203042
min	max
sure i could just force it to zero in the code if that ever happens but i d rather use a better method like using a udouble unsigned double which doesn t exist in silverlight or even setting the min max values somewhere in the dependencyproperty

1203047
division	multiplication
here is a routine that does a bcd on a 32 bit number and doesn t require division or multiplication

1203090
hide	show
i have it setup to show hide the uiscrollview if the user touches the small images

1203093
gif	png
so for example if i have a gray navigation bar i d render a 256px by 1px in this case solid gray png or gif i suppose and set that to be my body background with the repeat-y css parameter set for the body background

is there any way to execute terminate method on all the threads even if the thread is busy in my case busy means it s waiting for the data where the timeout set is about 30 sec .

1203193
hide	show
i do have code that show hide the image

1203219
terminate	timeout
introduce polling select or equivalent with a timeout or other kind of interruption so_rcvtimeo so_sndtimeo in what would otherwise be long-running blocking routines monitoring the terminate property

1203239

you ll note that the left margin is negative half the width and the top margin is negative half the height

1203290
stdout	stderr
if stdout or stderr is piped to something other than a terminal i would like to suppress this step

1203291
post	get
i read many blog but none of them explain me who to post data and get response

1203378
copying	overwrite
you see when you say passing data to the other program you might be a tricking the other process into copying what you put in front of it b tricking the other program into letting you overwrite its normally private memory or c some other approach

1203389
dictionary	map
instead of operations that would change a dictionary maps provide operations which return a new map which is the result of whatever change was requested

1203389
dictionary	map
that said the immutable aspect of the map may allow you to use it in situations where the dictionary would instead require more complex locking or to write more elegant code with fewer side effects and thus it remains a useful alternative

1203457
apache	nginx
most of the other solutions for it involve running something like apache or nginx just to rewrite urls for couchdb

1203504

1203709
postgresql	mysql
but i plan to support at least mysql and postgresql down the road

1203823
pop-up	dialog
i tried making a dialog using jquery it works but i have no succes at doing it onclick bacuse it should not just pop-up but only when you click on it

1203904

i think the problem could be related to the separate directory structure--i usually deploy all list files to the same folder schema.xml and weekcalendar.xml in your case

1203957

darn didn t get first post -

1203979

1204133
post	put
i can navigate my way through the recordsets returned from my database connection as of now i m doing two sql searches one for post and another for comments giving me two recordsets but i don t know what sort of data structure i should put those results into in order to eventually export them into the xml file

1204133

1204155
cos	sin
for example a sin or cos function

1204200
min	max
given min max amount

1204268
disk	ram
each one needs -xms 512m -xmx 1024m as jvm args to run well and that means you will swap to disk way too much if you only have 2gb of ram or less

1204311
firefox	safari
the webkit developers have started adding various -webkit-transform options in their nightly builds of safari and taking their cue firefox 3.5 just added some -moz-transform properties

1204311
width	height
just for fun i just tested out -moz-transform scale 0.5 on the stack overflow logo and it did work in ff3.5 but the scaling algorithm used is the same as if you had forced the content to a specific width and height using html properties or css

1204359
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
i want to create subclassing b that inherited from superclass a

1204366

1204433
put	get	post	put	post	get
or you can just search for c# http put get post request

pbkdf2	salt
you can specify the password salt iv and plaintext as well as the number of rfc2898 iterations to use in the pbkdf2

1204436
packets	multicast
the argument for method #2 would be that the point of multicast is so that one host can send a packets and it can be received by many clients one-to-many so it s meant to be the reverse of #1

1204447
post	get
there are however a couple of tricks to get this to work correctly i outlined these in a post a few months ago resuing types in silverlight service references

1204457
hide	show
you can clearly see it when you use show hide function in jquery with semi-transparent png file

1204459
packets	multicast
for example you may be depending that all routers and vpn software and wans and nats and whatever other things people connect networks together with can actually handle the multicast beacon packets

1204503

1204758
getter	setter
in particular if you re invoking methods or property getter setter and can do so in a type-safe way as far as the calling code is concerned it can make a huge difference if you convert the methodinfo into a strongly-typed delegate once and then reuse that

1204762
vb6	vba
most of it applies to vb6 as well as vba

1204772
ssl	https

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
even if ie holds the majority of the market develop for a standard compliant browser such as firefox or webkit google-chrome and safari using an xhtml doctype then fix the discrepancies on ie at a later stage

1204794
webkit	gecko
that way you will achieve the maximum compatibility with little or no efforts if it works in the gecko or webkit engine you are pretty close to being guaranteed that it will work for most browsers except ie but in most cases you ll be very close to perfect

1204808
debian	linux
a similar question has already been asked for the .net platform but i am on debian linux

i want to write a software to allow the parent to set a limit to their children phone calls

1204953
nunit	mstest
both nunit and mstest probably the other ones as well have a collectionassert class

1204968
client-side	server-side
my guess is that server-side implementation may turn out to be more flexible and more powerful than client-side as i can add functionality to the server easily as long as the client understands it

1205007
min	max
in your case if sub query resulted values is same simply use max or min function to let db select a value

versioning	upgrade
it allows the settings to be upgrade from a previous versioning using the following call

1205139
automake	autotools
it is very difficult to craft a portable makefile which is why the c++ community shifted from hand-crafted makefiles to using the gnu autotools automake autoconf autoheader autoreconf libtool etc. .however the extreme complexity of the gnu autotools left much to be desired resulting in the creation of cmake which is quickly becoming the build tool of choice for the c c++ community

google-chrome	safari
i have tested this in all modern browsers ff3+ opera9+ google-chrome safari 3+ and ie6 7 8

1205512
int	double
you re using int int which does everything in int arithmetic even if you re assigning to a decimal double float variable

1205527
int	double
you need to force a floating point operation double double instead of an int int

1205542
int	boolean
it s possible that some confusion has been caused by the true and false definitions in win32 which are not of bool type but int and which may trigger warnings when used in boolean statements

1205542
int	boolean
mainly anything non-zero is true but if you want to make sure that true is always one when using int instead of boolean you sometimes see shenanigans like this

1205557

after looking at it with filemon and tcpview from sysinternals we found out that if a ntfs fat was shared the smb client and server were transferring i o in 60k blocks while while sharing our filesystems it used 4k blocks

1206047
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
the problem is that we cannot figure out what in our filesystems causes the windows share server srv.sys to choose core mode 4k for our filesystems and raw mode 60k for ntfs and fat

1206049
teamcity	nant
we happen to control all this through teamcity but we can trigger the nant scripts manually too

post	get
to get a post from a browser you need either javascript wizardy or a plain old form with method post -- i ll assume the latter for simplicity

1210696
put	get	post	put	post	get
if you want to avoid rich frameworks you ll have to implement by hand templates for your html forms direct them via some kind of url dispatching in app.yaml to a handler of yours implementing with a def post self get the data from the request validate it form the new object put it display some acknowledgment page

1210696
post	get
if the newtopic url is served by a static form the handler for the post action of that form could get back to that via the referer header a notorious but unfixable mis-spelling but that s a bit clunky and fragile

1210696
post	put
put theid in the context with which you render that template and it will be in the request that the def post of the action receiving the form finally gets

1210823
uilabel	uibutton
although uilabel and uibutton can do it sometimes you want to draw it yourself.

1210835
nginx	lighttpd
if you need to scale it s easier and you can always have a lighttpd or a nginx http servers dedicated to images or simply put it out on other server to balance bandwidth

1210846
put	get
put the data in a temporary table and read the properties of the temporary table and from that you can get the list of column names

1210897
stretchblt	bitblt
in my desktop video game products i have my own stretchblt code which stretches the bits in a memory buffer and then calls bitblt to copy them to the display and that is considerably faster than simply calling stretchblt

1210937
intersect	contains
volumes intersect or contains one

1210937
intersect	contains

1210954
firefox	safari
firefox safari camino all work as intended

1211006

1211331
width	height
i have a table based layout which is 100 height width with no scrollbars

1211341
getter	setter
primarily this is because the object especially if it is subclassed is only partially set up during both of these methods and so calling setter getter may result in incorrect behavior if they have anything other than trivial actions

1211401
coalesce	isnull
also see coalesce vs isnull

1211403
getter	setter
remember that you should not use setter getter in init dealloc so you need to do your direct ivar access and careful memory management iin those methods

python believes that some such systems are freebsd openbsd netbsd osx and vms

1212849
min	max
one work around is to set the field to the min or max value of the type and check for this value wherever needed and do the appropriate conversions

yacc	bison
your yacc bison input file may contain token declarations like

1213176
yacc	bison
running this file through yacc bison will result in a tokens.h file that contains preprocessor definitions for these tokens

1213223
mouse	keyboard
it has a property i define called currentinputtype which is of type mycontrolsnamespace.supportedinputtypes with values keyboard mouse touchpad virtualkey

1213235
yacc	bison
probably tokens.h is a file generated by the parser generator yacc bison containing token definitions so you can return tokens from the lexer to the parser

1213235
yacc	bison
with lex flex and yacc bison it works like this

1213273
int	chars
the type of c should be int so that you can properly distinguish eof from a valid chars read correctly

1213476
post	get
looking at the http protocol post or get should be equally easy and fast to parse

1213476
post	get
from my point of view performance should not be considered when comparing get and post

1213484
stateless	stateful
the problem you have is really based on http being stateless but the service you are connecting to being stateful

1213511
post	get
just bear in mind that the proper way to speak http is to use get only for actions and post for data

1213515
post	get
there are several misconceptions about get and post in http

1213515
post	get
there is one primary difference get must be idempotent while post does not have to be

1213515
post	get
if i did this with a post and hit refresh in the browser the browser warns me if i do it with a get the browser will simply send the request

1213515
post	get
on the server get vs post is pure convention it s up to me as a developer to ensure that i code the post on the server to not repeat the call

1213515
post	get
to actually answer the question if i use get or post to perform the same task there is no performance difference

1213516

1213763
erlang	lisp
i think he did at least three different implementations lisp erlang haskell

1213770
int	chars
the result will be an array of chars rather than an array of int as you appear to be looking for in your example but you could cast the chars to int as you used them or depending on what you re trying to do with it chars could be fine

1213771
post	put
assuming that i m reading your post correctly and you re not trying to access the controller action names in the view but instead trying to do something with them and put the result into the viewdata

1213785
sorting	filtering
the data access repository will return the orders query then an intermediate filtering in the request processing pipeline will decorate this query with a filtering then it gets passed on to a display module that adds sorting and pagination etc

1213796

it s a good idea to upgrade to a newer versioning

1213837
telerik	radcombobox
there are some tools such as telerik radcombobox that will allow you to do such things

sorting	filtering
in brief i can t figure out how to filtering on multiple properties while sorting on another

1213959
sorting	filtering
let s also assume that i would like to filtering the entire collection using those properties and then sorting the results by one of

1213966

one of the easiest ways to get related post would be to compare the tags present on that post granted your post have tags

1214032
versioning	upgrade
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning

1214036
unsigned	short
note that wchar_t is defined as unsigned short - so it s just missing the define there - not an actual bug of conversion as said above

1214037
int	chars
the developer made assumptions about chars and int types that don t hold when you compile in unicode

1214066
cvs	svn
with git you can have a single public repository the authoritative version of the code managed in any number of ways - for example if all of the developers can push to it it gains everything you want about a centralized vcs except with all the added benefits of git and none of the inadequacies of cvs svn

1214076
getter	setter
use setter and getter or maybe a centralized config like

1214097

1214210
hide	show
when you hide a child form and show it again the mdi container probably considers that it s a new child form and it places accordingly.

1214210
hide	show
i think you need to save the location of the child form before you hide it so that you can restore it when you show it again

1214267
jsf	seam
i use jsf seam and have used seam s built-in authentication and authorization and find it extremely easy to use

1214267
jsf	seam
seam is just a layer on top of jsf so technically you would still be running on jsf

1214267

or better yet post that problem on stackoverflow and get a lot more brains on it

1214388
vsto	add-in
unfortunately f# doesn t have the ui-designers for creating vsto add-in like c# so the simplest way to do office interop is to use the com apis

1214404
int	chars
likewise we can ensure at compile-time that a template function only gets called on types which fulfill certain criteria say they must be random-access iterators while bilinear ones aren t allowed or they must be pod types or they must not be any kind of int type chars short int long but all other types should be legal

1214427
listview	gridview
if you can accept having the names in each row rather than each column you should use the listview with a gridview view property and a custom celltemplate that is just a bound textbox

1214865
hide	show
then when you start loading your data hide the table show the activity viewer and label start the activity viewer animating and start loading your data in a background thread

1214865
hide	show
once the thread finishes hide the activity viewer and label and show your table again

1214878
vsto	add-in
i would also take a look at this so post if you want to use clickonce creating a clickonce setup for vsto outlook add-in

1214921
int	boolean
for example it automatically sorts int so that 100 comes after 3 datetimes boolean and everything else sorts correctly too

1214980
int	chars
this will convert 1 hex chars to its int value but needs to construct a sub string

1215005

typedef	typename
the question isn t really about typedef but typename

1215092
typedef	typename
in your typedef example you still have the typename in the typedef declaration but once the typedef is declared that is not a dependent name

1215092
typedef	typename
it s just a type so the typename isn t necessary when referring to the typedef

jar	war
the .tag files are in a jar file which is included as in the lib directory of my war file

1215148
getter	setter
an alternative to using a factory could be to make a subclass of xmlrpcclient that has a matching getter and setter for xmlrpcclientconfig setclientconfig getclientconfig

pascal	delphi
martin waldenburg wrote a pascal version of lex yacc named paslex which has been kicking around for way over a decade now and has been converted to delphi although it might not work with the latest versions without some minor work

1215164
pascal	delphi
paslex was a delphi grammar implementation...tply was the lex yacc tool which generated pascal source from a .l file

1215236
put	get
the book says that since - and are not commutative operators the order in which the 2 pop functions are evaluated is necessary obviously to get the correct result ...and thus you have to put the result of the first function in a variable first and then proceed with the arithmetic like such

1215239
put	get
besides drawing it urself on the screen you can maybe have an image of the outline and put 2 image views on top of each other to get the picture with it s outline

1215345
getter	setter
i am not overloading the getter or setter for context in the model

1215365
memcached	apc
install apc or memcached d or here memcached also needs a memcached server to be installed see here then use the appropriate increment commands for bad login attempts from an ip address with a timeout of whatever suites you 5 minutes 30 minutes etc...

this only works in modern browsers google-chrome firefox 4+ ie9+ but in ecmascript 5 you can get all the properties of an object with object.getownpropertynames

1215407
inherited	properties
it just takes a little extra code to get the inherited properties from the prototype

1215416
objectdatasource	formview
i have an asp.net 3.5 page that contains a formview control bound to a business object using an objectdatasource

1215420
getter	setter
if no argument the method is used as getter else as setter

1215420
getter	setter
for simple getter setter

1215420
getter	setter
so i d like to narrow it down to classes objects with a couple of explicit getter setter

1215429
getter	setter
sure you could do that if it makes sense in your application otherwise i would just use the standard getter setter which have already been set up for you

srp addresses one of the two principles oftem mentioned together cohesion and coupling

1215522
hide	show
i wonder if there is a way to hide some document library lists that are show when the user navigates to the all site content page in sharepoint and i wonder if there is a programmatic way to achieve this

1215540
implements	extends
it could be argued that the second extends x implements y is verbose but the extra few chars are a good reminder

1215540
implements	extends
take a look at arraylist etc i m pretty sure they use the long form - extends abstrsvtlist implements list

1215570

1215698
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
the viewmodel is connected to the view using data-binding and it has to either implement inotifypropertychanged and or inotifycollectionchanged or expose its data using dependency properties

1215726
ubuntu	linux
given that standard ubuntu linux is not a real-time os in the narrow sense all alternative algorithms would run in the same setup --- and you can then compare your distributions using anything from summary statistics to quantiles to qqplots

1215772
inherited	properties
i have a class that inherited activerecordvalidationbase that contains the following properties

1215807
allocator	stl
in many cases the speedup or capabilities you can get by providing custom allocator for a single point-of-use of an stl data structure far exceeds the general speedup you can get from the global overloads

1215868
put	get
so if you put option2 then you get a constant value for the first two options

1215901

1215977
getter	setter
if you want to use a getter or setter you need to use self.editingviewcontroller or equivalently

1215977
getter	setter
note that apple reserves the _ prefix and that setter and getter should not be used in the init dealloc routines

1216039
punctuation	words
for matching and # tags i d suggest using the w metapattern matches words characters - so it ll match digits and letters but not whitespace punctuation

1216084
multiplying	add
a better method would be to take the difference between the start timestamp and the current timestamp divide that by the frequency round the resulting multiplier up to the nearest integer multiplying by the frequency again and add that to the start timestamp once more

1216105
tex	sweave
sweave allows to mix all the functionality of r with tex

1216105
tex	sweave
then you compile the sweave file from the commandline which returns a plain tex file

1216144
implements	extends
but it d be great to implements your projects with the area feature in mind so that you could extends your existing solution much easier later on if needed

1216225

1216248
client-side	server-side
client-side validation is great to help novice users but you shouldn t trust it since it can be bypassed - server-side validation is a must to actually enforce proper values

1216248
client-side	server-side
a quick googling for php form validation turned up this example of the differences between client-side and server-side validation

1216274

opera	firefox
i d say it s a rendering bug in firefox as it s fine in opera

1216350
post	get
there s a lot of duplicated post but it seems to suggest that you need to set the enablevisualstyles property on the form to get alpha transparency to work

1216379
put	get	memcached	apc
it would be best to put list of random numbers in memory apc or memcached google stackoverflow search for apc or memcached to get the best performance because disc io is what will make your site slow most of the time

1216379
memcached	apc
for this you should have a box with enough memory 128mb and you can install software apc memcached

1216379
put	get
if you are on a shared hosting provider but then you won t get best performance then it would be best to put the words in an array in the same file because every require statement will fetch the file from disc

1216397
zipoutputstream	zipfile
a zipoutputstream in java allows you to write to files in a zip archive without having to worry about the internals of the zipfile format

1216397

ostream	istream
in c++ here is the istream input stream ostream output stream and iostream bidirectional stream documentation

1216402
printf	strlen
the functions returns an int it is the case for printf but the validity is implementation dependent for strlen which returns a size_t which can be int or something else

1216402
printf	strlen
the function isn t variadic it is the case for strlen but not printf

1216409
pop-up	dialog
ps to set the user to run a step under you need to use the advanced page on the job step property dialog and select the user from a pop-up window

1216430

1216433
gif	png
i am creating a script that can put a 24-bit transparent png image as a water mark on jpg gif png images

1216439
gif	png
in order to combine another image your watermark with the gif image whatever image library you re using i m guessing gd is probably converting the png to an indexed-color format which is stripping out the alpha channel when it does so

1216451
dictionary	map
dictionary are specifically designed to map key-value pairs and will give you much better performance for lookups than a list would

1216472
int	boolean
in the above example the mymethod int method can be thought of as a convenience method for mymethod int boolean as it provides a default argument for one of its parameters

1216477
free	malloc
remember if you allocate memory using malloc method you always must to free this memory using free method

1216515
children	parent
when the children finish they return an answer to the parent via a socket and exit

1216653
int	boolean
i m only using a single string and a bunch of int numbers and boolean with some references to more of the same in globally available xml data

1216654

to put it in more concrete terms i started out with add an object to the screen remove an object from the screen type messages and i m now tending more towards display this list of objects and i ll let you figure out the most efficient way to get from the current display to what i now want you to display

1216662
client-side	server-side
if you are searching for a library to facilitate ajax requests it is not dependant of the server-side launching ajax requests is done on the client-side in javascript

1216677

wordpress	joomla
i m currently looking at wordpress drupal and joomla

1216823
wordpress	joomla
when using and developing wordpress drupal and or joomla

1216854
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you have heard the terms one-to-one or one-to-many and many-to-many one-to- relationships are identifying relationships and many-to-many relationships are non-identifying relationships

1216857
komodo	aptana
my experience has been that netbeans aptana and komodo are fast on computers where eclipse is painfully slow

1216872
django	turbogears
django and turbogears are the prominent python representatives of this ruby on rails probably the biggest name currently

1216890
wordpress	joomla
and have been a user of wordpress but joomla

1216910
width	height
i set width and height to 100 to be able to get the resizeevent and being able to adjust the layout if the user changes the window size

1216926
stdout	stderr
the 2 is stderr and 1 is stdout

1216926
stdout	stderr
when you run a program you ll get the normal output in stdout but any errors or warnings usually go to stderr

1216926
stdout	stderr
if you want to pipe all output to a file for example it s useful to first combine stderr with stdout with

1216935
stdout	stderr
like cma said it puts stderr on stdout

1216945
stdout	stderr
technically speaking it duplicates or copies stderr onto stdout

1216945
stdout	stderr
will work because it directs both stdout and stderr to the file mydirlist whereas the command

1216945
stdout	stderr
directs only stdout and not stderr to file mydirlist because stderr was made a copy of stdout before stdout was redirected to mydirlist

1216945
stdout	stderr
so read the second one as saying copy stderr onto stdout before it says send stdout to mydirlist

1216945
stdout	stderr
then read the first one as saying send stdout to the file mydirlist before it says duplicate stderr onto that stdout i ve set up

1216950
wordpress	joomla
i haven t used joomla much and have never really needed to tweak wordpress outside the design but have used drupal quite extensively

1216957
getter	setter
avoid getter returning a different value than the one accepted by the setter

1216965
getter	setter
an automatic property is still exposed as a public getter and setter whereas a public field is just that - a single field

1216965
getter	setter
thus implementing an auto property allows you at some later date to change the internal behavior of either the getter or setter like adding a validator without recompiling or re coding any dependant classes that use it.

1216971
getter	setter
if you later on decide you need to add code to the getter or setter you can do that without having to force every other assembly linked to it to recompile

1217011
implements	extends
extends is achieved by public inheritance and implements is also achieved by public inheritance

1217016
testdriven.net	xunit.net	mouse	keyboard
i m not sure how testdriven.net supports xunit.net but with nunit you can run a single test a class its tests or all test with a click of the mouse or keyboard shortcut

1217016
nunit	mstest
i did use nunit and still want to give xunit a test drive but for work i mostly use mstest what comes with visual studio

the first parameter to realloc must be a pointer that was previously returned by malloc calloc or realloc and not subsequently free d

1217101
ant	maven
both ant and maven have plugins to do this for you when you build your jar

1217108
jobs	cron
don t let task queues make you forget that cron is also there a good architecture for batch-like processing will generally use both cron jobs and queued tasks to simplify its overall design

1217125
jar	war	folder	directory
if you re deploying a war file you need to extract it to that directory from within that html folder run jar xvf solr.war or whatever it s called

1217136
rss	feed
also if you re doing some sort of ajaxy stuff then there are better ways of getting the data to the script in the browser than just handing off a full rss feed

1217136
rss	feed
having said all that there are ways to parse rss and similar xml feed on the client side

1217145
put	get
i am about to put a website online and would like to get a good description of my site indexed

1217163
nsis	uninstaller
adding requestexecutionlevel user or admin to the nsis script should get rid of the vista warning programs that are detected as installers will show this warning if no uninstaller entry is added to the registry and the exe does not have a vista manifest

1217168
codeigniter	cakephp
typo3 flow3 imho really the most funky php framework something based on symfony can t find anything but this should be a good start mambo cakephp or maybe something based on codeigniter .

1217183
free	malloc
what you are writing is not c++ but c code that uses new instead of malloc and delete instead of free

1217184
vim	emacs
available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platforms too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be installed separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systems

1217191
vb6	vba
set a reference on the tools menu in vba project in vb6 to the excel object library can t remember the exact name but it ll start with microsoft and have excel somewhere in the name

1217263
nfa	dfa
i further assume that you are doing this by the usual method of first constructing an nfa and converting it by subset construction to dfa since i m not aware of any other way of accomplishing this

1217263
nfa	dfa
in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that

1217263
nfa	dfa
if you are sticking to thompson nfa or dfa implementations then there s not really any notion of greedy or non-greedy matching

1217289
autocomplete	autosuggest
none-the-less if autocomplete and autosuggest are what you are looking for with php u will love phpedit or phpdesigner once you create a new project and point to the source folder you are ready to start working

inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
i m not sure about this but perhaps the itemscontrol is listening for events from ibindinglist or inotifycollectionchanged and not inotifypropertychanged

1217606
dictionary	map
map - dictionary not even quite sure about this one

1217641
dictionary	map
you re right about map dictionary

1217641
public	protected
public private protected the default are for instance variables only not methods and work like c++ s visibility modifiers you declare them as section headers rather than before each variable

1217648
accessor	properties
instance variables are usually accessed through properties instead of explicit get set accessor

1217682
width	height
blockviewdelegate is where i am storing width height and image information it is the controller for this uiview

1217689
min	max
if two corners of that rectangle are x1 y1 and x2 y2 then you simply test given a point x3 y3 that min x1 x2 x3 max x1 x2 and min y1 y2 y3 max y1 y3

1217689
min	max
we find the min and max x to find the left and right bounding sides and the min and and max y to find the bottom and top bounds

1217715

all the 670+ properties in the system are accesible using simple properties accessor

1217804
post	get
it handles get and post requests and reads query string parameters

1217812
profiling	instrumentation
the way this is measured is by either instrumentation or sampling within a profiling

1217872
versioning	upgrade
in this case because sql dialects differ you want to run the possibly generated sql against the correct versioning of your rdbms rather than attempting to mock all quirks of your rdbms and so that any rdbms upgrade that change functionality are caught by your tests

1217910
post	put
but remember that this is like print in python what the user type into the quotes is what have to be printed to all remember that the user can choose what put into the quotes then don t put something like a simple cout post something that reads what is inside the quotes and print it to all

1217943
ubuntu	linux
i think that on my ubuntu linux machine the files are stored at usr include

1217966

if you will create an rss feed for each user that you will be able to use flog blog - facebook rss service

1217998
for-loop	arrays
you won t necessarily know how many items you have in the value arrays at the end so you might want to put the printing into a for-loop rather than assume you have a fifth item

1218011
sdl	pyopengl
unfortunately v-sync can be handled in many places including sdl pyopengl your display server and your video drivers

1218108
hash	md5
i m not sure what techniques are commonly used but any information that isn t stored and only compared username and password could possibly be hash for example sha1 or md5 on the client

1218150
post	get
i only know how to get post values via named elements such as

1218168
subtraction	addition
the above example was silly one but this is how addition and subtraction is done in general

1218174
realloc	malloc
the number is to be represented in a buffer array able to take on an arbitrary size which means using malloc and realloc as needed

1218182
submit	submission
since the connect is not protecteded it can be easily tampered with perhaps by making it submit to a non-https page or perhaps submission to an altogether different domain which you will never know until it is too late

1218185
subtraction	addition
you do that by giving each number three int s and using the same rules you should have learned back in primary school for addition subtraction and the other basic operations

1218185
subtraction	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	multiplication
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

1218185
multiplying	add
multiplying a 12-digit number by a 3 digit number will never generate more than 15 digits add the digit counts

1218185
subtraction	addition	subtract	addition
3 addition of a positive and negative number is subtraction and subtract a negative number is the same as adding the equivalent positive

1218185
subtract	add
you can save quite a bit of code by having the add and subtract methods call each other after adjusting signs

1218185
subtraction	addition
for addition if signs are different use subtraction of the negation

1218185
subtraction	addition
for subtraction if signs are different use addition of the negation

1218324
easymock	jmock
the second version is what i ve usually used in jmock easymock and rhino.mocks - but i don t have any experience with moq so it may be more idiomatic to use the first form there

1218356
post	get
so far i ve set up a wordpress site and managed to get all post made on this site appear on facebook on notes

1218356
rss	feed
all posts made on my site must be able to appear on facebook as notes both drupal wordpress and pretty much anything with rss feed capability can do this

even i who understand why those languages are used and how they work often have to edit my post on so because of errors like not inserting an empty line at the right place to get this or that recognized -

1218856
for-loop	arrays
depending on what you are doing you could consider having each statement be a delegate create an arrays of delegates and run a for-loop across the arrays

1218859
try-catch	exception-handling
what about having those methods throw a custom exception-handling and put a try-catch for the specific exception-handling within your loop

1218902
getter	setter
you have a private field and then you return the value of that field in the getter and set the value of that field in the setter

bazaar	git
aside from details about the many wonderful features of hg git darcs bazaar and friends no sarcasm

1219253
cvs	svn
git hg and others are loaded with features and misfeatures that make them different from svn and cvs

1219264
junit	testng
junit 3.8 junit 4.5+ and testng 5.8+ are supported

1219281
zen-cart	magento
i m not sure if zen-cart or magento will do the above - anyone have any experience of the same

1219285
google-chrome	safari
i am testing some jquery in google-chrome safari and i just cant seem to solve this error

1219309

edit ps to get the form to post to the current page you don t have to explicitly provide action and controller -- you can also send nulls

1219330
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have an iphone app that uses an uitabbarcontroller which contains two uinavigationcontroller each of which in turn contains one or more tableviewcontrollers actually customized uiviewcontroller implementing uitableviewdelegate and uitableviewdatasource

1219341
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
and to apply this to a textbox dropdownlistfor listbox or checkbox you just need to add this attribute

1219341

...or this for a radiobuttonlist or checkboxlist

1219374
agile	sprint
this can happen in an agile process just us with any other process when the pm scrum master or whatever doesn t stick to the figures and squeezes another feature into the project iteration sprint

1219391
versioning	upgrade
if apple upgrade the pre-installed versioning of apache php your machine-specific config wouldn t be overridden as it would in the case of using pre-installed apache php

1219392
width	height
try to fill the td with the input completely using height and width rules in your css

1219392
onfocus	onblur

put	get
i put this in the init .py file in my project and then call it from anywhere in my package to get a file relative to the package

1219423
integer	unsigned
however it may not be properly initialized which means that the unsigned integer count might not be zero

1219441
width	height
could you try putting the autocompletebox control inside of a stackpanel or providing a specific size - height 40 width 120 or something like that to see if it appears better

1219465
dictionary	map
i figured i could pre-load all the relative cgpoints for the cities based on the imageview map into a dictionary so i can reference them during a touchesbegan event but i m quickly getting in over my head and possibly going about this the wrong way

1219478
folder	directory
i then changed the file etc init.d apache2 in order to enable public_html folder for users corresponding to the directory setting -d userdir

1219483
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome donâ t support these events on links and or form fields in all circumstances

1219494
explode	implode
first you probably want to use implode and not explode to construct your variable

1219551
firefox	safari
but if i use mac osx either safari or firefox i cannot drag the volume in the flash although i can see the mouse turn into pointer

1219616
firefox	safari
sqlite isn t written in .net but there is a .net adapter with linq to entities support and it is portable to all platforms you re likely to consider it s used for instance in firefox safari adobe lightroom apple s aperture and skype

1219668
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
unfortunately getcomputedstyle is a standards function which means msie does not support this but firefox google-chrome safari and opera do

1219671
addition	multiplication
if the compiler is not awesome then i d say that the second version should be faster if only because i m avoiding the implict pointer addition that comes with the thunk as well as removing the multiplication for the y and z indeces

1219699
persistent	transient
when we deal with transient objects we can use the business key semantics to compare objects and have a merge strategy available if you try to persistent two transient objects with same business key but different values in the remainder attribute

1219722
forth	smalltalk
truth in advertising i never learned ruby but the object-class relation has to be the one smalltalk set forth 30 years ago

1219749
xmltype	clob
i m trying to convert some xml data coming from a clob to a xmltype column

1219782
cpu	processors
generally speaking when you load a single value and it isn t hot in cache the cpu will pull in a cache line 32 64 or 128 bytes are pretty typical depending on processors

1219792
folder	directory
then when the folder is opened in nautilus you can find the mounted directory in .gvfs and then you should be able to compile it without any trouble at all

1219827
qimage	qwidget	qpainter	qwidget	qpainter	qimage
drawpoint draws a pixel on both a internal qimage and using qpainter on a qwidget thats the drawing area

1219831
preorder	postorder
how can i find the preorder listing of a tree if only the postorder listing is given and vice versa

1219831
preorder	postorder
i think that ought to get rid of the ambiguity of a single preorder or postorder being able to uniquely identify a tree

1219854
post	get
if that doesn t fix the problem can you post the full class that is causing the problem preferably cut down to the bare minimum of code that will reproduce the exception in your excerpt for example we don t see the original map get created and saved and don t get to see where mapid comes from

1219892
vim	textmate
i managed to achieve this in textmate and am now looking to start working with vim

1219897
ubuntu	linux
in any case on my linux system ubuntu with a 2.6.28 kernel sigev_callback doesn t seem to be defined anywhere but sigev_thread works as advertised

1219899
hash	salt
for my needs storing the salt in the db next to the hash password has always worked fine

1219904
subclass	abstract-class
myclass contains a method definition public abstract void mymethod but does not specify an implementation - an implementation must be provided by a subclass usually referred to as a concrete subclass so an abstract-class defines an interface perhaps with some implementation detail

1219908
hash	salt
the point of rainbow tables is that they re created in advance and distributed en masse to save calculation time for others - it takes just as long to generate rainbow tables on the fly as it would to just crack the password+salt combination directly since effectively what s being done when generating rainbow tables is pre-running the calculations for brute-forcing the hash thus the argument that by knowing the salt someone could generate a rainbow table is spurious

1219933
hash	salt
there is no need to store them separately - the point is to use a random salt for each password so that a single rainbow table can t be used against your entire set of password hash

1219933
hash	salt
with random salt an attacker must brute-force each hash separately or compute a rainbow table for all possible salt - vastly more work

1219950
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to the latest versioning of the client library migrate to google api 3.0

1219958
superclass	subclassing
it implies that the class can not be instantiated i can only be used as a superclass or that a method must be overridden by a subclassing

1219961
superclass	subclassing
subclassing may want to override the property and have the superclass respect that

1219966
hash	salt
the primary purpose of a salt is to prevent the usage of rainbow tables when cracking password hash - without the usage of a salt one could simply use a pre-generated reverse-lookup table to find the hash and immediately know what password likely generated it

1219966
hash	salt
with a salt the rainbow table approach is defeated because the mapping of hash to passwords is completely different for that particular salt - and thus one would have to generate rainbow tables individually for every salt value and the time it takes to generate rainbow tables is proportional to the time it would take to brute force the hash without the assistance of the rainbow table in the first place

1219988
portrait	landscape
i have all the autoresizingmasks set so they rotate fine but if say the blue view is being displayed i rotate to landscape its fine but then when i switch views the yellow one is all messed up because its never auto-rotated it starts out with portrait dimensions and auto-rotates to landscape fine but when it loads the normal portrait yellow view into the landscape view everything is messed up the yellow view never got auto-rotated with the rest because it wasn t even in view as a subview

1220063
for-loop	loops
the problem is that when i create the markers i do so through a for-loop and i add listeners to the marker in each loops

1220117
hash	salt
if you want it for hashing passwords i would say a hash function like mash would fit the bill of being resistant to brute force when used with a salt and rainbow tables

1220152
facebook	fbconnect
if the user does something that will need communication back to them prompt for an email at that time - or wait for facebook to implement sending user-to-user notifications in the fbconnect api and send mail through facebook itself

1220199
width	height
and from there you can sort your images based on the size member which is a width height tuple

1220236
disk	ram
use a ram disk

1220243
folder	directory
what i ve tried so far is downloading the zipped folder and extracting it to my c++ folder and then setting the ide to search for directory in the fltk folder but that doesn t work - i think it s a bigger problem than just looking for headers

1220264
onkeyup	onkeydown
this seems like an annoying user experience but if you insist then you can use the onkeyup onkeydown onkeypress listeners onkeyup is likely sufficient

1220325
freezable	pathgeometry
here is an msdn article on freezable objects of which pathgeometry is one which states that they can be shared across threads but no longer modified once frozen

1220328
folder	directory
i did find this method gitdiff.bat and gitdiff.rb that copies the files out to old new temp directory and then does a folder compare on them

1220337
int	chars
wilson is slightly off though you really should cast it to a chars instead of an int as with an int you will see 4 bytes not a single byte as you would with a chars

1220367
moq	typemock
i have been testing mocking frameworks moq and typemock specifically

1220367
moq	typemock
unfortunately i did not record actual numbers in my tests regarding moq vs typemock but the performance benefit of moq is signficant in my experience

1220451
google-chrome	safari
css is supported better than any other utility as it uses the webkit html rendering engine safari google-chrome

1220572
google-chrome	firefox
my website doesn t seem to display any element or content when viewed on ie even though source code is viewable but on firefox and google-chrome it loads fine

1220602
for-loop	arrays
the problem is the following when i extract the nsdictionary key values using nsenumerator - but also tried with a slower for-loop and add the resulting object into the mutablearray the values of the objects inside the arrays get initialized to the same object for all preceeding values

1220605
width	height
a uiscrollview with paging enabled will stop at multiples of its frame width or height

1220605
uiview	subviews
create a uiview subclass clipview that will contain the uiscrollview and it s subviews

1220606
google-chrome	safari
this works as expected in safari and google-chrome

1220632
nant	cruisecontrol
and cruisecontrol will run nant every time you check in your code while monitoring your code repository

1220661
vmware	virtualbox
when i have a powerful enough computer i generally use a virtual machine with eiter vmware or virtualbox in which i install a minimalist lamp stack

1220675
postgresql	mysql
i personally use good old manually installed and configured apache 2.2 php 5.3.0 mysql 5.0.x postgresql 8.4

1220770
comparator	comparable
implementing comparable gives your objects a comparator method

1220820
findwindow	showwindow
currently i use findwindow isiconic and showwindow from the windows api

1220820
findwindow	showwindow
i have to check to see if the window is there with findwindow and set my object to the specific window that is returned with that call i then check if it s minimized with isiconic and call showwindow if it is and then finally i have to call interaction.appactivate to set focus to that window

1220847
firefox	safari
on occasion in firefox 3.5.1 at least and safari 3 4 the background will change however my #main-container div will not

1220869
disk	ram
xts mode is the most common if you are encoding a random accessible data like a hard disk or ram

1220932
google-chrome	firefox
the code seems to work fine with firefox google-chrome and ie7 but with ie6 its adding in the middle of the filename

1220967
folder	directory
there are no .svn directory or something like this in this local folder

1220973
post	get
that being said if you want to create html files for the post and then store those locales in a db so that you can easily get to them then that s definitely a good solution a la movable type

1221001
move	drag
the easiest way is to right mouse drag the directory and click svn move versioned files here when you drop

1221094
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome download using the same name but ie6 inserts 1 just before the first extension it encounters .pdf so i get test 1 .pdf_check.txt

1221112
yslow	pagespeed
i suggest downloading yslow or pagespeed which is a plugin for firebug which analyses your page and shows how it is slow and gives advice on how to improve it

1221116
entity-relationship	diagram
the lazy solution would requere getting field names from the master shema - its better to list the fields asuming u can autogenerate the sql statements or use any from your aplication or entity-relationship diagram

1221125
mouse	keyboard
service is in fact a program that runs in background takes no input from keyboard and mouse and does not output to directly to the user s screen

1221133
hash	salt
you can use salt to get a more revere sengineering aware hash

1221133
hash	salt
later when the user tries to reach the url first generate the hash again with the salt and compare with the hash from url provided

1221190
hash	md5
i believe all databases have a hash function like sha1 xyz or md5 abc though it might have a slightly different name in each one

1221191
folder	dir
note inside your c program files microsoft sdks windows v6.1 bin folder you will find wsdl.exe or just do a dir s inside your c program files

1221281
rss	feed
i d use jquery to read in the rss feed using .ajax loop through each item in the feed and append flowplayer to the html page

1221282
postgresql	mysql
i have a script that will produce daily rotated backups for mysql but i can t find anything similar for postgresql

1221284
treemap	linkedhashmap
treemap is not an answer to your question because it sorts elements by key while linkedhashmap preserves original order

1221313
hide	show
i m using jquery to show hide a row of a table which contains a form however when i toggle the display of it it isn t working correctly

1221313
firefox	safari
it seems that the issue in question is not occurring in ie only safari and firefox

1221350
width	height
keep an int array the size of your screen into which you will plot your transparent pixels int width height

1221358
postgresql	mysql
you shouldn t copy files from postgresql directory just like in mysql - because chances are you will not be able to use them these files are architecture operating system and compile-options dependent

1221369
put	get
if the value is still 0 after the decrement you get the resource otherwise your entity is put into a queue

1221425
rss	feed
i build a site on drupal cms and added some external rss feed

1221449
super	abstract
you will have to forward the constructor parameter to the abstract super class every time .

1221459
post	get
rather than having different css files for each language you could one file site.css.aspx or similar and process the file output the paths based on the language supplied post get variables or in the accept headers

1221475
salt	md5
you could also use numeric indexes instead of the md5 and salt if you dont like the long md5 strings or the uniqid function

1221488
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
you should always use a salt md5 hash to secure your session

1221524
implements	extends
any class extends the abstract class will have to implements only its abstract methods and members and will have some default implementation of the other methods of the abstract class which you may override or not

1221524
implements	extends
finally you can implements as many interfaces as you want but only extends one class being it abstract or not

1221525
width	height
if you have a div container that s not really defined height width then its not going to work

1221525
width	height
an arbitrary height and width should do it

1221556
implements	extends
the key difference is that you can implements multiple interfaces in a class but only extends a single abstract class

1221571
width	margin
i have a centered div on my site using a fixed width and margin 0 auto

1221592
listview	gridview
use a listview instead with the view set to a gridview

1221611
getter	setter
often people say you shouldn t test setter getter since they re trivial

1221626
width	height
simply paste this code into a text editor replace the window width and height the timeout and the image file name with your values and save as an .hta file showimage.hta

1221642
queue	fifo
the isrs can be decoupled from tasks by use of a thread-safe fifo queue

1221642
queue	fifo
if task1 is just producing data the same mechanism may be used if you have a queue fifo in which task1 can write data which can be read by task 2 then the tasks are decoupled

1221698
rss	feed
feedapi will parse rss feed and turns

1221698
rss	feed
rss feed into nodes

1221698
rss	feed
but as the rss feed are imported into nodes those should be

ack	nerdtree
for navigation i find nerdtree ctags ack and possibly some custom scripts written in perl or whatever

1221800
svg	vml
if the text should rotate you could do it with vml svg canvas but in that case you might just be better off with flash

1221836
children	parent
edit i ve added some sample methods to show you what needs to happen in order to add children or set the parent

1221836
children	parent
objects and then create addchild and setparent methods in order to add children to the node or set the node s parent

1221847
hash	md5
you should have a good reason to go with md5 when we do have other hash algos out there that aren t at least yet broken

1221854
for-loop	loops
a better option would be to use a while loops instead of a for-loop with the check of the flag in the while condition

1221889
client-side	server-side
i want to monitor these updates in order to reset a client-side timer mirroring the server-side session timer

1221902
g++	gcc
this code with a compiles fine in g++ but throws up linker errors when compiled with gcc

1221912
g++	gcc
your code is c++ so it must be compiled with g++ the c++ compiler not gcc the c compiler

1221932
rss	feed
you could probably do something with their rss feed by playing around with the search options you can see how they are represented in the querystring and pull apart the returned xml.

1221933
salt	md5
md5 _session username . salt

1221933

formview	checkboxlist	objectdatasource	formview
i am using a checkboxlist inside of a formview with an objectdatasource

1222199
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
actually you should do this with svcutil.exe not with wsdl.exe

1222246
width	height
i can make some assumptions about the images if required i can force the user to specify width and height if required but i cannot really enforce the position it s html after all

1222254
post	get
what i can do now is get the post table with inner join on comments table and then run docount on comments table for each post-id

1222332
inherited	properties
the solution i came up myself was making all my generated entities abstract and all my properties virtual naming them dbcustomer for instance and creating an inherited customer class

1222332
getter	setter
then overriding all properties and call base.propertyname in the getter and setter

1222366
qunit	jsunit
jsunit qunit xunit

1222371
pop-up	dialog
i m pretty sure you d have to do this with a java applet or activex control that pop-up a file open dialog and then assigns each of the file names selected to a hidden fileupload html control

1222387
client-side	server-side
the type safety eclipse debugging and shared code between the server-side client-side will feel comfortable to your java development team

google-chrome	firefox
edit i m thinking that it may involve scripting a solution especially if i want to handle firefox 3.0 3.5 google-chrome

1222484
public	protected	width	height
i would refactor the drawing code out of the paintcomponent method of your implementation of jpanel to a public package protected method in that panel which can draw to an arbitrary graphics object of any width height presumably that the drawing code is general enough

1222513
versioning	upgrade
how about building your app with the latest versioning say 3.0 so you can exploit all the new cool apis and specifying the deployment target as the least recent versioning you want to support so guys out there who didn t take time out to upgrade their devices will stil run your app

1222536
inherited	properties
2 copy the transformmojo and the abstractxmlmojo .java files from the xml-maven-plugin you need the parent mojo to inherited the properties from its javadoc

1222612
filtering	grouping
just make a select statement grouping by all the fields of a table and filtering using a having clause where the count is greater than 1

1222613
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
for post-processing i ve had a lot of success with beautifulsoup but lxml.html is a good choice too

1222621
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
installing and upgrading an older versioning to check file differences from a new installation tests our deployment upgrade configuration

1222658

if you are doing something useful processing a lot of data then 100 cpu load just means that the processors is used in the most efficient way

1222662
serializable	deserialization
you are attempting to link the serializable deserialization of an instance with modification of the static state of a class

1222687

1222910
post	put
apologies for the fact that there are multiple related questions here it s hard to ask these q s in a vacuum w o an example to refer to and i figure it s better to put up the example once in one post than to separate out my questions

1222913
invokerequired	begininvoke
but what really needs to be done is access it via the invokerequired and begininvoke technique

1222957
cpython	ironpython
for now multiprocessing instead of threading remains the way of choice for using multiple cores in cpython ironpython and jython are fine too but they don t support python 3 currently nor do they make c++ integration all that easy either

1222959
lxml	beautifulsoup
others have recommended beautifulsoup but it s much better to use lxml

emacs	aquamacs
if you have a mac i would recommend aquamacs which is a beginner-friendly version of gnu-emacs and therefore has all the power of emacs while still offering standard copy-paste save and other features including normal file dialogs and windows

1223020
jtree	jtable
take a look at glazedlists -- there s an ability to use an eventlist for both a jtable and a jtree

lxml	beautifulsoup
look into using lxml instead of beautifulsoup

1223031
lxml	beautifulsoup
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it

1223031

cvs	rcs
as a result the cvs history does not show the older revisions that were tracked via rcs

1223341
cvs	rcs
for example suppose file foo.c was revised 10 times in rcs then 2 times in cvs

1223341
cvs	rcs
rcs has versions 1.1 through 1.10 and cvs has versions 1.1 1.2 and 1.3

1223341
cvs	rcs
rcs version 1.10 and cvs version 1.1 are identical

1223341
cvs	rcs
since cvs stores revisions in the same file format as rcs it should be a simple matter of beginning with the existing rcs file then checking in the new changes with the ci command preserving the timestamps the userids and commit messages

1223341
cvs	rcs
this new rcs file would then have the full history which could then be added to the cvs repository replacing the old version

in air 1.5 and flash player 10 the maximum is 8 191 pixels in width or height and the total number of pixels cannot exceed 16 777 215 pixels

1223850
width	height
so if an image is 8 191 pixels wide it can only be 2 048 pixels high. in flash player 9 and earlier and air 1.1 and earlier the limitation is 2 880 pixels in height and 2 880 pixels in width

1223867

please add a non-reoccuring nonce to the hash or use the nonce as the key to hmac

1224224
hash	md5
if the purpose is to demonstrate why or how hash functions result in collisions and not md5 specifically the clearest hash function i know of is simple modular division

1224282
hash	md5
the first part is just a header but the last part which you will note is the same in the two certificates is an rsa signature of the md5 hash of the colliding messages

1224331
tostring	getter
property getter and tostring for that matter are assumed to be pure which basically means evaluating it has no side effects

1224363
kerberos	ntlm
if you are using kerberos this wouldn t apply but ad uses ntlm by default

1225324
goto	break
you could create a if you really wanted to break your program in new and interesting ways. the internal methods use assembly to manually emulate a typecast by stripping themselves out of the call stack completely and jmping basically a goto to the appropriate method leaving it with the same parameter list as the function that called it had

1225332

hash	salt
keep in mind that having the salt hidden increases security because then the attacker does not know exactly what function is being used to generate the hash

1225389
hash	salt
if someone has your hash they likely have your salt as well

1225393
hash	salt
a unique salt will per password will prevent a rainbow attack with a pre-computed hash

1225393
hash	salt
using a unique salt per password requires the attacker to calculate the hash foreach individual password for each attempt

1225405
jboss	oc4j
i have also used oc4j and find that it is harder to use and more finicky with it s class loading mechanism maybe i m just used to jboss

1225409
post	get
i have tried switching from a previous post request to a get request

1225409
post	get
which assumes its a get but eventually does a post

1225409
post	get
that completes successfully but later on when i try to reuse the connection and switch back to get using the setopts above it still ends up doing a post internally with incomplete post headers

1225409
post	get
the problem is it believes its doing a get but ends up putting a post header without the content-length parameter and the connection fails witha 411 error

1225433

width	height
what i m looking for is a way to have the height and width either calculated at runtime or a straightforward way to pre-calculate them based on the text string

1225545
hash	salt
there are many large tables that contain tons of these hash so a single hash with no salt can be solved in next to nothing

1225545
hash	salt
a dynamic salt that is added to the password will help out much more then multiple hash

1225553
hash	salt
but more important than a multiple hash the use of a salt is essential for a better security

1225585

it appears that those are forum post on a moderate-traffic site so it should get crawled a few times a week

1226031
outputstream	inputstream
if you don t want to copy all of the data into an in-memory buffer all at once then you re going to have to have your code that uses the outputstream the producer and the code that uses the inputstream the consumer either alternate in the same thread or operate concurrently in two separate threads

wordpress	phpbb
there s no out-of-the-box method of sharing phpbb users with wordpress - it would involve modifying wordpress quite a bit to implement it.

1227330
hash	salt
instead i will store a randomly generated salt for each user prefix there password with it then hash it which seems to be a relatively common way

1227330
hash	salt
client prefixes password with salt then hash it before sending the hash to the server

1227341
uiview	subviews
one of my view controllers is a tableviewcontroller and under the navigationbar i added a uiview as a subviews to the view like this

1227349
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
my research so far has turned up a lot of keywords kerberos ldap ntlm etc but no solid information

1227356
hide	show
you could also keep about and rentals in the same frame and just hide and show them

1227358
hash	salt
it is common practice to never decrypt a user s password so keep it stored hash with a salt and when the user types in their password you will add the salt and hash it comparing it with the stored hash password

1227358
hash	salt
as added security it is a good idea to remember that the password you store should be stored hash with a salt

1227358
hash	salt
this way when the user submits the password you just add the salt and hash and you compare that version with the stored version

1227398
uiview	subviews
i changed the button s state just prior to adding the uiview to the subviews of the owning viewcontroller

1227398
uiview	subviews
just prior to adding my uiview as a subviews

1227466
google-chrome	firefox
my project is running perfectly in firefox google google-chrome and ie 8.0

1227479
svg	vml
dojo charting also works ok and uses svg vml rather than canvas excanvas which means you can do funkier things with it if you look at its internals but flot is nicer to program with imo

1227549
hide	show
then you can hide show it with something like this

1227560
filewriter	bufferedwriter
writer new bufferedwriter new filewriter studentfile true

1227565
hide	show
i really appreciate somebody let me know how to hide these tags not to show on the output of the report in my comment field

1227569
ubuntu	linux
however on linux ubuntu i get a different value

1227585
put	get
i would like to now write a xml schema file .xsd to validate this xml file so that developers can validate their form xml before it is put into the system and so they can get intellisense based on the xml schema while they develop it

1227610
portrait	landscape
now you re going to have another problem because the camera controller doesn t like landscape mode so you may have to switch back to portrait mode before showing it..

1227640
post	get
works perfectly for get request and i will post soon the solution for post request

1227644
unsigned	short
typedef unsigned short uint16

1227644
unsigned	short
typedef unsigned short word

1227657
sorting	filtering
for such a query you cannot use a single index both for filtering and sorting

1227657
sorting	filtering
if you expect it to return many records and limit them you need to use index for sorting and then filtering

1227673
g++	gcc
one easy method is to build with gcc rather than g++ - this won t link in the default c++ libraries but will still compile .cpp files as c++ code

1227719
width	height
i define a height and width but most of the images i am trying to resize are already smaller

1227795
post	get
the problem i have is that i have an nsoutlineview with drag and drop see the bottom of post for code to make drag and drop work it works but when i drag one row into another row the dragged row becomes a child but it also stays where it was as a parent and when i delete either row both of them get deleted

1227817
sorting	filtering
so it needs more functionality than filtering and sorting

1227818
put	get
for your example above i d use data.binary and write custom put get ers myself

1227892
inherited	properties
inherited via a parent properties so that

1227892
dictionary	map
a hash map dictionary of name- value pairs for

1227923
sorting	filtering
with out specifics it s hard to answer your question but you should look into filtering and sorting

1227931
spaces	delimiter
after some searching i find i can split a line by a char other than spaces but only one delimiter at a time

1227936
postgresql	mysql
this definitely works on sql server mysql and postgresql

1227954
scrollbars	dock
setting the user control s dock to fill seems to hide the panel s scrollbars

1227960
google-chrome	firefox
i have this code which is working fine in firefox google-chrome and ie8 but is it not working on ie6 and ie7

1227971
google-chrome	firefox
i make it to hide them in ie and firefox but i can t make it happen in google-chrome

1227971
google-chrome	firefox
to hide buttons in firefox but seems that not work for google-chrome

1227972
spaces	delimiter
one simple way is to take a copy of your text replace all the delimiter characters with a spaces character and then split using a spaces as your delimiter

1227974
try-catch	exception-handling
talking about exception-handling try to put an try-catch block in the line that access your webservice

1228015
ant	pom.xml
we built a custom pom.xml build file specific for sonar we are using ant for other build purposes

1228038
post	get
there are years and years worth of post that can help you figure out what you need to do to get what you want in flash

1228038
put	get
if you ve never used xaml and you ve got a sort timeline to get this thing done you best be prepared to put in some extra time or be okay with a less than stellar look and feel

1228111
sorting	grouping
one of my need to to be able to control the sorting of the grouping ascending or descending

1228146
mbunit	mstest
i am using mstest instead of mbunit

1228154
hide	show
there s also hide and show

1228326
redmine	trac
your best bet would be to use one of the various trac alternatives such as redmine or drproject or if i may pimp myself piano-man

1228373
post	get
if you save his xslt file in the post to a file called stripnamespaces.xslt in the web site project you should get your data if you change the asp xmldatasource to be

1228388
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
of odp.net you install it will always have problems with sqldatasource it simly doesn t work so if you try any other datasource like objectdatasource with dataset or other implementation it s working and parametrized too but remember to use param instead of param

1228438
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
however if you re using something like jpeg gif png or bmp you can use the imageio class

1228452
hide	show
how i did this was to very quickly hide and show the parent object in your case it sounds like the parent to your row

1228478
getter	setter
is it common to have getter setter style methods as in java

1228486
getter	setter
no it is not common to use getter setter style names in c#

1228486
getter	setter
properties should be used for almost all places you would use a getter setter in java

1228486
bcl	fxcop
it s enforced by several tools fxcop and is the dominant style of many libraries including the bcl

1228516
height	border-box	width	height	width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing content-box is not applied to table cells it currently only applies border-box which includes the border in the height width it is non-standard and needs to be fixed

1228516
width	height
if you want add a div above the table with a fixed height width border and see as firefox renders that div s border above the table border overlapping it as if it wasn t even there

1228527
client-side	server-side
as for form validation you can do both server-side and client-side

1228527
client-side	server-side
we always try to show server-side errors on top of the form in a distinctive container client-side - right next to the field in question on submit

1228593
int	chars
unfortunately a lot places use standards such as m_ for member variables i for int no matter how used cp for chars pointers

1228596
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works on ie7 firefox opera safari and google-chrome

1228619
haskell	ocaml
in fact i very much believe the popularity of ruby affected the popularity of languages like haskell ocaml scala and f# in a positive way in addition to the other dynamic languages

1228659
cpython	ironpython
so unless ironpython which is written in .net can correctly load c dlls written for cpython you might be out of luck

1228659
cpython	ironpython
a ironpython does not support using pyds built for cpython since they

1228672
innodb	myisam
i am simply trying to convert a table from myisam to innodb

1228724
put	get
make a thin wrapper to put with your other custom classes to get around quirks with matlab s classloader

1228875
post	get
i keep coming across generic.xaml but if i look on msdn for generic.xaml or just do a google search i only seem to get blog post and forum questions that happen to mention it--i can t seem to hit upon anything really authoritative and clear

1228884
mouseout	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
initially hovering works and the over class is added on mouseenter and removed on mouseout but after doing some hovering over paragraphs with class risk the toggle class becomes stuck and mouseover removes it instead of adding the class opposite of expected functionality

1228919
mouseleave	mouseenter
why not have two separate functions for mouseenter and mouseleave

1228919
mouseleave	mouseenter
have mouseenter add the class and mouseleave remove the class

1228919
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think the problem is that if for example the mouseleave event is not fired browser looses focus i think can cause this then the mouseenter function will remove the class instead of adding it

1228929
versioning	upgrade
presumably you have some table that contains a db schema versioning so you should make sure to lock that table for the duration of the startup upgrade process

1228954
hide	show
i have this simple jquery function to hide or show a table

1228954
hide	show
the show hide works but the image plus minus is not changing

1228975
queue	fifo
although i agree with nick that the queue s purpose is more for fifo style processing and arsenmkrt s solution will work another option involves using a messageenumerator and piling the messages into your ienumerable

1229012
post	get
both post and get works perfectly

1229012
firefox	safari	post	get	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
post and get works perfectly in ie 7 and 8 safari google-chrome and firefox

1229022
addclass	removeclass
try not to change css values in code but instead use jquery to addclass and removeclass

1229130
vpn	lan
proxies if you re connected over a vpn or your company uses a proxy go to tools-internet options-connection tab and click on lan settings.

1229144
vb.net	vb6
i have a interesting problem where i work we ve built a home-grown erp system in vb6 that we are slowly moving over into vb.net

1229167
versioning	upgrade
move what can be moved to separate dll s then it is often possible to upgrade just by coping in a new versioning of the dll

1229171
perl	tcl
mac os x leopard comes with a ton of stuff built-in perl python ruby tcl tk bash

1229171
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i decided i would have to deploy imagemagick but in my testing i am running into an infamous bus error and would prefer not to have to compile imagemagick or graphicsmagick with all its dependancies if i can do what i need to out-of-the-box

1229195
postgresql	mysql
but what you propose doesn t work on mysql it seems you have to use now + interval 2 hour and not now + interval 2 hours -- still i don t know about postgresql

1229195
postgresql	mysql
btw i don t have a postgresql server so i ll test everything with mysql -- should work on postgresql too still.

1229336
int	double
found double required int

1229394
addclass	removeclass
so the best solution is use addclass someclass and removeclass someclass to make things hidden

1229417
post	get
this is just a simple example of course i can hardcode post url here or get url by location object etc with javascript i hope you get what i mean.

1229492
int	chars
quassnoi can explain better than i but i think there is no visible difference in performance if you use a varchar chars or int in a index to use it later for group ing or other method to find the duplicates

1229522
hid	keyboard
your delegate should have already made the decision to hide the keyboard or not and the event being broadcast is merely to let all the other components know that they keyboard hid

1229537
spaces	delimiter
there are 91 lines in final_file 91 different standard spaces delimiter inputs and therefore the bash script should call the . runnable input 91 times

1229541
rss	feed
subscribe to the rss feed for c++

1229544
hide	show
now in css you can hide the area when the js class is not available and show the area when js is available

1229643
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
cocoamagic is a single-file replacement for large parts of rmagick ruby integration with imagemagick or graphicsmagick

1229762
width	height
according to the docs a display object that has nothing inside it cannot have its width or height set

1229821
google-chrome	firefox
i have this code which is working fine in firefox google-chrome and ie8 but is it not working on ie6 and ie7

1229849
prepare	execute
also database server machines are usually shared resources but the statement is likely to be prepare separately for each user so if you have multiple users hammering the system with repeated queries that are discarded the server will be too busy preparing queries to execute any of them fast

1229947
put	get
i ve pared the logic down to the bare minimum but hopefully you get how to modify the logic to put the hibernate support back in

1229972
agile	sprint
most agile proponents mike cohn ken schwaber and jeff sutherland for instance recommend that teams use the recent weather to base their future estimations on how much they think they can commit to in a sprint

1229972
agile	sprint
i recommend mike cohn s book on agile estimating and planning to provide an overview of the way sprint estimation and planning all can fit together

1229981
width	height
if you want that widget have the same size in only one direction width or height set the mode property of sizegroup

1229994
photoshop	fireworks
fireworks is specifically web orientated and has preset styles that you can use but it doesn t have the fan-base or tutorials available that photoshop does

1229996
icns	dmg
the app then need to be repacked in a dmg for distribution i could use idmg and also add the icns as an icon for the dmg

1230007
width	height
if you still think you need that transparent sprite you can draw a transparent rectangle beginfill 0 0 or create a transparent bitmap new bitmapdata width height true 0

1230051
inherited	properties
and since a program started by a service inherited this properties it usually is not allowed to get to the desktop either

1230132
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable or more properly ienumerator doesn t have moveprev

1230162
rss	feed
parse rss and atom feed in python

1230163
width	height
give it a set height and width say 300 pixels by 300 pixels

1230168
post	put
i think you need to put some default values into your route for the post title.

1230220
free	malloc
you could of course re-build your own crt lib from corrected sources or try to replace the crt malloc free

1230249
maven	pom.xml
when i modify my hibernate dependency to this latest version in my project s pom.xml i get the following error when i run a maven build

1230274
getter	setter
i don t know all the answers to your questions but i ve had this issue before and i now check that the model i am trying to update has both getter and setter on it

1230327
children	parent
you can make additional parent and children pointers using

1230343
base-class	subclassing
i gather that you have a base-class and two subclassing that you want to map to two subclassing tables using the table-per-concrete-class mapping strategy

1230343
base-class	subclassing
the two subclassing tables need to declare the same primary keys and the primary keys need to be mapped in the base-class mapping

1230350
put	get
or put it in a database where you can get at it via sql client

1230417
button	right-align
i used to be a proponent of dynamic width until i started seeing pages which looked great on 14 and 19 screens displayed on 24 monitors the major issue is with right-align items such as button which become separated from the main content

1230431
notepad++	textpad
put the file in a text editor such as notepad++ or textpad and change the view to show control characters

1230445
spaces	delimiter
i want spaces to be the delimiter and i want the search to be case insensitive

1230450
post	get
i don t post sample code because i get 1263 errors - so i get error in all files - but this is a sample traceback

1230456
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
on my website it seems every updated browser firefox opera safari ie8 ie7 and even ie6 seem to render the separating line between my content div and sidemenu div

1230528
width	height
the dimensions of the watermark image are 179 width 39 height

1230563
perl	tcl
pl python pl tcl pl perl etc

1230563
ubuntu	debian
interface with r statistical libraries postgresql pl r available in debian ubuntu

1230564
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade my iphone to the latest versioning 3.0.1 7a400

1230580
min	max
i would use a min-width and max-width css attribute to set absolute min max then let it be fluid otherwise

1230580
min	max
note that min max width are not supported in ie6 but then it ll just default to fluid so it shouldn t be a big deal

1230581
width	height
you need to pick a maximum percentage of height and width of the smaller image that you can allow the watermark to be then scale watermark image to the smaller of these two maximum values

1230581
width	height
for example if you want the watermark to be no more than 25 of the height and no more than 50 of the width of the target image you can see how big the watermark should be if you scaled it to either dimension

1230623
jboss	glassfish
a more direct comparison for jboss 5 would be the glassfish v2 releases which are based on java ee 5

1230623
jboss	glassfish
sun also provides patch releases of glassfish akin to redhat s support for jboss

1230655
width	height
meaning that i separate things that deal with size width height and position from css classes that do font-weight color etc

1230668
postgresql	mysql
it has native support for sql server mysql oracle postgresql sqlite db2 and others

1230749
google-chrome	firefox
now this seems like how it should work however it doesn t happen in ie7 firefox google-chrome

1230773
getter	setter
second if get and set are to be strictly interpreted as setter and getter then if other semantic associated with setting getting a value side effects for example will be surprising

1230797
getter	setter
several languages have different ways of handling getter and setter

1230802
getter	setter
c# getter and setter are first class entities and don t resemble function calls syntactically though any arbitrary code can run in the context of an accessor

1230812
accessor	properties
in python you have the concept of properties and so an accessor might look like obj.foo and a mutator might look like even though methods are called behind the scenes

1230829
metaclass	subclassing
in the class that s really a legacy old-type class the one made the second time metaclass is classobj which isn t a subclassing of type and properties don t work right assigning x.x bypasses the property and after that getting x.x doesn t see the property any more either

1230829
metaclass	subclassing
but in the first case the qt case there s a different metaclass and it is a subclassing of type so it s not really correct to say the class isn t new-style

1230853
children	parent
that is a process stores pointers to it s parent but parent appear to not store information about children

1230875
pseudo-class	visited
i read somewhere to think of the a pseudo-class as love hate link visited hover active one more specific than the previous

1230890
ienumerable	ilist
jamie s suggestion is good but instead of overriding tostring i would just project your ilist order into ienumerable listitem before binding

1230907
uiview	calayer
within -drawrect for a uiview or -renderincontext for a calayer the following code will draw text and apply a glow around it

1230926
getter	setter
the java language currently doesn t have properties so the getter setter syntax has become the de-facto standard

1230926
getter	setter
this isn t just so other programmers can read your code but more importantly hundreds of other java frameworks are built to handle objects supporting java bean style getter setter

1230982
mouseout	mouseenter
the code below will take each of the nav link elements and add the mouseenter and mouseout events

1231004
jsmin	jscompress
this uses the jscompress msbuild task from the msbuild community tasks which i think is based off of jsmin

1231010
width	height
i think the solution is giving percentage instead of absolute numbers like 240px to height and width of divs

1231035
getter	setter
then all the classes can use the singleton getter setter to manipulate the lookup tables

1231108
retaincount	dealloc
assuming your retaincount is then 0 dealloc will be called in 99 of the cases you should never call dealloc yourself

1231130
width	height
note that if you have anything like borders or padding set on any of the divs that will add to the width and height of the element so take that into account

1231133
width	height
and my problem is that when the content is really very large i need to calculate the content s height and width and then add new page..

1231134
actionscript	haxe
mtasc is build around actionscript 2 whereas haxe is it s own language and very similar to actionscrip

1231134
actionscript	haxe
again based on the request to the server you can even generate actionscript haxe on the server compile it and inject it into a swf created by swfmill to then serve it to the user

1231173
range	minimum
it also mandates minimum range but allows for multiple encoding schemes two s complement ones complement and sign magnitude

1231173
integer	unsigned
the typedef name uintn_t designates an unsigned integer type with width n

1231173
integer	unsigned
uint24_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 24 bits

1231174
distance	pdist
what you re looking for is called the hamming distance you can get a better description of it if you do doc pdist

1231229
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview tied to an objectdatasource using paging

1231241
ironruby	ironpython
asp.net + asp.net mvc with ironruby ironpython

1231244
udp	tcp
if you are working with tcp ip sockets you already have that scheme with udp sockets listening on a local port to which multiple sources can send data

1231255
gmail	hotmail
contacts is a universal interface to grab contact list information from various providers including hotmail gmail and

1231292
mouse	keyboard
you ll probably also want to tweak the keyboard and mouse settings in system preferences

1231298
boost	stl
boost shared_ptr is safe to use in stl containers unlike std auto_ptr

1231323
getter	setter
then you set the getter and setter properties for this column to private in the property manager window which you probably used to rename eventtype

1231342
children	parent
if you re implementing it yourself then to get row highlighting you would just either use the pseudo css class hover or jump to closest parent and apply a css class to background color the children

1231373
getter	setter
you cannot have a pointer to a property because a property is an interface to an object specifying the format of the getter and setter methods

1231420
ffmpeg	libavformat	libavformat	swscale
i m trying to build a c++ cli executable to which i statically link ffmpeg libavcodec libavformat libavutil swscale

1231426
getter	setter
i really like special notation for getter and setter

1231493
nfa	dfa
for more information search for dfa vs nfa in this article about regex matching engines

1231553
public	protected
base class base defines protected virtual abstract method v and public non-virtual method m

1231561
inherited	properties
i thought of having a single super pom with all the properties but if i change one of the problem i need to either increment its version and to update all the poms inherited from it or to delete it from all the developers machines which i don t want to do

1231628
rss	feed
there s also an rss feed on the site above that contains many great blog posts regarding the technology

1231671
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
i want to save the stack for each malloc free realloc

1231724
maven	pom.xml
the irony is that the hibernate artifacts have some fairly intricate inter-dependencies and well-documented minimum versions of those dependencies which would be ideally represented as a maven pom.xml

1231734
put	get
is my first time in this forum i have a problem with the jqgrid i can not get it to work and this problem is by about 2 days that i can not risolvere.il problem is that if i put the code javascript within the jqgrid view home then everything works but if i change my path for example client linqgriddata gives me the following error

1231740
public	protected
however if it is not super important you might consider mapping the columns just as you normally would but as private protected properties and then create a public property in your class that exposes those private public properties as an array

1231775
maven	pom.xml	inherited	properties
the standard set are inherited from the maven super pom.xml and can be overridden by redefining the relevant properties

1231951
free	malloc
but if you want to do something about it it s not free you should be looking at but malloc

1232043
freemarker	velocity
the variant is very common apache velocity freemarker unix shell also used int apache ant buildfiles and springframework bean configurations

1232053
postgresql	mysql
it will mostly depend on the sql engine you use oracle sql server mysql postgresql etc as they ll all optimise in different ways

1232063
hide	show
it should hide and show certain divs when a user clicks on a radio button

1232073
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but ie ignores the padding rendering it as a flat list quite hard to use and google-chrome doesn t render the s which are technically not valid as an is supposed to contain at least on

1232079
datarow	dataadapter
offcourse the dataadapter only fires the correct sqlcommand which is determined by the rowstate of each datarow

1232080
nsstring	nsdata
i have a rsa exponent key value which is supposed to be a biginteger but i have it in nsstring nsdata with full value in utf8 encoded

1232080
exponent	modulo
2.i need to do arithmatic operations on exponent and modulo values including powmod

1232084
vim	emacs
and you can make easily from emacs or vim

1232095
rss	feed
you can use a xml parser to parse the rss feed and display them

1232096
width	margin
edit i already have this working using a containing div for the floating element and specifying a width for the container then use margin 0 auto

1234620
multiplying	multiplication
don t divide a bazillion times by len_best compute its inverse one outside the loop and multiplying by that inverse -- also you don t need to do that multiplication inside the loop you can do it at the end in a separate since it s the same value that s multiplying every item -- this saves no memory but avoids wantonly wasting cpu time

1234623
post	get
this post sounds similar except they get a message undeliverable error and i don t

rss	feed
as usual -- if you re a powershell geek you owe him a spot in your rss feed

the problem is that on google-chrome the stream works ok but on firefox 3.5.2 it stopps after a few seconds

1234865
int	double
if you will be storing value types structs int double etc. then the cost of boxing unboxing will most likely balance things out and i would recommend the dictionary t instead

1234930
post	get
i added support for updating build steps and a few other minor things which outside the scope of this blog post but this should hopefully get you started

1234945
pull	push
you can fake different ones especially in .net because after all they are presented as managed streams which would be fine at the push pull and of the pipe

put	get
you then put a comma after each item in the array and you can get to the requried string that you are looking for

1234985
post	put

1234991
rss	feed
you may want to consider grabbing the rss feed for the search and parsing that

1235077
implements	extends
by the way extends thread is not generally as good as implements runnable for quite a few reasons

1235114
post	get
you could also implement this a method on the postrepository to get all of the post by a given user

1235116
firefox	safari
in firefox the jquery file shows as a 19k request but safari shows it as a 56k request

1235125

getter	setter
not all languages have properties java only has fields that must be accessed by getter and setter

1235179
for-loop	loops

1235574
vim	emacs
emacs vim can handle all of them natively or by exntensions

1235585
children	parent
you could create a new table called something like validparents that only has the parent ids that have n children and keep it in sync with triggers

1235612
restrict	shared
the reason its not easy to restrict memory usage is there is only one heap which is shared

1235652
post	get
i am using a post verb but even after setting the webmethod cacheduration attribute the json doesn t get cached

1235658

this takes advantage of domcontentloaded - which fires before onload - but allows you to stick in all your unobtrusiveness.

1236044
prototypejs	mootools

i could be wrong but i think there may be inherent problems with using a mouseover or mouseenter event to control a vertical accordion -- unless you really know what the submenus are going to be like

1236458
mouseover	mouseenter
you fire all the mouseover out or mouseenter leave events for #3 #4 #5.

1236546
comparator	comparable

1236555
superclass	subclassing
you can t just cast a superclass to its subclassing

1236559
integer	fractions
in c++ 5 4 1 not 1.25 - because 5 and 4 are both integers so the result will be an integer and thus the fractions part of the result is thrown away

1236787
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
use sharpdevelop windows or monodevelop nix

1236798
post	get
in your post you mentioned that it use libpcap to grab packets but as i know libpcap will just get a copy of the incoming packet and then that packet will still pass into the normal kernel stack path and that may be not what you want

1236825
equals	gethashcode
for example if a base class you inherit provides a gethashcode and an equals method overriding equals but not gethashcode breaks platform-documented rules developers are supposed to follow when they override equals

1236826
int	double
lastly i changed your assumption that the parameter be an int between zero and one-hundred to be a double between zero and one

1236826
multiplying	subtract
if the parameter is greater than 0.5 multiplying lambda by two and subtract one this maps onto and return the interpolated color between color b and color c

1236954
sdlc	methodology
risk management doesn t replace any part of the sdlc or a typical methodology

i would defintly recommend using as few static properties methods as possible especially if you are trying to work with inherited at least with php 5.3

1236993
awt	swing
i want to support the native look and feel and thus i have to use awt instead of swing

1237008

the change event fires fine when the current item is selected using the mouse but when i scroll through the items using the keyboard the event is not fired and my code never executes

1237194
post	get
interpreting the captured packets takes some experience so if you get stuck feel free to post more data here

1237208

today i can easily support linux opensolaris freebsd and even cygwin

1237360
fastcgi	scgi
this is web project that uses apis that popular in unix world like cgi fastcgi and scgi that implemented in most unix web servers

1237360
decltype	auto
i probably would never be able to support visual studio maybe 2010 with c++0x support because i relay on c++0x decltype auto feature or typeof __typeof__ extension that is supported by most compilers i worked with gcc intel sun studio

1237360
fastcgi	scgi
the project relates to standard web server api as fastcgi or scgi that allows to accept many requests over sinlge socket

fbjs has its own getter and setter

1237483
salt	md5
an md5 encrypted password usually includes a random salt to make it more difficult to perform dictionary attacks

1237504
jobs	cron
in fact it s invoked by several simultaneous cron jobs that run at 2 mins 5 mins and x mins interval - so yes compile-time is crucial here.

1237524
maven	m2e
i am trying out m2e the eclipse plugin for maven and have noticed that the resources are now excluded from the build path of all my projects

1237527
sin	sqrt

to convert a double to an int value check this page

1237538
inherited	properties
try inherited the class you want to modify and override the corresponding properties

1237553
mvp	presenter
in the past years i have been using my own implementation of mvp with a very passive view that enslaves itself to whatever the presenter tells him to do

1237553
dependency-injection	factories
the constructor parameters of the views enable super-easy testing but without a solid dependency-injection framework one will have some ugly factories setup code inside onmoduleload

1237561
hide	show
create the page dialogs with the main dialog not the tab as their parent and as the user switches between tabs simply show and hide the relevant page dialog

1237595

1237629
listview	gridview
i have got a listview item with a gridview child bound to a list of objects

1237659
int	chars
added also be aware that the chars that separates the fractions part from the int one differs from country to country

1237667
int	chars
that means llist is a type just like int or file or chars that is a shorthand for struct node your linked-list node structure

1237670
typedef	struct
c requires that you reference struct with a struct prefix so it s common to introduce a typedef for less verbose mention

1237722
hide	show
the hide and show will run for each element found hence this might explain why it seems a infinite loop is occuring

1237732
typedef	struct
typedef creates a new type in your program so the return value and types of parameters of those functions are just your struct

1237760
postgresql	mysql
the nemo collaboration building a cosmic neutrino detector underwater had much of the same problems and they used mysql and postgresql without major problems

1237826
debugdiag	debugging
a very relevant article is debugging heap corruption with application verifier and debugdiag

1237862
spweb	spsite
i ve looked as the close method in refelector for spweb which is called by spweb.dispose and there is nothing in it to indicate the actual spsite member field is disposed of

1237862
spweb	spsite
put it in a loop which runs 100 times and use the sprequeststacktrace registry key described in troubleshooting spsite spweb leaks in wss v3 and moss 2007 to check that your test code is the source of the problem.

1237897
min	max
other idea would be to use several loops for generating and each loop having it s own set of min - max values

1237916
division	modulo
then you pretty much just have modulo and division operations to split the value down

1238002
hex	binary
i have a string that has both binary and string characters and i would like to convert it to binary first then to hex

1238003
children	parent
you can create your tables as normal with a 1 m relationship then on the child table have a count column with a check constraint that determines how many children can exist for a parent as well as a unique constraint over the parent id + count column

1238003
children	parent
the only thing this doesn t guarantee is that for each parent there are at least five children

1238017
junit	testng
to run them together there are few options available but i have chosen using different profiles for junit and testng

1238017
junit	testng
since if we add testng dependency to main project in maven it will skip all junit i have decided to put it in separate profile

1238027
spweb	spsite
there is stefan s blog that states you need to ensure that you only dispose spsite and spweb objects that your code owns

1238027
spweb	spsite
put it in a loop which runs 100 times and use the sprequeststacktrace registry key described in troubleshooting spsite spweb leaks in wss v3 and moss 2007 to check that your test code is the source of the problem

1238050
getter	setter
you can view and modify the reference using a getter and a setter

1238100
installation	upgrade
the basic idea is to develop an automatic upgrade framework that knows how to upgrade from an existing sql schema to the newer sql schema and can build an upgrade path for every existing db installation

1238110
webclient	webrequest	inherited	properties
the webclient doesn t have a timeout properties however it is possible to inherited from the webclient to give access to timeout on the internal webrequest used

1238113
division	multiplication
converting between units mathematically merely involves a simple one or two step process of division or multiplication depending on which way you are going between units

1238135
serializable	deserialization
when you have to read only 3 properties i suppose you can write code that manually read from that node and have a full control of how it is executed instead of relying on serializable deserialization

1238181
getter	setter
- a viewmodel which wraps the service proxy classes intercepting the setter and getter

1238248
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox

pull	push
or if you have a thick client app you can pull down the records to the client show the report and - if approved - push them back up

1238271
versioning	upgrade
you ll either need to upgrade django or roll your own selectdatewidget perhaps by copying the versioning from trunk into your own project tree if you can t upgrade django

1238295
ant	maven
as far as making the filtering quicker i don t know of any other simple mechanism that will help as you ve said you need either ant or maven to run the filtering and they both take some time to set up before building resulting in the slow down

1238296
put	get	textarea	pre
for ff use a pre behind textarea paste text before cursor into it put a marker html element after it cursorpos and get the cursor position via that marker element

1238296
textarea	pre
notes | code is ugly sorry for that | pre and textarea font must be the same | opacity is utilized for visualization | there is no autocomplete just a cursor following div here as you type inside textarea modify it based on your need

1238308
pascal	delphi
i ve programmed since i was very young on several languages mostly pascal delphi c c++ sql python sometimes in other languages such as java php or perl so i m not a newbie programmer but apart from basic html i ve little experience on the front-end side of web programming css html javascript and ajax because on my former professional projects if there was web programming somebody would do the frontend part

i use prototype hence the tag and the show hide for it

1238494
hash	md5
i need to create the hash of a the html of a webpage from its url using sha1 or md5 in java but i don t know how to do it.

1238502
spweb	spsite
it seems that you cannot really have a spweb without having a spsite

1238502
spweb	spsite
so if you got the spweb without going through spsite to get it either by doing a new spsite or one being provided to you then you probably do not need to worry about disposing the spsite

1238509
post	get
if you re deleting something you should always use post and not get so using confirm is a bad idea

1238549

google link opera firefox - works well alert1 alertsrc alert2 but safari doesn t - show alertsrc

1238583
put	get
probably the most straightforward way to do this in vanilla javascript would be to put the javascript function in the page and use the server tags to get the rendered clientid

1238601
hide	show
if you re using the textbox because later you want to be able to select all the output to copy and paste it i would have the textbox hidden by default and have a button that says like toggle raw output that will show hide the text field so users can get the text easily

1238628
hash	md5
my plan was to use md5 hash as the existing passwords can be easily altered with the mysql function and i was expecting to find an easy solution for the gwt-ext side as well

1238628
hash	md5
but as i found out java.security is not supported by gwt and there doesn t seem to be any other implementation that can be used to change the password string to a md5 hash on client side

1238794
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
by implementing idataerrorinfo in your domain entities and possibly ieditableobject and inotifypropertychanged you give them the ability to get databound on many .net presentation technologies windows forms wpf asp .net... without much code

1238799
children	parent
children get a copy of the parent s state at the time of the fork

1238799
children	parent
so if the parent has a counter or other property then the children will see the value at the time of they were forked but not if the parent subsequently alters it

1238808
sat	np-complete
if you can define your problem in terms of a boolean formula you could throw a sat solver at it but note that the 3sat problem boolean variable assignment over three-variable clauses is np-complete and its first-order-logic big brother the quantified boolean formula problem which uses the existential quantifier as well as the universal quantifier is pspace-complete

1238849

1239825
versioning	upgrade
if you are deploying via clickonce even if you get around the gac issue you note above perhaps by having your it department push out a gac registration of the interop assemblies if this is a corporate environment you will need to handle situations where users have a different versioning of office than the standard -- and heaven help you when office 13 comes out and users start to upgrade and it breaks your application

sorting	filtering
paging filtering and sorting right now happen within the sql query

1240851
hash	md5
the password is hash md5 and stored in the registry

1240852
hash	md5
i thought that it wasn t possible feasible to decrypt md5 hash

1240858
ubuntu	linux
where are include files stored - ubuntu linux gcc

1240859
width	height
.moo .attr href width 600 height 300e

1240869
hash	md5
md5 is not encryption though it may be used as part of some encryption algorithms it is a one way hash function

1240869
hash	md5
that means that there are 2 128 possible md5 hash

1240869
division	modulo
next perform integer division using some large probably primes n and take the remainder see modulo

1240869
hash	salt
that is one reason why you should always salt hash passwords so that two identical values when hash will not hash to the same value

1240871
spaces	delimiter
something like this should work - for the exact formatting you ll need to tweak the portions - add more spaces or other delimiter

1240875
hash	md5
because of the pigeonhole principle there is likely more than one value that hash to any given md5 output

1240875
hash	md5
moreover md5 is made to make it difficult to find any such reversed hash however there have been attacks that produce collisions - that is produce two values that hash to the same result but you can t control what the resulting md5 value will be

1240880
hash	md5
cryptographic hash md5 etc... are one way and you can t get back to the original message with only the digest unless you have some other information about the original message etc

1240882
hash	md5
md5 is considered broken not because you can get back the original content from the hash but because with work you can craft two messages that hash to the same hash

1240882
hash	md5
you cannot un-hash an md5 hash

1240890
hash	salt
it is pretty feasible if your passwords are hash without a salt

1240929
hash	md5
i d don t really know what excel interop can do but in standard c# .net the quickest way to hash a password in md5 format is use

1240945
superclass	subclassing
in my domain model i ve modeled the different types of benefits as subclassing with an abstract superclass which has the common properties

1241019
put	get
put this all together and you get

1241027
vmware	esx
i did a write-up about it on my blog a while back titled simulating slow wan links with dummynet and vmware esx

1241049
inherited	properties
i want to be able to generate a strongly typed class that inherited from configurationreader and exposes properties named for the keys in the xml template file

1241102
free	malloc
malloc is free to do anything it wants as long as you get your single seat

1241121
inherited	subclassing
when inherited true which is the default it means that the attribute you are creating can be inherited by subclassing of the class decorated by the attribute

1241336
comparator	comparable
you can either have your beans implement comparable in which case you just compare them directly or you create a comparator -

1241338
post	get
i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around

1241340
put	get
if you put date in a file template it will get transformed when the file is created to the current date

1241358
post	get
i m setting up an ado-based client dataset and when i try to insert a null value into a tintegerfield on post i get project raised exception class edatabaseerror with message non-nullable column cannot be updated to null

1241478
firefox	safari
i have the need to trigger the opening of the browser ie firefox safari etc context-menu via javascript

1241530
post	get
so take advantage of that feature post like 300 questions to them to get your work done

1241554
hide	show
my problem is when i hide the widgets they are hidden as intended but the custom css is used on this and as these are hidden the border still show up

1241558
ggplot2	lattice
the most obvious methods that come to my mind are to use either lattice or ggplot2

1241558
ggplot2	lattice
i think you should be fine with either lattice or ggplot2

1241564
width	height
saying that form size left bottom width height will be modified

1241567
subtraction	addition
there is a family of operators we can call assignment by xyz where xyz here represents a binary operation on operands of the same type such as addition subtraction concatenation

1241594
int	chars
in fact the table contains exactly one row and the blob column contains some valid ascii chars data a serialize d php int

1241628
post	get
when generating htlm output like you re doing to get data into the form s fields when someone is trying to edit a post or if you need to re-display the form because the user forgot one field for instance you d probably use htmlspecialchars it will escape and -- depending on the options you give it

1241628
postgresql	mysql
it is better safer to use a function that fits the engine mysql postgresql ... you are working with it ll know precisely what to escape and how

1241636
jboss	glassfish
i have done certain research using mom with jboss and glassfish but one of the most important impact was the permanent storage if you are going to use any

1241645
width	height
i m trying to reuse swing s built in html support and it works perfectly if i hard code the height passed to view.paint but i can t figure out how to determine how tall the bounds of the rendered content would be at runtime given a specific width

1241665
jobs	cron
now i wouldn t recommend this but would suggest that you use sql instead as this approach is very hacky and possible a bit insecure to run cron jobs with admin privs

1241756
mouse	keyboard
i would like to have program a timer that will count the seconds during which there is mouse movement or any keyboard movement

1241820
mouse	keyboard
it sleeps for a second before getting the information so it reports a time of around a thousand milliseconds assuming you use the mouse or keyboard to run it

1241822
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome but in ie the only thing that pops up is a box asking to download the .gz file which contains the html document for the page

1241829
bazaar	git
the merge resolution in git and in mercurial and in bazaar is very very good

1241838
post	get
however when i run these commands against the processid for a coldfusion application server on this vista64 machine i get the error message in the title of this post

1241843
filtering	grouping
grouping by month is innesessary in mysql since your month is filtering and mysql supports selecting an ungrouped column in a select list of a grouping by query returning a random value within the grouping

1241875
width	height
the height can t be calculated until the width is known

1241876
jar	manifest.mf
i suspect it s vastly simpler to find the manifest in a jar file from c# than the assembly version from java though - it s just a case of loading a zip file and finding the meta-inf manifest.mf file

1241942
uppercase	ord
i tried using a validator and transforming the value of the key event object to the uppercase letter char value using ord however i could not find any set methods

1241953
rss	feed
you could include inline blocks as part of each entry s body but this rather defeats the entire purpose of rss atom feed imo and is likely to be filtered out by many readers

1241958
public	protected
it s even neater to make the provided method private or protected depending on your needs and create public convience methods so you can hide the implementation details

1241964
rss	feed
i want to publish more data in the rss feed under different fields but cannot figure out if this is even possible

1241969
for-loop	loops
the only difference between java s for-loop syntax and c s is you can declare variables in the initialization field 1st section of loops

1241995
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox return the html supplied by the original document in this case

1241996
swt	swing
the two most popular options are swing and swt

1242005
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsview	qgraphicspixmapitem	qgraphicsscene	qgraphicspixmapitem
i am currently using a qgraphicsview with a qgraphicsscene object containing a qgraphicspixmapitem

1242031
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
maybe this can solve out the ugly delay with touchesbegan to touchesmoved

1242041
postgresql	mysql
if you are worried about the cost of purchasing a database there are very good proven open source databases out there such as mysql and postgresql that won t cost you anything

1242132
put	get
still it s another project to put in your portfolio to help you get more professional work

1242154
irc	icq
i have icq and irc applications that essentially just sit there waiting for the server to send it something

1242165
put	get
since you put the initialize_devices one on top it renders that one with higher priority which is why you always get that

1242207
post	get
i think your post table will have to get very large for the query times to really become an issue

1242243
put	get
instead you could create an attachedproperty previouslyused to put on the togglebutton s and use bindings so they get their value a bit more automagically

1242261
min	max
i suppose that old windows stored min max and close buttons icons as a truetype font

1242263
hash	md5
and then check the cookie against the column ex which contains the md5 hash in the database

1242335
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have extended both nsstring and nsmutablestring with some convenience methods using categories

1242335
nsmutablestring	nsstring
for i have implemented the ruby strip function that removes space characters at the endpoints for both but for nsstring it returns a new string and for nsmutablestring it uses the deletecharactersinrange to strip the existing string and return it like the ruby strip

1242335
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the problem is that when i declare nsstring s and run s strip it tries to run the nsmutablestring version and raises an extension

1242356
post	get
i may try to post actual working code later if i get a chance

1242374
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you ve been bitten by an implementation detail some nsstring objects are instances of a subclass of nsmutablestring with only a private flag controlling whether the object is mutable or not

1242374
nsmutablestring	nsstring
since i went through nsstring and not nsmutablestring this object is not mutable

1242376
datalist	repeater
datalist or repeater

1242390
mockups	balsamiq
we use balsamiq mockups to create our website wireframes

1242400
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to compile xdebug for ubuntu 64 for use with lampp xampp for linux

1242411
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
you can use your unit testing tool of choice nunit mbunit mstest etc

1242485
telerik	componentart
we use telerik and before that we were using componentart

1242535
int	chars
still that wouldn t work because you want a chars array for write and not a raw int which will print garbage

1242599
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i tested the layout on ie7 mozilla 3.0.1 google-chrome 2.0.xxx safari 3.1 and opera 9.51

1242613
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

1242622
switching	screens
our users were quick to point out that with the current character based interface they could have over a dozen telnet based terminal sessions going at the same time on their pc screens which enabled them to multitask or task switching with high efficiency

1242645
min	max
i would like to set different zoom min max levels for each map but

1242645
min	max
seems to set the same min max for both maps i can t set them to different levels

1242659
bazaar	svn
bazaar fundamentally works with one branch directory the branch are visible at the file system level so if you need to clone each branch from your repository not unlike svn in a way

1242693
width	height
then just set the border width and leave the height alone

1242725
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
we managed to get the code to work very well for bmp png and gif files and pf1bit pf4bit pf8bit pf16bit and pf24bit images

1242727
free	malloc
if possible it is better to do malloc free in the same scope imo it makes the code much more readable - memory allocation in c is already hard enough

1242727
free	malloc
in your case you would first malloc call the function and free after outside the function

1242739
pull	push
when i ve finished a feature i push it up to the master and then log in to the production server and pull it to the working directory there

1242741
opera	safari
opera has the best css3 support followed by webkit safari

1242741
lan	intranet
if you re writing an intranet application on a lan this would probably have a negligible impact but on a slow connection that could make your pages appear unresponsive

1242747
instances	transient
instances - save the transient instances

1242747
instances	transient
if you google object references an unsaved transient instances you will find several matches for this

1242771
for-loop	loops
to aleviate the boilerplating of the second type where the third clause was often unused and to compliment the generics introduced in java 1.5 the second of your two examples - the enhanced for-loop or the for-each loops - was introduced

1242771
for-loop	arrays
this new style for-loop can be used with arrays as well

1242852
free	malloc
if you are using linux with a recent glibc and are using that malloc you can return free d memory to the os

1242865
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so while it s not legal to change the return type of method from nsstring to void it would be legal to change it from nsstring to nsmutablestring

1242868
umbraco	dotnetnuke
we build cms s with asp.net using tools such as umbraco and dotnetnuke etc

1242910
bresenham	dda
this can also be addapted to integer math using a variation on bresenham s line drawing algorthm or dda

1242915
google-chrome	firefox
of course none of this happens in google-chrome or firefox

1242953
listview	gridview
i have a wpf listview that i am replacing the view with gridview to give me columns etc

1242981
width	height
personally i find that inline styles are usually code-smells unless used for last-minute width and height purposes in variable-size boxes situations

1243004
put	get
you can put the timer in an iframe if you can t get rid of the postback

1243023
stdout	fflush
if you write to another file handle that is also associated with the terminal and might be unbuffered make sure you first explicitly fflush stdout

1243055
post	get
if you d post a bit of each array not all 10 000 items the first 10 would do you may get more bites

1243057
postgresql	mysql
if the answer is a relational database mysql postgresql then this should be done using a sql query as it is quite trivial and much more efficient than anything you could do in php

1243069
sorting	filtering
you could do the sorting and filtering using join s and where s on the right tables

1243111
google-chrome	firefox
of course none of this happens in google-chrome or firefox

1243162
post	get
how can we get post the request to server with scriptaculous.js or prototype.js

1243173
put	get
they can put these files somewhere on their harddisk and then in the add service reference instead of entering the url to discover the service they can type in the name of the main wsdl which imports all other files and they ll get their client proxy

1243178
post	get
and for post replace get by post

1243180
powerpc	i386
even if you got around the linking to external frameworks provision the default build of regexkit.framework does not include the arm architecture in its fat binary it includes powerpc ppc64 i386 and x86_64

1243233
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but the background somehow doesn t show up in ie 6

1243234
gridview	objectdatasource
to get this working i add to create two methods one for the gridview and other for the objectdatasource as well change the select parameter from a controlparameter to a normal parameter

1243394
post	get
the scriptmethod attribute tells which method should be used to call the method post get and with formatting the response should use json or xml

1243461
int	double
if you do that everywhere you use int 3 you will then have a nice list of places which you can double click on to take you straight to the offending code

1243476
children	parent
there is an alternative solution to force each parent to have exactly either 0 or n children without materialized views using just check foreign key and uniqueness constraints

1243476
children	parent
the uniqueness constraint and the check for the child_nr field take care that a parent has at most 5 children

1243489
apache	lighttpd
it is supported by lighttpd and newer versions of apache

1243554
folder	directory
the folder where vs express installs it it s weird some c users carlo temp applications weirdnumbers9231ffc231 directory and i don t want that either

1243564
post	get
so if one user was to post product details to my service under the username randomuser65 from website www.example.com then another person that tries to access the same product details user randomuser95 and website www.tryingtostealproductdetails.com can t get accesss

1243570
config	ini
you can then simply parse the ini file and use your config settings like that

1243583
system.in	system.out
the only useful methods in a socket are getinputstream and getoutputstream but if youâ re running as a cgi you already have those theyâ re called system.in and system.out

1243592
versioning	upgrade
this will cause serious problems if it is necessary to install service packs or upgrade to a future versioning

1243603
put	get
i have tried to put in a contentplaceholder but it seems that i cannot get it to show inline with the other stuff it breaks and the content of the contentplaceholder is shown below the button instead

1243627
code128	code39
data density in code128 is better than code39 - since it gets mentioned that often in other replies

1243648
jms	jta
you can of course attach java ee functionality to tomcat but when you re sticking together jms jta ws etc

1243648
jboss	jonas	jboss	glassfish
jboss glassfish jonas etc they all provide an already tested and hopefully more stable solution than yours

1243659
installation	upgrade
so we need to build a merge module that can upgrade from .msi installation

1243672
bibtex	latex
that allowed me to use the same environment in linux and windows has some auto completion features and runs all tools latex bibtex makeindex ... automatically to fully build the project

1243731
int	chars
second requirement is that the database type for the key must be int or chars x .

1243736
spweb	spsite	sharepoint	spsite
i am writing custom activity for sharepoint workflow and i don t know how i can use current workflow item spweb or spsite

1243776
int	chars
assign each user a unique userid in your database can be int or chars

1243805
put	get
simply put you should really use taxonomy it should solve all of your problems if not you should still use it and try to solve the problems you could get using taxonomy instead of cck fields

1243814
versioning	upgrade
its certainly worth being aware of this when you upgrade from earlier to later versioning of jquery

1243821
centos	linux
i am using mod_perl on a centos linux box with perl 5.8.8

1243847
firefox	safari
silverlight is officially supported on windows ie and firefox and osx safari and firefox

1243880
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
for thread joining and waiting see here msdn look at mutex monitor manualresetevent autoresetevent

1243931
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i discovered this when a uiview s touchesbegan method is fired and there is only one finger on the screen the system will wait up to 0.25 seconds to see if the finger move far enough before it will fire touchesmoved

1243937
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with ie firefox google-chrome with the default adobe reader plugin

1244037
width	height
here is the content of xaml and i want it to scale according to video width height ratio related to the display area on web page so i select stretch uniform

1244037
width	height
another modification i made is the default automatically generated aspx test page by assign width and height explicitly 120 120

1244101
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there is solution which works in safari firefox and google-chrome

1244102
post	get
that means that if updatemodel were designed such that it did not reset non-existent form fields such as date the same behavior would mean that if the user removes the text in your date field and post it would not get updated with empty or null

1244169
min	max
#1140 - mixing of group columns min max count ... with no

1244203
folder	directory
we have now moved all the webservices into the same virtual directory folder

1244294
cvs	svn
newer tools like git have much better merge support and tracking than old-style tools such as cvs and svn

1244316
public	protected
if the shared code can use just the public interface of the class so it doesn t access private member variables protected functions etc. you should consider whether other classes might want to use the same code

1244364
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop in your code leaves a trailing at the end of the arrays

1244371
children	parent
the id of the parent is then the id of the direct children with the last character removed

1244376
getter	setter
public methods - ordered by importance first comes start and stop then getter and setter

1244411
public	protected
public protected private methods

1244411
public	protected
public protected private variables

1244411
public	protected
things that change the interface then come before this in the order public protected

1244418
nsstring	nsdata
a kind of nsdata nsstring nsnumber

1244418
nsnull	nsdata
depending on the type of data you could put in a placeholder instead of nsnull and then do a process before after loading the .plist like for example using a zero-length nsdata object to represent your nsnull in the plist

1244418
nsnull	nsdata
then after loading translate the empty nsdata back to nsnull

1244434
button	checkbox
what i would like to do this is the reason why i m interested in the api of the generic baseclasses like powerobject or windowobject is to recursively iterate over all gui elements windows tables button checkbox you name it using powerscript in powerbuilder 11.0

1244471
folder	dir
although when i launch dir c directly from the command line i get the expected result so there is no dir particular setup on my system. trying to pass a token -w or on any other option seems not to work i just get the name of the folder files contained in the drive but no other information whatsoever

1244551
solaris	bsd
solaris bsd should probably be supported too if you do it right

1244557
textmate	bbedit
i agree textmate is great for mac yet so is bbedit lots of nice features plus with html tidy it can clean up and validate your code

1244576
bazaar	git	vim	emacs
if you re doing web development you probably should use the tools every good coder use a programmable editor like vim or emacs and some version control system i d recommend using a decentralised one like mercurial git or bazaar

1244588
innodb	myisam
this is especially efficient on myisam since the is instant but even in innodb it s 10 times more efficient than order by rand

1244601
qpainter	qgraphicsscene
you can add it to a qgraphicsscene if it s not already inside one and then render the scene to a qpixmap using a qpainter

1244676
min	max
various flags are used at the windows api level to controls certain aspects of each window instance the existing of a control box border min max buttons etc. but the border width for resizable windows is determined by a system setting to ensure uniformity and is not configurable on a window by window basis

1244676
min	max
this entails rendering your own caption bar min max buttons and window border

1244737
width	height
just use the width of the char to inset from the right side and the height of the char to offset vertically between chars

1244770
width	height
if you created a usercontrol got rid of the width and height values in the xaml and override measureoverride to return an arbitrary size then place an instance of it in a canvas you would see it display at the size you returned

1244820
jqgrid	datatables
i am currently using datatables because it is easy to implement on existing html but would prefer jqgrid s theme support and hooks

1244879
info.plist	ipa
by looking at skype s info.plist file you can open it from the ipa file itunes has downloaded you can tell it has no url registered so you won t be able to call it from your application

1244888
wav	aiff
aiff has similar problems to wav files - it s unclear if any compression codecs are supported

1244888
decoder	encoder
i certainly don t want to write my own audio layer and encoder decoder just for this

1244891
explode	implode
just use php implode and explode functions and assembly reformat the string to whatever you need

1244916
for-loop	arrays
the arrays in objective-c are zero based and your for-loop is starting in 1

1245075
inherited	subclassing
my gut instinct is to use inherited define a generic panel and have subclassing for the different configurations

1245129
post	get
you can get more info on it and download the free chapter from scottgu s blog post here

1245167
client-side	server-side
asp button is a webcontrol which accomplishes the same thing with the onclick server-side event and onclientclick for client-side

1245169
filtering	grouping
the rdbms value proposition stems from sql being a relatively simple way to specify select sum count from fact join dimension where filtering grouping by dimension attribute

1245173
matlab	simulink
i have a simulink model that uses an embedded matlab function for a block and i haven t been able to figure out how to move data between the embedded matlab block and a gui in real-time while the model is running

1245174
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome it doesn t work at all

1245174
google-chrome	safari
i believe i know why this doesn t work in safari google-chrome and that s because the form s action doesn t go anywhere and the form is not submitted

1245199
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse wheel support for incrementing decrementing the current date portion

1245227
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
while it is true that the visible line surrounding an icon in a jtogglebutton can be made invisible by using setborderpainted false the same is not true for jcheckbox and jradiobutton

1245227
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
i can not use the jtogglebutton and therefore need to use either the jcheckbox or jradiobutton or some derivative of jtogglebutton i am not aware of but need the square or circle respectively to be non-visible when there is no icon on the button

1245248
uicontrol	uibutton
all examples i can find alyways use a uibutton or uislider as base for subclassing but i want to go closer to uicontrol since that s the source for what i want fast and undelayed touch coordinates

1245291
children	parent
this is what allows you to create the hashtable by iterating on the companies as children rather than iterating on them as parent

1245295
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to roll my own tool chain using recent releases on ubuntu and was hoping there was enough of a linux community here that i could get specific advice on certain problems as they come up

lxml	beautifulsoup
it has a compatibility api for beautifulsoup too if you don t want to learn the lxml api

1245368
lxml	beautifulsoup
ian bicking agrees and prefers lxml over beautifulsoup

1245368
lxml	beautifulsoup
you can even use css selectors with lxml so it s far easier to use than beautifulsoup

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what s really weird is that when you wrap the button inside another update panel the validation fires in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome or safari

1245446
prng	random
in addition even if this was not the case it is unlikely that your reference application uses the same prng that openssl uses to turn the seed file into a series of random bytes

google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
as for being able to debug your own markup and style in ie6 these are the two options that i suggest xenocode s browser sandbox virtualizes browsers ie6 ie7 ie8 ff2 ff3 google-chrome opera 9 safari 3 safari 4 on your pc without having to install the actual application and ietester which is pretty buggy but let s you render your markup in ie6 ie7 and ie8 without having to install them

1245736
width	height
the ie box model known as the traditional box model includes the padding and border in the width height of an element

1245736
width	margin
under the ie box model a box having a width of 100px with 2px padding on each side a 3px border and 7px margin on each side will have a visible width of 114px

1245736
width	height
the w3c box model which is the standard box model excludes the padding and border from the width height of an element

1245736
width	margin
under the w3c box model a box having a width of 100px with 2px padding on each side a 3px border and 7px margin on each side will have a visible width of 124px

1245737
setinterval	clearinterval
a closure-based solution using setinterval and clearinterval

1245798
post	get
unless you modified something out of the box wordpress will allow you to use get variables because it uses them too for previewing post

1245816
post	get
i suppose you could write routes that will forward all requests to a single action in one particular controller but this will then be active for all http commands either get or post or otherwise

i recently upgrade my iconworkshop versioning to 6.5 and a vs 2008 plug-in was installed

int	boolean
divisiblebyupto returns a boolean if the number i is divisible by every int up to and including n similar to your divides function

1245914
opera	firefox
edit this happens only in ie8 it works fine in ie7 firefox opera etc

1245920
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
yes svcutil.exe can be used as a replacement for xsd.exe but it sounds like you are having trouble getting generic collections to be generated

once you ve found p q r and s then scale sqrt p 2 + q 2 and you can then find the rotation from sin rotation q scale and cos rotation p scale

1246107
width	height
the problem is that your element has width 120 height 120

1246107

if you take the width and height attributes out of the usercontrol it should work as you expect

1246169
children	parent
i want to get the x y coordinates of the children relative to the parent stackpanel

1246192
superclass	subclassing
now you are no longer concerned with having some superclass responsible for building subclassing which i think is better design

1246231
portrait	landscape
but if it s a non-square object and has to move position for example if it s at position 40 60 in portrait but moves to 20 100 in landscape and maybe even needs a bit of scaling to look better then you may want to try the two-step process and see if it looks smoother

octal	decimal
php therefore gives it the decimal value of octal 2446 as a string 1318 which is not a zip code at all

1246467
rss	feed
the only solution i can come up with to your problem would be if somehow you had an rss feed of your inbox which you could then easily import and parse in your custom app and search it to return the relevant mail items

1246603
cvs	svn
is there a way to configure hudson to only execute build or post build actions if there are changes in svn cvs

1246610
prefuse	visualize
it does not provide the ready to use data structures as prefuse does but it surely scales and provides a great degree of freedom in how one would want to visualize the data

1246759
cairngorm	puremvc
after becoming familiar with it i could never go back to using a framework that makes extensive use of global-state singletons cairngorm puremvc

1246904
firefox	safari
support for older versions of firefox is a lot trickier since any workaround you created would need to be hidden from safari

1246917
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome and ie6 all have

1246928
set	bag
many valued end the set or bag

1247227
postgresql	mysql
you can connect to sqlite mysql postgresql oracle and more

1247227
apache	nginx
if you re looking for painless rails deployment with apache or nginx i d have to suggest using phusion passenger aka modrails

1247229
postgresql	mysql
a decent web application ror can handle many types of dbms s including mysql postgresql sqlite

1247231
postgresql	mysql
a lot of rails applications use mysql so support for that is very strong but there are easy options for postgresql and many other popular rdbms platforms

1247295
inherited	subclassing
that doesn t prevent subclassing but it is a strong signal to users that it is not designed for inherited and it means you have to be very careful when using the derived class

1247298
vb6	vba
vba is all late-bound it is not pre-compiled into a dll like a vb6 dll or a .net assembly

1247323
public	protected
i realize that this forces you to have a public parameterless constructor on your singleton subclass but there is no way to avoid that at compile time without a where t protected new construct

1247470
uiview	subviews
i have a subclass of uiview that has a uilabel property as one of its subviews

i like that alternative #2 lets me call the property gateway wherever i am because it gets used a lot in both the base and concrete classes and it s a short but clear name

1247624
lisp	scheme
as anton says there is no exact scheme equivalent to common lisp deftype

1247636
spaces	delimiter
i want spaces to be the delimiter and i want the search to be case insensitive and i want special characters such as

1247666
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
i think the issue may be that language designers are always balls-deep in hex octal binary whatever and just think this way

1247693
width	height
according to google page speed you should always define the width and height in the image tag

1247693
width	height
also you should always specify the same height and width as the actual image so the browser doesn t have to do any modifications to it like resizing

1247693
width	height
to prevent reflows specify the width and height of all images either in the html tag or in css

1247702
width	height
you should always specify the height and the width of an image if only to help the browser lay the page out even before the image has been downloaded

1247702
width	height
the height and width attributes give

1247716
width	height
the height and width functions gets the actual dom object height

1247723
width	height
the height and width attributes give user agents an idea of the size of an image or object so that they may reserve space for it and continue rendering the document while waiting for the image data

1247731
gif	png
problem is i get errors when i try to upload a png or gif image

1247731
gif	png
what can i do to adjust this easy if possible so that it can either work with png s and gif s or convert them before trying to work with them

1247735
google-chrome	firefox
it s likely that visual studio and ie share the same implementation so that s why you re experiencing the error in just those two programs and not in firefox or google-chrome

1247756
jar	war
i ve put the jar file under war web-inf lib and added to my classpath in eclipse and added to my html file

1247758
width	height
it seems that the width and height properties of the textifield don t respond.

1247768
width	height
the only thing that comes to mind is that the entire document hasn t loaded rendered yet therefor the element doesn t have a width and height

1247794
postgresql	mysql
the web application itself will be written with django so i have a few choices of database including mysql and postgresql

1247794
innodb	myisam
if mysql is an appropriate tool for the job i would also like to know if it makes sense to use innodb or myisam

1247794
innodb	myisam
i understand the basic differences between the two but some sources say to use myisam for speed but innodb if you want a real database while others say all modern uses of mysql should use innodb

1247801
innodb	myisam
innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

1247866
realloc	malloc
the c solution is to use malloc instead of new -- this makes realloc available

1247867
realloc	malloc
you can do this using the function realloc though that may only work for memory allocated with malloc rather than new

1247911
itunes	iphoto
cathy shive has created a framework called ktuikit which was designed with single window applications modeled after iphoto itunes etc

1247950
post	get
i have some idea from the previous post that were talking about making a hash value for each array i and then compare the hash to get the unique array but i don t know what i can do exactly

1247996
width	height
other svgs might benefit from a new viewbox derived from the advertised width and height these are often the same numbers

1248063
move	drag
it seems like jquery grid bug google map if i clic the map the litle hand will stay closed and drag the map in the way i move the mouse no mather if i m not clicking anymore

1248098
onchange	onkeyup
however when i use the firebug i do not see any onkeyup or onchange

1248098
onchange	onkeyup
and notice that they input tags have no onkeyup or onchange properties

1248100
keydown	keyup
i finally figured out that keypress has a better compatibility than keydown or keyup on linux platform

1248100
keydown	keyup
i just changed keyup keydown to keypress so all went well

1248103
spaces	delimiter
i want spaces to be the delimiter and i want the search to be case insensitive and i want special characters such as

1248116
children	parent
the css spec dictates that if a parent element is hidden all children will be hidden also even if they are set to display block or any other valid display value or are absolutely positioned

1248122
versioning	upgrade
i cannot upgrade to a newer versioning of mysql

1248136

facebook most likely has some external or internal javascript code that subscribes to the onkeyup onkeypress and onblur events of its input fields

1248149
gif	png
edit does need to include jpg png and gif file types

1248206
google-chrome	firefox
the good thing about selenium is that you can drive firefox google-chrome and ie rather than being restricted to ie which was the case with watin the last time i looked at it

1248233
interbase	firebird
it has all the tools and sources necessary to install uninstall start stop firebird interbase and also to get the version of the server and more

1248256
gif	png
and it supports jpeg png gif gd .

1248265
getter	setter
most implementations of javascript don t support creating getter setter properties so it wouldn t be super useful on the web

1248265
getter	setter
edit let me just clarify writing getter setter is syntactic sugar over the use of a getfoo setfoo foo style property

1248277
short	base
when your manager doesn t really care about the maintainablity and extensibility of current code base instead they care much about if they would be able to deliver the product on schedule especially for the project with short and tight schedule

1248357
inherited	properties
i d like to create a custom datamodule in delphi a tdatamodule like maybe inherited class which would have a custom grid based design interface one component per line some properties as columns

1248670
memcached	apc
below the friend list is already in the query the reason for that is i plan to get the friend list into an array and store it in memcached or apc cache so it will be 1 less query

1248712
komodo	aptana
if you re looking for ides pick either komodo or aptana

1248856
firefox	safari
it comes as a java command line tool and allows you to remote-control both firefox ie and safari

1248856
mechanize	hpricot
although it is officially a browser based web-testing tool it can be very useful for crawling and scraping ajax-based web applications and for all sort of automated tasks otherwise difficult to accomplish with non graphical http clients such as curl hpricot and mechanize

1248862
rss	feed
for example if i pass it i want it to tell me that it isn t a valid rss feed

1248897
division	multiplication
in theory this is faster precomputing the constant to do multiplication instead of division

1249083
hide	show
for expediency i d love to be able to do this server-side so i can just show hide an asp panel accordingly

1249093
post	get
if you want te freedom of passing variables as either get or post you can use the _request superglobal

1249133
width	height
it should default to uniform which sounds like what you require however from your description you may either have it set to fill which will fill the cell resulting in cropping none showing it as the original or have specified the image width or height this may override the stretch

1249133
width	height
setting it to uniform or leaving out the stretch property and not specifying the width or height will mean it will resize to the maximum possible with out being cropped from either direction

1249134
min	max
aggregation can be by sum min max etc

1249144
rss	feed
i have worked extensively with rss and atom feed but haven t used any special class to handle.

in opera safari google-chrome and firefox this works fine the html background shows through and the flash mouse over events are still received

1249234
nodevalue	innerhtml
you could create an element assign the encoded html to its innerhtml and retrieve the nodevalue from the text node created on the insertion

1249284
perl	tcl
tcl tk started as a side project to demonstrate that api compatibility with perl tk was possible

1249284
perl	tcl
that s great if you know tcl as there are very few surprises introduced by the bridge to perl but if you don t it s awkward to translate from an unfamiliar language

1249322
fastcgi	scgi
i m building a browser game in c++ and yes some parts definitively suck such as using fastcgi which does not support multiple connections at once unless you re implementing your own fastcgi-handler cgi even worse scgi doesn t support multiplexing either but is a charm to implement and using a custom server api isn t portable however once you have the environment set up developing isn t that difficult

1249333
easymock	powermockito
powermockito extends easymock and allows you to mock concrete types even final and static methods

1249333
easymock	powermockito
powermockito is a framework that extend other mock libraries such as easymock with more powerful capabilities

1249363
rational-numbers	fractions
as a further twist as you appear to want fractions results while the input values are integers remember to use a fractions rational-numbers type for your computations - not sure if c# comes with one but worst case you can find plenty on the net

1249407
octal	hex
these power of 2 numbers also look nice in octal or hex notations

1249413
debian	linux
i m running debian linux and for a lua script i need to create a sha256 checksum to authenticate requests to amazon web services

everything works fine in development but in production this method is never invoked and i get an http 500 error when trying to post a comment

1249448
getter	setter
- you need to declare the property dynamic and implement the getter setter like so

1249450
dictionary	map
to check if it s a dictionary you can call a instanceof map

vb.net	vb6
i am currently converting an old vb6 application to vb.net prefer to work in c# and have been developing in .net a fair amount

1249577
vb.net	vb6
coming from familiarity with vb6 c# and vb.net are the same on the back end and vb.net would be a better choice for you i prefer c# if you care

hide	show
by displaying a certain amount of text at the top in one div and being able to show and hide the other half of the text with a slide effect

1249594
folder	directory
checkout the repository to a local folder not the webserver directory because you don t want people to be able to access .svn folder

1249594
dreamweaver	phped
some editors such as dreamweaver or phped can save to both your working directory and also your webserver directory ftp or otherwise in one key short cut.

1249594
folder	directory
this is really bad because your .svn folder will end up on the webserver directory

1249600
vb.net	vb6
microsoft did a lot to make vb.net easy for vb6 developers to pick up on so you can easily code on vb.net very similarly to what you did in vb6

1249618
division	modulo
on machines that don t implement a division modulo instruction that little could take several hundred cycles so you would need something like

1249626

jsf	seam
from what i have read it seems that seam is the next step of jsf

1249638
perl	tcl
so we used perl just because it was easy to do string manipulation some of us even used tcl shudder

1249652
postgresql	mysql
i don t like mysql because there are so many ways you can get bad data into the database where postgresql is intolerant of that behavior see comparing speed and reliability the bad myisam behavior is just a subset of the concerns there

1249652
postgresql	mysql
given how fractured the mysql community is now and the uncertainties about what oracle is going to do with it you might want to consider taking a look at postgresql just so you have some more options here in the future

it affects performance on safari as well when i try -webkit-box-shadow though it isn t as noticeable as in firefox

1249756
hide	show
instead just toggle its visibility with show and hide

1249761
getter	setter
kmiyashiro is mostly right except for the getter and setter for the class name

1249761
getter	setter
check out this list for more getter and setter

1249765
profiling	instrumentation
if you are doing this via profiling instrumentation setilfunctionbody then you need to supply a new il code map as well setilinstrumentationcodemap so that the debugger becomes aware of the il modification

1249769
public	protected
to have the compiler satisfied you might override or new the baseclass method as public not a good advise if method is protected in baseclass

1249789
post	get
edit 2 8 10 09 apologies if this is incorrect usage i couldn t get the interface to allow me to post an answer nor could i add a comment.

1249838
post	get
if you opt for vb.net you will end up learning c# in a round about way anyway as you get increasingly frustrated attempting to find articles books forum post etc with examples in vb

int	chars	int	boolean
boolean are chars not bytes or other int value despite yes and no being 1 and 0 respectively

1249885
getter	setter
i am trying to read write that string from my view class but it s giving me error about getter setter method not found

1249930
jar	war
the jar could be in another jar war or a temporary directory

1249970
direct3d	directx
note that managed directx and xna are limited to the direct3d 9 feature set which is somewhat difficult to use for gpgpu

1250008
lisp	scheme
while common lisp supports a functional programming style that is not its general focus scheme while not purely functional is much closer

1250038
merb	ruby-on-rails
hello ruby ruby-on-rails merb developers

1250060
post	put
same is for put post operations

1250066
cairngorm	flex
specifically with flex you should lookup the model locator pattern with cairngorm

1250071
public	protected
with delphi it s things like prefixing private variables with f and putting private declarations before protected which in turn are before public ones etc etc

1250074
post	put
the same arguments apply for put post .

1250094
client-side	server-side
you can do this server-side or client-side with javascript

1250108
min	max
the max - may need to be a min again i m not clear on your exact requirements

1250121
draggable	droppable
i will be adding scriptaculous draggable and droppable effects to allow interaction by moving many dynamically generated divs from one div to another

1250160
width	margin
both of the last two divs have a 50 width no margin and no padding

1250172
width	height
the solution to escaping is to give the containing element a height or width any will do it will stretch to fit so usually 1 is what i use.

1250172
width	margin
also if setting widths keep in mind that any borders or margin you set are in addition to the width of the elements so if you set two divs at 50 with a border or margin you will get a line break

1250175
ubuntu	linux
if you aren t on linux you can use virtualbox to create a ubuntu vm

1250209
websphere	ibm
i m using ibm rad as the ide and websphere application server v6.0 to deploy applications

1250211
saucelabs	browserstack
browserstack and saucelabs

1250234
chown	chmod
edit 2 you can change permissions with the chmod and chown commands

1250269
post	get
the event log stopped reporting that the post size exceeds allowed limits but i still get the same behavior in the browser ie or ff the connection to the server was reset while the page was loading. i m using vs2008 and the built-in web server not iis

1250347
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
lxml is a wrapper on very fast c libraries libxml2 and libxslt and is generally considered superior to the built in ones

1250350
hide	show
i can add all the labels buttons interface and then hide show them at events

1250375
vim	emacs
powerful editors such as emacs and vim seem very popular among python programmers

1250375
getter	setter
this may confuse java programmers because in java each file generally requires boilerplate code such as a package statement getter and setter

1250375
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are very powerful and general but have a steep learning curve

1250412
ubuntu	linux
i assume i ll need to use the gcc but don t know what else i need on my ubuntu linux workstation to get this going or how to compose the files

1250425
mp4	h.264
newest flash player can use the excellent h.264 codec what youtube uses for hq and hd video in mp4 container take a look at this tutorial

1250429
vim	emacs
me i use vim i have to admit emacs is at least as powerful but my fingers are deeply trained by over 30 years of vi and any other editor gives me the jitters especially when it tries to imitate vi and never really manages to get it 100 right

1250435
addition	multiplication
specifically scalar vector multiplication of your parameter t and the vector n and vector addition of a and t n

1250454
aho-corasick	rabin-karp
i suggest to start with reading the aho-corasick and rabin-karp wikipedia pages and then decide whether that would make sense in your case

1250522
boost	stl
i am fairly good with c++ stl and boost

1250522
boost	stl
i like stl boost style very much and i use them with c++ whenever i can in uni projects

1250522
boost	stl
qt does have a good collection of containers but i am greatly familiar with stl boost stuff

1250527
getter	setter
well in the second case you re adding a getter setter method for that particular iboutlet

1250527
getter	setter
any time you add a getter setter method you almost always want to have it set to retain for memory management issues

1250531
button	checkbox
this will take all text checkbox radio button etc and add them to an appropriate value to be sent

1250533
put	get
and if you put an empty path string you get even closer to ordinary string concatenation

1250544
subtract	add
then for every next bit subtract the first bit from the sum and add the next bit and see if the sum matches the pattern s sum

1250589
boost	stl
yes qt works just fine with both boost and the stl

1250589
boost	stl
however nothing prohibits you from using stl boost counterparts of the qt constructs or functionality therein that qt lacks

1250589
qstring	qvector
for example a qstring can be converted to a std string and a qvector can be used with std for_each

1250593
accessor	properties
there isn t any difference between the way those two interface definitions work until you start using the accessor provided by the properties

1250594
width	height
i have some divs with just a width height and border

1250605
width	height
also setting the width and height of the div is probably a good idea too

1250613
onclick	onkeydown
you could add an onclick eventhandler to anchors on your page that remove your onbeforeunload event to avoid it and you might be able to do the same with an onkeydown event on the window body page however i don t believe there s a way to catch users pressing the browser s refresh button

1250630
google-chrome	firefox
jquery ajax default browser behavior happens in ie firefox google-chrome

1250681
post	put
first off you re sending a post with curl but you ve got the magic _method parameter on your url and it s set to put

1250681
put	get
if you re using a standard restful controller that makes good sense because you re accessing a member people 12 which by default only allows get put and delete

1250722
folder	directory
you can do this by deleting the .netbeans folder in your user directory in c documents and settings

1250767
gridview	sqldatasource
my problem is that when you use the sqldatasource wizard to connect the paramters to the gridview control it doesn t let you select which datakey of the gridview to bind it to

1250805
uiview	subviews
the uitextfield will also be a subviews of the top level uiview so it will have an additional retain on it being in the subviews array of the top level view so at this point the text field has been retained twice

1250810
strcpy	malloc
malloc could return null and strcpy could try to copy data to memory address 0

1250823
int	chars
the toupper function expects its input to be an int in the range of unsigned chars 0 - 255 while in some cases a chars variable can be in the range of a signed chars -128 - 127

1250824
ffmpeg	libavformat
for programmatic decoding encoding you might want to check out libavformat libavcodec and libavutil parts of the ffmpeg project

1250827
int	chars
a signed chars above 127 would be treated as if it were a negative number if you did not cast it to unsigned chars since the argument is an int

1250937
django	web2py
and web2py is more lightweight than django rails whatever on pretty much all counts

1251011
disk	ram
the narrow part is important because the clustering key will be added to each and every index page for each and every non-clustered index on your table - and if you have a few of those and a few million rows in your table this amounts to a massive waste of space - and not just on your disk but also in your sql server s ram

1251043
int	double
you could specialize lexical_cast for int and double types

1251043
strtol	strtod
use strtod and strtol in your s specializations

1251047
tcplistener	tcpclient
for transferring the files data you can use the tcpclient tcplistener classes which is nice abstractions over the grittier socket functionality

1251051
int	boolean
source and target being of whatever type you want including built-in types like boolean or int which is possible in c++ because of templates

1251053
folder	directory
if the jar will always be in that directory you can use a full path my folder rybka.exe

1251093
rtp	rtcp
you have to manage an rtcp connection and a rtp connection per channel audio video

1251093
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp
it is pretty complex to code a rtsp rtcp rtp stack from scratch

1251109
strtol	atoi
boost.spirit 2.1 which is to be released with boost 1.40 seems to be very fast even faster than the c equivalents strtol atoi etc

1251130
hide	show
you could hide show each panel when required

1251135
put	get
note the storyboard sitting in the resource of the second rectangle i couldn t get it to work inside the controlstoryboardaction.storyboard but it did work if i made the rectangle a contentcontrol and put it in the template

1251176
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox google-chrome and even ie6 7

1251177
stdout	stderr
you can pass streamconsumers to capture the stdout and stderr the commandline handling will pass the output to the consumers one line at a time

1251218
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
everything works fine with firefox 3 ie6 ie7 ie8 opera 9 and google-chrome but i have issue with firefox 1 firefox 2 and seamonkey

1251261
stdout	stderr
note that you should consume stdout and stderr concurrently to prevent blocking

1251261
stdout	stderr
note that you may be able to get away with just taking stdout and not stderr

1251297
unix	aix
it uses dir -c on windows df -kp on aix hp-ux and df -k on other unix

1251308
solaris	aix
the pattern could lead to subtle compilation error across compilers and as i currently work both on windows visual c++ linux g++ oracle solaris cc and aix xl this is not acceptable

1251352
superclass	subclassing
what i also found irritating was the fact that self is always the subclassing even when called in the superclass

1251352
superclass	subclassing
from this i first expected the code from the superclass is executed in the context of the subclassing

1251374
getter	setter
and provides a getter and a setter to it

1251386
put	get
put a clearing div where you need it at the bottom of your div and get on with life

1251416
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

1251435
google-chrome	firefox
the username and password user entry controls show left justified in the panel in firefox and google-chrome but internet explorer shows them centered in the panel

1251449
multiton	singleton
the multiton pattern is a variation on the singleton pattern but that allows for n instances of an object

1251449
multiton	singleton
much like how the singleton class has a static variable to hold the single instance the multiton is often implemented with a static array or map of instances depending on how you want to access the instances - arrays only allow for numerical access but by using a map you could provide string keys to your instances making them named

1251460
button	checkbox
i am trying to add a checkbox in a listview with value as ids of the records from the database so i can allow the user to check the ones they want to delete and when they click the delete button i can get value collection of checkbox with request.form

1251462
client-side	server-side
telerik and infragistics both have extensive control libraries for asp.net that include both server-side and client-side components

1251469
hash	md5
md5 always creates a 128 bit hash

1251471
hash	md5
you can just take as much of the md5 hash as you need and throw the rest away

1251472
folder	directory
i would like to be able to add two different additional include directory so that if i have the file on my local machine midl will take that version otherwise it will take the file from the server so chdir ing to the root folder is not an option

1251488
hash	md5
however if you re interested in losing fewer bits of fidelity and thereby decreasing the risk of collisions you could take the 128 bit value returned by the md5 hash and encode it using ascii85 also known as base85 encoding instead of a hexadecimal-based encoding

1251488
hash	md5
after obtaining the md5 hash from the md5.computehash call you can use jeff atwood s ascii85 encoder

1251499
put	get
now in order to get a list of all the users in the mailing list i cannot simply do a database query as the asp.net profile table is simply put awful

1251502
pop-up	dialog
after some use visual studio 2008 when opening a solution that is checked into visual studio team foundation will pop-up a dialog saying

1251524
bash	subshell
edit the motivation for this question is a bash script that does export -f foo and then uses perl in a subshell to invoke the function directly via system foo

1251535
versioning	upgrade
go around and get everyone upgrade to the latest service pack for your vs versioning

1251552
inherited	properties
instead of setting strangearray.prototype to array.prototype this will let you set strangearray.prototype to a new instance of array so it inherited array.prototype s properties without calling array s constructor

1251568
children	parent
if the parent owns the children and there s no possibility of creating a child without a parent then it should be just parentdao and no childdao at all

1251574
width	height
i have a div with fixed width and height where i need to put text from database

1251580
subtract	add
add subtract

1251586
x86	64bit
you need to set the project to compile for x86 processors since on x64 systems the 64bit webbrowser is used which when i last checked didn t have a working flash plugin yet

1251595
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i ve read on the wiki that the accepted path of xd_receiver.html depends on the browser and firefox accept the full path while ie opera and safari want a path relative to the current page like xd_receiver.html or .. xd_receiver.html

1251602
getter	setter
no default constructor no getter setter noise just a pojo with my own annotations

1251651
trie	tree
you can also check out patricia trie or radix tree algorithms

1251669
folder	directory
i have a external js file named test.js that i have kept in script folder in my root directory

1251690
post	put
to put the results in the order you want is not so easy because the first ordering key is the created_date of the thread-starter post

1251703
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
one other asp.net button one checkbox with autopostback property true one dropdownlistfor with autopostback property true

1251784
jobs	cron
i want to programatically change the hour which certain cron jobs execute

1251784
jobs	cron
here is the command which has been working with all of my current cron jobs during debugging

1251819
post	get
scott hanselman has a good post on doing a hybrid version of debug and release that could get you the best of both worlds here

1251912
mockups	balsamiq
for mockups i go with paper and pen or a cheap whiteboard substitute but balsamiq is an interesting tool for creating mockups

1251924
hash	salt
it has info like their alias their email address their salt password hash and all the usual candidates

1251970
put	get
edit for those that want to use this code you d have to put something in your controller in order to set session has_location true when you get the location

1251973
getter	setter
if you ever have problems with myproperty it s easy to add logging code to the setter or even getter to find out every time it s changed or even accessed

1251993
profiler	yourkit
you might try a memory profiler such as yourkit

1252008
innodb	myisam
1 is myisam the other innodb

1252016
accessor	properties
properties accessor hiringcompany on

1252034
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
however you can use a plain uitabbar and implement your own view switching in a uiviewcontroller subclass rather than a uitabbarcontroller

1252047
listview	gridview
i have wpf listview with gridview view and i want to remove any trace of row highlight

1252047
listview	gridview
in this case of listview gridview i am unable to find the corresponding chrome and template to change

1252056
ubuntu	debian
i have used pdftk before for such concatenations as pdftk happens to be readily available to debian ubuntu

1252077
jsf	seam
it s not correct to say the seam is the next step of jsf. seam doesn t have to use jsf as the view layer

1252077
getter	setter
excessive calls to getter setter

1252077
jsf	seam
there are more than enough pages detailing the shortcomings of jsf elsewhere note that these aren t criticisms of seam - rather of jsf1.x and many are resolved in jsf2.0

1252077
jsf	seam
i don t believe that seam is the next step for jsf but it and facelets are crucial if you re planning to use jsf1.x right now

1252094
google-chrome	firefox
and here s the correct layout as rendered by firefox and google-chrome .

1252116
rss	feed
i d like an rss feed from this google scholar search scholar fish oil search

1252125
post	get
i would like to get the name of the form used to post parameters from a java httpservletrequest object

1252126
jsf	seam
i like jsf and i evaluated seam not long ago

1252126
jsf	seam
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3

1252126
jsf	seam
also icefaces is great with jsf and facelets it works perfectly well with or without an application framework like seam or spring

1252129
rss	feed
see 7 tools to make an rss feed of any website

1252134
int	chars
but what if i use chars instead of int

1252135
innodb	myisam
i need to implement something like a full text search on a couple if index s in a large products table using innodb myisam is not an option due to its lack of transactions and relationship support

1252140
put	get	post	put	post	get
i put the variables email and password from post to get such that

1252159
google-chrome	firefox
this is my first jquery script which works great in firefox and google-chrome but fails in internet explorer

1252159
rss	feed
the first script is a jquery plugin that parses rss feed for me

1252159
rss	feed
the effect is that an rss feed containing the path to a random image in the item s description is used to set the background of the div #page

1252159
rss	feed
the rss feed is generated by the cck and views module

1252161
subscript	superscript
wpf has the typography.variants attached property that lets you do superscript and subscript

1252161
getter	setter
i also didn t see anything obvious on fontfamily and the only thing i could find on typography was the variants attached property itself and its getter and setter

1252182
int	boolean
the boolean is one byte and the int is four bytes

1252186
maven	pom.xml
there s a maven pom.xml that references flickrj by name you may find the listed dependencies useful

1252186
maven	pom.xml
you can also see the dependencies for flickr-api a wrapper for flickrj in its maven pom.xml

1252206
width	height
image name image type image width image height image horizontal resolution image vertical resolution image bit depth and finally actual image data

1252218
width	height
i kinda thought that image.thumbnail does it but what it did was that it scaled my image to 150 px by its width leaving height 100px

1252229
width	height
in pixels given as a width height

1252293
post	get
i ve never seen this before i ve always known there was either get or post

1252315
post	get
htmlâ s method attribute only allows get and post

1252328
post	get
but i assume the only useful response would be a 301 redirect but that could also be used with get or post so i don t see how head would solve any issues

1252328
firefox	safari
a quick test in the current versions of both safari and firefox on a mac shows that actually a get is invoked

1252328
post	get
maybe for some time spam robots were in fact fooled into using head which would then be rejected on the server or might be fooled into skipping this form if they would only support get and post

1252420
width	height
you could set the width and height of the parent page s html and body tags to 100 as well as the iframe tag that contains the page you want to load

1252450
mouseover	mouseout
here is a working example it just uses a click to change it once but i ll leave the mouseover mouseout to you - you may want to speed up the animation

1252452
width	height
although the tab panel properly occupies 100 width it ends up scaling its height to the interior flextable rather than forcing scrollbars upon it

1252461
post	get
if you re not sure which request method was used use the superglobal which contains both get and post variables example

1252518
webclient	webrequest
in response to the comments you said you are using webclient - that is considerably more substantial than using webrequest

1252534
disk	ram
maybe you could run the tests on a db stored on the disk but using a ram disk

1252534
disk	ram
in windows you can install a driver to set up a ram disk some instructions here

1252534
disk	ram
a ram disk will act exactly like a hard disk but will operate completely from memory so that you will lose some of the overhead of loading files to from the hard disk

1252550
junit	testng
note that i am only interested in developer tests written with junit or testng

1252563
fadein	fadeout
the fadeout and the fadein function have a complete handler you need to use for example

1252567
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout cause asynchronous animations so javascript continues executing further statements while those effects occur

1252582
bitwise-and	modulo	division	modulo
bastien lã onard s answer has a more idiomatic function to do the conversion using bitwise-and instead of modulo 2 bit-shifting instead of division and the ternary operator instead of if else

1252585
free	malloc
for this particular case i wouldn t bother with malloc since you free in the same function

1252585
stdout	stderr
error message should probably go to stderr rather than stdout

1252605
put	get	post	put	post	get
put another way as soon as the page knows whether it s been called via get or post it will know the correct super-global to retrieve the id from

1252605
post	get
in fact there may be some pages that will always be called with post and others always with get

1252659
cairngorm	puremvc
also i ve looked into puremvc cairngorm and these methods seem equally tedious except with another layer of abstraction

1252702
ubuntu	debian
if you don t find anything i d suggest using your distribution s tools to obtain the source that corresponds to the binary that you have installed on your sytem apt-get source libgtk-2.0 on debian or ubuntu

1252731
udp	mtu
udp s maximum transmission unit mtu size is 64kb

1252738
cos	sin
if t 90 degrees then cos 90 0 and sin 90 1

1252742
x86	64bit
you could get the 64bit drivers installed or run the package use the 32-bit version of dtexec located in c program files x86 microsoft sql server 100 dts binn

1252743
post	put
they post partial xaml code i can t even put into my xaml code correctly vs highlights them in red

1252756
udp	mtu
although the ip layer may allow udp packets of up to 64k in size i think you will find that the maximum in the wild udp packet size will be limited to the smallest mtu of the devices in between your source and destination

1252756
icmp	udp	udp	mtu	mtu	icmp
if you are determined to use udp you will have to implement path mtu discovery in your protocol and prey that the routers firewalls don t block the fragmentation needed icmp packets

1252756
mtu	icmp
but like i said i ve seen cases in the past where fragmentation needed icmp packets are blocked or discarded and i had to manually tweak my own mtu

1252762
gmail	hotmail
i tested gmail outlook 2000 2007 yahoo old new hotmail thunderbird successfully

1252808
cpython	ironpython
ironpython has real multithreading unlike cpython and it s gil

1252881
pop-up	dialog
instead of worrying why the dialog doesn t pop-up add a class library project to your solution that references your testing framework

1252915
int	double
but this only works for double well int work too because of the implicit type conversion

1252964
children	parent
i write the parent object to xml which of course involves among other things writing out its children in no particular order and due to the possible circularity i replace these references between the children with unique ids that each child has

1252980
dictionary	map
as each object comes out shove it in a dictionary or map with the uid as the key

keydown	keyup
instead of only looking at keydown events any solution which is going to be caring about multiple keys at once is going to have to be looking at both keydown and keyup events and keeping track of the state of the keys in question

1253013
int	double
because of implicit type conversions like float to richfloat you can even use your sort function on lists of int or float or double

1253039
uiview	calayer
in my answer here i describe a way to apply a glow effect to any text or vector elements drawn within a uiview or calayer

1253059
iprincipal	iidentity
our identity model relies on the iidentity and iprincipal classes not the windowsidentity windowsprincipal so using an alternative identity implementation is fine

1253071
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy - you should use strncpy instead to explicitly define the number of bytes to copy and avoid a buffer overflow

1253080
fgets	strtol	fgets	fgetc	strtol	fgetc
a better alternative here is to use an input function like fgets or fgetc to read chunks of input then scan it with sscanf or parse it with string handling functions like strchr and strtol

1253080
strcat	gets	printf	strcpy
strcpy strcat and printf suffer from a similar problem to gets - they don t allow you to specify the size of the destination buffer

1253080
printf	strncpy
it s still possible at least in theory to use them safely - but you are much better off using strncat and printf instead you could use strncpy but see above

1253120
udp	tcp
you mention datagram in your question which implies that you are using connectionless udp sockets not tcp

1253153
put	get
i work on c# window ...vs05 ......i want to put space on enum string ....i do it below code have this.....my problem is after select a value from the combo how can i get the index number of this value .....and if i gone to edit mode then i need to show the value what is user already selected .....how to get enum selected value on basis of index number

1253188
strcpy	strncpy
most people agree that strcpy is dangerous but strncpy is only rarely a useful replacement

1253203
post	get
you could use one site for login purposes and exchange data via post or get but you d still have to maintain two separate cookies

1253248
mouse	keyboard
but to handle all the events keyboard and mouse you have to use javascript

1253277
public	protected
there is no reason to specify public private protected since it will always be public as interfaces cannot have non-public members

1253293
width	height
the problem is actually that the table is set to 100 width height when you set it as a tab child

1253293
width	height
overflow only works if you set the width height using pixels

1253305
pop-up	dialog
if that is the case then you should keep in mind that the user may not respond to your dialog for some time after it pop-up

1253350
int	double
the master key generated consists of 5 numbers 4 double precision floating-point values between 0 and 1 and 1 int between 1 and 1 000 000 000

- sin yaw 2 sin pitch 2 cos roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
q2 cos yaw 2 sin pitch 2 cos roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
+ sin yaw 2 cos pitch 2 sin roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
q3 sin yaw 2 cos pitch 2 cos roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
- cos yaw 2 sin pitch 2 sin roll 2

1253366
jsf	seam
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above

1253366
jsf	seam
see this article for details speed up your data-driven jsf seam application by two orders of magnitude - part 1

1253366
jsf	seam
since seam 3 is imminent and supposed to make use of 2 new specs jsf 2 and webbeans that leaves questions on what happens to projects on seam 2 and how long it will take for things to get stable

1253402
hide	show
this article showed me the light show hide performance

1253526
versioning	upgrade
from a corporate perspective sometimes its a big decision to upgrade to a later versioning of ie - the use of an internal bespoke web client being one reason

1253566
hide	show
then show hide populate the controls there

1253597
disk	ram
since cpu util is low the cause of the problem could be that the app was swapped to disk and the gc run forced it back into ram

1253621
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo is a common standard that tool implementers can follow to ensure compatibility in the same way that html is the common standard for web pages xslt is the standard for xml-to- translation etc

1253621
xsl-fo	xslt
if your html can be considered well-formed xml ie short tags are closed properly such as br and img - not br and img then you should be able to use xslt to translate that directly to xsl-fo which you can then pass directly to a tool like apache fop for conversion

1253742
set	bag
to prevent this problem you must use a bidirectional association with the many valued end the set or bag marked as inverse true

1253742
set	bag
please note that nhibernate does not support bidirectional one-to-many associations with an indexed collection list map or array as the many end you have to use a set or bag mapping

1253742
set	bag
otherwise you might have to map your collection as a bag or set instead of a list

1253747
hide	show
in each of them is a picture where i have an onmouseover onmouseout event on it which show a message in a div and hide the message

1253747
mouseover	mouseout
my problem is after a user moves quickly from left to right over a lot of images all mouseover and mouseout events of the images are executed which looks stupid.

1253766
mouseover	mouseout
we ve had the exact same problem what we ve done is on the mouseover event is to set a variable _mouseon to true set to false on mouseout then set a onetime event over that fires in say 500 ms

1253770
opera	firefox
it doesn t work only in firefox opera and ie8 are ok

1253794
put	get
to be restful you have to follow rules like get for read put for create etc.

1253832
nunit	moq
for a long time we had only .net 2.0 assemblies and applications but still created .net 3.5 sp1 class library projects for testing with nunit and moq

1253883
gcov	lcov
i m unable to make any suggestions on this for windows but for linux projects i highly recommend gcov and lcov

1253885
hide	show
since now you won t be able to rely on event-model and will have to manually code lots of javascript to interconnect controls enable disable repopulate show hide etc.

1253910
onclick	onkeyup
to generalize the question javascript events are handled by associating an event type onclick onkeyup onfocuse etc with a function or multiple functions

1253990
pthreads	fork
i would suggest gradually moving to more cross-platform libraries like as you suggested refactoring pthreads to boost thread or going from fork to multi-process with ipc probably also using boost s facilities

1254003
multiplying	subtract
oftentimes pay periods are on the 15th and the end of every month so in that case you d count the number of months and multiplying by 2 checking the end conditions if start is before the 15th subtract one pay period

1254063
versioning	upgrade
the problem i have is that when we upgrade to a new versioning of our websites users may be half way with a long-running task

1254105
listview	gridview
i have a control template in xaml that contains a listview with a gridview

1254126
innodb	myisam
on a site i work on we recently switched to innodb from myisam and we found that some simple select queries which had both where and order by clauses were using the index for the order by clause resulting in a table scan to find the few desired rows but heck they didn t need to be sorted when it finally found them all

1254147
post	put
such as post put and delete in a

1254169
post	get
there is a nice paper by the w3c about this uris addressability and the use of http get and post

1254169
post	get
1.3 quick checklist for choosing http get or post

1254192
post	get
if you use complex data types then it must be in a post it cannot be in a get

1254192
post	get
using get and post where it is expected helps to keep your program understandable

1254204
daemons	launchd
you can run your server as a service windows o daemons linux and when you want the gui you have to launchd and operate with it

1254249
onfocus	onblur
you could use the onfocus and onblur events of the select box and then update the style.width property accordingly

1254274
google-chrome	safari
in the home page of my app i try to implement something like most visited websites that google-chrome safari have in their home pages

1254376
unix	solaris
if you are using any linux unix solaris os it is available unless you have explicitly not installed

1254435
equals	gethashcode
if it hasn t you might be using different object instances that represent the same actual cluster and you perhaps haven t provided a suitable equals implementation you should also update gethashcode at the same time

1254475
post	get
i managed to get a checkboxlist working and i can t somehow get the values back when i post the usual way

1254572
google-chrome	firefox

i m rather interested in the actual algorithm not ready solutions although i d be ok with taking a look at something implemented in ruby or python or relying on mysql or postgresql

1254629
put	get	post	put	post	get
it s not the same to post to an url than to get it delete it or put it

1254633
textblock	itemscontrol
is there an equivalent of itemscontrol for text content inside a textblock or flowdocument

1254655
prepare	execute
the idea behind prepare statements is that you call db- prepare once and execute can be called multiple times on the same statement object

1254672
post	get
i believe the decision for django was made because usually just get and post is enough and that keeps the framework simpler for its requirements

1254726
bash	zsh
both zsh and bash use the same less at usr bin less

1254738
width	height
in the above example i have used width 100 to give layout to ie but you could just as easily use zoom 1 or height 1 if you would rather

1254740
webrat	cucumber
i am using the selenium-client gem with webrat and cucumber to test a rails project

1254761
rss	feed
for example if the web service is more wide-ranging xml like a html document or an rss feed you want to use a parser like hpricot or nokogiri

1254822
subtract	add
solution would be to either create your dates in cocoa with the reference date of 1970 or to add subtract the offset in cocoa or php

1254847
sorting	grouping
i have list of objects i need to sort the list based on object s property1 and i need to sort again the resultant list with object s property2 without loosing the grouping done in first sorting ...

1254861
set	bag
each document is reduced to a sparse vector of pairs and you can throw a naivebayes or some other classifier at the set of vectors that represents your set of documents or compute similarity scores between each bag and every other bag this is called k-nearest-neighbour classification

1254870
jsf	seam
if you re going to be using ejb and jsf already seam is killer

1254870
jsf	seam	richfaces	icefaces
if you re going to be using jsf plus any of its related tools like icefaces or richfaces seam pojos can simplify your setup a lot as well as give you access to the life-cycle states that seam provides conversation etc.

1254870
wicket	seam
if you re using ejb with wicket or gwt seam might be able to save you some configuration as well though i ve not personally used it in this configuration

1254951
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the other thing to note about the onbeforeunload event is that at this time opera does not support it safari firefox and internet explorer do though

1254961
min	max
you could pass in the min max values but calling person.iseligable would be a better solution in my opinion

1254980
put	get
you can specify the ordering of the items within the aggregates put order by in the derived table you can group and join so you get more than one result row you can change delimiters and so on

1255035
tableview	nsoutlineview
note that nsoutlineview is a subclass of nstableview so all the tableview features work on an outline view as well

1255043
solaris	aix
here s the patch applied to esql c 3.50 on solaris - you ll need to adapt it to aix

1255045
profiling	debugging
well you can see the entire query in sql profiling admittedly that is after it s been sent to the database but it gives you an easy way to copy-paste the statement so you can debugging with that inside management studio

1255061
width	height
the reason why you can t access the width and height properties of a control with width or height set to auto is that the run time system is querying for the property values before they ve been set

1255061
actualheight	actualwidth
the properties actualwidth and actualheight claim to get the rendered height of controls so in theory you d think you could simply wait until the sl application had finished loading and then perform your query since the controls would be rendered by then and therefore the actualheight actualwidth values should be set

1255061
width	height
sizechanged is triggered whenever the width and height properties of a control are changed so if i handle that event i am guaranteed that the values are set to something other than nan

1255086
caanimation	catransition
i had a problem where i had a series of overlapping catransition caanimation sequences all of which i needed to perform custom operations when the animations stopped but i only wanted one delegate handler for animationdidstop

1255086
caanimation	catransition
however i had a problem there didn t appear to be a way to uniquely identify each catransition caanimation in the animationdidstop delegate

1255086
caanimation	catransition
when you start your animation use the setvalue method on the catransition caanimation to set your identifiers and values to use when animationdidstop fires

1255089
put	get
if you do get stuck by accident know that local admins on the application tier machine are tfs super-admins who can bypass all security checks and put things back in order

1255091
dictionary	map
the version with the synchronisation dictionary doesn t work properly as you are not protecting the map dictionary inside a lock before using it

1255091
dictionary	map
you have to protect the map dictionary inside a lock so that only one thread at a time can access it

1255094
ssl	https
java client certificates over https ssl

1255129
freebsd	linux
freebsd might be a certain way today but maybe in the next release it will copy a feature from linux that would erase the need for you to build your program two different ways

1255129
freebsd	linux
say that on freebsd these are the a and b features and on linux they re the x and y features

1255129
solaris	bsd	solaris	sunos	sunos	bsd
it could be that feature a comes from the original bsds and is in solaris because it has bsd roots from sunos in the 80 s and solaris also has feature y from it s system v based redesign in the early 90 s

1255129
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
by testing for these features your program could run on solaris too because it has the features your program needs just not in the same combination as on freebsd and linux

1255275
putty	winscp
winscp to interact with the development server with norton commander like interface as well as the good putty integration

1255291
mouseup	mousedown
now this mouseupdownfilter will fire an mouseup mousedown event when they occur on a watched control for example your textbox

1255353
innodb	myisam
for mysql the data is stored in var lib mysql or something similar path and depending on the database format you are using with myisam the database information will be stored in a directory of its same name in .frm .myi and .myd files and with innodb the database information will be stored in the ibdata1 and ib_logfiles

1255358
width	height
the danger with this is that some browsers adjust the font which can alter the width height of the font

1255366
hex	binary
i d like to append the int to the string but in human readable form hex notation rather than in binary gibberish

1255390
gcov	lcov
code coverage - gcov lcov .

1255398
innodb	myisam
the precise structure of these depends on the storage engine used typically myisam or innodb for mysql

stdout	stderr
it handles escaping of the arguments environment specific execution and allows you to attach consumers to stdout and stderr leaving you to focus on the handling

1255423
implements	extends
either make trackthread implements runnable and not extends thread anymore or just write

1255431
svg	vml
the image transformation is for browsers not supporting svg or vml

my strategy roughly involves a setting the css height of the html node to 100 and setting the background-position of the background-image to bottom

1255490
children	parent
selects all elements that are children of elements that have a class of title that are the first children of their parent in this context

1255490

1255496
debian	linux
i m using a qmail vpopmail combination on linux debian so i d rather that fire an event to my java daemon than poll the mail accounts through the java mail extensions

1255499
implements	sealed
i m trying to implements the gethttpcontext function from htmlhelpertest.cs in vb.net using rhino mocks but i m getting type httpcontextbase is not defined. the compiler suggests changing it to httpcontext but when i do that i get a run time error that a sealed class cannot be mocked

1255505
put	get	ready	each
edit all silence here so i ll add the suggestion to remove the locking and instead put each stdout_value on a queue.queue instance -- queue is intrinsicaly threadsafe deals with its own locking so you can get or get_nowait etc etc results from it once they re ready and have been put there

1255594
debian	linux
i m using a qmail vpopmail combination on linux debian so i d rather that fire an event to my java daemon than poll the mail accounts through the java mail extensions

1255603
put	get	post	put	post	get
from my limited knowledge of rest it is utilizing http get post put delete verbs to perform crud-like operations on remote resources denoted by urls which lends it into a more chatty and remote-method like style aka rpc style

1255620
mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mousedown	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	keyup	mouseleave	mousedown	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	keyup	mouseenter	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	keydown	mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseenter	mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseout	mousedown	mouseenter	mouseup	mouseleave	mouseup	mousedown	mouseup	mouseenter	keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mouseleave	keydown	mousedown	keydown	mouseenter

1255649
imap	nntp
i use the term network services to refer to things such as nntp imap pop3.

1255686
google-chrome	firefox
everything works flawlessly in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie7 haven t tested 8

1255700
gif	png
i would also put in the encoding jpeg gif png bmp... the mime type image png etcetera so you don t have to parse the file name every time

1255713
mockups	balsamiq
now i am using foreui it can create mockups like balsamiq and also able to export working html

1255744
udp	tcp
that s what a binding is a level of abstraction built on a basic protocol typically udp ip or tcp ip

1255747
cvs	rcs
i learned rcs and then cvs there and how to use make files

1255775
int	double
if the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a prototype the int promotions are performed on each argument and arguments that have type float are promoted to double

1255775
integer	unsigned
one promoted type is a signed integer type the other promoted type is the corresponding unsigned integer type and the value is representable in both types

1255775
unsigned	short	int	chars	int	double
the default argument promotions are chars and short to int unsigned int and float to double

1255805
width	height
my motivation for monitoring text size changes is to dynamically change the height or width of elements so the whole page does not require browser window scroll bars

1255818
int	chars
can fail because an int will be passed and the function expect a chars

1255818
int	chars
can fail because an int is expected but a chars will be passed

1255835
put	get
then you might just have to get your hands dirty and put timers in your code .

1255837
width	height
you can create your own button class inherited from button and make sure that every time button is created it s height is equal to width

1255837
width	height
if not - make height equal to width or width equal to height

1255864
hash	salt
in my user table i have an authentication hash column that is calculated as sha1 salt + username + password

1255864
hash	salt
hash the password the unique salt on the client via javascript before submission

1255890
hash	salt
your under ssl so you could send the credentials free text since the line is encrypted already and then apply the rules to salt hash your password for comparing server side

1255911
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby are open source implementations on top of the dlr itself open sourced on codeplex

1255926
hash	salt
hash the password the unique salt on the client via javascript before

1255933
serializable	deserialization
level datastructure to get serializable deserialization

1255933
serializable	deserialization
started and then call the serializable deserialization

1255944
stdout	fflush
when you print something which isn t n -terminated you have to fflush stdout if you want to print it immediatly

1255954
hash	salt
hash the password the unique salt on the client via javascript

1255954
hash	salt
the server generates a salt and stores the following hash

1255979
imap	nntp	udp	tcp	irc	nntp
has built-in support for tcp udp ssl tls multicast unix sockets a large number of protocols including http nntp imap ssh irc ftp and others

1255996
hash	md5
i ve tried every example i can find on the web but i cannot get my .net code to produce the same md5 hash results from my vb6 app

1256060
rss	feed
i m currently using the code below to attempt to check for a certain root node rss and a certain namespace prefix itunes but it seems to be saying that the feed is valid even when supplied with a random web page url instead of one pointing to a feed

1256064
put	get
you get the touches as a from the touchesbegan method you ll need to loop through all the touches and put them into context of your app so that you can identify them later

1256130
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
i am wondering if there are any hooks to set the position for the standard .net openfiledialog and savefiledialog which do not have a startposition property

1256139
ienumerable	ilist
if you encapsulate your database access for example using the repository pattern you could have the repositories implement a common interface and have the methods return the type you choose to use as return type such as ienumerable t or ilist t

1256139
ienumerable	ilist
since ilist t implements ienumerable t there is no problem in that direction

1256139
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable t implements ienumerable t to tolist works fine in that case as well

1256239
put	get	post	put	post	get
although there are similarities between crud operations and the http get put post delete there are subtle differences that are very significant to the architecture of your application

1256252
explode	implode
if you really want to use explode and implode you could do something like this

1256292
hash	md5
all hash in general and including md5 do not have performance dependent upon the content

for-loop	loops
where of course a for-loop can be substituted to loops over a b c ... and a small part can be memoized

1256308
firefox	safari
no you can t in firefox safari etc

1256348
stdout	stderr
after having parsed your command which includes redirected stdout stderr the shell forks opens creates the files if they don t exists

1256360
ssms	sqlcmd
enabling the sqlcmd mode from the ssms menu solved the error

1256376
ssms	sqlcmd
if you are executing this from ssms you should try enabling the sqlcmd mode from the menu before executing the script

1256432
epl	zpl
also your printer may use epl instead of zpl but zebra s guide for that is equally good

1256440
rss	feed
i am successfully parsing an rss feed with php but want to return a message when the feed is empty

1256466
submit	submission
you validate before the user submit the form in order to ensure that the submission will be valid without incurring the time cost of a full round-trip to the server

1256473
hide	show
what this does is simply hide the form so that if you show it again its already loaded into memory

1256550
width	height
if you specified the width and height in each image tag they could load all images asynchronously otherwise they had to load enough of each image to determine the size before they could continue to render the page

1256556
centos	linux
the application is in java 5 running on linux centos 5

1256579
postgresql	mysql
wikipedia runs on mediawiki software which uses php and mysql although by now mediawiki might support other sql databases such as postgresql - you ll have to check the docs

1256581
inherited	properties
by default other members methods fields properties and events inherited the cls-compliance of their type

1256581
folder	directory
this also has the side-effect of ensuring that all dependent assemblies are copied to the debug bin or release bin folder during the build so they are in the correct directory when the application is run after it has been compiled

1256656
awt	swing
swing will combine repaints for you see painting in awt and swing on sun s website

1256673
post	get
this php script can be used to communicate directly between your flash application and your mysql database using get and post vars

1256684
apache	lighttpd
you could either put them in with your media files site_media php or if you prefer to use something more lightweight for your media server like lighttpd you can set up another portion of the site that goes through apache with php enabled

1256684
urllib	httplib
from there you can either take the ajax route in your templates or you can load the php from your views using urllib 2 or httplib 2

1256702
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
it s looking like firefox and opera tested on mac as well don t like the cross domainness of this but safari is fine with it

1256743
children	parent
since this class has relationship with itself parent children automapper went crazy and threw a stackoverflow exception

1256769

uilabel	uitextview
is it possible with uilabel or do i need uitextview or something else

1256916
actualheight	actualwidth
to do this i ve tried setting the centerx and centery of the rotation to the images actualwidth 2 and actualheight 2 however i ve discovered that actualwidth and actualheight are not always populated at least not right away

1256916
actualheight	actualwidth
even using the downloadprogress event on the image doesn t seem to guarantee the actualwidth and actualheight are populated and neither does using this.dispatcher.begininvoke .

1256945
actualheight	actualwidth
to update the actualwidth and actualheight of a frameworkelement you will have to call updatelayout

1256949
memcached	apc
on a single server setup i am assuming apc would be better then memcached for this

1256974
min	max
i need to take the time from the min stop row for each shipment and the time from the max stop row and place in start end respectively

1256997
vmware	virtualbox
with the advent of vm software like vmware and virtualbox it would be much easier to sell someone like me your software if you just provided an image that i could load into the vm and run

1257029
post	get
when changing the drop down only the update panel post back to the server and when you refresh the page you can get the value out of the session

1257101
min	max
the docking won t work because you hard-coded the min max size into the control

1257159
min	max
the seqminmax cte selects the min and max stop_seq values for each shipment_id and the rest of the query then builds on those values to retrieve the associated times from the table test

1257185

x86	64bit
when we run the app on a 64bit machine we build targeting an x86 platform so we re running in the 32-bit emulator the thumbnails are fine but the main image is missing all text

1257285
min	max
i have just had a thought - since i am printing floats why would it display 3 exponent values since the max min exponent is 38

1257287
hash	md5
i have md5 hash of passwords in a database that i want to use against http auth digest

1257306
emacs	textmate
i second docgnome s suggestion of django mode and yasnippet but the real kicker that will make you never want to go back to textmate is to integrate pyflakes into your development environment at which point emacs will provide you on-the-fly notification of errors in your python code

1257306
emacs	textmate
as far as theming like textmate theming can be a bit annoying emacs

1257306
emacs	textmate
unless you truly want the exact theme you have in textmate i d grab color theme for emacs and find one that suits your fancy

1257338
prng	random
not everyone needs cryptographically secure random numbers and they might benefit more from a speedier plain prng

1257344

bde	dbase
they re supposed to be dbase version 7 but the borland bde only connects to 5.0 reliably from what i ve found

1257509
prng	random	mouse	keyboard
this is an actual real world problem btw that has been observed on headless servers which naturally have rather small entropy pools because they lack entropy sources such as mouse and keyboard input running linux where applications incorrectly use the dev random kernel cprng for all sorts of random numbers whereas the correct behavior would be to read a small seed value from dev urandom and use that to seed their own prng

1257524
folder	directory
just just tossed all the folder in one directory

1257528
subscript	superscript
most adobe fonts provide only a few alphabetical lowercase characters for things like superscript and subscript not even the entire latin alphabet mind you

1257567
yacc	bison
if you don t want to write a lexer and or parser yourself you can use lex flex and yacc bison but if you plan on that you might want to start with a somewhat smaller project

1257575
width	height
edit width and height set the viewbox attribute on the main svg element to the rectangle you want render repeat

1257588
bazaar	git
you could consider using a distributed vcs such as mercurial bazaar git

1257650
put	get
however it is certainly possible to create a mapping for a stored procedure that tells linq2sql to return entities when it s executed and put a method in your datacontext class to run the sproc and get your list of entities

1257666
gentoo	ubuntu
i use ubuntu so i did an apt-get i use gentoo too the command there is # emerge dev-util git

1257688
yacc	bison
i know with yacc that the first section allows you to define c stuff outside the control of yacc and it appears bison has a similar feature based on it s upward compatibility claim and the documentation here 2.1.1

1257709
webclient	httpwebrequest
if that is the issue you ll probably need to refactor to use the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse classes instead on webclient and configure a more reasonable timeout

1257747
mouse	keyboard
i have a normal pc and a mac mini and i want to be able to use a single keyboard mouse and a monitor with both

1257761
goto	break
you can use goto to break out of any number of loops

1257761
goto	break
using break and goto can make it more difficult to reason about the correctness of a program

1257764
min	max
addendum here s an adaptation of cptskippy s solution that may be more efficient than using min and max if you have a shipments table

1257841
hide	show
what he meant was that he has to do it manually by r-clicking on task bar then click on properties - task bar - customize notifications and then you can set behavior to always show always hide hide when inactive for each taskbar icon on the list

1257847
mouse	keyboard
my main box has 2 monitors the mouse and the keyboard

1257847
mouse	keyboard
as mentioned above i use synergy to share the keyboard and mouse between machines

1257854
lisp	scheme
same goes for python ruby c objc c++ c# haxe lisp scheme java etc

1257923
int	chars
on an elementary level glib provides type definitions replacing the c primitive types chars int float and so on in order to improve portability

1257952
dictionary	map
though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary method is much less efficient

1257958
dsl	dynamic-languages
mps blurs the lines between internal and external dsls and with this you get static typing and tool support which you wouldn t get when developing a dsl with a dynamic-languages like ruby

1257993
many-to-many	many-to-one
unfortunately my fluent syntax isn t very good but it looks like fnh is somehow regarding the relationship as a many-to-one rather than a many-to-many

1258042
post	get
it always depends on post or get

1258042
hash	md5
urllib can post to a form somewhere else if we want the rather tricky thing validate between different hash sha and md5

1258048
width	height
for example i could not find a way to define the color and thickness of the borders for each side of the button top bottom left right the background color the margins the padding the width and the height of the button

1258053
mkplacemark	mkreversegeocoder
if all you want to do is take a latitude longitude and present it as an address on the map you ll need to use the mkreversegeocoder class which will spit out a mkplacemark that can then be added to your mkmapview using addannotation

1258053
mkmapview	mkannotationview
you can then implement the mapview viewforannotation method on your mkmapview delegate and return a custom subclass of mkannotationview

1258079
super	extends
it s super easy to use and extends

1258091
rss	feed
that will result in your feed looking even more garbled than it already does because the php will be double-encoded once for the rss xml and again for the html contained in the rss xml

1258126
int	chars	int	boolean
i need to make a multidimensional array 10 000 or more rows 8 columns ordered as such 3 columns should contain boolean values one should contain an int two need to hold gps coordinates usually have a decimal like 62.422342 one needs to hold a 30 chars string

1258127
installation	downgrade
to use it i had to invoke setup.exe from the command line giving it the --no-verify option and it still wouldn t let me downgrade the cygwin package itself but at least it is albeit very slowly allowing me to install the version i wanted to test as a parallel installation

1258219
int	chars
another as josh pointed out is that urls are highly similar so comparisons will be extremely slow compared to an int that is - for two items - 2007 and 2008 inside website.com type car country usa manufacturer ford year you have to cover a lot of ground - 56 chars plus the three for 200 before you hit a unique

1258224
goto	break
no any automatic variables in your loops will not cause programming leaks if you break out of your loops with a goto statement

1258270
goto	break
the break statement is a just a goto in disguise designed for cases where strict adhearance to the thou shalt not use gotos commandment didn t make sense

1258295
put	get
you can get all kinds of information about an exe windows file if you download it the easy way by running external utilities on it or up to a point the hard way via apis and your own code simulating those utilities -- a lot depends on what info was put into it when it was built

1258327
haskell	ocaml
there are many languages ocaml standard ml haskell lua and probably also perl ruby which interoperate nicely with c provided they are in charge

that code looks a bit like swing or swt code so it is most comfortable to pure java developers

1258390
postgresql	mysql
you probably need to setup the central hive metastore by default derby but it can be mysql oracle postgresql

1258390
hive	hdfs
the metastore is the glue between hive and hdfs

1258390
hive	hdfs
it tells hive where your data files live in hdfs what type of data they contain what tables they belong to etc

1258414

i ve also tried including the rewrite stuff in apache2.conf httpd.conf and public .htaccess

1258521

the strncpy is a safer version of strcpy as a matter of fact you should never use strcpy because its potential buffer overflow vulnerability which makes you system vulnerable to all sort of attacks

1258565
scrollable	panels
the panels area is now scrollable

1258574
strcpy	strncpy
using strncpy you can copy a limited portion of the original string as opposed by strcpy

1258581
put	get

1258694
ant	maven
can be built using a maven plugin or ant script and allow me to process configuration files and scripts

1258708
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another

1258713
children	parent
i think if you were to rename .top and .bot to .root.top and .root.bot respectively that might fix the issue you re seeing because that would make them children of the .root parent

1258717
vmware	virtualbox
in this case provided you have a powerful enough computer using vmware or virtualbox to run a minimalist virtual machine with linux+apache+php+mysql on it

i have tried with ajax get in a separately.but here i want to mix up both post and get.

1259454
put	get	post	put	post	get

fgets	fgetc
now i will parse the out.txt for the row x column i want using fgetc fscanf or fgets

i think you can solve this problem using the parent pom.xml but you need to have a maven repository and a ci build tool

1260327
inherited	properties
i ve got several projects which all inherited base properties from a parent pom

1260327

i am using the facebox plugin for jquery with is a pop-up type dialog box

1260457
distance	altitude
you can then calculate the 2d distance as a length work out the rate of change of altitude and then simply use pythagoras to calculate the increase in length with one side of the triangle being the 2d distance and the altitude being the second length

1260460
put	get
acrobat 9.0 release notes say that it supports webdav but if i intercept the request with fiddler i can see that only get propfind and put commands are happening

if you are on a linux unix machine you are going to have to chmod the folder or chown chgrp so that the web server has write access

1260979
profiler	visualvm
i don t see a problem with your code but if you want to diagnose it in detail use visualvm s heap profiler comes with the jdk since java 6 update 10 or so

1261007
addition	multiplication
i m thinking a bit about the ease of implementation too addition of 2 bigints is more complicated then multiplication by 2 but i m more concerned about the performance rather then the size of code or ease of implementation

1261022
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
its not too bad in firefox google-chrome safari but it s very bad in ie7

1261037
int	double
when you bitshift an int to the left then you double it multiply by 2

1261068
int	double
other than that use more precision double or int math

1261076
arcgis	proj
i am working on a custom arcgis desktop tool proj and i would like to implement an automated linear referencing feature in it

1261106
gif	png
i don t understand image file structures formats well enough to know if there is some sort of standard header in the first few bytes that i could read in to tell if it is a jpg gif or png

1261116
put	get
the only way i have found to do this is to put the attempt to read the file in a loop and exit the loop when i don t get an exception

1261122
multiplying	multiplication
if multiplying by two by left-shifting that s one left-shift operation for the multiplication and one right-shift operation + and with 1 to obtain the carry

1261166
hide	show
you can toggle the display property and it show or hide the tabcontainer properly

1261237
pop-up	dialog
wpf programmed in c# i have a program where the user can click a box and a dialog box pop-up and they can select any image

1261237
width	height
i want to be able to display the width and height of the image because if the image they selects is small it ll resize to fit the box

1261237
width	height
but i want to display the actual width and height of the image they selected

1261239
cos	sin
given the angle a computed in step 2 if you started at 0 0 with a due north heading pi 2 radians and are turning left then your new positions is r cos a -1 r sin a

1261240
openfire	ejabberd
ejabberd would be a good server as it supports bosh i don t know about openfire or tigase but i d say they do

1261255
distance	altitude
if you had a linear model traveling 50 of the distance between the points also means you went upwards through 50 of the altitude then you can probably pretend that the entire thing was a right-triangle

1261255
distance	altitude
you act as though the world is flat for purposes of determining how the altitude shift affects the distance

1261255
distance	altitude
the distance along the ground is the base the altitude change is the height of the triangle and the hypotenuse is your estimated true travel distance from point to point

1261255
distance	altitude
if you want to refine that further then you can note that the model above is perfectly good for infinitesimal distance which means that you can iterate across individual deltas of the distance calculus-style each time using the current altitude to compute the ground distance and then using the same trigonometric ratio to compute the altitudinal-change contribution to the distance traveled

1261272
actualheight	actualwidth
there are two dependency properties that you can use actualwidth and actualheight

1261272
width	height
this will give you the size that the picture is using on the screen not what is currently set which is what width and height give you

1261276
put	get
i tried to put this in the main page but i get an error because #tabs does not exist on the page when it is first loaded

1261309
internationalization	localization
perhaps still follow the general internationalization localization guidelines and create a separate dir for each support language such as en.lproj and it.lproj and the then name your dbs as en_data.db and it_data.db or whatever naming convention you prefer and place them in their respective dirs

1261313
nl2br	addslashes
as all of the details are currently unescaped and i would rather not go through the process of using nl2br and back again i m thinking of two queries one using prepared statements for the _post variables and then another using addslashes and regular statements for the file

1261346
int	double
then to realize this generic class for a specific type you would write examples here for int double and string

1261364
rss	feed
i am scraping a list of rss feed by using curl - look at the xml from the rss feed that s giving the problem there s more than one feed so it s possible for some feed to be right and for the feed that are wrong to be wrong in different ways

1261461
fadein	fadeout
i am attempting to cycle through arrays of words with a jquery fadein fadeout

1261472
powerpc	i386
apparently it has to do with what the compiler produces even though the file type says it is for powerpc ppc64 i386 x_64 universal binary and seems to match all the other .so mods i have

1261491
bazaar	git
mercurial and bazaar don t support this and git s support is limited

1261500
serializable	deserialization
you can use the javascriptconverter class when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process

1261533
width	height
note the imagestructure variable is a trivial structure that stores the total width height number of frames and a list of images representing each frame

1261550
debian	linux
i have a gnu linux debian server running apache jboss proftpd and postgresql ram 16gb 4 core xeon

1261598
pascal	delphi
i am doing a project converting some pascal delphi code to c++ and would like to write a function that is roughly equivalent to the pascal setlength method

1261647
hide	show
hide form constructor make it private then add static factory method that would initialize new instance of the form and show it straight away

1261655
calloc	malloc
note that the array must have been allocated with malloc or calloc

1261718
gif	png
convert jpg png gif whatever into an rgb byte array which is independent of encoding

1261720
try-catch	exception-handling
option 2 the app-wide try-catch isn t really for safety it s just because you think you can do something more useful with the exception-handling like print something out and exit cleanly than just let the c++ runtime call terminate

1261743
mp3	wav
record audio through a microphone on a website and upload the audio as a wav or mp3 file to the server

1261744
hash	md5
the easiest thing to do is to do a hash like md5 of the image data ignoring all other metadata

1261827
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
learning how to use the google-chrome debugger tools or similar tools in firefox safari opera etc. will also be invaluable

1261989
put	get	post	put	post	get
provide services which behave as expected get requests are idempotent post updates records put creates delete deletes

1262027
x86	64bit
it seems that if i have a .net assembly that is going to be loaded by some unmanaged x86 code running on a 64bit o s vista then i need to compile that .net assembly with the .x86 solution platform

1262040
ati	nvidia
hardware acceleration issues on both nvidia and ati resulting in repeateable bsods

1262040
mp3	wav
wav mp3 audio

1262045
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
uiscrollview seems not to respond to touchesbegan and to touchesmoved

1262049
put	get	post	put	post	get
in strictest terms the url must represent a resource and proper http verb get put post delete must be used

1262049
wadl	wsdl
some people believe wadl equivalent of wsdl must be used to classified as web services especially in jax-rs community

1262109
put	get
well newer versions of .net put layers on top of older layers so all the older knowledge you get is definitely practicable however not all of it is practical

1262125
width	height
get the height and width of the canvas

1262125
width	height
get the height and width of the image s picture property

1262147
ssl	https
the do not save encrypted pages to disk comes into play when dealing with ssl https connections

1262147
ssl	https
just like a web server can send done information about how to cache a file one can basically set internet explorer up to not save files to the cache during an ssl https connection regardless if the web server advises you can

1262170
lwjgl	jogl
you could use plain java with an opengl binding like jogl lwjgl but you re going to have trouble with media playback

1262196
imperative	declarative
the trick is that because you re working with declarative code rather than more-familiar imperative the temptation is to try to think of it as if everything happens at once

1262208
union	distinct
a fourth possibility would be to have two distinct procedures one which runs a union and one which doesn t and then make it your code s responsibility to determine which one to call based on that parameter something like

1262264
ant	maven
what i want to accomplish is a tool that filters my files replacing the occurrences of strings in this format with a value got from a properties file just like maven s or ant s file filtering feature

1262264
ant	maven
my first approach was to use ant api copy-task or maven filtering component but both include many unnecessary dependencies and my program should be lightweight

1262294
post	get
this should get you the ids of post in a certain category sorted by their titles

1262304
versioning	upgrade
if you have made changes then restore to a backup you just run your upgrade script and it goes through and updates the db to the current versioning

1262343
networkstream	sslstream
wrap your socket in a networkstream to use it with an sslstream

1262351
xna	slimdx
if you don t want to be stuck at directx 9.0c support i suggest you take a look at slimdx which is a similar concept to xna but maps to both directx 9 and 10

1262395
width	height
specifically if the imageorientation is right left then you need to both rotate the image and swap width height

1262453
folder	directory
check the documentation on the resource_autoloader its purpose is to load resources that reside in the models directory or elsewhere - i.e outside the library folder

1262465
getter	setter
however since it is really a one-to-one relationship i would need to put some crazy getter setter in the patient class like this so i don t litter my code with collection references when there isn t really a collection

1262484
getter	setter
this class is just getter and setter plus an empty method

1262523
buildroot	uclibc
buildroot uses the lightweight uclibc c library rather than glibc so it might not work for your purposes

1262550
for-loop	arrays
now note also that a for-loop aliases each element of an arrays so

1262597
pop-up	dialog
when captcha is returned i want to open up a pop-up dialog on the screen and load my captcha script so far everything works up to this point

1262599
umask	chmod
you could also have fun with umask but i ve always prefered calling chmod when it s necessary and only when it s necessary i prefer not giving too much permissions -- more secure this way -- and umask may have some problems with some servers if i remember correctly

1262618
min	max
if there were it would go in dm-aggregates along with the aggregation functions count min max avg

1262683
sorting	grouping
since i am grouping this for duration attribute i end up 4 different output files and then merging and sorting the data explicitly is something i would like avoid

1262690
mouseout	mouseleave
instead of using mouseout as the event to close the div use mouseleave then the event will only be triggered when the pointer leaves the boundary of the div not when it moves onto other elements within it

1262692
implements	extends
the redirection was implements in wse 3.0 and i m sure extends it even further

1262711
mouse	keyboard
and handle all mouse keyboard and focus issues

1262715
int	chars
the strings are stored by writing their size as an unsigned int before the string data as chars

1262726
stdout	stderr
because error messages often go to stderr not stdout

1262726
stdout	stderr
that works because stdout is file descriptor 1 and stderr is file descriptor 2 by convention

1262779
getter	setter
just one thing you want to watch for limit its use only to variable-structure objects or use it only for syntactical shortcuts to getter and setter

1262779
getter	setter
it makes sense to keep getter and setter in your class to seperate business logic in multiple methods but there is nothing wrong in using it as a shortcut

1262779
getter	setter
that way you can continue using your getter and setter to validate and set your data and still use the syntactic shortcuts as such

1262797
getter	setter
another method that andrew didn t mention or hasn t mentioned at the time of writing is for getting rid of getter and setter

1262797
getter	setter
instead of having to declare each setter and getter like this

1262812
writetofile	nsdata
i m trying to understand the meaning of the value returned by nsdata writetofile options error

1262850
dependencyobject	uielement
a complete diferent way would be to not implement inotifypropertychanged and instead descend from dependencyobject or uielement

1262861
hide	show
wrap a link a tag around the triangle image or text like hide show that runs the javascript to toggle the display property

1262884
udp	tcp
if reliability is not an issue then you can choose from the mirirad of non-queued solutions remoting tcp udp broadcast http call etc

1262980
updatepanel	ascx
i have a button inside an ascx inside an updatepanel inside aspx content page

1263041
inherited	subclassing
problems arise if you need to subclassing something else as .net does not allow multiple inherited

1263054
client-side	server-side
in your example you re using linkbutton.onclick which is a server-side event so it won t fire the client-side javascript

1263122
queue	fifo
you want fifo you use a std queue

1263165
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
collections nullpointerexception classcastexception if you re not using autoboxing and you screw it up

1263165

js is used to show or hide the ...read more notice

1263207
salt	md5
password db field md5 password + salt + + salt

1263235
hide	show
i always use iframes to do any types of upload...you can show hide your iframe with javascript and the c# page in the iframe can handle any type of database updating you need...let me know if you want an example.

1263237
jobs	cron
i am not really sure if cron jobs are the best way or i could use triggers or may be something else.also i am using apache as my web server and my os is windows vista

1263265
content-disposition	content-type
put the semicolons behind content-type and content-disposition around line 1220 indeed and it works

1263268
salt	md5
md5 password + salt + + salt

1263268
salt	md5
md5 the password and salt

1263268
hash	md5
then compare the resulted md5 hash

1263283
updatepanel	scriptmanager
put a scriptmanager on your page then put a updatepanel on your page

1263324
free	malloc
if you have a good reason not to use a global concurrency or recursion you can use malloc free

1263324
free	malloc
the important thing is to either increase your stack not a good idea if you re using threads or get the data on the heap malloc free or the static data segment global

1263355
uitableview	uisearchbar
my goal is to have a uisearchbar fixed in a view right above a uitableview

1263355
uitableview	uisearchbar
if i make the uisearchbar a subview of the uitableview the search bar displays as expected but this is not what i want

1263415
int	boolean
as noted property class reference docs these appear to be biginteger binary boolean date datetime email float html int person string unique identifier or url

1263439
getter	setter
but when you want to do some validation etc. you just add getter and setter

1263447
allocator	stl
i m not sure how to go about allocator the c-style string without subscripting or stl functions

1263489
inherited	properties
from this class i ve created class b inherited from a which adds some properties

1263506
many-to-many	one-to-many
in my world mapping tables like those are how you implement a many-to-many relationship and using them for a one-to-many relationship is madness mdash

1263506
many-to-many	one-to-many
i mean if you do that maybe you intend for the relationship to be used as one-to-many but what you ve actually implemented is many-to-many support

1263524
trie	tree
use a prefix tree trie

1263535
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
then with php json_decode it will fail if it find ã so for firefox opera safari and google-chrome i ve to call utf8_encode before json_decode

1263571
many-to-many	one-to-many
i agree that the join table for a one-to-many in this situation doesn t seem to add much benefit and as chaos says you actually end up implementing many-to-many support

1263593
pascal	delphi
on the other hand pascal delphi and actionscript programmers immediately grasp the true meaning of var

1263604
put	get
rather than marking which code can or can not throw exceptions use raii to ensure your objects get cleaned up and put some thought into implementing the appropriate level of exception safety in your raii objects so they re able to survive without special handling if an exception is thrown

1263613
versioning	upgrade
also there may be a new better versioning of the membership provider one day that you won t be able to upgrade because you have customized the membership schema

1263644
hash	salt
do not forget to salt your hash or it may be insecure

1263694
gif	png
wondering if there is an existing javascript library that will parse the png data and output gif or even jpeg

1263694
gif	png
no obvious existing javascript libraries to do this so i ll use flash to convert image data to gif output for ie and continue to use png for all other browsers

1263728
wxpython	pyqt
pyqt if you can stand the gpl license or pay for the commercial one and wxpython are imho currently superior offerings for cross-platform gui apps though you ll have to work to bundle them with py2exe or pyinstaller if you want to distribute a stand-alone app and other packages are excellent if you don t care about cross-platform distribution or have specialized needs pyui -- while now a general-purpose ui toolkit -- for simple uis for games if you re using pygame or pyopengl anyway

1263750
visualsvn	sharpsvn
no matter how far i expand the rights even into the local admin or visualsvn admin groups sharpsvn continually throws an svnauthorizationexception and i get a corresponding entry in the security event log under the aspnet account

1263793
multiplying	add
if i leave breakpoints set they seem to multiplying and get attached to adjacent lines as i add more code

1263842
wav	riff
alternatively you could just write out the sound data to a wav file which is not terribly difficult since wav files are just raw uncompressed pcm data with a riff header

1263859
submit	submission
just handle the form submission on the submit event and return false

1263862
post	get
using an ajax post request in jquery i get the following xml back from the server

1263867
post	get
this blog post should get you going

1263876
folder	directory
i m trying to configure the java logging api s filehandler to log my server to a file within a folder in my home directory but i don t want to have to create those directory on every machine it s running

1264035
fortran	ada
while we write new code in c and c++ i can t even get management pay to upgrade old code written in fortran or ada to c or c++ forget java that requires a whole new coding standard and butt loads procedures and documentation have to update that cost even more

1264096
super	implements
yes this would then require that you write a super simple wrapper around the ninject kernel which implements idependencyresolver as well

1264147
post	get
what i m trying to do is create a single function that would get post

1264168
integer	unsigned
as to the last bit of voodoo -- the only point in specifying 1u it is because it s possible that if k is large enough the result of the shift would meet exceed 32-bits of storage in which case the outcome will be different if the lh operand is treated as a signed or an unsigned integer

1264185
profiling	instrumentation
if you are having a specific performance problem with delete beyond the required fetch it would be helpful to profiling the operation in instrumentation

1264224
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
says that firefox and safari allow cookies up to 4097 characters ie 4095 and opera 4096

1264246

sorting	grouping
i am having a problem sorting results from joining tables that have to be grouping in mysql

1264303
ssl	https
but i could not manage to do it for https as i received an ssl certificate error

1264372
hash	salt
a hash salt is the way to go because its impossible to retrieve the original password from it

1264376
hash	salt
if all you re doing is storing a password in the database so that you can check it later against a known input value then a hash with a salt will work

1264487
post	get
having two classes like blog and post in entity framework and linq-to-entities how can you get the blogs with the post sorted by date

1264543
amr	aac	mp3	wav
a common set of blackberry supported audio formats are aac amr au gsm mp3 wav wma

1264572
gentoo	freebsd
maybe the answer will be disappointing but the relatively high number of source downloads could mean that the application is packaged in a port-based distribution like gentoo freebsd or macports where every package is downloaded and compiled on a local machine during installation

1264606
post	get
it seems like your ajax request is using get but your delete script is trying to retrieve the id via post

1264636
implements	extends
one you extends the class thread and implements the method run

1264636
implements	extends
i personally prefer to implements runnable because i don t change the behaviour of thread that would be extends it but only use the thread-functionality

1264675
internationalization	localization
i ve already read about internationalization and localization in wikipedia

1264737
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
you need to read each byte from your inputstream and write it to a bytearrayoutputstream

1264765
integer	fractions
the date type is stored as a fractions value -- the date as the integer portion and the time of day as the fractions portion

1264818
cvs	svn
for example currently there re plug-ins for cvs svn ssh java c++ python and ..

1264822

gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
imageio supports a number of image formats by default jpeg png bmp wbmp and gif

1264881
processors	hyperthreading
for multi processors multi core hyperthreading case the relation is approximately p n where p is the number of processors however the thread exectution becomes a multi-dimensional scheduling problem

1264881
cpu	affinity
your operating system s thread scheduler will make effort to distribute the threads among the available processing units based on runtime characteristics used cpu cycles blockedness user preferences affinity thread s serving the active window and other properties

1264930
gitorious	gitosis
if i remember correctly gitorious is using gitosis for managing access via ssh so i used response from gitorious in example below

1264948
packets	multicast
my co-worker has been successfully running an in-house application that uses ipv6 multicast on his macbook pro for several months but today the mac decided to stop routing the multicast packets

1264948
packets	multicast
if my understanding of link-scope multicast is correct the packets only has to go out the local ethernet port en0 in this case which is up and working on that machine

1264967
xna	spritebatch
xna already has some classes for doing 2d graphics the main one being the spritebatch

1264987
int	chars
in particular textreader.read chars buffer int index int count s docs say

1265004
button	checkbox
when selecting the checkbox you can bind new click events on your button - and unbind them later on

1265006
post	put
always put the actual code into your question rather than re-typing it and always post a full program when you can

1265037
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
currently i have a file that stores username + md5 password hash with username as salt

1265054
opera	firefox
devexpress usually cares about consistency between user environments â for example their web controls look the same in ie firefox and opera

1265110
hide	show
my project explorer hide folders that belong to a source code management system while the package explorer show the .git folder

1265158
button	checkbox
radio button are like checkbox except that when several share the same control name they are mutually exclusive when one is switched on all others with the same name are switched off

1265168
folder	directory
that directory was added to the bundle as is via folder references feature

1265192
free	malloc
it feels like using malloc without free

1265196
typedef	struct
there s no need to typedef a struct in c++ as unlike to c in c++ struct names live in the same name space as other names

1265203
google-chrome	firefox
however i could work it out with google-chrome and firefox

1265217
960.gs	fluid
i prefer fluid version of 960.gs fluid 960 grid system

1265271
hide	show
this discussion is going to be alive as long as the ide you work with is not flexible enough to show or hide the exact information you need

1265276
hide	show
in the past we used the css attribute display to show and hide dom elements

1265353
jdom	xom
i ve checked the source code for jdom and xom and they all print attributes on the same line and provide no specific hooks for overriding that

1265353
jdom	xom	public	protected
both xom and jdom do have specific classes for serializing xml xmloutputter and serializer respectively and both classes have protected or public methods for handling the serialization of attributes so you could if you wanted to subclass those classes and override the appropriate methods to control your attribute formatting as you want it

1265389
free	malloc
with the heap i could try and overload every malloc free and new delete across all projects and track it that way but that is quite daunting with an application this size

1265425
firefox	safari	installation	upgrade	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve made an extjs frontend for a company dashboard and using a django backend managing the url dispatching the orm and the data retrieval communicating with the frontend with json webservices and users love it because it s almost as interactive as a local application use something modern like firefox 3.5 google-chrome safari 4 or explorer 8 for better javascript performance but easy to manage for programmers and administrators no installation no local backups no upgrade problems etc.

1265428
inherited	properties
i think the properties-maven-plugin is the right approach long term but as you responded to that answer it doesn t allow the properties to be inherited

1265428
inherited	properties
the configuration can be defined in a parent project and will be inherited by all the child projects if you do this avoid declaring any files as they won t be discovered only set the filepaths properties

1265466
opera	firefox
dragonfly in opera firebug in firefox ietester has it s own thing but i never use it

1265537
entity-relationship-model	datamodel
for your datamodel entity-relationship-model you will want a foreign key in the member table pointing to the group table

versioning	upgrade
upgrade update - update on a newer versioning should be done automatically for example schema and data upgrade

1265707
children	parent
the reason height 100 does not work is because heights do not work on children whose parent do not have an explicit non height

1265820
pull	push
that way instead of getting clearcase to pull the code you can get hudson to push the code onto the build server and build it all remotely using the master slave technique

1265880
queue	fifo
lists and dictionaries are containers that don t support a queue model that is they re neither lifo nor fifo

1265884
queue	fifo
dictionaries and lists aren t queue and also fifo and lifo doesn t apply to c# lists and dictionaries

1265888
width	height
a common solution to what you re trying to do is to add an empty tag styled with a width and height that match the graphic you re using

1265892
strcpy	strncpy
i am not a proponent of thinking of strncpy as a safer replacement for strcpy because it really isn t

1265907
client-side	server-side
i would like to tie the click events on these client-side creations to server-side events without having to thrash or bypass the whole page lifecycle

1265921
queue	fifo
in c# if you want a lifo stack use system.collections.generic.stack and if you want a fifo queue use system.collections.generic.queue

1265926
opera	firefox
this line of code work prefectally to get the host string in both firefox and opera

1265926
opera	firefox
i was wondering if anyone had the same problem and managed to solve it or if someone has any idea why i always get null in ie but not when using firefox and opera

1265926
opera	firefox
however such approach make the internalinterface always return null in ie but not in firefox nor in opera

1265965
jobs	cron
however the downside is that it s not isolated from your environment and if you change that you may find your cron jobs suddenly stop working

1265988
width	height
for the width or height to be automatically determined based on context you use for it the value of -1 for example -1 100 for a height of 100 and automatic width

1265988
width	height
if a width or height is specified and the sizer item for the control doesn t have wx.expand flag set note that even if this flag is set some sizers won t expand in both directions by default you might call it locked as it won t chage that dimension

1266003
udp	tcp
udp was only used instead of tcp as it was simpler to configure on an embedded system

1266029
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i getting this weird issue in safari google-chrome works in firefox and ie

1266082

sorting	filtering
this makes sorting filtering these items a pain in the ass behind

1266117
hash	salt
i then use that hash plus a salt to generate a key

1266126
folder	directory
it turns out that the problem was down to using solution folder and not having all the projects on the same directory level

1266139
put	get
i already put the log4jconfiglocation in web.xml but i still get the following warning

1266155
strcpy	strncpy
you must either use strcpy or strncpy

1266183
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
it must work on windows while being able to use it with solaris freebsd linux macosx would of course be nice

1266193
int	double
i ve seen a case someone has been using strings in place of native datatypes such as int or double for every class member that gave an outofmemoryerror when storing a relatively small amount of data objects in memory

1266257
pull	push
the syncing part can be a simple push pull style http request it s the logistics of how to properly keep them in sync that raises concerns

1266278
put	get
so i need to get the info from line 1 1 e put 1 into a variable and then e into another

1266315
for-loop	loops
just loops through the xmllist until you find one that matches then return the index in your loops for-loop with an index

1266336
width	height
in the maximized state set the width and height to the standard maximums

1266336
width	height
in the normal state set them to some variables you have stored with the current normal width and height

1266336
width	height
in other words when the size is changed don t automatically set the width and height unless currently in normal mode

1266336
width	height
save the new normal width and height in variables called normalwidth and normalheight

1266341
mouse	keyboard
keep in mind that for this solution to work the machine should receive input from the user keyboard mouse

1266355
agile	sprint
reading through wikipedia i came across the concept of sprint in agile

1266375
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
all processing is done by the browser and it should work in ie6+ firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1266436
hide	show
in viewmode i need to hide the datepicker icon and only show the date

1266483
effort	automapper
i m giving up the idea of using automapper to do this job i don t have a lot of entities and the changes i need to do in this library in order to work requires some effort it isn t something trivial to do

1266484
equals	gethashcode
it s way too easy to fall into a trap where you override equals and gethashcode on an object and break code where the type was formerly used as a key in a dictionary

1266487
telerik	radcombobox
i have been searching the web for a concrete and simple example of binding a telerik radcombobox with a dataset by following the asp.net mvc pattern but couldn t find out a working snippet

1266499
equals	gethashcode
you can override gethashcode and should do so if you override equals so that objects which are equals also return the same hash code

1266512
equals	gethashcode
the default implementation of gethashcode equals basically deals with identity

1266514
pop-up	dialog
everything works well but when facebook is supposed to show a pop-up dialog for example fb.connect.showfeeddialog or fb.connect.streampublish the pop-up shows inside the iframe

1266609
retaincount	dealloc
this constant string class may override nsobject s methods like retain release and dealloc so that they do nothing and also override retaincount so that it always returns the same number uint_max or so

1266655
put	get
to get to the root put a in front of the file name

1266697
opera	firefox
ie firefox opera correct content into div excellent

1266697
google-chrome	safari
safari google-chrome correct content but the entire page is refreshed with the results

1266790
datediff	difference
datediff will get the difference between two dates

1266802
width	height
the width and height members are set tothe inside size of the window not including the border

1266851
int	double
as a general rule of thumb everything in wpf is measured in double values so either live with it you checks would likely be the same anyway or continue rounding to int if you like so -

1266854
versioning	upgrade
that meant everyone had to upgrade when a new versioning came out and helped keep problems from arising if out of date versioning were used

you cannot pass a pointer you did not obtain from malloc or calloc or realloc ... to free

1267033
firefox	safari
it all works on ie and safari but not on firefox 3.5 3.0 works perfectly though

1267033
hide	show
the web-app tiparlo which i was working on before had a similar problem in fact any manipulation done on an applet via jquery is faulty but solved that problem by wrapping a div around and controlling hide and show the div instead of the applet

1267040
free	malloc
adding to the more formal answers i d compare the mechanics of this to one taking a book in the library malloc then tearing off a few dozen pages together with the cover advance the pointer and then attempting to return it free

1267040
free	malloc
you might find a librarian malloc free library implementation that takes such a book back but in a lot of case i d expect you would pay a fine for negligent handling

1267040
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
by the calloc malloc or realloc function or if the space has been

1267040
free	realloc
deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behaviour is undefined

1267040
free	malloc
in my experience a double free or the free of the pointer that was not returned via malloc will result in a memory corruption and or crash depending on your malloc implementation

firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
update 2 updated the code to work with firefox 3.5 opera 9 safari 4 ie6-8 and probably more and earlier versions but that is not tested

1267181
udp	tcp
to find out what the dns name of a machine is you first need its ip address which you have if you received a request from the machine over tcp or udp since that will include the requester s ip address

1267200
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works perfectly in firefox google-chrome opera

1267207
spaces	delimiter
in your last line where you re restoring the delimiter to semicolon you need a spaces between delimiter and

1267241
imperative	declarative
there is clear advantage from maintenance point of view to have most of the code in declarative format html+css and as little as possible in imperative javascript

1267264
onsubmit	onblur
do this onblur or onsubmit

1267275
hide	show
i have a processing... div overlay that i show with .show prior to making ajax calls and hide on completion

1267275
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i m running into is that if i want to show the div and then make several ajax calls prior to hiding the div again it seems to queue the events in internet explorer 7 and google-chrome 2.0.172.39 but i get the expected result in firefox 3.0.13

1267348
post	get
i think the jboss portlet throws out post get and uses action urls instead

1267350
ready	each
you ll keep an image for each status ready to call up

1267400
folder	directory
copy web.py folder into your app directory then start the server

1267439
int	chars
in both cases c++0x offers the tools to fix this with unicode-specific chars types and int of a guaranteed fixed size

1267443
versioning	upgrade
when you upgrade to versioning 2.0 you deploy an additional class called toolagentimplmenetation2_0 and update the mytoolagent class to load and use it

1267443
versioning	upgrade
you do waste some memory here but you achieve the versioning upgrade

asterisk	ivr
after migrating my client s ivr s over from sipx to asterisk utilizing phpagi i must say that i haven t encountered any other architecture that anywhere near as simple and capable

1267548
asterisk	ivr
but i must say using phpagi for the ivr and the asterisk cli for debugging has worked perfectly and allowed me to develop ivr s far faster than any other company out there

1267592
pop-up	dialog
the class derived from cwnd using ddx_control all the message boxes including default system message box pop-up when you enter invalid input in the edit box are hidden behind main dialog until you use alt + tab to bring them to front

1267604
comparator	icomparer
you could create a comparator class that implements icomparer of string then pass an instance of this class as the second parameter of array.sort

1267623
children	parent
so i have a parent form that opens a bunch of children with show and then when one is needed i use bringtofront to display it

1267659
vb.net	vb6
also in-house utility programs are written in c# vb6 vb.net

1267659
vbscript	vb6
to handle this problem i wrote a vb6 vbscript encryption routine which i converted to .net

1267659
salt	md5
both of which were considerably enhanced with multiple features such as the md5 is a salt version and the rc4 contains a crc check and an option for double encrypting using multiple passkeys

1267659
put	get
if you get them from the registry and try to put them on another system they re no good.

hex	binary
binary representation of decimal and hex numbers

1267708
post	get
at this time autocompleter 1.1pre there isn t a way to get it to post without changing the plugin s code

1267757
hash	salt
for each credit card we store the last 4 digits the expiration date a long random salt 50 bytes long and the salt hash of the cc number

1267757
hash	salt
then for each matching cc we check whether its stored salt hash matches the salt hash calculated from its salt and the new cc number

1267761
touchesbegan	touchesended
i do this to can get touchesbegan and touchesended events so that i can implement a long touch

1267769
webrat	cucumber
i have a cucumber feature with two scenarios that each rely on webrat to resolve the step when i go to the list of articles the article model is not an activerecord model and shouldn t rely on sql for access

1267829
unix	sunos
when i run it in windows perl correctly identifies it as 5 arguments whereas when i ran it on the sunos unix machine it identified 8 splitting the arg with spaces into separate args

1267852
thin	webrick
from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin

1267864
sitecore	umbraco
i m just getting up to speed on umbraco after using sitecore and sitefinity on a few projects

1267882
hash	salt
i am using sha-1 with my membership but i would like to recreate the same salt so the built-in membership stuff could hash the stuff the same way as my stuff can

1267890
floating-point	integer
a caveat as commenters have pointed out this won t work if b might be something other than an integer or floating-point number or a string representing one

1267924
hash	salt
combining the salt with the password and hashing it using the technique above will allow you to verify users passwords using the hash value stored by the framework

1267967
folder	dir
my next goal is to make this recurse subdirectories but this seems a bit more challenging changing it to dir -recurse makes it quit after the parent folder for some reason

1268044
jobs	cron
i am not really sure if cron jobs are the best way or i could use triggers or may be something else.also i am using apache as my web server and my os is windows vista

1268044
jobs	cron
php scheduler or cron jobs or any other method

1268083
versioning	upgrade
i keep a versioning number in a table in the backend and perform the appropriate subroutines to upgrade the backend

1268088
mouseout	mouseenter
i want the div to stay still when mouseenter the div region and div should disappear when i do mouseout from div or the td.any help is appreciated

1268101
fedora	buildroot
my coworker has a fedora x64_86 machine with a gcc 4.3.3 cross compiler from buildroot

1268148
for-loop	loops
you can t modify the variable of a foreach loops so you have to use a for-loop

1268157
gentoo	ubuntu
they usually have a quite large set of patches applied to gcc for example on gentoo there are about 20 patches fedora and ubuntu won t be that different

1268201
mouseevent	mouselistener
i have tried adding a mouselistener to the table and consuming all mouseevent s but this does not work - if i return true from iscelleditable then my listener never receives any click events but if i return false then f2 no longer works

1268217
mouseup	mousedown
i have noticed that there is no mouseup and mousedown triggered when playing with stylus acting as a mouse on the screen

1268227
opera	safari
the ones that do reload the page are some of the older ones such as safari 2.0.4 and opera 8.5x

1268241
int	boolean
strings boolean and int are currently the only allowed data types

1268321
super	abstract	super	implements
you problem is that you are not implements abstract methods of nsmutablearray super class that need to be implements it says

1268334
ivar	subclassing	nsobject	ivar
it s better to make a category on nsarray or make an nsobject subclassing that has an nsarray ivar that you talk to

1268334
subclass	abstract-class
to create a subclass of a class cluster you have to implement all the primitive methods of the abstract-class you are inheriting from manage your own storage and basically reimplement all the stuff you were hoping to get for free by subclassing

1268357
profiler	yourkit
i suggest a 3rd-party profiler such as yourkit which may allow you to take snapshots without kicking off the gc first

1268366
networkstream	binaryreader
in this case you re using binarywriter on one side so attaching a binaryreader to the networkstream returned by tcpclient.getstream would seem like the easiest approach

1268376
put	get	post	put	post	get
my normal query is to get all post with the categories it is put into

1268376
put	get	post	put	post	get
now i want to get all post that belongs to a certain category id with all the categories the post is put into

1268376
post	get
i.e i want to get the same things as in the first query but only the post that belong to a certain category

1268376
post	get
now i only want to get the post that belongs the category asp

1268410
width	height
why i need it instead of creating more timages at runtime i could create one and store my image there knowing that it will be fit until it reaches timage s height and width

1268451
post	get
so if your browser crashed in the middle of writing a long post you can get it back

1268464
jobs	cron
exit extraneous applications kill background tasks stop all scheduled events cron jobs eliminate plug-ins and uninstall browser add-ons

1268504
int	chars
is it that hard to see that the template arguments are chars and int values

1268508
ready	each
since i didn t have control of the writer i had to add another polling mechanism to check the file size on an interval to make sure each new file was actually ready to be read

1268518
ienumerable	icollection
secondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generic than icollection and does not even have simple properties like count

1268535
many-to-many	many-to-one
if you re trying to have an employee have exactly one manager then first of all you re doing a many-to-one relation not many-to-many and having the manageremployeeid in the table as a foreign key reference to the same table is just fine

1268565
firefox	safari
this code works fine in firefox and safari but will not work in ie7

1268566
ilist	icollection
that s probably because collection implements ilist which has some extra methods that icollection hasn t is ilist enough for you

1268569
google-chrome	firefox
i confirmed with a much simpler test that both browsers i m working with google-chrome firefox 3.5 can do input checked + ul if it s simply an input followed by a ul

1268580
put	get
im trying to get the contents of a webpage put into a field in filemaker pro 10

1268587
put	get
when you get to an open parentheses push the stack in and put characters that aren t parentheses into string of the stack

1268670
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome and opera neither method appears to work properly

1268679
range	min
- which could be a range min

1268733
mp3	wav
wav mp3 aac etc

1268739
inherited	properties
i created a class which inherited from sitemapnode and overrode the title properties of it

1268894
folder	directory
they get buried in one of those hidden folder inside the user s profile directory

1268955
folder	directory
if that isn t the problem check that the user account used to run your website has permissions to the directory and all the files and folder contained within it and make sure that the network service has permissions

1268997
tinyint	boolean
i ve got a hibernate model that uses a custom type to represent boolean fields ie model has a boolean object but the database writes a 0 or 1 to a tinyint field

1268998
put	get
what i usually do is lay out the template in the index.phtml and then when i need to get something from a model put that snippet in a detail.phtml so logic is as far out of the way as possible

1269006
bmp	png
i am writing an imaging library using the mit licence and would like to hook it up to a library that supports loading and saving of images in various file formats bmp png jpg etc

1269019
integer	unsigned
i can t find any clear reference for specified behavior when negating an unsigned integer

1269041
memcached	apc
not use some cache like file apc memcached but just keep the data in memory for the execution of the script

1269042
firefox	safari
they are working as intended in firefox safari but internet explorer throws the following error

1269049
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

1269049
integer	unsigned
41 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer

1269049
integer	unsigned
type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer

1269049
integer	unsigned
a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type

1269057
getter	setter
so in the db i just have a text datatype that i want to store the comma separated list of urls and i override the default ar setter and getter so i can assign an array and get an array for the values and it takes care of the joining and splitting

1269067
post	get
you might want to look at my second post at this question to get another idea on how you could structure your plugins

1269086
post	get
specifically i ve got some zend framework controller actions that receive parameters via get post but aren t functional params

1269089
scrollable	panels
a caveat however there was a longstanding defect with any sort of scrollable panels inside of a tabpanel

1269093
versioning	upgrade
i would suggest doing a trial of the db ghost product because they have some interesting claims concerning multiple versioning upgrade

1269093
versioning	upgrade
upgrade may be from a very old versioning

1269140
firefox	safari	fadein	fadeout
for a client i am attempting to get this site to work in ie and other web browsers currently only works in safari and firefox for mac i am using jquery s fadein and fadeout functions on the pictures to cycle them through in the background

1269142
post	get
when you pass in the data on post you can do the form first save it and get an instance

1269186
memcached	apc
then you will probably want to add so kind of caching mecanism like apc or memcached

1269212
javassist	bcel
just to let people know i decided to go with javassist in the end instead of bcel since javassist seems to be a lot simpler to use and is perfectly adequate for my purposes

1269254
haskell	ocaml	ocaml	ada
nowadays language designers recognize that textual inclusion is no way to run a railroad so languages tend to run either to separately compiled interfaces ada modula ocaml to compiler-generated interfaces haskell or to dynamic systems that guarantee interface consistency java smalltalk

1269257
postgresql	mysql
part of the mysql query that i m trying to convert to postgresql

1269275
put	get
you put and get into and out of an mvar

1269282
width	height
on another note though ie8 does return the width and height

1269310
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working fine for me google-chrome ie8 and firefox 3

1269328
google-chrome	safari
i came up with a solution that doesn t run on webkit google-chrome + safari but which is very compact

1269328
google-chrome	safari
but alas oy vey the nameitem doesn t work on safari google-chrome - maybe there s an alternative approach for those browsers.

1269337
getter	setter
for example serialize urls array â it sounds like you ve already got a working getter and setter but it s always nice to reuse what activerecord provides

1269374
caliburn	prism
however some of the implementations of common features done in prism are nice too and the founder of caliburn has even removed some features that you would then get from prism

1269402
width	height
etc. the x y width and height are always 0

1269415
getter	setter
if you just open your class internals with getter and setter then you re giving up encapsulation completely

1269427
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
on my website at the site as a whole displays well in mobile safari and the homepage displays well on desktop firefox opera safari and ie but the homepage specifically does not look at all good on mobile safari it displays one word per line stretching out the text vertically

1269441
pop-up	dialog
one thought that came to mind for me is the modal pop-up dialog

1269449
post	put
i am trying to make an ajax call with jquery if i put an alert in the success part it launches the alert so i know the call is working and there is no errors but if i try to u a value returned from the ajax call it is null i would post code but i m on an iphone

1269561
google-chrome	firefox
the actual output in firefox and google-chrome is a box the tabcontainer with a themed border

1269579
bids	ssis
ssis would be the preferred way via bids vs 2005

1269584
memcached	apc
also as someone else mentioned take a look at a caching mechanism like apc or memcached but i would also reccommend a php class caching system

1269585
pascal	delphi
i haven t worked with pascal since a few months of torture with delphi turbo

1269600
implements	extends
if jquery did decide to implements something like this into the core this is a huge decision that will affect a lot of people and may affect how they use extends jquery and if they continue to use jquery

1269619
pop-up	dialog
you mentioned pop-up modal dialog and i d argue that non-modal ones are just as bad

1269643
width	margin
normally you should use margin 0 auto on the div as mentioned in the other answers but you ll have to specify a width for the div

1269643
width	margin
if you don t want to specify a width you could either this is depending on what you re trying to do use margins something like margin 0 200px

1269667
min	max
a nice approach is in your head consider the min max standard type of time

1269692
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works in ie8 safari google-chrome firefox opera etc

i have the following jquery code similar to this question that works in firefox and ie but fails no errors just doesn t work in google-chrome and safari

1269740
moq	typemock
as i don t care too much for the record-replay steps of typemock and rhinomocks i ve opted for the newer moq which will happily mock either the datarepository classes or the service layer calls themselves with minimal hassle

1269742
dictionary	map
then parse it and store it in a dictionary map whatever-the-language-or-framework-has-for-hashtables

1269748
jobs	cron
for windows cron jobs i cannot recommend pycron enough

1269823
stateless	stateful
silverlight apps are interactive stateful applications not stateless web pages containing information and page requests

1269829
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout stderr from the spawned ps

1269833
getter	setter
first you need to understand the difference between instance variables and properties and getter setter

1269833
getter	setter
getter setter implement that interface and may use an ivar as backing storage

1269833
getter	setter
you access a property by using a getter setter either explicitly eg self username or equivalently using dot syntax self.username

1269833
getter	setter
you implement a property either by using synthesize which simply tells the compiler to write the getter setter for you or by implementing it yourself ie you write methods implementation for username and setusername

1269833
getter	setter
further you need to know that you should not use getter setter in either the init or dealloc routines

1269862
post	get
amusingly i had to add more backslashes to get this to post properly -- so ate a few of them

1269868
folder	directory
however the easiest thing to do is set your test files and folder to be copied to the output directory

1269904
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring and nsmutablestring are implemented as a class cluster see string objects in the iphone version of the documentation

1269928
pop-up	dialog
import the icon your want in the pop-up dialog and make sure the id of the icon is the smallest one

1269929
integer	fractions
for date and time i use 64bit float where the integer portion of the real number is the same as integer julian like dates described above and the fractions represents the time in fractions of a day

1269946
uitableview	uisearchbar
the uisearchbar in my uitableview header is the strong color

1269998
int	chars
for instance it is possible to compute the squares of each digit by repeatedly dividing by 10 and fetching the modulus 10 of the resulting value instead of converting the value to a string and then each chars back to int

1270038
division	multiplication
you can implement fastdivbyonemillion as a multiplication and a division by a power of 2

1270056
division	multiplication
division is the same as multiplication by a fraction

1270127
uiview	uitouch
in these messages track the uitouch objects locations converted to points on the view by using the convertpoint toview message of the uiview you re subclassing and calculate the difference of movement

1270134
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you could also try using the developer tools in safari or google-chrome if you re not a firefox fan

1270158
post	get
i will try to get the latest code up on the blog soon and i will update this post when i do

1270182
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works in ie8 safari google-chrome firefox opera etc

1270199
onmousemove	mouseevent
protected override void onmousemove mouseeventargs mouseevent

1270224
children	parent
as you can see although the class parent has two children lists children1 and children2 when they are mapped to the database tables there is nothing in the table saying that which children row should be in children1 or children2 lists

1270224
children	parent
from database perspective we know only which children row belongs to which parent but not which children lists

1270245
width	margin
i believe if you since you ve set the div to width 686px you can use margin 0 auto

1270248
int	chars
a and would return an int representing the chars s ascii value which was usually not the behavior people were looking for but in practical use chars would normally be represented by a one-character string

1270248
int	chars
in ruby 1.9 chars are never mysteriously turned into int

1270275
int	double
xslt 1.0 does not have an int data type only double

1270279
fseek	fread
but you could probably use functions like fwrite and fread and fseek which will be manipulating the pointers and allocating more space if necessary

1270294
width	height
but when i set width and height on the canvas my image disappears

1270351
textmate	bbedit
for example textmate stores the selection for a document this way much as bbedit mpw and others used to store tab settings window size etc

1270381
postgresql	mysql
you can always look at something like spec for example that shows both postgresql and mysql at least

1270393
postgresql	mysql
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

1270393
postgresql	mysql
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

1270393
perl	tcl
both have stored procedures these days but postgresql has much more flexible so far for example support for stored procedures in perl python tcl r etc

1270403
floating-point	integer
in the book they use an example of mixing an integer and a floating-point number 40 + 3.14 and proceed to explain that the result of this expression would be a floating-point number because python converts operands up to the type of the most complicated operand

1270500
firefox	safari
per this post here on so firefox 3.5 safari 4 and ie8 support html5 storage

1270502
boost	stl
by using the stl container classes and the various boost smart_ptrs there s little need to ever explicitly call new or delete in your c++ code

1270505
post	get
they have freed my mind a bit and so in response to my own question i would like to propose an alternative set of restful url conventions which actually embrace the two methods get and post of the non-ajax world instead of trying to work around them

1270505
post	get
but if javascript is disabled clicking the link will instead send a get request which returns a delete confirmation form from the server and that form sends the post to perform the delete

1270538
hide	show
in jquery you could move to the correct layer and hide or show it relatively easily

1270553
vb6	vba
so i ve learned that i need to user interface to make it work and i need to regasm the dll to create a type library file which i can reference directly from the vba vb6 app

1270570
multiplying	division
as joshua haberman mentioned your compiler will probably already convert the division by a constant 1000000 to a multiplying by a magic number followed by a shift if the division is an integer operation

1270594
min	max
the two main problems of using datetime are the min and max constants

1270626
jlist	jtree
i have designed two components i.e calculator and engine source codes below which need to be inside any of the swing components either jlist jtree or any

1270628

by using different xslt files i can use the same xml source to create multiple polyglot x html files presenting the same data in different ways a rss feed an atom feed a rdf descriptor file and fragment of a site map

1270665
maven	pom.xml
i write short xslt transformations to do mass edits on our maven pom.xml files

1270707
xslt	xquery
i ve used xslt and also xquery extensively for various things - to generate c++ code as part of build process to produce documentation from doc comments and within an application that had to work with xml in general and xhtml in particular a lot

1270761
put	get
headers get applied afterwards and then the message gets put directly into the requestcontext s requestmessage property

1270814
width	height
ensure you have installed above gems and make changes to the width and height in the has_attachment then you could see the changes

1270901
width	margin
reduce the width of one div you should have width set on your floats until their combine width including padding margin borders fits in available space

1270917
submit	submission
the last action was the loading of the success page not the form submission which means if users do an f5 it will just reload that page and not submit the form again

1270934
google-chrome	safari
i have sifr v3 revision 419 running fabulously on ie7 ff3 and safari but in google-chrome and ff2 the text renders really tiny

1270960
filesystems	fat
windows fat does not so you will have to come up with another way to handle garbage collecting your session if you are stuck with a fat filesystems or any other filesystems where atime tracking is not available

1270979
width	height
your canvas should have a width and a height and you can use the autoscale maintainaspectratio properties to make the image behave

1270981
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
right now the traditional sqlconnection sqlcommand approach is used and to make sure everything works the two steps delete old entries then insert new ones are wrapped into an ado.net sqltransaction

1271020
getter	setter
you should create yourself setter and getter for the properties you want to modify and a refresh is required afterwards

1271023
plot	heatmap
i m creating heatmap sub plot that differ in aspect ratio according to the data used

1271024
min	max
my numbers table contains a max of 288 since thats the total number of 5 min slots you can have in a 24 hour period

1271069
post	get
i m going to tweak it a bit more to see if i can get it 100 consistent before i post it

1271136
int	double
is for int or long not float or double

1271193
pull	push
my personal feeling is that microsoft have invented the notion that the xmlreader is better with the explanation of the push pull model but i don t really buy it

1271229
post	get
i have been tweaking my code to fit these patterns but i got no results oscillating between not working and not working and i get an extra record so i decided to post my original code

1271254
put	get
after a while i tend to get a lot of small static classes usually with only one method which i usualy put in a utility namespace that gets bloated with classes

1271259
gzipinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
put the data into a bytearrayinputstream then you should be able to decode it with gzipinputstream

1271260
folder	directory
but when its installed as a virtual directory it breaks because it is looking for files in root folder and not in virtualdirectorypath folder

1271268
ant	maven
any copying of modules to a deployment installer-input directory must be done outside the context of maven s core functionality with the ant maven copy command

1271345

the same scenario works just fine on firefox opera and google-chrome

1271354
wav	caf
i have a directory with about 50 wav files that i need to convert to caf because audioservicescreatesystemsoundid returns an error for some of them but not all

1271402
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
it should therefore be possible to do what you want by implementing the viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods in your controller

1271402
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
your viewcontroller will get the viewwillappear viewdidappear messages in that case - by maintaining state and receiving those messages you can then implement logic to decide whether or not you need to play the movie

1271456
inline	inlining
to summarize there are few scenarios where you should attempt to take manual control of inlining by placing or omitting inline statements

1271472
portrait	landscape
in my app when the phone rotates i want to change the view like the calculator app does when it is in portrait it shows the normal calc and when it is in landscape it shows the scientific calc

1271472
portrait	landscape
for example in one of my uiviewcontrollers for portrait mode i will have a grid with images and when it is in landscape i want it to show an image and to be able to swap them like in the photos app

1271516
opera	google-chrome
if i remember correctly in google-chrome and opera simply calling

1271559
children	parent
the number of paths should be o n log n but the algorithm could be much worse depending on what representation they use for children of a parent

1271575
apache	nginx
nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that

1271575
apache	nginx
an added bonus is that nginx serves static and cached content even faster than apache

1271592
width	height
window size width 160 height 78

1271592
width	height
buffer size width 160 height 78

but i want to know the difference between the methods of distinct union group by keyword method for this purpose

1271646
geocoding	geocode
you can try a very ugly hack which consists in geocoding your full adresse and all subsets of the words your adress contains you get a lot of geocode that you use to get the adresses related to them with reverse geocoding tool

1271700
hard-drive	hdd
since in-memory ops are mostly trivial anyways given a hard-drive based database an update can change a database field in-place on the hdd while a delete would remove a row leaving an empty space and insert a new row perhaps to the end of the table again it s all in the implementation

1271702
hide	show
the basic idea is that you show the container element when you hover over the trigger then when you leave the container you hide the container

1271806
versioning	upgrade
otherwise i d have to stay with the current versioning or be very careful with any upgrade since i couldn t be sure what it would break

1271817
draggable	droppable
i can drag my draggable items and drop them on my droppable and get the drop position from

1271819
cvs	svn
svn cvs and other version control system try to resolve conflicts automatically and when cannot will just tell user there is a conflict

1271819
children	parent
when there are disconnected updates to a shared object from two different users two separate children versions leaf nodes result from the same parent version

1271876
post	get
run the monitor as some sort of servlet and get javascript to post kill applet commands when it needs to be killed

1271878
min	max
ie itself is responsive menus min max close etc. but even attempting to navigate also gives infinite load times

1271912

.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you re using mod_php you could put either in a .htaccess in users or in your httpd.conf for the users directory

1272038
prop	each
i would like to sort the elements within each element separately according to their prop attribute

1272047
dictionary	map
map bst are good if you need to have sorted output for your dictionary

1272111
cfstring	nsstring
i think carbon s cfstring toll free bridged to nsstring allows you to use your own memory allocator

1272120
ati	nvidia
the question is ati and nvidia have different conventions for these error messages and the only way i ve found to decide what type of error the shader had is to parse the error string generated by glgetshaderinfolog

1272160
inherited	properties
when i modify the cancelbuttontext properties of my inherited form and i rebuild the project everything is going as expected the text of the cancel button remains as the text that i ve set

1272193
children	parent
the solution is to handle the problem programatically and start with the parent returning a filterered list and then building a list of all the children belonging to the filtered parent

1272226
maven	pom.xml
every maven project inherits the configuration for the central repository from the maven super pom.xml

1272269
hide	show
just use a jquery show hide for your content

1272290

width	height
grab the required property information height width etc. from the control you want to save and store these data in a class you made for that purpose

1272497
swt	swing
the critical parts to master are in my opinion the list tree-models and the general data-binding mechanisms and to find learn and stick to a layout manager that works miglayout is superb and has backends for swing and swt

1272549
children	parent
my class has a parent and a list of children of the same type

1272562
versioning	upgrade
for some reason everyone who upgrade their flash player to the latest versioning 10 0 32 18 immediately start having problems with my application

1272572
codeigniter	cakephp
for php i would recommend yiiframework cakephp or codeigniter .

1272574
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

1272645
getter	setter
in many other languages python delphi groovy the compiler will generate the getter and setter for you unless you supply the code

1272701
superclass	subclassing
however when retrieving an instance of containerclass via hibernate.isession.get it always returns me an instance of superclass even when the item in question should be an instance of subclassing

1272792
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
the image formats considered are bmp jpeg png and gif

1272800
hash	md5
assuming that dict is a dictionary that contains the filename as the key and the md5 hash as the value you could use the following code to display duplicate files

1272824
rss	feed
this post at the yahoo pipes blog goes through the basics of building a complex rss feed with a couple examples

1272855
ant	maven
you ll also want to make note of the paths on other builds tools maven ant jdks config files for thos build tools .m2 settings.xml and the like

1272864
jboss	glassfish
typical examples are tomcat glassfish jboss jetty and many others

1272864
jboss	glassfish
of these tomcat is the lightest weight as it is only a servlet container jboss and glassfish are j2ee application servers and is the reference implementation for the servlets specification

1272912
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i tried to put it in viewdidload and viewwillappear but those didn t work unless i assigned the view of the root view controller to the view of the navigation controller used in the modal which then caused other issues.

1272927
getter	setter
i don t believe there s a language ready solution for this all the properties would need to have getter and setter

1272934
implements	extends
the simplest to implements is just to extends the checkbox class

1272948
firefox	safari
i have tested my website on safari and firefox on both pc and mac and the links work fine

1272956
put	get	post	put	post	get
to consume an ado.net data service all that is needed is the ability to make http requests using the get post put and delete verbs and to set the accept header

1272956
put	get	post	put	post	get
not all programming environments offer these silverlight 2 and j2me can only do get and post not put and delete

1272968
free	malloc
calling free on a ptr that wasnt allocated by malloc or its brethren is undefined

1272987
versioning	upgrade
this assumes that intermediate builds are free upgrade and major versioning changes are paid

1273024
firefox	safari
your links are all held within a table missing its starting tag but tables are not supported in all document types and perhaps firefox and safari are guessing better

1273089
rss	feed
read some rss feed walk the dog stackoverflow

1273111
post	get
otherwise to get raw post content try

1273113
cvs	svn
he s not new to version control having used cvs svn and clearcase before

1273125
udp	tcp
ncat has a host of new features such as connection brokering tcp udp redirection socks4 client and server supprt ability to chain ncat processes http connect proxying and proxy chaining ssl connect listen support ip address connection filtering plus much more.

1273141
folder	directory
you can programmatically check to see if an update has just been downloaded using applicationdeployment.currentdeployment.isfirstrun and then write your own migration code to move the appropriate folder from .pre into the parent directory

1273141
folder	directory
a different answer and the one we ve used is to bypass the clickonce datadirectory completely and set your own folder up in the user s application data directory remembering to use the .net alias for that folder

1273141
folder	directory
the folder follow a user that is using roaming profiles our experience has been that in a roaming profile situation the clickonce directory are not configured to roam

1273149
put	get
java s hashmap has the put and get methods for setting getting items

1273155
post	get
i get all post done by x done all post done by x s friends

1273166
int	chars
that could be slower for more complex types than int and chars

1273217
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu

1273257
put	get
either put them in the same translation unit or use a function to get log

1273285
folder	directory	chown	chmod
so i used chmod and chown to make the project directory static documents folder writable to apache

1273285
chown	chmod
i m not too familiar with this distro it s the flavor of red hat we re given so i ve never had to go beyond chmod and or chown to fix a permissions problem

1273314
onclick	onfocus
edit changing the onclick property to onfocus fixed that problem but brought another one to light see my comment david

1273329
int	chars
then you do to scan the chars into an int

1273343
udp	tcp
also you can read info like this from proc net tcp and proc net udp

1273346
post	get
helpful if you ve got several variables existing between pre post text and only want to get rid of a particular one

1273385
public	protected
this requires to use a public non-virtual method as interface for the clients and making the virtual method protected which is actually a good thing to do but it requires the use of a member variable specifically for this purpose which needs to be mutable if the virtual method must be const

1273433
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have an asp.net webform with a number of dropdownlistfor multiple select enabled listboxes checkbox and textboxes

1273469
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
self navigationcontroller pushviewcontroller controller animated yes

1273478
for-loop	loops
yes you should use a for-loop but since you already commented on that i left the while loops alone with the assumption that there s more code you didn t show us

1273509
maven	pom.xml
essentially maven is searching for a dependency that is not included in the pom.xml file or the in the settings.xml file at all

1273511
fflush	gets
if this is critical data however you should call fflush after each write to make sure it gets to disk

1273570
sorting	grouping
in report design view open sorting and grouping from menu or toolbar

1273580
put	get
if you put style in app.xmal then you can get the style with the code like

1273590
width	height
you may be able to throw something together by using gdk_window_get_root_origin to get the top left corner of the window and gdk_window_get_geometry to get the width and height

1273609
mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout
it is actually less expensive to use mouseenter mouseleave because they do not fire for the menu when children mouseover mouseout fire

1273646
sudo	passwd
depending on how exactly you installed things you may need to use sudo python setup.py install and give your passwd to enable writing into the system directories

1273682
folder	directory
create the remote directory or folder

1273684
hide	show
it s not stacking it side but side but the short cut of ctrl-r lets you show hide the results window very quickly and not bother moving the vertical divider

1273702
dxcore	coderush
if you re interested in doing this yourself the dxcore can be installed through the free coderush xpress available from

1273705
tapestry	wicket
wicket s goal is to support static typing to the fullest extent whereas tapestry is more about saving lines of code

1273705
tapestry	wicket
so with tapestry your code base is likely smaller which is good for maintenance and with wicket you much is statically typed which makes it easier to navigate with an ide and check with a compiler which also is good for maintenance

1273837
ant	maven
also you could use maven ant build systems for building production code from scripts

1273863
stdout	stderr
i ve been learning qt on windows for a little while background in unix embedded and would like to have stderr stdout dumped out somewhere unit test event logging debug from my win32 qt gui app

1273919
udp	tcp
and my conclusion is pretty similar to yours the only currently available methods are using the net ftp net ssh net scp being the easiest solution and the standard tcp udp protocol

1273919
udp	tcp
the problem with the latter tcp udp is that you have to write custom code to slice and dice the binary file and package it in such a way you can send it as a packet and on the receiving end you have to authorize it validate it and unpack the damn packet

1274037
cos	sin
your sin and cos functions expect arguments in radians

1274074
single-quotes	double-quotes
attributes can have double-quotes single-quotes or even nothing arround their values

1274131
cvs	svn
i particularly like nick sergeants article describing a method where you checkout the drupal sources via cvs and then control your changes and the cvs records using svn

1274137
post	get
here is a sample script that i recently used in a gateway post transaction that receives a get response

1274145
xsl-fo	xslt
if for some reason you like xslt then you could use xsl-fo but i think it s painful

1274199
maven-assembly-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
i couldn t get the maven-jar-plugin to work i had to use the maven-assembly-plugin

1274225
apache	lighttpd
i m using lighttpd + fastcgi not apache + mod_php

1274226
ant	myeclipse
afaikt there is no ootb feature that can generate an ant script or equivalent headless-build script from myeclipse nor is there an exposed way to invoke myeclipse builders from a build-script platform

1274285
sorting	grouping
we do this by sorting the images in descending order of def so the 1s are at the top and then grouping by vehicleid to make sure there is only one row per vehicle

1274297
sorting	grouping
we do this by sorting the images in descending order of def so the 1s are at the top and then grouping by vehicleid to make sure there is only one row per vehicle

1274301
affinity	processors
std thread does not include support for priorities controlling the size of the thread stack controlling the scheduling policy or controlling the processors affinity

1274301
affinity	processors
processors affinity and stack size are really important for high-performance systems

1274309
post	get
instead a match in the routing table diverts a get or post request from the browser to a controller method in one of your controllers

opera	firefox
for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox

1278292
getattr	subclassing
if you also have to handle custom classes that behave like dictionaries but aren t subclassing from dict you can use getattr to get the function you require

1278310
textview	simplecursoradapter
simplecursoradapter knows how to handle textview and children automatically but everything else needs help

1278328
eiffel	ada
now some languages mandate eiffel -- i think it is also the case of java and c# but my knowledge of them is not good enough to be authoritative or allow ada an shared handling of genericity don t have explicit specialization but would allow virtual template function putting template in libraries and could reduce the code size

1278348
agile	sprint
then when you have that under your belt you could consider adding features such as a project wiki to track requirements and or add functionality to the tool to help with agile processes such as a burn down chart and functionality for tracking sprint

folder	directory
the first and the second site are separate physical folder and virtual directory on iis7

1278689
post	get
it never post but does a get

1278789
folder	directory
if you need the parent read only and the child not read only then you ll need to use a filewatcher to look for new directory and change the read only attributes on it when it sees a new folder

1278867
hide	show
the toggle hide show method overrides the hide class s style

1278874
int	double

google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox and google-chrome chromium we re still working on the css for ie but the js works as far as i can tell

1279050
button	checkbox
instead of performing the checkbox functionality on button click you could use the oncheckedchanged event of the checkbox and set autopostback to true in asp.net

1279050
button	checkbox
then you will can execute the checkbox actions automatically and perform the data validation on the button click event

1279141
pkcs#5	pkcs#1	des	aes
as long as you use same algorithm des aes etc same mode cbc ecb etc same padding pkcs#1 pkcs#5 the cipher should work on both platforms

browsers it works in are ie 5.5 6 and 7 google-chrome 2 firefox 2 3 and 3.5 and safari 4 all on windows

1279178
mouseup	mousedown
after that handle the event mousedown or mouseup depending of the behavior you want

1279179

if you know what the file is supposed to look like you could compare it against a known good md5 hash

1279185
mouse	keyboard
ideally i don t want to setup a keyboard mouse and monitor

1279211
.htaccess	httpd.conf
my first guess would be an issue with the .htaccess or httpd.conf file

1279211
.htaccess	httpd.conf
having said that if you know the issue isn t with the httpd.conf file check to see if the root of the publishing path has a .htaccess

1279240
pop-up	dialog
i have all the code to do this but i simply want a modal window pop-up dialog to launch in which i can have my simple add form

1279242

1279359
for-loop	arrays
it was fast of course but i cringed every time i had to write a for-loop to go through the elements of an arrays which was very often

1279365
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1279410
implements	extends
however you could of course extends dataannotationsruleprovider and override the appropriate method to make it do what you want extract validation attributes from implements interfaces

1279410
implements	extends
to get attributes from properties in implements interfaces you should extends dataannotationsruleprovider and override getrulesfromtypecore

1279421
free	malloc
his primary concern is that the malloc and free calls be fast and correct

1279450
telerik	radcombobox
telerik responded quickly and their radcombobox met my needs

1279487
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos	redhat	fedora
rpm is used by redhat and its derivatives fedora centos while deb is used in debian and ubuntu

1279508
width	height
not the data changes only the layout changes like the width the height the order of the columns and maybe the visibility of them

1279550
free	malloc
from looking at the tango source malloc free in tango.stdc.stdlib are just the c standard library functions so there should rightfully be no difference - and in fact when i try it using phobos and std.c.stdlib under linux the memory goes right back down as it should

1279572
firefox	safari
this works in firefox 3.0 and 3.5 safari 4.0.2 and i ve only found this error when viewing the page in ie8

1279626
width	height
this depends on the containing element of the togglebutton - i believe that on a grid stackpanel or dockpanel the button will stretch to fill available space if you don t set width + height or maxwidth + maxheight

1279663
facade	mediator
when the proxy s state is updated rather than sending a new notification the mediator which retrieves a reference to the proxy from the facade has its state updated

1279668
firefox	safari
i have found this solution to work in ie 6+ firefox 3.5+ safari 4+

1279717
dia	visio
dia is roughly inspired by the commercial windows program visio though more geared towards informal diagrams for casual use

1279756
division	multiplication
you need to change your structure to use a numeric or decimal datatype don t forget to allow a few extra places for doing division and multiplication on the values

1279807
linefeed	delimiter
mac uses cr as line delimiter at least it did before i am not sure for modern macs nix uses linefeed and windows uses both crlf

1279818
ats	smalltalk
you might find smalltalk interesting or even ats

1279843
put	get
if you put all the special values in one table you get a very sparse table

1279846
haskell	ocaml
it should be noted however that this would not be typical of idiomatic ocaml code - for example its polymorphism is also runtime similar to haskell and that carries the appropriate penalty

1279846
boost	stl
it can be fairly high-level if you use high-level libraries such as stl and boost

1279893
free	malloc
it just means that digital mars implementation of malloc and free doesn t return memory to the os even when you allocate a huge chunk like that

1279893
free	malloc
you could try using malloc and free from msvcrt.dll instead maybe they ll free the memory

1279909
postgresql	mysql
for fulltext search compare sql server vs lucene.net vs clucene vs mysql vs postgresql

1279915
width	height
conceivably you could wrap the cell contents in a and use that to enforce a particular height width

1279928
google-chrome	safari
i have tried on ie8 google-chrome safari and in all three as the page loads the linkbutton just disappears

1279945
int	double
f is a function that takes a single int parameter and returns a pointer to a function that takes a double parameter and returns int

1279962
getter	setter
the data capsule is a simple class with lots of getter and setter properties it uses a di framework and consistently use the ioc container to provide instances of the data capsule lucky me

1279992
firefox	safari
it seems that firefox and safari ignore this while ie does not allow scripts to overwrite this

1280047
bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
update this works in bash 4.0 as well as tcsh and dash if you change source to

1280067
octal	decimal
the thing is that 027447002 in terms of numbers is octal base-8 - not a zero-filled decimal base-10 integer

1280141
put	get	accessor	properties
if i put a breakpoint on the line of code under test vs tells me the properties or indexer presenter.iqueryform.queryresults cannot be used in this context because it lacks the get accessor

1280181
octal	binary
the real question is why haven t more languages adopted octal and binary notations in a more regular fashion

1280186
octal	binary
in c# there are no binary or octal literals perhaps the reasoning is that you shouldn t do as much bit fiddling that the language needs it.

1280203
hide	show
and finally one more option show hide different panels on the page

1280229
put	get
then i tried to put the triangle numbers and their number of factors in a 2d array first and then get the input from the user and search the array

1280232
slider	jcarousel
i am using the plugin jcarousel and rather than the images slider in like in the carousel with autoscrolling demo

1280239
set	bag
use set instead of bag

1280256
floor	sqrt
that obviously would take n comparisons...you can just go up to floor sqrt n

1280256
floor	sqrt
and we re done because 4 is floor sqrt n

1280315
button	checkbox
some form controls automatically have labels associated with them press button while most do not text fields checkbox and radio button and menus

1280342
getter	setter
the actual implementation of datagridview isn t under mocks control so it can t intercept the getter and setter for selectionmode

1280348
range	infinity
i will say that the integration over infinite range is a problem that i addressed and upon execution of the code it states the round off error at infinity which numerically just means large

1280362
unsigned	short	int	chars
1 an rvalue of type chars signed chars unsigned chars short int or unsigned short int can be converted to an rvalue of type int if int can represent all the values of the source type

1280368
webkit	gecko	post	put
i found that webkit would crop everything if i put overflow hidden on the element but gecko wouldn t see my blog post for code and screenshots

1280387
hide	show
i m looking for some non-javascript techniques by which to reload a page of tree items basically divs within divs while remembering their show hide status

1280387
hide	show
basically my goal is to be able to show hide the tree whether js is enabled or not

1280418
g++	gcc
i want my code to compile with the intel compiler s or with gcc g++ depending on a configure argument

1280464
next	except
almost the same in python 2.5 except you have to use g.next instead of next g in the append

1280470
ant	maven
i have the ant script call maven to set up the local repo and then call svn to commit it to google code

1280488
blitz++	ublas	boost	blitz++
you could try blitz++ -- or boost s ublas

1280492
superclass	subclassing
let s say we have a superclass called super and a subclassing called sub

1280492
super	extends
now you would probably expect since sub extends super that sub would now inherit all of super s methods however it seems to only receive references to the sub s methods

1280525
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested this out in firefox 3.5 ie7 ie8 google-chrome 3

1280556
nstimer	nsrunloop
nstimer created by this call is owned by current nsrunloop object so it is not going to be autoreleased by any autorelease pool drain

1280583
ready	each
each developer gets their own branch that they can do with as the please then when they are ready to share their changes with the other developers they just merge their changes back into the main branch

1280590
bazaar	git
any dvcs such as bazaar mercurial darcs or git supports private branches

1280628
inherited	subclassing
the code uses inherited to do its thing you have to use that subclassing to store your values

1280631
stdout	stderr
his favorite trick was to have shell scripts calling shell scripts calling shell scripts and explicitly redirecting stdout and stderr to dev null sometimes 2 and 3 layers deep

1280672
width	margin	puts	gets
the wrapfig package takes an entire column away so text below the images gets wrapped to a fixed width even without the image there and pushes the description environment past the left margin and the floatflt package puts the image exactly where i want it but no text gets wrapped

1280686
trie	tree
a somewhat simpler trie is the burst-trie which essentially gives you an interpolation between a standard tree of some sort like a bst and a trie

1280693
postgresql	mysql
if you are just doing development work look into mamp which has a whole bunch of extensions including pdo for mysql and postgresql built-in

1280705
tax	shipping
id | subtotal | tax | shipping | datecreated

1280717
min	max
2 ttrackbars 1 for min 1 for max

1280717
range	min
2 ttackbars 1 for min 1 for range

1280717
min	max
you can click and drag 3 different points to the min max or both

1280741
spaces	delimiter
it gets a list of changed files filters it to just mergeinfo only changes strips everything but the actual file path converts the one-per-line paths into a spaces delimiter list and the calls revert on that list

1280797
inherited	subclassing
since the subclassing inherited from the double class you still get all the functionality of the double class and the added functionality of your custom mydouble class

1280820
src	attr
this always works for me #foo attr src url

1280862
opera	safari
you might be looking for the elementfrompoint method that exists in msie ff3+ and in some form in safari and opera

1280872
junit	testng
this happens because it keeps track of the current test being executed by the test runner which can be a junit 3.8 a junit 4.5+ or a testng 5.8+ runner

1280872
junit	testng
so when not running in the context of a testing framework junit or testng it lacks the necessary test tracking information

1280888
put	get
group the data by question_id such that i can put tags to my questions i have tried to manipulate the data by php but i get only this far

1280903
firefox	safari
safari 4 is perfect firefox 3.5 is great etc

1280967
min	max
it won t move min and max simultaneously but since you ve got the source you could probably add that functionality if you really need it

1280998
subtract	add
you should have done a search - i posted a complete answer to this question over here just the other day for utc at least - to adjust for other timezones just add or subtract the timezone offset in seconds from the unixtime before you call the function

1281087
mouseleave	mouseenter
what you are looking for is mouseenter and mouseleave

1281087
mouseover	mouseenter
a good example can be found at this link they have compared both mouseenter and mouseover

1281094
perl	tcl
tcl might be easier to embed than perl but i do have to agree matthew scharley s reasoning

1281114
i2c	spi
it uses a samsung micro and the development hardware has some generous peripherals including uart spi i2c and usb interfaces

1281214
content-disposition	content-type
if you re attempting to output binary data look into php s header function and ensure you set the proper content-type and content-disposition

1281233
client-side	server-side
tracking can be done either server-side or client-side

1281236
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that shows a list of contacts via a sqldatasource

1281236
gridview	sqldatasource
gridview and sqldatasource here

1281239
submit	submission
one common approach to classic form submission is to display the code on say index.php submit it to say save.php and then afterward redirect back to index.php or an alternate page so that theoretically the post will no longer be the most recently displayed page and refreshing the page will not resubmit the form noting of course that not all browsers obey that logic all the time

1281244
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
if you were managing leading a large or distributed team i d strongly recommend dvcs hg is my choice but git and bazaar are very popular too but as you appear to be working on your own svn s just fine

1281244
vim	emacs
what ide or editor you like -- eclipse vim emacs zend stuff w ever -- is really secondary

1281258
actionscript	mxml
mxml is simply declarative actionscript so there is no difference between creating your instance in actionscript or using the mxml notation

1281299
superclass	subclassing
when you create a new subclassing a new type of structure is defined with all the superclass s ivars followed by the new class s ivars

1281299
nsobject	ivar
in the case of nsobject and indeed object the base class structure only contains one ivar - a pointer called isa to the class structure representing this object s class

1281368
vsto	add-in
the code is similar to the first sample except that the current excel.application instance is available to the add-in via globals.thisaddin.application vsto generated and i can see that it is really a microsoft.office.interop.excel.application instance because i can use things like app.activecell.value2 test this actually puts the text into the active cell

1281369
children	parent
the cardinality one-to-many defines just this a parent has many children but a child has only exactly one parent

1281372
maven	pom.xml
it s worth following the maven conventions in your pom.xml regardless of your build method

1281372
maven	pom.xml
as the point of putting your jar in a maven repository is to make it accessible to maven users you will therefore need to define a pom.xml for your published artifact

1281372
maven	pom.xml
for example adding the scm details to the pom.xml will amongst other things allow your users to import the project into their workspace using the ide integrations for maven

1281372
ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
set up a maven repository do your builds with ant and use maven to deploy the jar and pom.xml

1281372
ant	maven
set up a maven repository ad use an ant http task to publish the artifacts

1281372
maven	pom.xml
note that the maven deploy goal will automatically translate the pom.xml to project-name - version .pom

1281372
ant	maven
if you want to use ant to deploy to a maven repository you can use an ant http library note i ve not tried this myself

1281372
ant	maven
if you want to avoid maven completely and use ant to deploy to an svn-backed repository you can use the svnant subversion library

1281390
filtering	grouping
when you want to sort by any date you need to add a date filtering located in the date grouping

1281397
rss	feed
trying to write a python application that downloads images from an rss feed and makes a composite background

1281399
nfa	dfa
one of the other major differences between dfa s and nfa s is that badly-written nfa s are prone to serious even catastrophic performance problems and sloppy alternations are one of the easiest ways to trigger them

1281422
getter	setter
from what i can tell django follows the gorm model more than it does the ar model so that model might be something worth looking into especially given that java probably wouldn t lend itself to dynamic getter and setter as ruby does unless you starting delving into generating bytecode on the fly but your compiler and ide wouldn t like that very much

1281428
exponent	modulo
the integers are the modulo and the public exponent

1281430
post	get
if somebody has it working and can help me get it working that s great and i ll post code errors

1281460
post	get
using both get and post requests this cached as expected

1281460
post	get
if you re running osx use this awesome tool to create get and post requests

1281485
pop-up	dialog
edit i ve just compiled and tested this and it works pop-up some dialog with folder appearance settings

1281490
getter	setter
cheat and bind to a string property in my viewmodel whose setter getter does the conversion loading values into the combobox using code-behind in the view

1281511
rss	feed
first work out what you want to show and where this information comes from could be a bunch of reg keys in the case of an mru list and an rss feed for news headlines

1281549
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
example objectinputstream and objectoutputstream keep references to all objects they have seen in order to send subsequent occurences of the same object as references rather than copies and thereby deal with circular references

1281552
svg	vml
not quite charting but lightweight svg vml cross-browser graphic library raphaeljs.com

1281568
solaris	bsd
sure it s easier but won t work on mac linux bsd solaris and probably nor very later windows version

1281572
hash	salt
alternatively use cryptographic hash sums that include a salt and the client s ip address to ensure data has not been tampered with

1281618
post	get
what i m trying to do is get the latest wordpress blog post like 5 and generate an image from it

1281651
tostring	string.format
i run this separately for each approach the + operator string.format and stringbuilder calling tostring so the memory used will not be affected by other approaches

1281659
width	height
with that you can also grab the width and height

1281683
jobs	cron
now i am working on my own project and would like to find good practices for web development when using shared web hosting and not working from a unix based environment with all the magic i could do with perl bash scripting cron jobs etc

1281714
actionscript	mxml
besides xml configuration spring actionscript also supports mxml configuration

1281770
treeview	tabcontrol
currently i populate the treeview or tabcontrol manually iterating through the xml adding the nodes to the appropriate leaf

1281870
folder	directory
in the latter case your deployment script would simply move the bits to a staging web folder accessible via beta.mysite.com and then another deployment script could move that to the live web directory

1281894
perl	tcl
nearly all of the scripting languages perl python lua php ruby tcl are intended to be embedded into c and c++

1281974
firefox	safari
i would not doubt that this could be something wrong with firefox but if safari does it too it is likely your code

1281998
children	parent
you need to set the parent property of each child instead of adding children to the parent

1282928
gif	png
i have a watermark script i am working on the results are good on png and on jpg images however a gif image not so good

1282941
client-side	server-side
finally since the server-side code will look about the same regardless of which client-side submission method you use submitting via ajax is more effort which is not always justified

1282941
submit	submission
however even forms that have the option to submit via ajax should also support traditional submission

1282960

1283072
mouseover	mouseout
so your best best in this situation would be to apply a concrete class let s say .hover via a function bound to the mouseover and mouseout events of the desired target elements

1283156

1283195
xdebug	xhprof
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server

1283349
width	height
how can i inside the fx code get the actual height and width of the applet

1283409
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
use strutils.ansistartsstr for case-sensitive strutils.ansistartstext for case-insensitive

1283422
accessor	ivar
in the meantime using the accessor directly is the only way to do it without providing an explicit ivar

1283446
ati	nvidia
even if you know what the error messages look like now nvidia and ati are under no obligation to keep them the same in the next version s of their drivers

the dependencyobject class contains a dispatcher properties which means all controls and other objects which inherited from this class also provide this properties in a way similar to winforms

1284138
vbscript	jscript
there is no need to convert everything to jscript you can use utilities written in jscript from vbscript

1284141
children	parent
i assumed that this would access the span element parent the li and children the ul contained instead the li but this doesn t seem to be the case

1284144
children	parent
when you click on the span you get the parent of the spam the a and look for its ul children â it doesn t have any

1284163
fadein	fadeout
basically i use fadein and fadeout for jquery - the problem is that everything works fine except in ie

1284183
put	get
once you get to the os you will need to put in some dll s to make most pda programs work but it should do the job

1284193
width	height
furthermore i do not necessarily know the floated div s width and height

1284200
post	get
i think you can checkout my other post example included and get a headstart

1284201
imagemagick	magick++
magick++ is the object-oriented c++ api to the imagemagick image-processing library

1284215
stdout	stderr
i m afraid i don t want to waste lots of cds testing it out so i haven t run it but by you re comment it looks like it s not outputing the info to stdout but to stderr

1284215
stdout	stderr
i suggest running a sample command directly on the command-line and redirecting stdout and stderr to different files

1284215
stdout	stderr
then you can work out which things come out on stdout and which on stderr

1284220
width	height
furthermore i do not necessarily know the floated div s width and height

1284227
keydown	keyup
the control.keypress event and related keydown and keyup should do what you need

1284415
vmware	virtualbox
something to consider-- if you have the hardware run vmware or virtualbox and set up a few virtual machines to get used to various distributions before making the commitment to install a particular one on bare hardware

1284426
concave	convex
edit reconsidering this picturing possible collisions with concave convex boundaries it is just as well your polygons overlap

1284426
concave	convex
alas when the convex and the concave meet it always gets me into trouble

1284463
children	parent
lets call them parent and children

1284463
children	parent
the parent table has many records in the children table

1284463
children	parent
my approach is to select all records from parent then loop through each one selecting the data from children

1284463
children	parent
the data needs to be displayed like the name of the parent record then a list of children records

1284464
post	get
i want to use ajax to post the form and i want it to get all fields even if they are disabled

1284480
post	put
also keep in mind that if you put it all in one form when you post back the data each time you could be posting back a lot of data from viewstate assuming webforms and posted data so it all comes down to how much each form does

1284491
children	parent
any ways if you want to know what sql to use checkout select parent record with all children in sql

1284493
children	parent
as has been pointed out in the comments if you use the inner join of course you ll only get back parent and their child records - parent without children will be left out

1284519
rss	feed
there isn t really a standardized api for these types of things and every rss feed provider is different

1284519
rss	feed
if you don t want to email them or they don t have the requested api you are going to have to pull the whole rss feed parse is and then figure out what to do from there

1284596

g++	gcc
which is compiled in codesourcery g++ gcc 4.3.2 for bare metal arm

1284619
g++	gcc
all files for c and c++ compilation are identical the only difference is the call to compiler - g++ for main.cpp gcc for main.c with differences in the level of warnings and c++ has rtti and exceptions disabled

1284639
uiview	subviews
so don t set the table view directly as self.view but rather create a blank uiview as container and add the table view as well as the header view as subviews to that view

1284644
fflush	gets
another way to do it would be to simply buffer elements in the queue and when the queue gets too large fflush it explicitly

1284658
opera	google-chrome
note display inline-block is only supported in ff3+ ie8+ opera and google-chrome

1284667

1284677
verilog	vhdl
it understands c c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a number of other languages

1284703

i am initially hosting this system on a resource limited vps which i have to scale up all factors in order to upgrade i can t just whack loads of ram in without paying for extra bandwidth disk space etc

1284715

limited exponent range results might overflow yielding infinity or

1284725
post	get
from this i assume your get action is using some object stored inside tempdata from the post action

hash	salt
you should not be keeping the passwords in any form other than salt hash digests

1284872
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox safari google-chrome opera - the search bar and 4 sliders from the page linked above are all on 1 row

jruby includes the ffi api which was originally created for rubinius but is now supported on jruby macruby maglev tinyrb mri and yarv the last two via the ffi gem as well

1285015
put	get
if you use an object as a key in a hashmap or if you put it in a hashset and then change the state of the object so that hashcode would return a different value then you re confusing the hashmap or hashset and you ll get strange things

1285022
coldfusion	railo
you might look at fusionreactor it lists railo resin support so it might work for coldfusion resin and you could use the trial to test it or just ask them

1285031
firefox	safari
firefox and safari have -khtml- and -moz-

1285095
comparator	comparable
the comparator and comparable interfaces are likely inapplicable here

google reveals that i need to use fseek and ftell but for that the file apparently needs to be opened in binary mode and that gives only garbage

1285137
unsigned	short
how about int and short int or even differences between signed and unsigned versions of each of the types

1285153
post	get
you can either develop a custom provider as described in becky s post for forms-based authentication or make calls to profile.getpropertyvalue and profile.setpropertyvalue to get and set the profile values for the current user

1285178
fink	macports
also macports and fink two oss package managers for os x use the opt and sw trees respectively

1285178
fink	macports
of course one of the best ways to go if you want to keep things unix-y is to package your app for macports or fink

1285178
fink	macports
macports is of the bsd ports tree lineage and fink is of the debian lineage

1285212
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in firefox opera and google-chrome or any other browser that correctly implements window.getcomputedstyle is very simple

1285229
post	get
i was thinking of maybe adding a new column on the forum_categories table and updating it each time a post is made however that could get messy

1285239
post	get
the only hit you get when you delete a post then you need to update cache for the question and the forum

1285254
vbscript	jscript
you will need to build some other jscript functions to assist converting the object into something more easily consumed in vbscript

1285255
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
simply use an objectoutputstream to serialize it into a file and an objectinputstream to get it back

1285339
firefox	safari
when an error string is returned instead of an integer parsefloat html some string... firefox and safari correctly display the error in the else condition

1285339
firefox	safari
as before works as expected in firefox safari but ie evaluates both string error and integer success as a success

1285353
int	boolean
decimalformat uses a bunch of fields for maintaining its position within its formatting process patterns for prefixes and suffixes boolean s indicating whether or not to use exponential notation and thousands grouping int s to describe the size of its int and fractions parts etc

1285408
post	get
it should just post data then redirect to get a new page could be the same url

1285420
bytearrayinputstream	bufferedimage
then through creating a temp file using bytearrayinputstream and reader object to form a bufferedimage object which i write to a file send this back into matlab in an array

1285486
post	get
a post or even a get request by the client implies that the client expects a response back from the server

1285486
post	get
however your post handling action method will not return a concrete answer but will return a redirectresult to the get handling action method thus the client will request that and wait for its response in turn the get handling action method will contruct the view and return it

1285493
post	get
i discovered long ago that setting this header for post requests is necessary but this seems to have really screwed up get requests

1285553
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to make a pop-up dialog which will allow a user to enter in some databases settings

vb6	vba
the thing is i didn t anticipate the .net dll to be used for other than .net apps so now i was told this all is going to be used in a vba powerpoint macro which i figure is rather similar to a vb6 app so that is how i m planning to test it right now

1285935
vb6	vba
and can someone please provide some resources or sample codes that i can learn on how to properly write a .net dll which has functions with parameters that can be called from vb6 vba app

1285945
multiplying	add
my application would perform a large number of matrix operations add multiplying on dense matrices

1285946
viewdidload	viewwillappear
one case for doing this in init is that viewdidload can be called after viewwillappear

1285960
uiview	subviews
the overall uiview that contained subviews would not draw its subviews if i called drawrect which makes sense now actually since it says in the documentation if you call drawrect you are responsible for filling that entire area regardless of super and subviews implementations

1286029
csc	vbc
but using notepad or at least use notepad++ will teach you more about msbuild and the vbc or csc compiler syntax than it will teach you about the language features

1286033

i was doing a memory profiling in instrumentation for my iphone app and i pressed the full screen button in the lower left

1286059
firefox	safari
the above code works great in firefox safari but not in ie

fseek	ftell
however this avoids having to use fstat or fseek ftell to figure out how big the file is beforehand

i found this very easy to do with rss feed and linq but i am stuck trying to do the same with an atom feed

1290865
strcpy	strcmp
besides a discussion on the standard lib strcpy strcmp etc. i would like to give them some hints something like and things like that

1290902
stdout	stderr
foo 2 1 means redirect all of the output including handle 2 that is stderr from the foo command to handle 1 that is stdout

1290906
int	chars
getchar is going to return the chars code for the chars as an int

1290951
strcpy	strcmp	strncmp	strcpy	strncmp	strcmp
never ever use strcpy strcmp strcat etc.. instead use their safe variants strncmp strncat strndup .

1290951
strncmp	strcmp
use strcmp or better strncmp

1290974
post	get
its get not post

1290982
qtableview	qtreeview
qtreeview or qtableview

1290994
post	get
i would suggest if you are using .net to create a wcf service with webhttp bidding and implement get and post methods you can get responses back in json and xml theres a set of classes to parse json on the iphone that will make parsing the response a breeze they are avaialble in the web with little setup you will be able to perform gets and post from the iphone using nsurlrequest

1290997
int	double
i have some .dll native c++ programs which mainly return int double values array structures and string values

1291029
hide	show
i m still deciding how i will filter the map contents on the left either with ajax or a javascript show hide -- hence my need for this solution

1291061
antialiasing	transparent
i d like to draw antialiasing text on a transparent bitmap and have the antialiasing drawn as alpha blended pixels

1291096
prepare	execute
the performance benefit comes when you execute a prepare query multiple times with different parameter values

1291116
post	put
so if i put this address localhost 3000 en post 72 to the browser then it gives me the page without a problem

1291147
cout	cin
a tutorial is talking about cin and cout

1291179
ubuntu	linux
so for a start i would like to create a server which manages the game rules and player interactions and a client on the local cli i m running ubuntu linux for convenience

1291187
put	get	post	put	post	get
this works great for get operations and the put and post operations are about as easy to write

1291187
post	put
the catch is the rails put and post operations don t accept the same tags

1291253
stopwatch	chronometer
here s my two cents on how to turn it into a real stopwatch function without subclassing chronometer

1291286
factors	matrix
if i m understanding what you wrote then multiplying your matrix by a shape say s2 will scale each of s2 s points by a factors of x

1291288
getdate	dateadd
to duplicate your asp code it would look something like dateadd m -6 getdate

1291296
sorting	filtering
make sure your columns are well indexed and the index is used for filtering and sorting

1291325
jquery	scriptaculous
here s the scenario i m using prototype and scriptaculous but i believe jquery would have the same issue

1291352
firefox	safari
after spending over 15 hours on this issue dedication i know i found a partial solution that works in firefox and safari but not in ie

1291352
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari this function will insert the content at the current caret position within the iframe that wordpress uses as a tinymce editor

1291362
strcpy	strncpy
i would discuss when and when not to use strcpy and strncpy and what can go wrong

1291373
put	get
also sounds like this might be one of your first iphone apps so you re likely learning new stuff every day - now you get to put all the new stuff in this app too

1291385
post	get
the main problem is that you re using a post request when submitting the form but will-paginate uses a get request

1291426
uidatepicker	uipickerview
can anyone help me how to make the uipickerview displays the first row s value after the last row s value just like the uidatepicker where after 12 the 1 will follow

1291467
sum	floor
the elevation of the floor however is defined by the sum of the floor heights below it

1291477
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a little project consisting of a root uiviewcontroller which manages 5 other view controllers with a uitabbar i m not using uitabbarcontroller

1291477
uidatepicker	uipickerview
each view controller has a uipickerview except one that has a uidatepicker

1291479
vb6	vba
i don t have much experience with vba which is why i m simulating this using vb6 which i know a tiny bit more about

1291479
vb6	vba
so i m hoping there s other tools methods that i can use which can allows me to properly debug what s going on between the vb6 vba app and the .net dll

1291559
folder	directory
i m working with a lot of files in my resources directory and i d like to create folder to organise them

1291559
folder	directory
i ve tried both grouping in xcode and creating an actual folder in the resources directory

1291578
folder	dir
place the file in the cmd folder of your git install dir eg c program files x86 git cmd

1291586
min	max
use a linq .where statement and string.compare between your min and max directory names as strings with x as a string

1291600
min	max
the most common are min and max

1291607
put	get
even if you were to put a cert on the other server i think it may still get confused because of different sites can t confirm nor deny though and regardless you don t want to waste the time of your media server by encrypting images

1291732
strlen	strcpy
however for the code to work as intended i think line and therefore tempstr must be already null terminated strlen line will count to the first null terminator so for the code to work as expected it must also be utterly redundant as strcpy will have copied the null terminator when it copied line in the first place

1291741
apache	nginx
i ended up running nginx with passenger and ruby 1.9 on port 80 and then proxying off my other virtual hosts to apache 2.2 on port 8080 with passenger and ruby 1.8

1291743
getter	setter
i left only methods signatures for java example and skipped getter setter

1291747
trie	dawg
it sounds to me like you want to store you dictionary in a trie or a dawg data structure

1291757
mouseover	mouseout
the live event does support mouseover and mouseout - if you were to use those events instead of hover you d be able to wire them outside of the click event

1291777
punctuation	words
then you d consider any words with two or more punctuation consecutively

1291778
metaphone	soundex
sounds like based on soundex or metaphone is not uncommon option for proprietary full text search in databases oracle ms sql server or open source search engines such as lucene

1291812
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
edit also firefox 3.5 opera google-chrome etc seem to be adopting the html5 postmessage api which allows secure cross-domain data transmission between frames iframes and popups

1291854
int	chars
length positive int number of chars in input

1291954
hash	md5
you could md5 the resulting mysqldump on the server and the transfered locally by rsync then compare the two hash to ensure they match

1292032
firefox	safari
it refreshes safari and firefox but as i said it only works the mac

1292033
public	protected
first of all the default visibility for ivars in objc is protected so unless you explicitly make them public you have to use an accessor

1292033
subclass	accessor
aside from this you use the accessor because you never know if you or someone else might subclass your class and change it enough that using the accessor is necessary

1292033
accessor	properties
if you re talking about within the class you don t have to use the accessor but if you set up properties values there s no reason not to use the dot notation even if you re synthesizing everything

1292033
getter	setter
using both getter outside the class and setter is good practice

1292083
width	height
your best bet would be to catch your window s onsize event get the size that the user wants the window to be which is stored in the wxsizeevent calculate the new width and height according to the aspect ratio and then immediately call setsize with the new size

1292102
unix	aix
nick meyer s answer is correct on windows and aix but is unlikely to be correct on every other unix platform by default

1292104
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine with any modern browser firefox google-chrome safari ie7 + 8 but is falling over on 6

1292109
put	get
and don t use a wildcard when you both want to get and put from to a structure

1292116
min	max
you are missing some characters the beginning of the tags and you will need a comma to separate the min and max options

1292176
draggable	droppable
i have a jquery ui draggable and several separately-defined droppable

1292176
draggable	droppable
because one of the droppable is configured tolerance intersect it s possible for a draggable to be dropped on more than one kind of droppable at the same time

1292176
draggable	droppable
none of the droppable overlap but the draggable is large enough to overlap a droppable with tolerance intersect while the mouse pointer is over another droppable with tolerance pointer

1292209
draggable	droppable
are you going to calculate percentages of the draggable on each intersecting droppable

1292219
folder	directory
i have all my web application contents inside a directory ui page of web folder

1292258
google-chrome	firefox
i have a page that renders differently in google-chrome when compared to firefox

1292298
rss	feed
ok here is my rss feed link

1292329
implements	extends
1 you are right you cannot extends this but here are two alternatives one is to avoid the need for extends this at all and making use of what is provided such as using viewdata and the other is to implements your own

1292346
button	checkbox
i have a button while clicking the button i just produce a div containing some checkbox

1292359
pop-up	dialog
if you are using asp.net you can check out the ajax control toolkit which has a modal pop-up dialog

1292359
pop-up	dialog
jquery pop-up dialog

1292380
profiling	debugging
the difference is in the profiling you are using for code-sign where for debugging build you re using your developer profiling and for the distribution build ad-hoc or appstore you need to create ad-hoc or appstore profiling respectively

1292393
rss	feed
try an rss parser which also caches the feed to save everyone time and money

1292432
draggable	droppable
maybe in the over event of the less preferred droppable you could check if the draggable is also over the preferred droppable and if it is disable the less preferred droppable

1292510
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you wanted a finer grain control over the process you can use the writeobject readobject methods that the objectoutputstream objectinputstream use as part of the serialization process and you could combine that with some custom annotations or any logic you wanted

1292511
int	double
i ve kind of solved this problem by changing the sorting to sort double instead of int

1292511
int	double
my problem is that i want to sort the double values by int using the function stable_sort

1292604
short	base	int	chars
if your base types and not int types chars int short long long long types will not be promoted so assignment will fail

1292688
hide	show
however from a software design view i ve always tended to have each layer have their own collection of members when doing editors - it makes operations on the layers better encapsulated show layer hide layer select only from one layer move layer to top etc

1292729
rss	feed
i want to integrate an rss feed in my .net based site

1292755
min	max
i need the select statement to return the min and max sizes from the table of sizes

1292755
min	max
however as the actual size is stored as a string i need to run the min and max functions against the sizeorder column but return the value of the sizename column

1292759
inherited	properties
maybe its doing the properties inherited thing and using the binding mode of the ui control underneathe it

1292767
tax	shipping
you can collect personal company payment details then shipping payment addresses and then present the user with a final confirmation screen showing tax delivery charges before processing the order

1292769
rss	feed
i answered a similar question some time back net has a class to parse atom and rss feed

1292802
width	height
during a re-layout due to a change in width or height java s scrollpanelayout requests the preferredsize of it s children before setting the bounds of it s viewport

1292807
post	get
get and post that usually involves the

1292860
width	height
if i trace i see the width and height is 200 x 200 but there is still nothing visible in my component

1292876
post	get
in fact what you need to do is post some data to a webserver and get a response

1292883
int	double
the simd primitives can pack eight 8-bit int operations or two double or 4 floats etc into a single operation that gets parallelized in hardware

1292896
switching	screens
sending cameraarguments when invoking the app which appears to be useless and now i was thinking a solution could be as simple generating a back key event before switching back to my app which would theoretically dismiss the annoying edit screens

1292954
updatepanel	scriptmanager
we use the asp.net updatepanel and the scriptmanager scriptmanagerproxy for ajax related functionality

1292961
int	chars
for chars stats in a database driven game i would generally advise to stick with the naã ve approach of one column int or float per statistic

1292988
public	protected
also consider to add visibility to your methods and members public protected private

1293040
slideup	slidedown
for example lets assume i want to slideup element with id id1 on view1 and slidedown element with id id2 on view2

1293055
emacs	textmate
i use ii2 to manage latex software for the back end and i have used both textmate it has a very nice latex bundle and emacs with auctex as front ends

1293055
emacs	aquamacs
you can get a nice baked-in latex experience in emacs by using the aquamacs distribution i can t use it because i have a non-english keyboard with no aquamacs-specific mapping

1293057
hex	binary
i ve just reverse engineered a binary with ida and loaded hex ray to check out a specific function

1293121
submit	submission
we have a comments form where users can submit their comment about news articles and after that submission every comment is accepted and listed in the same page

1293130
mouse	keyboard
if you really want an element that isn t a link but which can be activated as normal by mouse or keyboard what you want is a or is just as good for simple textual contents

1293131
post	get
i would also make the action a hidden post form submitted by javascript since this is not really something you want driven by a get

1293158
width	height
i can t use the css sheet for this as the width and height variables are dynamic

1293183
width	height
you can change the size of a thickbox window by adding width and height parameters in href attribute of a element

1293188
serializable	deserialization
so currently my question is around how serializable and deserialization works in spring remoting

1293188
serializable	deserialization
currently all consumers use the respective stubs and serializable and deserialization happens accordingly

1293193
superclass	subclassing
subclassing that have constructor parameter lists that differ significantly from their superclass is another example of a class doing too much

1293193
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing truly is-a superclass then it shouldn t require significantly more data to do its job

1293195
getter	setter
for a typical hierarchy like you will have getter and setter to retrieve and change the various properties of the object

1293199
yslow	pagespeed
1 install yslow and pagespeed extensions for firefox and follow their advice where possible

1293200
inherited	properties
in addition to the other answers marker interfaces can also be used to specify additional properties of a class that is not inherited by some other already-implemented interface

1293211
inherited	properties
however if you find that you absolutely need this and a long inherited chain consider using a hash properties bag like object as the sole parameter

1293227
firefox	safari
firefox 2 firefox 3.5 safari 3 and

1293234
firefox	safari
in case it is any solace to you the url you posted here works nicely in firefox but it does not work in safari 4 safari 4 only shows the image at the end not the countdown

1293257
pull	push
but there is also part of the git distribution a git-shell command a non-interactive shell used as a login shell for ssh accounts you want to restrict to git pull push access only

1293257
pull	push
it permits execution only of server-side git commands implementing the pull push functionality

1293266
min	max
- maybe i should only avoid creating new instances in the for-loop to have the min and max points.

1293317
versioning	upgrade
this happened because as soon as a client sees a working copy it upgrade it to its current versioning

1293324
listview	gridview
i don t think there is any point in using a listview if as you say you cannot use gridview or any other view

1293337
easymock	jmock
jmock and easymock both choke on final methods and i don t see a nice way to test the static calls

1293344
easymock	powermockito	mockito	easymock
alternatively you can use powermockito which extends easymock and mockito to allow mocking of final and static methods

1293344
easymock	powermockito
powermockito is a framework that extend other mock libraries such as easymock with more powerful capabilities

1293348
versioning	upgrade
upgrade one of your svn clients so that they are at the same versioning preferable

1293381
disk	ram
a ram disk could be a solution for this

1293381
disk	ram
mount the ram disk as your index directory and you should be done

1293424
javassist	bcel
alternatively you could use a library like bcel asm or javassist

1293499
postgresql	mysql
has a significant algorithmic performance benefit in postgresql or mysql implementations when scanning the indexed column s or whether the unique keyword simply introduces a unique constraint alongside the index

1293513
innodb	myisam
an index always contains some kind of a pointer to the row ctid in postgresql row pointer in myisam primary key uniquifier in innodb and the leaves are ordered on these pointers so in fact every index leaf is unique is some way though it may not be obvious

1293562
config	ini
basically you are asking for a solution to serialize a given object in your case a config to ini files

1293592
width	height
information like the width and height

1293598
rss	feed
i m not a strong asp classic developer but i am tasked with supporting this application at work well i ve been trying to convert an rss feed date to a short date format

1293598
rss	feed
so far i have been tinkering with this rss feed script for asp

1293628
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i m checking the view outlet at viewdidload and viewwillappear with nslog statements

1293628
viewdidload	viewwillappear
when i select an item from the table view though viewdidload gets called again followed by viewwillappear and i get these

1293640
getter	setter
know that wpf optimizes dependency property access such that the getter and setter of your clr wrapper are not invoked

1293652
children	parent
children are idle the parent will

1293713
rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
i ve read that this is possible with sdp and rtp and i ve found multiple examples on how to define a sdp rtp body in a sip packet

1293741
hash	md5
if an md5 hash is almost unique for a unique id then what is wrong from md5 ing a uniqid

1293764
hide	show
i also want to show and hide this panel control onmouseover and onmouseout event

1293769
hash	md5
a md5 hash is 128 bits wide and doesn t guarantee uniquess only a low probablity of collision

1293769
hash	md5
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage

1293772
intersect	contains
then just put another image over the top with combinedgeometry contains the same objects as the geometry group with a geometrycombinemode of intersect and that will highlight the intersect in your custom brush

1293775
inherited	properties
an approach i have taken with a number of forms mainly multipage but same applies for single page is for each form page to inherited from a common base class which has a number of properties

1293780
hide	show
you can use the display property to show and hide panel

1293783
prng	random
you could use the linear congruential generator lcg one of the best known pseudo random number generator prng

1293806
width	height
if the ratio of the width to the height is 8 3 its a good chance they have 2 standard 4 3 monitors side by side

1293836
int	double
byte to short int long float or double

1293836
int	double
short to int long float or double

1293836
int	chars	int	double
chars to int long float or double

1293836
int	double
int to long float or double

1293836
int	double
conversion of an int or a long value to float or of a long value to double may result in loss of precision-that is the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value

1293836
floating-point	integer
in this case the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value

1293860
salt	md5
the advantage of md5 -ing the output along with an application-specific salt string or random number is a way harder to guess string

1293861
width	height
using maxpower47 s suggestion about resolution the only way to display the page on the other monitor would be to open a popup and use the options to set the top right width and height properties so the window will appear on the second monitor in a decent size

1293866
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the site loads and displays perfectly when viewed with google-chrome firefox and safari but breaks when viewed with ie8 both sidebars disappear and only the main content window is visible

1293867
int	double
the choice could certainly have been made to require all implicit conversions to lose no information at all - so int and long to float would have been explicit and long to double would have been explicit

1293867
int	double
int to double is okay

1293867
int	double
a double has enough precision to accurately represent all int values.

1293888
restrict	shared
assuming your setup allows this of course - on a shared host you may be restrict

1293893
pascal	delphi
but delphi was pascal and he knew nothing about pascal and couldn t be bothered to learn more about it so he chose to develop in powerbuilder for new projects

1293902
int	boolean
that is it s roughly identical to an array of boolean except you pack your boolean into a large int

1293902
int	boolean
for instance if you had 8-bit int you would store 8 bits boolean per int which would further reduce your space requirements

1293911
post	get
essentially phil s sample project covers the get side of things and i ve implemented the post

1293916
jsf	stripes
but if you do decide on using a framework from my experience of having used stripes struts1 and jsf myfaces recommend stripes without hesitation

1293922
jboss	glassfish
i am working with a team of programmers developing web applications for a java ee application server currently using jboss but switching to glassfish in the near future

1293934
int	double
byte - short - int - long - float - double

1293956
post	get
when required to restore all i do is get to a httphandler class with querystring parameters that parses the intended id and deserilizes the state for restoration which renders hidden fields to simulate the user doing a post from the original page

1293984
ironruby	ironpython
in which part of your current project will it make your code cleaner or simpler or enable things you could simply not do outside of the obvious interop with dynamic languages like ironruby or ironpython

1294050
multiplying	multiplication
let s just say the above code is a lot easier to read it s nice that it works but it was also very slow about 10 000 times slower than a regular multiplication doh and about 100 times slower than an icalculator interface with a multiplying method

1294066
versioning	upgrade
the app uses an old versioning of html mime mail to prepare messages i ll try to upgrade to a newer versioning

1294113
box-sizing	border-box
off topic but important when using inline-block on spans it is often very useful to turn on box-sizing -moz-box-sizing border-box

1294143
versioning	upgrade
since then we have upgrade to .net 3.5 and this may not be an issue using the latest versioning of the toolkit

1294146
octal	decimal
would 09 be a decimal number or octal

1294152
getter	setter
when is the point when it s not good to put some code to getter setter and when to create own method that is used to change my property and other parts of my class

1294178
getter	setter
whenever i ve come across the need to put code in a getter setter i put the code in a private method and call that method from within the getter setter

1294208
post	get
now i m trying to get a list of post for a specific user in order of date

1294208
post	get
i know i can get a list of all post for all users by

1294230
idictionary	icollection
i was trying to create a visualizer for idictionary or icollection

1294230
ilist	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
i want to use something similar for icollection or ilist idictionary etc

1294272
pygtk	pygobject	pygtk	pycairo	pygobject	pycairo
i have an application which depends on pygtk pygobject and pycairo that i built to work on linux

1294288
getter	setter
getter and setter get internally translated into standard methods such that the runtime has no idea whether some getter or setter is associated with a certain property

1294288
getter	setter
however there is an important software engineering benefit your code tends to be easier to understand if you restrict yourself to use getter and setter with get and set semantics

1294288
getter	setter
your class could provide two properties kilometers and miles with respective setter and getter

1294295
put	get
put it simply methods are actually doing the work...properties either instigate action or get the status

1294323
width	height
also if it s a background-color you may need to set the height and width of the a element to match the parent s

1294356
cdr	cons
and then for lists you re going to need to define cons car and cdr methods for ruby s array type

1294366
children	parent
however i can imagine circumstances where parent controls need to dictate their children behavior

1294397
serializable	deserialization
you can create a dummy class to represent that immutable object during serializable deserialization

1294409
firefox	safari
opacity works for firefox and safari

1294464
inherited	properties
to use this make your controller inherited from ajaxiancontroller and use the isajax properties instead of the isajaxrequest extension method then all redirects on the controller will automatically maintain the ajax-or-not flag

1294472
serializable	deserialization
but it s rather unwieldly in this case because you need to not only go from builder to immutable but also from immutable to builder so that the serializable deserialization is symmetrical

1294486
ssl	https
every now and then and since the last week more often i get questions about https ssl

1294538
mbunit	mstest
i am using gallio to integrate mbunit s test runner with the mstest test runner in visual studio

1294552
try-catch	exception-handling
i expected that i could put a try-catch around the process method and receive the exception-handling

fadein	fadeout
you can preload the images maybe see here and then call the the fadein and fadeout methods sequentially in a loop

1294658
gif	png
to change it just go to the library right-click on your image choose properties and in the new window just change the compression combo-box to lossless png gif

1294687
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is having the intended effect making the field no longer editable but its contents are submitted with the form in firefox safari and google-chrome but not for ie7

1294709
width	height
images are set 100px in width but they vary in height

1294738
depth-first-search	backtracking
usually a depth-first-search is a way of iterating through an actual graph tree structure looking for a value whereas backtracking is iterating through a problem space looking for a solution

1294739
children	parent
in a depth-first search you start at the root of the tree and then explore as far along each branch then you backtrack to each subsequent parent node and traverse it s children

1294774
unsigned	short
a cast to unsigned short would probably prevent that from happening but the best way to be sure is to mask off the bits

1294795
width	height
i am trying to dynamically adjust the width and height of a web part in a sharepoint web part page so that it fills up the entire available space

1294795
width	height
it appears that there is no way to choose a percentage for width and height from the web part property editor window in sharepoint

1294801
versioning	upgrade
when application starts the db upgrade code compares current db versioning and code versioning and if the code is newer - looks into scripts folder and applies all db changes automatically

1294801
versioning	upgrade
this way every instance of application on production or developers machines always upgrade db to their code versioning and it works great

1294809
queue	fifo
fifo fifo queue

1294809
queue	fifo
if you want a fifo queue you will need two stacks and shift the elements from one to the others in order to get to the first element when it is enqued then you can deque from the top of the second stack which is in reverse order as long as nothing else is enqued

1294810
queue	fifo
for a fifo queue you need two stacks -- to quote the

1294814
children	parent
i have two entities in linq to sql setup as a parent child relationship parent can have many children

1294824
config	ini
each unit doesn t care if the config is stored in a table ini file xml file or even gasp the registry

1294826
queue	fifo
typically a queue is fifo while a stack is obviously last in first out

1294826
queue	fifo
a fifo queue would just be a stack with enqueue being push and dequeue being pop

1294826
queue	fifo
that doesn t make any sense as an exercise so i d definitely assume a fifo queue was intended

1294828
hide	show
the msdn entry to animatewindow says it is used to produce special effects when showing or hiding windows and the aw_hide flag determines that the function either show or hide a window

1294832
allocator	stl
i have implemented a custom allocator to be used by stl containers within my memory debugging utility without them using my overridden new operator

1294905
versioning	upgrade
users that wish to upgrade to the next latest versioning must apply the package which will execute all the database scripts to update the database and replace the assembly that contains your data access layer

1294912
ready	each
by versioning you can prevent each project from using the new dll until you re ready to migrate

1294912
versioning	upgrade
this provides a level of safety - you know you won t break a client s project because somebody else changed something underneath you but it s very easy to upgrade at any time to the new versioning

1294946
button	checkbox
say i wanna put a checkbox inside a button

1294960
ubuntu	linux
i ve used aws and various forms of linux over the past few years but am wondering if anyone has any experience using canonical s aws ubuntu images and can compare them to hammond s

1295001
post	get
if you re using prototype you can get the protohover plugin to achieve the same result or view this blog post

1295001
hide	show
that would accomplish the show hide effect for the following

1295005
post	get
tamper data will show you both post and get methods

1295009
hide	show
position the link as you d like it to appear on hover then hide it with javascript and use the onmouseover event to show it

1295054
swt	swing	awt	swing
i m not aware of a drop in host awt swt in swing component but you should be able to build a work around yourself

1295058
awt	swing
swing and awt run on a separate thread

1295060
pull	push
a push is like a fetch done backwards not like a pull done backwards

1295073
int	chars
to expand on this the difference between var_type_ and type where type is something like chars int binary etc. is that the non-var version will get padded to the full length that you specify if necessary

1295074
children	parent
in 1.4 the children s startup will be called after the parent startup

1295096
google-chrome	firefox
however my code only seems to work in ie and not firefox or google-chrome

1295096
hide	show
that function will check if there is one showing just used 0 for default nothing and if there is hide it and if not then show one

1295119
children	parent
of course being a relational database i have to delete rows from the children before i can touch the parent

1295127
strcpy	malloc
strcpy does not call malloc

1295168
sorting	filtering
and many of these values get repeated and sorting and filtering them in python would be cumbersome so i though perhaps dumping them in a table in db would be quicker

1295216
int	chars
usually the bool type is just a glorified int or chars

1295216
int	chars
in older code that i ve worked with bool is just typedef d to int or chars

1295216
int	boolean
and i m not sure but i think the result of bitwise operators is going to be an int even for boolean

1295226
int	boolean
java has primitive types int boolean float etc and anytime you wish to use them as an instance of an object they are wrapped in an associated class type

1295226
int	boolean
for example boolean get wrapped by boolean int as int etc

1295235
maven	cargo
when i m using maven with the cargo plug-ing to handle hot deployments to tomcat maven fails on the clean task if the .war artifact doesn t currently exist

1295307
int	boolean
and b1 and b2 will be promoted to 0 1 int and then converted back to boolean on the rule that anything other than 0 is true

1295309
content-disposition	content-type
things you will want to be sure to do are to set the content-type response header to text javascript technically incorrect but most common mime type and for internet explorer which tends to not respect the content-type header also set the content-disposition header to inline

1295364
hudson	bamboo
not to mention it seems to get all the integration love when it comes to things like continuous integration cruise control bamboo hudson etc...

1295386
proj	ogr	gdal	ogr	gdal	proj
but all these acronyms and different libraries geos gdal proj pcl shaply opengeo ogr ogc ows and what not each seemingly depending on any number of others is slightly overwhelming me

1295425
mouse	keyboard
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

1295440
versioning	upgrade
can be called to upgrade your settings from the previous versioning

1295463
width	height
remember to addchild in createchildren to set x y width and height in updatedisplaylist and to set your own measured properties in measure

1295536
awt	swing
graphics handling is going to be dependent on your gui library but the awt swing font api has support for determining line metrics

1295546
mp3	ogg
for example mp3 evrc ogg vox

1295630
processors	hyperthreading
in the case of simultaneous multithreaded architectures like ibm power6 ibm cell sun niagara and intel hyperthreading you also tend to see new instructions to prioritize between threads like setting priorities and explicitly yielding the processors when there is nothing to do

1295693
width	height	min	max
the same can be applied for width height min and max with minor adjustments

1295716
accessor	properties
on the other hand will send a message to the properties s set accessor which will take care of retain count

1295719
width	height
then you can maintain an aspect ratio while setting a new size via the simple html height and width attributes for the img tag

1295721
ssl	https
be sure to read some background on https and ssl to get a understanding of more specifically what kind of security problems it adresses

1295725
uiview	subviews
2 the uiview method convertpoint toview -- you might be able to call this on b to find the coordinates of c in terms of a and use that to move b s subviews to a

1295728
width	height
height and width are in pixels

1295748
min	max
some records can be deleted too so the min to max id set will have holes

1295751
int	double
a b int 4 or double 4.5

1295751
division	modulo
given reasonable timespan division timespan modulo should be pretty straight-forward

1295753
vpn	lan
i am having to connect to 1 mail server via lan for my internal work and to a second mail server outside of my lan but through a vpn connection in order to do my work as well as both sides of this has information that i cannot access from my lan

1295767
folder	directory
i tried creating the resources directory using both new- folder new- source folder none avail

1295800
versioning	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade an asp.net mvc project written with the beta versioning of the framework to the use the full 1.0 versioning

1295868
stdout	stderr
what you can t do however is access stdin stdout stderr without a console

1295884
punctuation	words
as far as i m aware there are no reserved words as such so provided the criteria regarding valid characters no spaces punctuation and must start with letter is met then the name attribute can contain anything

1295904
postgresql	mysql
super smack originally a load-test tool for mysql it also supports postgresql and it includes a generator of mock data

1295955
post	get
one item per post and we will see if we get a winner by means of votes

1295966
implements	modifiers
c# and java both seem to implements the same set of access modifiers

1295970
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
there are silverlight plugins for ie firefox opera safari and google-chrome

1295977
lxml	elementtree
personally whenever possible i d start with elementtree preferably the c implementation that comes with python s standard library or the lxml implementation but that s essentialy a matter of higher speed only

1295977
lxml	celementtree
i have no recent experience as to how pyrxp today compares with lxml or celementtree

1296033
inherited	properties
all of these a valid methods properties that can be found on form elements due to interface inherited and all of them can be overwritten by same-named fields

1296104
google-chrome	firefox
alright i got the ul s to show in firefox and google-chrome

1296195
content-disposition	content-type
set the content-type property to the mime type and add a custom header content-disposition with a value like

1296201
serializable	deserialization
full cycle serializable deserialization could work reliably only if you are holding both activities in your own hand

1296201
serializable	deserialization
if one company implements serializable sends the rdf over to another company that implements the deserialization you cannot expect too much

1296201
serializable	deserialization
the only justified reason i can think of where guaranteed serializable deserialization could work correct me if i am wrong if you would use rowlex as data storage layer persisting retrieving your objects to from rdf

1296208
vb6	vba
vba vb6 392 chars w formatting

1296214
width	height
first of all the width and height properties of the canvas element do not reflect its actual size on the screen

1296214
put	get
secondly i can t get the onresize event to fire regardless of whether i put it on the canvas or on the surrounding box

1296259
post	get
the one will be accepting get commands initial load of the page the other will be serving post requests perform the necessary action and redirect back to the same view

1296263
subtraction	addition
as far as i know bitwise operations are the cheapest operations slightly faster than addition and subtraction

1296263
division	multiplication
multiplication and division operations are a little more expensive and comparation is the highest coast operation

1296288
integer	unsigned
the c# byte is an unsigned 8 bit integer with values that can range between 0 and 255

1296294
hide	show
and you just show or hide it

1296297
integer	unsigned
size unsigned 8-bit integer

1296377
inherited	properties
but i still got this feeling that i should inherited the initial comment s properties only adding a simple comment-id joint

1296382
post	put
post variable put it in a form element

1296394
put	get	post	put	post	get
in addition to that i advise you to read your web service might not be restful ifâ as just properly handling get post put delete is not the all that is needed to be really rest

1296397
getdate	datepart
when i do for example datepart mm getdate i get the result of the month being 8 for august

1296399
addition	multiplication
if the multiplication unit is being used by another instruction perhaps we can find an addition instruction to execute instead for example

1296403
int	chars
edit if arr supposed to be used in int expressions then please don t mind the chars value of 0

1296434
min	max
as a simple example consider this access for n 10 random integers between min 100 and max 200 from random.org which supplies true random numbers based on atmospheric noise rather than a pseudo random number generator

1296456
stateless	stateful
don t try to wedge a fundamentally stateful interaction into a stateless model just because you read about it on wikipedia

1296471
post	get
here s a great blog post about using get vs post

1296516
int	chars
the moment you ask for 05 is no longer and int but a string chars varchar nchar nvarchar etc

1296552
postgresql	mysql
i have too little experience with postgresql or oracle to judge so i will just stick with not recommending mysql

1296601
profiling	instrumentation
however i suggest testing such optimizations using a profiling such as instrumentation just to make sure you re not over-complicating your code for not a lot of benefit

1296630
post	get
here s a blog post with some more information get vs2010 extensions easily with built-in extension manager and checking out a vs2010t4 editor

1296684
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve tested all combinations of pre-allocating not pre-allocating counting up down and for while loops in ie 6 7 8 firefox 3.5 google-chrome and opera

1296684
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the functions below was consistently the fastest or extremely close in firefox google-chrome and ie8 and not much slower than the fastest in opera and ie 6

1296707
width	height
not the width or height of the image but the size of the data

1296719
versioning	upgrade
by default when using a new versioning of a subversion client it will upgrade the repository to that versioning

1296728
children	parent
i really donâ t want to run the first query on the children and then query the parent by a list of ids as i figure there has got to be a better way of doing this

1296747
move	drag
for vanilla drag drops it applies rules based on original and destination drive volumes - dragging dropping files around on a volume is a move operation by default

1296770
folder	directory
either copy the python lib directory to the ironpython folder or set ironpythonpath

1296781
post	get
attempts to use response.redirect above to my .ashx file result in get not post and trace.axd of course shows nothing in the form collection so that seems wrong too

1296799
addclass	removeclass
to prevent your row styles from vanishing put them in a css class and use addclass and removeclass instead to apply them bearing in mind that if they re not in a class then they don t exist

1296802
put	get
if you put it in an external file this won t get evaluated and that script text will be in the javascript file on the client which is not going to work because it doesn t have the proper id

1296816
unix	sunos	unix	aix	sunos	aix
there s libstatgrab which doesn t seem to be very actively developed it already supports a decent variety of unix platforms though and the very active psi python system information which works on aix linux sunos and darwin

1296827
client-side	server-side
you are mixing server-side and client-side code

1296831
post	put
two things here the first is that you actually have to put your post string very similar to a query string into the

1296865
int	chars
additionally 0 is like all chars literals an int constant in this case with the value zero

1296897
html5lib	beautifulsoup
maybe beautifulsoup or html5lib

1296921
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
if it helps all of the methods in that class perform asynchronous downloading of xml data with nsurlconnection and then parse it with nsxmlparser

1296946
rss	feed
the service type could be rss or whatever other feed you might support

1296972
width	height
you can specify the x y width and height to draw the image and you can specify where in the image you want to draw using the clippingrect

1297045
hide	show
.lib files enable you to hide certain parts of your implementation - you could have private exports that do not show up in the .lib but are discoverable via getprocaddress

1297048
implements	modifiers
by the way one language that implements access modifiers per object and not per class is ruby

1297126
g++	gcc
the above code returns 4 on gcc and 1 on g++

1297144
implements	extends
zend_rest_client extends zend_service_abstract which in turn implements a gethttpclient method which returns a zend_http_client instance which exposes a getlastresponse method which returns a zend_http_response instance which once again exposes a getbody method

1297205
g++	gcc
edit to clarify things i m using gcc g++ 4.3

1297249
pull	push
it allow full round-tripping of revisions full clone pull and push however as of this writing xxx amend this if when it becomes incorrect it is still in development and there are not yet official releases

1297249
pull	push
up until recently this only let you clone and pull a subversion repository but as of hgsvn 0.1.7 it supports push

1297270
valgrind	callgrind
for this you need to be running in linux which i think you are and have the callgrind and valgrind programs available

1297275
put	get	post	put	post	get
when you say go and create a medication you put or post to the medications resource and you get a reference back to that medication

1297275
put	get
for example they re usually a side effect vs explicitly managed via get put delete

1297306
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade it to the latest versioning from 2.0 and i have a feeling that this has something to do with it

1297357
cpython	ironpython
the .msi installer for ironpython includes all parts of the cpython standard library that should work with ironpython

1297357
cpython	ironpython
you can simply copy the standard library from a cpython install if you prefer although you re better off getting just the modules that the ironpython developers have ensured with with ironpython - this is most of them

1297392
nszombies	nszombieenabled
one way to determine if my scenario is what is happening is to turn on nszombies which you can do by setting the environment variable nszombieenabled to yes

1297426
rss	feed
i m working on a blogging application and trying to made just a simple rss feed system function

1297426
rss	feed
my rss feed class is below

1297449
width	height
i want to set the height and width of an image in the js file

1297456
width	height
once you have a reference to your image you can set its height and width like so

1297463
bazaar	git
i m attempting to find a bazaar workflow i like and being a regular git user i can t avoid using git as a reference point

1297473
folder	directory
i have a very simple war project and i want to include a directory named meta-inf at the top of the classes output folder where all the compiled java classes are

1297480
hash	hmac
in some other applications we don t want create a database just for this so we create a hmac secret hash of the email address and use that as confirmation secret

1297506
put	get
either of these procedures should get me the same date i put in

1297526
retaincount	dealloc
if you use a retain you will increment the retaincount by one so that when autorelease releases the object it will still have a retaincount until another release is sent - which should be done by you at some point - maybe in your dealloc

1297553
versioning	upgrade
which versioning it can be upgrade

1297559
tinyint	varchar
a tinyint only takes a single byte of storage and can represent up to 256 different values as opposed to storing a varchar of suspended which takes up 9 bytes plus one prefix byte

1297561
integer	unsigned
in sphinx all document ids must be unique unsigned non-zero integer numbers

1297580
width	height
you can change the actual width height attributes like this

1297651
getter	setter
you can try postsharp to create those attributes and have the class implement the getter setter interface

1297671
put	get
i put my calls to async services in the model and hook into events from my viewmodel that get fired when the data is returned to the model

1297684
width	height
it includes columns like timestamp length width height speed score and more

1297694
ubuntu	debian
here is a guide for debian ubuntu which may also work for other distros

1297733
nsoperation	nsnotification
i m currently sending a nsnotification at the end of my main method and any code that is waiting for the nsoperation to complete subscribes to the notification

1297734
firefox	safari
everything is working in firefox on both pc mac and on safari but doesn t work in ie

1297734
firefox	safari	post	get
using post instead of get causes it to fail in firefox and safari as well

1297741
width	height
there is also another graph that is basically a pie-chart where the width of the slices doesn t change their height does

1297778
getter	setter
turns out you can create a getter setter delegate from a propertyinfo and have near native get set performance

1297782
ethernet	wireless
i m doing the reverse of what it seems most people do when bridging an ethernet and wireless interface

1297782
ethernet	wireless
i have one box without a wireless card and i want to provide access to the internet through the box next to it which has both a wireless card and an ethernet card

1297811
web.py	bottle
python using a micro-framework such as bottle djng itty juno mnml newf web.py or werkzeug

1297819
post	get
security as safety of data in transit no difference between post and get

1297862
min	max
step 1 find max and min values for tracking_no m1 and m2

1297890
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox all 4 lines work

1297902
rss	feed
in terms of linking separate rss feed for the blog and portfolio

1297923
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux
most linux distributions provide it in their repositories -- for example in debian and ubuntu it s named python-mysqldb

1298005
freebsd	linux
linux or freebsd or windows

1298026
width	height
i need to get the body element height and width when i resize the browser windows

1298042
spaces	linefeed
my idea there is that we deal with cr linefeed and spaces at beginning or end of line replacing with a single spaces

1298105
filtering	grouping
the actual summarization query is something like the following counting up the number of sessions and transactions then grouping by campaign and optional filtering

1298130
rss	feed
convention seems to go with using your first example as the link for an rss atom feed

1298154
comparator	comparable
cons value must either be comparable or you need to provide comparator in the constructor

1298161
equals	tostring	equals	compareto	tostring	compareto
boolean boolean boolean string parseboolean string tostring boolean valueof boolean valueof string booleanvalue compareto boolean equals object hashcode tostring

1298163
treemap	treeset
treeset and its brother treemap oddly have nothing to do with representing trees

1298163
children	parent
internally they use a tree organisation to give you an alphabetically sorted set map but you have no control over links between parent and children

1298163
comparator	comparable
if you donâ t supply a comparator to define the ordering you want treeset requires a comparable implementation on the item class to define the natural order

1298166
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
along with a custom uiimageview that implements touchesbegan and touchesmoved to determine where to move the uiimageview

1298166
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
use of nslog shows the touchesbegan touchesmoved methods on the jm_uiimageview are no longer called

1298241
rss	feed
i have a fairly simple process running that periodically pulls rss feed and updates articles in a mysql database

1298258
folder	directory
copy that file into your project directory and add it to the project by right-clicking in xcode on your resources folder and choosing add existing files

1298298
width	margin
the outer one also floated left and with 100 width the inner with a left margin of the same width as the left column

1298305
feedback	review
firstly do not be discouraged or disheartened when something doesn t work or when something breaks or if you receive negative feedback the proverbial it sucks review

1298408
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
window a would be a qmainwindow and window b would be a qdockwidget

1298416
equals	compareto
if a treeset contains object a then object b is considered part of the set if a.compareto b returns 0 even if a.equals b is false so if compareto and equals isn t implemented in a consistent way you are in for a bad ride

1298416
equals	compareto
the lesson to learn here is always avoid implementing compareto and equals inconsistently

1298434
gridview	detailsview
in order to bind a datasource to a server-side control gridview detailsview

1298434
gridview	objectdatasource
since in your case databinding situation is different as you mentioned earlier that you bind gridview with objectdatasource which executes a query in page load and in every select insert update delete operations datasource is bound automatically which means databind is also called automatically

1298434
gridview	objectdatasource
there is another case which you are looking for an answer in the first place is that if datasource is queried and bound in page events you query something and get a result with datatable and bind it into gridview -- this source is not in the page not a objectdatasource or something else stands on page as static source .since this query is coming from an event when you enable pageindex you must query it again that leads to you must also bind it with databind

1298500
swt	swing
swing and swt are two completely different apis although the principles are the same

1298522
swt	swing	awt	swing
swt awt and swing

1298522
swt	swing
swing vs swt

1298522
swt	swing
swing vs swt 2nd

1298617
swt	swing
we also had this question in company and decided to go with swing because for normal desktop application you just cannot sense the speed difference which is supposedly on swt side and this speed you are buying with ruining wora principle you have to bring with your application needed .dlls or .so files to natively support your application running in desired os-es

1299125
google-chrome	firefox
i think firefox google-chrome etc will add the tbody in for you therefore the selector should be

post	get
if i check the values of these boxes with adobe acrobat reader i get the values i just posted in the top of this very post

1299268
getter	setter
you can mark the backing field as obsolete so that the compiler will generate a warning when you try to access it and then suppress that warning for the property getter setter

1299273
getter	setter
i don t know c# but in java you may have a base class with only private instance variables and public setter and getter should return a copy of the instance var. and do all other in an inherited class

1299276
getter	setter
at least in c# you can have adders and removers for events like getter and setter for properties

1299296

the issue of ini files being readable by everyone can be prevented by server side config or even better by simply adding a single line of code inside a comment line at the top of the file

1299660
rss	feed
the reason you re having trouble is that you can t include javascript inline or external inside rss feed

any one knows why bsd md5 program produces hash output in this format .

1299850
post	get
as this can get a bit complicated for more advanced features you could use some charting controls i d read this post or check codeproject.com i remember that i saw few attempts to write some decent charting controls which are open source new articles will probably be coded in wpf but you should find something older as well

1299872
tinyint	boolean
however in the database the boolean value is being stored as a tinyint field for legacy reasons

1299914
hash	md5
i d be scared to use md5 hashing algorithm as getting back the original password from hash can be done in few seconds if password wasn t long enough actually you can google for md5 rainbow table there are sites that will decode such hash in few seconds and give back the result

id name and surname are entities in the real world and may or may not represent entities in the underlying entity-relationship model

1300396
client-side	server-side
you ll need to show it client-side rather than using mpestep1.show otherwise it s not going to get around to displaying until the server-side stuff is finished anyway

1300438
entity-relationship	diagram	entity-relationship	entities
however this mapping is an implementation decision for example an entity-relationship diagram may contain three entities triangle square and circle and these could potentially be modelled as a single table shape

1300470
children	parent
let your server s domain logic handle the bit about keeping the parent record consistent with that of its children

1300526
stdout	stderr
it will redirect stderr to stdout so hopefully you should see why it s not working

1300528

it s not an issue in neither firefox or google-chrome

1300771
children	parent
the parent nodes represent parent parts and the children represent parts that make up the parent

1300771
children	parent
in some cases the user will check the checkbox at the parent level to indicate they are replacing the entire part with all its children

1300771
children	parent
what i need help with is hiding the children when the parent checkbox is checked

1300816

practically speaking they usually run on some kind of unix which may also be bsd solaris or others but many of them will run just fine on windows as well

1301068
daemons	systemd
if you want your application to start as a daemons when the systemd boots you ll need to look into initscripts which differ between different distributions

1301082
hash	salt
in addition to the hmacsha1 class mentioned above if you just need a quick salt hash then you re already 95 of the way there

1301096
merb	ruby-on-rails
plus ruby-on-rails and merb which are united in ruby-on-rails 3 are very productive environements frameworks to develop apps .

1301096
codeigniter	cakephp
if you decide to use it do yourself a favor and use it only with a proper framework environment as flow3 zend synfony codeigniter or cakephp .

1301149
division	addition
basically a very fast vector addition and division

1301160

open a good text editor i d recommend textmate but the free textwrangler or vi or nano will do too and open

1301375
division	multiplication
obviously after the multiplication has overflowed the division isn t going to undo that overflow

1301385
switching	screens
another option would be screens which lets you have multiple textual sessions open and switching between them

1301412
addition	multiplication
if you ve studied different algebraic structures as part of your math curriculum then you know that square matrices form an algebra with 3 operations addition multiplication and multiplication by scalar

1301426
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the code below is tested and working in ie 6 7 8 firefox 2 3 3.5 opera 9 10 safari 3 4 and google-chrome

1301432
int	double
byte an int type and double a floating point type not an int type are not bitwise compatible you can t just bitshift to values of a bunch of bytes into a floating point type and expect an equivalent result.

1301432
int	double
1 assuming the byte array is a memory buffer referencing an int value you should be able to convert your byte array into a 128-bit int via bit-shifting and then convert that resulting int into a double

1301502
pbx	ivr
some of the vectors that are coded into the pbx are super important in that if they re changed in the wrong way pretty much all of our telephony arena applications and features go haywire ivr cti crm and acd

fifo queue style processing

1301550
gedit	bbedit	emacs	gedit
emacs has tramp mode gedit on linux and bbedit on the mac support remote editing too

1301557
queue	fifo
for example to make a thread-safe queue with a different queueing discipline than fifo one imports queue subclasses queue.queue and overrides such methods as _get and _put

1301557
put	get
client code never calls those hook methods but rather the organizing public methods such as put and get this is known as the template method design pattern -- see here for an interesting presentation based on a video of a talk of mine on the subject with the addition of synopses of the transcript

1301583
pop-up	dialog
it has 2 dialog boxes that pop-up during the search

1301594
versioning	upgrade
the biggest problem i have had with grails is every time i upgrade to a new versioning it seems to break things that were previously working

1301696
mouseover	mousemove
edit it appears as thought the mousemove event isn t binding for earlier elements than the one currently being dragged should be bound upon their mouseover

1301719
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
theres a section where i have a tab bar not using uitabbarcontroller which is manageed by the same uinavigationcontroller i simply add the uitabbar to the navigation controllers view by using addsubview

well i was able to get this to work so i thought i would post the code that i used

1301749
managed	loaderlock
to disable go to debug - exceptions - managed debugging assistants and uncheck loaderlock

1301777
children	parent
the problem i m having is that this image disappears when you hover over a parent menu item s children

1301785
goto	break
in my solution i wanted to map nearly to what you are doing an infinite goto unless break

1301805
put	get
the only way to get similar behavior loosely similar is to put a label within an update panel that is getting updated on that partial postback and set its value to something which would only take the one line of code to set it .

1301815
webrat	cucumber
i am working on rails with rspec rspec-rails cucumber and webrat

1301841
vbscript	jscript
what i do know is that an arraylist in c# turns into a standard collection in com usable by vbscript vb jscript 5.x etc

1301863
post	get
i want to know what are the vulnerabilities while using the get and post variable directly

1301863

the 4 http methods commonly used are get post put and delete

1301900
post	get
in general and not limited to get and post but also to any data that comes from outside the system including cookies in the case of web applications

1301902
post	get
if you take any get or post variable and effectively execute it without passing it through a filter of some sorts you are opening yourself up to injection attacks

1301920
int	double
in this particular case almost nothing was done except define gam vec normv etc and create an implicit definition from symbol to int or double reading from a table where you ll store such definitions later on such as with a loadm equivalent

1301921
post	get
it extends to a bit more than just get or post

1301930
children	parent
you need to wrap the children inside the parent and then .hover on the parent only

1301930
children	parent
since children is inside the parent so when you hover the children you are still hovering the parent

1301944
post	get
you can t do that with javascript to solve your problem or use method post instead of get or use nocache random parameter trick

1301972
post	get
get and post data is data directly sent from the user

1302000
post	get
you ll just use the webrequest class to post or get from the service

1302086
width	height
width and height represent the width height of the viewport area in tiles

1302096
put	get
i tend to use concurrentlinkedqueue because the time it takes my producers to get work to put onto the queue is diverse

upgrade to the trunk versioning of redmine

1302145
bazaar	git
all three of the modern dvcses git mercurial and bazaar can tell when you last merged and won t try to remerge changesets that have already been merged

1302159
put	get
the reason why its so long is the sareplacement hrmsadminreplacement hrmanagerreplacement and payrolladminreplacement can all be null so i put in a check to ensure they are not null so the rest of the clause does not get executed

1302166
public	protected
thereâ s public private and protected to enforce access instead of pythonâ s _voluntary_ underscore __convention__

1302188
multiplying	add
however if you use or multiplying the points by 1.3333334 or maybe even just add 0.0001 to the pixel measurement it offsets things just enough that you actually get fs22 or fs28 rather than fs21 or fs27 respectively

1302212
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it behaves as expected in firefox google-chrome and safari

1302231
uiview	subviews
try making the root view a uiview with a uitableview for a subviews

1302262
versioning	upgrade
with respect to versioning especially semantic versioning patching will upgrade a software s patch versioning number and updates upgrade their minor versioning number

1302322
innodb	myisam
if your index is small enough to fit in memory make sure your my.cnf allocates enough memory to key_buffer myisam or innodb_buffer_pool_size innodb you should be able to preload it using

children	parent
hit parent first then the children then the next nodes

1302365
maven	pom.xml
this includes things like maven pom.xml files and build.xml files docbook files xhtml documents etc

i ve found that if i have a working application and i put an app_offline.htm file in the root and then rename the bin folder my app_offline.htm file does not get displayed

1302592
phpmyadmin	heidisql
since you re on windows i can highly recommend heidisql over phpmyadmin for working with mysql

1302601
versioning	upgrade
the biggest reason for that is if you have multiple applications that use the same libraries and want to upgrade to a new versioning for one app you can do that without affecting the rest of them

1302602
x86	64bit
alright it appears that it s an endian issue which still doesn t quite explain it since a little-endian x86 64bit signed integer should fit in a big-endian 64bit integer and vice versa they d just be corrupted

1302629
firefox	safari
it works in firefox just not safari

1302761
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you have to put the call to becomefirstresponder in viewdidappear instead of viewwillappear

1302769
pull	push
now i want the origin topic to reflect the rebase so i want to push but first i have to pull to make clone topic fast forward then i end up a merge which has all the original commits from clone topic with all the commits from origin topic on top

1302778
udp	tcp
one quick and dirty way to accomplish this would be to transmit the data to a remote host could be nonexistant for udp though you d need a listening socket on the remote for tcp

1302778
udp	tcp
this pcap would have your raw data packetized data inside udp tcp ip and ethernet headers

1302865

1304737
free	malloc
there a few questions on so about malloc free versus new delete but all of them focus on the differences in how they are used

1304737
free	malloc
i often hear c programmers say that malloc and free are costly operations but i ve never heard a c++ programmer say this about new and delete

1304737
free	malloc
so my question is how do the algorithms used by malloc and free differ from those used by new and delete

1304752
free	malloc
there s no real difference under the hood - usually the default new and delete operators will simply call through to malloc and free

1304788
free	malloc
often new and delete use malloc and free for memory allocation deallocation

1304788
free	malloc
anyway they must use some primitives for memory allocation deallocation - with overloading new and delete operators that could be something faster that malloc and free say it can be functions working on a memory pool for fixed-size objects

1304804
realloc	malloc
if you have n bytes of malloc ated memory you can realloc m bytes where m n and thus throw away the last n-m bytes

1304804
memcpy	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc
to throw away from the beginning you can malloc a new smaller buffer and memcpy the bytes you want and then free the original

1304829
free	realloc
your entire 4k may be free and realloc may move your memory elsewhere thus invalidating any pointers to it that you may hold

1304830
ienumerable	iqueryable
the first issue was that it only applies to iqueryable this however can be overcome by using the .asqueryable extension method on any ienumerable

1304840
realloc	malloc
if your block was allocated with malloc realloc will allow you to reduce or increase the size of the block

1304840
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
this is a limitation of the malloc calloc realloc free api -- and implementations may rely on these limitations for example keeping bookkeeping information about the allocation immediately before the start address which would make moving the start address difficult.

1304860
post	get
you ll want to use post here as you re probably modifying said schedule and the amount of data might also exceed the maximum url limit if you d use get

1304953
post	get
you can get the â untranslatedâ with s still in value by looking at the input stream for post or environ query_string for get and decoding it manually but it would be better to fix django s incorrect string-to-unicode decoding really

1304959
client-side	server-side
in less metaphorical terms implement both solutions so that there is a server-side url for every client-side url that outputs relevant content

1304960

1307603
integer	unsigned
i m not sure i would call this phenomenon overflow but it is a common mistake to assign a small negative integer to a variable of unsigned type and wind up with a really big positive integer

1307635
multiplying	add
unfortunately table lookup adds a multiplying and add each time you use it so it s not necessarily good

1307756
multiplying	add
an array of arrays sometimes called a jagged array provides better performance than a two dimensional array because the two-dimensional address translation requires a multiplying and an add whereas the jagged array only requires two adds

1307796
getter	setter
many people know this article more on getter and setter

1307796
getter	setter
i think it does a convincing job of portraying the evil side of getter setter

1307796
getter	setter
i ve also tested it by trying to convert an existing project unfinished to code without getter setter

1307796
getter	setter
code readability improved greatly less code and i ve even managed to get rid of getter setter where i initially thought they really were necessary

1307796
put	get
but getters don t get out of the model something very different from what was put in there

1307796
getter	setter
there are a lot of people who think getter setter are not evil at all

1307800
webclient	webrequest
viewing the initial page using a webrequest or webclient object works ok but if the page makes extensive use of javascript to alter the dom on page load then these don t provide an accurate picture of the page

1307811
post	get
i mean i personal could allow someone to get my id and name and maybe allow a page to post something in my feed if i accept just that and not that the application should have access to all my other somewhat private data

1307827
subtraction	addition
when dealing with money it is often faster and far more efficient to use integers if you are performing comparisons or simple addition and subtraction and don t need to worry about rounding errors

1307853
webclient	httpwebrequest
use httpwebrequest or the simplified webclient class

1307864
pull	push
i am able to have it pull code from a private repo github but i can t seem to get it to push the tags back after a build

1307877
webkit	gecko
they should look roughly the same i suppose but i have no problem with using webkit and gecko rounded borders knowing they ll fall back to square corners in trident and presto

1307894
post	get
it involves url s get and post to interact with the model

1307921
stateless	stateful
you will have to make some good analysis to determine how you will refactor it to separate all stateless beans from the stateful ones maybe encapsulate state in some value objects etc

1307931
vim	emacs
i would dig in and learn vim or emacs if you really want to

1307931
vim	emacs
i really would suggest learning vim or emacs especially when you are still in university

1307961
hide	show
specifically i have a php contact form in a show hide div

1307961
hide	show
clicking on contact show and hide the contact form

1307961
hide	show
both the show hide js and the php contact form work perfectly

1307971
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram are what you are looking for

1308003
entity-relationship	diagram
sql server management studio 2005 and 2008 supports entity-relationship models and can auto generate the diagram from a database although it s up to you to lay out the diagram sensibly

1308026
width	height
html attributes for width and height are integer values only

1308051
int	chars
the type int string chars myclass yourclass etc of value doesn t support the operation

1308057
hash	salt
with javascript their password is hash locally salt too

1308095
hash	salt
your php script would send a form which included a secret salt value and then you have some javascript which hooks into the submit event and replaces the password entered with the salt hash

1308099
button	checkbox
right now clicking on the do not limit button will properly disable the checkbox thanks gw for all your help on this one

1308127
pull	push
given that the event mechanism allows the model to push its state to the view the view doesn t need getters to pull the state and if the model is also a listener you don t need builders

1308158
children	parent
category has id name parent and children

1308158
children	parent
parent and children are of category too

1308158
children	parent
but it doesn t bring the full category with its parent and children

1308184
disk	ram
add more ram is the way to go because if you are using windows 7 or vista they aggressively caches disk files in ram

1308281
verilog	vhdl
i m a lot more comfortable in verilog so double check this vhdl any comments appreciated

1308367
rss	feed
having looked at the generated rss feed via view source the articleid now does appear to be unique but i haven t left it long enough to know if google reader etc sees it as different

1308468
textinput	textfield
if you wat to change the cursur you need to check the mouse when it is currently over the textfield sub-object of the flex textinput control

1308469
superclass	subclassing
create a factory method on the abstract superclass that creates concrete subclassing instances

1308484
stdout	stderr
this sends stdout to the log file and stderr to my email

1308484
stdout	stderr
1 send both stdout and stderr to the logfile

1308484
stdout	stderr
or to put it another way stderr to both the logfile and the email and stdout only to the logfile

1308484
stdout	stderr
i saw this which is intended to send the stdout and stderr from a command to one file and then just stderr to another file posted by zazzybob on unix.com which seems close to what i want to do and i was wondering if it would inspire someone more clever than i

1308510
vsto	add-in
see paul stubbs article how to create excel udfs in vsto managed code where he uses a vba add-in to expose vba udfs which in turn call his managed udfs written in vsto

1308510
vsto	add-in
vsto is a great designer for managed com add-in allowing you to easily add ribbon controls and the like

1308510
vsto	add-in
so my advice is to create a managed automation add-in as per eric carter s article and drop the vsto requirement

1308559
stdout	stderr
i assume you are using bash you redirect stdout and stderr like so

1308616
range	max	range	min	min	max
that it is out of the range of max and min ticks

1308620
puts	gets
when i run vscandemonstarter it puts entries into its different log file the vscandemon log file gets created but no entries

1308715
integer	unsigned
so you can assign a value of -4 to an unsigned integer and this will place a series of bits into that memory location

1308715
integer	unsigned
so when you do your addition store the result in an unsigned integer memory location and then call printf on the result it doesn t bother looking for the sign because by definition it is always positive

1308727
folder	directory
instead i see a directory view of folder files such as meta-inf web-inf etc

1308730
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
well aside from using jpasswordfield which is just a subclass of jtextfield you could replace every character with on each key press and store the actual text in a string or an array of chars

1308762
stdout	stderr
a bit tricky if you want stdout and stderr combined in one file with stderr yet tee d into its own stream

1308762
stdout	stderr
stderr is sent to a named pipe picked up by tee 1 where it is appended to the logfile wherein is also appended your command s stdout and tee d back to regular stderr

1308810
stdout	stderr
for some reason it outputs everything to stderr instead of stdout and i d like to check on its progress so i find myself needing to redirect stderr output within a start command

1308822
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
imho the best way to solve the problem is to look how jpasswordfield overrides jtextfield and to make your own derivation of jtextarea

1308837
stdout	stderr
claft runs all the defined tests supplying arguments and inputs to each checking return codes and matching output stdout and error messages stderr against regular expression patterns

1308892
put	get
if you can put the javascript right in your .aspx markup then you can get around the changing id s as well by doing this

1308960
datamapper	activerecord
it s obviously a datamapper instead of an activerecord

1309003
int	chars
the binary file is a mixture of int and chars

1309003
int	chars
the int are 1 bytes each and each chars is written to the file as 2 bytes

1309003
int	chars
please note each int is associated with the string of chars following it

1309003
int	chars
does nothing but prints the int value and not the actual chars i want

1309058
sorting	filtering
a dailyreport has many different options for creating a view such as sorting ice cream types alphabetically by dollar value - or including an hourly breakdown - or optionally including the temperature for that day - or filtering out certain ice cream types as a list

1309058
post	get
rather than using query parameters with a get i d rather post a dailyreport representation with the appropriate options using a well-defined custom media type to document each option

1309100
mouse	keyboard
via user input through the keyboard or mouse

1309111
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
when i want to display another view using the pushviewcontroller function of the navigationcontroller i loop through the textfields and call resignfirstresponder on them

1309119
hide	show
i need to show both spans and hide the drop down after a user makes a selection

1309170
width	height
where width and height are those of the ellipse

1309306
firefox	safari
enhance your site progressively so you can have a great design in ieâ and make it even better for those safari firefox users with things like css3 multicolumn or multiple background images

1309320
firefox	safari
wouldn t work in safari but worked just fine in firefox

1309343
rtf	mhtml
i d like to generate the mhtml document by converting the rtf snippets into images in memory and then just embedding the base64-encoded data directly into the mhtml object

1309348
filtering	grouping
membership is an intermediary model connecting artist and grouping with some extra data date joined etc. i was asked to see if one could filtering artists by what grouping they re in but i can t figure out how to do that

1309357
vb6	vba
vb6 vba - 190 chars

1309401
vsto	add-in
in the case of a vsto or com add-in check that word powerpoint other excel instance is also closed as there is still a gc root back to the launching process

1309433
glassfish	weblogic	jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish
if money was not part of the equation and i had an employer that insisted on spending money that wasn t mine i d still choose weblogic over websphere or jboss or glassfish or anything else on the market

1309433
websphere	ibm
websphere is a typical ibm project twice the cost half the functionality poor documentation and you have to buy all their nonsense eclipse based ides to use it

1309436
hide	show
i d like to do just this but still show and hide the message at completion

1309441
stdout	stderr
for some reason it outputs everything to stderr instead of stdout and i d like to check on its progress so i find myself needing to redirect stderr output within a start command

1309498
webkit	gecko
i d be very happy if it worked with at least webkit and gecko and bonus if trident too

1309512
post	get
instead of using redirect just send a new header with post instead of get

1309547
entity-relationship	diagram
the easiest method of visualizing a database design is to use entity relationship diagram entity-relationship diagram and it also allows us to easily see what your design looks like without sifting through code

1309557
bazaar	git
any of git mercurial and bazaar are fine choices in general

1309557
bazaar	git
this so question is about git mercurial bazaar on windows

1309573
migrate	upgrade
do you need to migrate or upgrade data

1309608
bazaar	svn
you can not have multiple physical branches under one repository with mercurial like svn or bazaar but the good thing about mercurial imho is the easy user interface that is really straightforward and the performance that is faster than bazaar although bazaar is getting faster and faster in their recent release

1309616
sorting	filtering
so i can store all kind of object in the system and it is still possible to do filtering and sorting according to the data of the attributes

1309624
postgresql	mysql
just trying out postgresql for the first time coming from mysql

1309677
firefox	safari
the styles are exactly the same for firefox and safari

1309680
integer	unsigned
size_t is an unsigned pointer-sized integer and that s exactly what uintptr means

1309700
int	chars
the field is numeric int always have four chars and is included in the range of 0..1331

1309786
multiplying	add
if you just require a smoothed average a quick easy way is to multiplying the latest value by x and the average value by 1-x then add them

1309797
postgresql	mysql
this ought to give you a mysql field -alike function under postgresql 8.4

1309816
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the code works just as expected in firefox google-chrome opera but low and behold it doesn t work in ie 7 - i m not even going to bother with ie6

1309826
fcntl	fork
with this information you can either call fcntl fd f_setfd fd_cloexec on each open file descriptor or alternatively you could call close fd on each file descriptor after fork

1309860
accessor	ivar
only exception is if self ivar is a lazy-loading accessor and i already used it in the method and i know it has been initialised and i don t want to check if it is nil the 10 more times i use it in the method

1309865
aggregate-functions	sum
the problem i see here is that sum is an aggregate-functions

1309879
versioning	upgrade
i can t upgrade to a newer versioning of jsw because they went gpl

1309881
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
you generally do not want to generate proxies from the code of the service itself...the point of web services is to decouple you from implementation and allow you to bind to contract which is what wsdl is...a contract. you can generate client proxies in a few ways...either with wsdl.exe svcutil.exe or via visual studio s add web reference or add service reference options

1309937
qlist	qsharedpointer
if you are using 4.5 you can use qt s qlist and qsharedpointer classes like this

1309939
datamapper	activerecord
just read and understood stuff like datamapper activerecord identity map domain model yesterday via fowler s peaa book

1310031
put	get
finally we will execute that nvarchar string and get out put

1310034
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it seems to be working well in google-chrome and opera but in firefox i get strange rendering artifacts

1310036
button	checkbox
users see radio button and checkbox as checked but when they submit the form the browser simply fails to send the post data

1310114
erlang	ocaml
hi i d like to pick up one fp language it s always a pain when you work in a position that does not require you learn much and after doing some research i felt erlang and ocaml are the two that i d really like to get my feet wet for the following reasons

1310160
direct3d	directdraw
this would allow you to make use of the accelerated direct3d or directdraw libraries and get fully accelerated performance for your application

1310216
spweb	spsite
my timer job would create the object of spsite then spweb and then spdocumentlibrary or possibly picture library using their guids stored in any xml or database.after that it would take the back up of documents in the document library in some third party application and then delete those documents

1310239
accessor	properties
properties accessor

1310328
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari google-chrome and konqueror all support their own form of the css3 style border-radius so put this in your css and be done with it

1310329
inherited	subclassing
now since the vtable is a part of the class it is inherited by its subclassing and thus the virtual methods are inherited as well

1310437
hide	show
when you pick an option you need to relocate the panels and show hide them

1310467
gridview	detailsview
but since your detailsview sits inside a gridview edit template i suggest you wire the events manually

1310467
gridview	detailsview
...and the update you click is on the detailsview and not the gridview

1310473
qstring	qregexp
i am using c++ with the qt toolkit and wanted to use qstring split qregexp

1310473
qstring	qregexp
qstring is very similar to std string and qregexp are basically posix regex encapsulated in a class

1310522
int	chars
you can use _getcwd chars buf int len to get the current working directory

1310562
magento	oscommerce
this being said if you decide to miss on the extras coming from using an integrated cms ecommerce solution like drupal+ecommerce or drupal+ãœbercart you should probably not be using oscommerce anyway but rather look at something with a different code base like magento or zencart which derived from oscommerce originally

1310597
gridview	rowdatabound
a possible solution maybe is to manage the rowdatabound event of the gridview and set the values like

1310630
int	chars
properties can have a any value of type decimal int datetime and varchar length varying from 5 chars to large chunks of text

1310678
mouse	keyboard
one major reason is that i find my hands need to leave the keyboard too much in ides as they require the mouse too often.

1310687
draggable	droppable
unbinding all bubbles first then re apply the droppable object by simply recalling the init function for bubbles won t do any good because it looses the draggable tag

1310736
git-svn	svn2git
a simple git-svn will reproduce the svn branches actually simple directory with copies in it so i would recommend using svn2git and git2svn

1310737
move	drag	mouse	keyboard
you happen to move your hands out of the keyboard less to hold the mouse drag it here and there and click

1310746
rank	percentile
then to get the real percentile rank you will need to first get the number of values in a variable or distinct values depending on the convention you want to take and compute the percentile rank using the real rank given above

1310755
interbase	firebird
interbase or firebird with fibplus anydac ibo or ibx

1310781
range	max	range	min	min	max
anymore since this functionality is on min max and range constraints

1310796
rss	feed
i am trying to create an rss feed which gets info from a separate xml file

1310799
int	chars
you could try adding a property type int chars etc to the materialsproperty table and partition the table on the type

1310921
folder	directory
after creating addin project vs creates addins folder in visual studio 2008 directory of your s projects directory

1310977
getter	setter
unfortunately this approach doesn t work with property getter setter as there is no such concept in javascript at least not in every major browser yet the only way to get property getter setter to work is to let the silverlight runtime be the one creating the wrapper for my class

1311111
width	height
use jquery to get the view ports width and height as well as the divs current dimensions

1311111
width	height
eg width height

1311111
width	height
you need a bit of logic to determine whether to set the width or height first then use the initial ratio to calculate the other side

1311115
ienumerable	iqueryable
the top one will not compile saying it returns ienumerable rather than iqueryable

1311159
lxml	libxml2
my favorite xml processing library for python is lxml which because it is a wrapper around libxml2 also supports full xpath

1311168
mouseover	mouseout
when the height of the goes beyond max-height and the vertical scrollbar appears hovering over the elements triggers mouseover but if i move to the right to the scrollbar and start scrolling with the mouse the mouseout event never fires

1311237
free	malloc
in xcode run- start with performance tool- shark. however in this case i feel reasonably certain that the primary problems are the per-pixel malloc free the floating-point arithmetic and the two method calls in the inner processing loop

1311237
free	malloc
to avoid the malloc free you want to be doing something like this instead

1311242
ostringstream	std
and i ve tried std ostringstream which seems to work for most values if i do stream.precision 16

1311249
filtering	grouping
a reason to put it in a table as opposed to writing it to a log file is that you can use sql syntax to filtering out grouping calculate average times etc

1311295
post	get
the version there also contains an error which turns the get request into a post request with internet explorer

1311362
init.d	pid
start will start your service and record the process id in a known location stop will kill the process with the pid from the file you created and then place it in etc init.d

1311366
children	parent
a lookup is a bit like a - so basically you work out which children belong to which parent then add them all in

1311374
put	get
in the module s code you will put the statements that will get the image and return a link to it

1311386
filesystems	fat
while linux can work from fat you could just create another partition on the usb stick which will be ext2 or any other non-journaling filesystems and let linux work on it

1311399
superclass	subclassing
you could create a default callback superclass which takes a loadingmessage object argument in its constructor and provides hook methods for subclassing onsuccess0 and onfailure0

1311416
vim	emacs
actually a good text editor like vim and emacs i personally use vim is fairly enough for php development i think

1311450
int	chars
i want to sort this column in descending order but i can t because the column is not defined as int and it has a chars in front of all the values

1311516
udp	tcp-ip
network cards and routers have a tendency to prefer tcp-ip packages above udp

1311530
getter	setter
this is also often used for accessor methods on an instance setter and getter especially with setter methods if they implement extra functionality rather than just setting the value of an instance variable so that you do not have to repeat that code over and over when you want to set the value of that variable for example

1311544
super	self
in functions like init you need to be careful that when you call the super class init you reassign self to be the return value as the super class init may redefine what self points to

1311544
super	self
super is similar to self except it points to the superclass dispatch table

1311580
lxml	elementtree
elementtree supports xpath queries just like lxml

1311580
lxml	elementtree
elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster

1311584
int	chars
here line is a chars array containing a line from the modem and entry is an int in which the id is stored

1311588
profiling	debugging
in the dim dark ages of software engineering one often used a profiling tool to achieve that since profiling injected extra code at entry and exit of all functions although i must say that this is a pretty dismal approach to debugging and when i used it it was a desperation move not front line

1311622
postgresql	mysql
out of the box it supports sql server oracle mysql firebird postgresql and a few other databases

1311650
disk	ram
writeallbytes loads the entire file into ram before writing it to disk

1311660
coalesce	isnull
aside from isnull on sql server i m a big fan of coalesce since that takes any number of arguments

1311738
coalesce	isnull
here s some differences and other explanations about isnull and coalesce

1311740
16-bit	64bit
for example for a 8-bit cpu the stack size is expected to be 8-bit wide and 16-bit cpu vs 16-bit stack width and 32-bit 64bit cpu and so on

1311750
postgresql	mysql
mysql is a solid database and so is postgresql

1311750
postgresql	mysql
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at

1311767
folder	directory
here is an example configuration that will generate the standalone application in the target appassembler folder and generate the jsw wrapper files in the target appassembler jsw myapp directory

1311780
post	get
then in you php page change the post to a get

1311780
post	get
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable

1311780
post	get
there s nothing wrong with using post except that you don t seem to be able to get it to work easily

1311843
rss	feed
the problem that we were having minor performance issues and when we looked into it we found that firefox 3 was loading the rss feed on every page load

1311843
rss	feed
it just seems quite unnecessary to load up the rss feed on every page load like it is right now

1311850
width	height
this is my text --- works fine as in td width is fixed only height increases

1311970
google-chrome	firefox
my asp.net web application works fine in internet explorer but in firefox and google-chrome i have a problem where httpcontext.current is defined but httpcontext.current.session is null

1311973
firefox	safari
if i m not using the css grid system i use a css reset the one provided by eric meyer as it gives you the best possible starting point and the least trouble when trying to develop for ie7 ie8 safari firefox

1311980
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
a framework like pylons django turbogears etc. separates the presentation html templates from programming from database access

1311980
put	get
beyond that it starts to get murky how much power should be put into the tag language

1311987
try-catch	exception-handling
so it appears that the jvm needs all exception-handling classes to be defined when the program starts running and not when they re needed when that particular try-catch block is reached

1312013
maven	m2e	folder	directory
the reason for this is that some maven plugins can t cope with a directory that is outside of target so the m2e devs force the folder for compiled classes to be target classes and target test-classes no matter what you configure in eclipse

1312026
folder	directory
when you packaged your code into dynamictestjar.jar star wars fan you are you didn t get the path right because you didn t zip up the directory containing the folder dynamictestjar so the path that the class loader sees is incorrect

1312043
expander	grid
i would like the grid to stretch to accommodate the expander and i would like the listbox only to fill the grid

1312078
integer	unsigned
you can represent your matrix as a nonnegative integer with each cell in the matrix corresponding to exactly one bit in the integer on a system that supports 64-bit long long unsigned ints this lets you play with anything up to 8x8

1312087
put	get	post	put	post	get
using http get post put and delete we can operate on these resources

1312109
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i added a clientaccesspolicy.xml and a crossdomain.xml to the webroot c inetpub wwwroot

1312137
postgresql	mysql
in mysql and postgresql

1312158
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql

1312167
cvs	svn
a few of the version controls out there are cvs svn git sourcesafe clearcase

1312208
uiview	calayer
because such a view has its content drawn by the opengl layer you can t do the same sort of quartz drawing within it that you would in a uiview backed with a standard calayer

1312208
uiview	subviews
my recommendation is to move your custom quartz drawing to another uiview subclass and place that uiview as a subviews of your caeagllayer-hosting view

1312211
zoo	xts
for irregular data such as business- daily use the zoo or xts packages which can also deal very well

1312217
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
i removed the clientaccesspolicy.xml from the webroot leaving only crossdomain.xml there

1312240
serializable	deserialization
in short you need to create a class that handles the serializable and deserialization of the rss 0.91 standard

1312240
rss	feed
syndicating and consuming rss 1.0 rdf feed in asp.net 3.5

1312244
hex	binary
if you ve got opaque binary data you re trying to persist then you could either use hex or use web safe base64

1312247
filtering	grouping
i switched the code so that it filtering columns that are zero inthe filtering tab of the grouping and that resolved the issue

1312296
client-side	server-side
a server-side method that can respond to a request for data and a client-side javascript function that can make an ajax request to that method and consume the data updating the web page

1312364
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
you may need to implement the inotifypropertychanged on your objects and inotifycollectionchanged on your collections

1312396
put	get
you could possibly create your own subclass of properties which overrode setproperty and possibly put but it would probably get very implementation-specific.

1312418
google-chrome	firefox
i have successfully created a few single accordion drop-downs but when i go to nest an accordion with an accordion internet explorer goes nuts but firefox google-chrome etc work just fine for both the single and nested accordion

1312430
rss	feed
henk the reason you can t read the feed from slashdot is because it uses rss 1.0

1312430
rss	feed
the .net framework only includes built-in support for rss 2.0 and atom 1.0 feed

1312430
rss	feed
however it is possible to create your own class that extends the syndicationfeedformatter class and parses rss 1.0 feed

1312430
rss	feed
check out my article on this topic for a description of the process along with c# code for such a class syndicating and consuming rss 1.0 rdf feed in asp.net 3.5

1312433
vb.net	vb6
we are using vb6 and vb.net 2005 and vss2005

1312481
dateadd	datepart
where nameday. date dateadd year - datepart yyyy birth_date -1900 birth_date

1312491
post	get
you re going to have to dig through the source of the external form to determine the html name s of the relevant fields and whether the form is submitted using get or post

1312564
serializable	deserialization
an instance of the mylistsurrogate class can then be passed to the datacontractserializer constructor and it will be called during serializable and deserialization to substitute types as needed on the fly

1312604
actionscript	mxml
i ve an empty grid made in mxml then in actionscript i add in this order

1312622
google-chrome	safari
for safari google-chrome it s

1312691
maven	pom.xml
i think the problem with idea arises because you are using the root pom.xml in your source structure to do two things that are usually mutually exclusive in maven

1312691
maven	pom.xml
you are first using the pom.xml as a location to store common configuration information for unrelated from a build perspective maven projects

1312704
versioning	upgrade
other half-baked approaches such as hoping that operations that look atomic are indeed atomic may happen to work for specific cases in a given versioning and release of python but could easily get broken by upgrade or ports

1312802
button	checkbox
i don t care about fancy html formatting attachments colors radio button checkbox etc.

1312817
rss	feed
i use the php to create a simple rss reader using simplexml to grab some feed from another blog and display them on my web page

1312817
rss	feed
when i do that i get all sorts of validation errors like cannot generate system identifier for general entity and general entity blogid not defined and no default entity coming from the rss feed

1312817
rss	feed
should i just ignore all the errors that are flagged in the rss feed

1312822
for-loop	arrays
using and not in the for-loop you are using to access arrays elements and not

1312826
for-loop	loops
getimagedata has a for-loop i realised that each index in loops is called more than once

1312841
rss	feed
use something like striptags to take all of the formatting out of the rss feed content

1312841
rss	feed
consider this code which will only fetch and format the rss feed every 5 minutes.

1312846
google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox and google-chrome but on ie8 the map is gray

1312847
tortoisegit	svn
i am trying to run git-svn using tortoisegit and am having problems 405 method not allowed and am wondering if the problem is that the svn server is too old svn 1.3

1312850
versioning	upgrade
i strongly agree with cutrisk - stage the whole thing somewhere else first install released versioning upgrade to beta open it for internal testing etc. then carefully roll it out to customers

1312855
cassini	iis
this will happen more often when you are debugging locally with cassini in my experience since cassini allows all requests to route through asp.net while in iis a lot of requests are handled by iis for you

1312871
post	get
this directive describes the order in which php registers get post cookie

1312891
post	get
environment get post cookie and

1312893
button	checkbox
go to tools - clear recent history - press the details button check site preferences settings i dont know how it is in english but you will find the right checkbox easy and then click erase now or ok whatever

1312911
vsto	add-in
afer deploying my vsto add-in with clickonce i get the following error message when trying to launch setup.exe

1312941
width	height
actual width and height 0 in most

1312982
post	put
then if the post returns a notification you put it into the table and flip the display from none to block and here you can add any fade-in fade-out stuff you want anything like that

1313003
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to hg versioning 1.3.1 and everything works now

1313041
int	chars
you can use the string constructor that takes a chars and an int

1313055
int	chars
as bdukes mentions there s constructor that takes a chars and an int

1313065
google-chrome	safari
single image per page variable heights and widths has to be vertically and horizontally centered has to be fluid shrinks for smaller browser windows and i m merely looking for recent browser support ie8 google-chrome ff3 safari

1313065
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie8 google-chrome and safari but not firefox

1313175
postgresql	mysql
working heavily with drupal recently i can say that it is well suited for stuff like this except a certain lack concerning database abstraction since it currently only supports mysql and postgresql

1313211
tortoisegit	svn
a svn server 1.3 should be able to be accessed by any client including a tortoisegit even recent

1313292
folder	directory
my directory structure in war folder looks like

1313311
postgresql	mysql
to further elaborate on this point say most of my development is done with mysql as the underlying storage mechanism for my data if i avoided vendor specific functions -- unix_timestamp -- in the construction of my sql statements and used a abstract db object that has a common interface moving between mysql and maybe postgresql or mysql and sqlite should be a simple process

1313334
ord	chr	single-quotes	double-quotes
another point of view i ve come across but i m not sure i subscribe to is to use single-quotes for characters which are strings but ord chr are quick picky and to use double-quotes for strings

1313341
width	height
in the following example the leftmost column s width does not increase to accommodate the listbox s scrollbar that appears when the usercontrol s height is decreased

1313389
mouseleave	mouseenter
would like to add to iftrue s answer that you can grab and remove the title attribute in the mouseenter event and place it back in the mouseleave

1313425
int	chars
conversion of chars to int

1313425
int	chars
why does int value of chars

1313454
post	get
on a side note ideally you would not use get for deleting entries but rather post but that s another story

1313491
children	parent
i have four parent pages and six children pages tied to each parent page in wordpress cms

1313504
int	chars
when a int on a system is larger than one byte the signed flat is not affected when you convert chars to int other wise it is

1313508
post	put
such as post put and delete in a

1313515
int	chars
usually in c chars to int conversion and vice versa is an issue because the stanard apis for reading chars input writing chars output use int s for the chars arguments and return values

1313515
getc	putchar
see getchar getc and putchar for example

1313547
int	chars
however if the chars was intended to be unsigned +255 then the signed int may end up being -1

1313547
int	chars
some machines regard chars as signed int while others interpret them as unsigned

1313584
disk	ram
the only thing you need to know is that you can not trust the first try because most of the time it will read data from disk while second try will use cached data from ram

1313596
versioning	upgrade
bug in the jvm upgrade to the latest versioning and hope it doesn t happen again - or some buggy 3

1313598
hide	show
now the feature creep is asking if i can hide or show tabs and other controls based on the user s database permissions

1313608
folder	directory
if copying to a folder nested in the current folder called example in the case below you need to omit that directory also

1313641
min	max
instead of using just the min max points of the zip code areas you could get the average of all positions that would give you a more weighted position

1313691
ant	maven
there you can uncheck compile on save option if you use ant or select disable if you use maven

1313716
versioning	upgrade
tracking conflicts was introduced in mercurial 1.1 which is a newer versioning that you are using you should really upgrade mercurial 1.1

1313722
fortran	ada
it compiles a truly staggering number of languages c c++ ada java fortran objective-c and supplies an intermediate language for haskell

1313734
ubuntu	debian
and for what it is worth my choice would be debian or ubuntu

1313744
onfocus	onblur
i have simple html textbox with couple of events like onfocus change backgroud color onkeypress making sure only accepting numerals onblur formatting and validating the numerals to us-phone format onmouseover showing the tooltip onmouseout hiding the tooltip etc

1313751
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome and safari but ie is a different story

1313755
move	drag
the avatar is positioned offset so the move events are not trapped by the node representing the drag

1313755
mousemove	mouseup
then we register temporary mousemove and mouseup event listeners

1313755
mousemove	mouseup
when mouseup is fired we disconnect both mouseup and mousemove events this._listeners

1313822
wordpress	phpbb
i have looked at wordpress as well as phpbb but i feel there is too much going on at once for me to comprehend

1313836
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have a nsstring and i want to write its value to a nsmutablestring

1313842
int	boolean
ps don t try this on other brands of database that uphold the sql standard behavior a boolean expression yields a boolean not a 0 or 1 int

1313937
filtering	grouping
if you define a m2m between artist and grouping using through membership you can set up a filtering directly on grouping without going through membership

1313945
gentoo	linux
this works surprisingly well the build agent running my unit tests runs on windows xp in a vmware virtual machine with gentoo linux x64 as the host os

1313954
ggplot2	lattice
i ve been experimenting with both ggplot2 and lattice to graph panels of data

1313989
.htaccess	httpd.conf
add some directives on httpd.conf file or use .htaccess

1314022
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the second example allows the compiler to potentially use something called named return-value-optimization nrvo

1314022
return-value-optimization	nrvo
the more sophisticated ones also apply return-value-optimization when there s a named result that the function returns the so-called named return-value-optimization or nrvo

1314022
return-value-optimization	nrvo
hopefully the phase of the moon is less important to when the compiler might use return-value-optimization nrvo maybe it s down to day-of-the-week

1314039
postgresql	mysql
i can recommend webfaction - they provide an easy-to-use control panel which offers various combinations of django versions python versions mod_python mod_wsgi mysql postgresql etc

1314041
getter	setter
i have a class like this with getter and setter all mapped to hibernate each with a sequence to oracle db

1314060
int	chars	int	double
in absence of a function prototype chars and short become int and float becomes double

1314060
int	double
by reading the text i am getting an impression that unless you explicitly specify the argument type by either using cast or function prototype function arguments will always be passed as either passed as int or double

1314060
int	chars	int	double
my guess is c and number were both converted to int and double on the function call and were then converted back to chars and float

1314077
cpu	processors
when we ran some heavy load i could see the cpu on one reaching almost 100 and the other processors is completely idle

1314086
int	chars	int	double
based on the promotion rule you quoted earlier it promoted chars to int and float to double and decided that the signature is

1314094
int	chars	int	double
as for chars and short becoming int and float becoming double that refers to the default types for implicit function prototypes

1314094
int	double
it defaults to int for int values and double for floating-point values

1314110
for-loop	arrays
this construct is a different kind of for-loop that runs over items in an objective-c collection rather than a c arrays

1314173
getter	setter
there aren t a whole lot of occasions when we ever even should access our instance variables without using an accessor for encapsulation but sometimes we need to such as in dealloc or in custom getter and setter

1314270
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i m aware of some of the build tools out there cruisecontrol teamcity and so on and also that vs projects .csproj etc are just msbuild files

1314287
pull	push
now the developers push and pull from their own local git repos to the central subversion repository but still get all the cool power of git

1314326
wadl	wsdl
wadl appeals to people coming from the soap world where it is common to use a code generator to create client side code based on the wsdl

1314410
hash	md5
a non-optimal solution would be to have a database of md5 hash of all or select important files and verify it again at start-up

1314426
bazaar	git
at some point when i can figure out a good mirroring scheme i ll switch to mercurial git or bazaar but for now this works pretty well

1314439
equals	gethashcode
note when overriding equals you also have to override gethashcode

1314441
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
mercurial with hgsubversion git with git-svn and bazaar bzr-svn all have an option to synchronize with an upstream svn repository

1314499
rss	feed
i m working on some code to determine the character encoding of an xml document being returned by a web server an rss feed in this particular case

1314501
post	put
you may want to post it asynchronously and put up the ol uiactivityindicatorview or some other hud

1314533
width	height
the row or column star sizing only works if you give the grid a width and height

1314545
keydown	keyup
if i add a handler for keyup and keydown to the button itself and set the event to handled it will swallow the event if i hold down the space and let go but not if i just tap it

1314549
prepare	execute
the way query parameters work is that the query is sent to the database server when you called prepare and parameter values are sent later when you called execute

1314555
ienumerable	ilist
the only way i ve found to do this which is a bit of a hack is to create a valueconverter that converts from ilist to ienumerable

1314569
min	max
set a min max font size and scale between those

1314569
min	max
set the min max and adjust between as necessary

1314574
post	get
you must sanitize all requests not only post as get

1314586
fileinputstream	filechannel
if you want to fiddle with the bytes yourself get a filechannel from the fileinputstream and then allocate a bytebuffer and then read all the content into it

1314635
post	get
if you have enabled you should either disable it whenever you can or stripslashes get post and cookie values

1314643
post	get
since the post has been closed i m sure this solution will get buried out there but i created a pretty cool class that solves the problem above using the advice i was given

1314649
hex	binary
the input file is read in binary and the output file is written as ascii hex

1314661
formview	detailsview
when a user is using a detailsview or formview in edit mode and tries to leave the current page i want to trap this and force any changes to be saved just as if the user had clicked on the update linkbutton

1314760
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
clojure is a dialect of the lisp programming language so lisp scheme or haskell developers may feel at home while developing with this language

1314794
stdout	stderr
0 1 and 2 will refer to its own private stdin stdout and stderr streams respectively

1314796
hid	keyboard
the scanner is configured as hid human interface device and emulating keyboard

1314812
128bit	64bit
sse sse2 etc will have 64bit registers and 128bit registers even on a 32 bit system

1314832
prepare	execute
i store the question of the user and use the following functions to sanitize the user data prepare it and execute the sql command respectively

1314834
put	get
edit you can get the binding of any of the methods as follows but even with it i m not able to eval successfully be sure to put this at the top

1314842
hide	show
you do not lose much by doing this as most things that do not support icommand cannot leverage the hide show enable disable anyway

1314862
post	put
the agavi framework uses the put request for create and post for updating information

1314862
post	put
usually in rest this is used the other way around often referring to post adding information while put replacing the whole data record

1314862
post	put
if i understand it correctly the important issue is that put must be idempotent while post does not have this requirement

1314874
int	boolean
any difference in size between and int and a native boolean type is really going to make little or no difference to your application s performance or the kb size of your database

1314931
set	bag
one alternate approach i would suggest is that once the validation is successful set a flag in the session property bag of the list with the document guid as the key and in the final landing page deploy a custom web part that will check for the this guid and if there is a value then it will display the message

1314936
mouse	keyboard
most of the keyboard mouse or basic user input events are awtevents

1314952
awt	swing
more to the point awtevent is as the name implies the superclass of all the built-in awt event classes while event classess in other parts of the standard libraries including swing descend from eventobject directly

1314953
integer	unsigned
in 32-bit cpus the memory address of each byte is stored in a 32-bit unsigned integer which as a maximum value of 4 gb

1314953
cpu	processors
you should really be focusing more on learning how to program than about the internal workings of your processors and why you can t access more than 4 gb of ram on your 32 bit cpu

1314978
wordpress	joomla
i m using wordpress and joomla in some projects of my clients and i always try to create some kind of additional security

1315004
awt	swing
the two official java gui apis are swing and awt

1315004
awt	swing
swing is built on top of awt but is a far more extensive api for designing usually desktop applications

1315005
rss	feed
a box containing some headlines descriptions of an rss feed from my blog

1315008
postgresql	mysql
it might be mysql might be postgresql might be sqlite -- file will tell you

1315017
many-to-many	one-to-many
as far as mapping goes jointable annotation is mostly used for many-to-many mapping or somewhat uncommon unidirectional one-to-many mapping

1315063
post	get
either jquery or proxy.php isn t happy about mixing post and get parameters

1315079
google-chrome	firefox
if http 1.1 403 then web browser firefox ie google-chrome ... will ignore whatever

1315079
google-chrome	firefox
if http 1.1 403 then web browser firefox ie google-chrome ... will ignore whatever

1315081
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
for this i placed all the releases in dealloc and didreceivememorywarning with a nil check to avoid releasing nil

1315128
disk	ram
ideally you should have enough ram so that sql can load the entire database s into memory including tempdb and only touch the disk for log writes and when it has to checkpoint the database s

1315134
opera	firefox
looks and works perfect in opera but as for internet explorer it looks terrible and it looks fairly good in firefox

1315147
ubuntu	debian
for debian and ubuntu systems you would similarly edit etc apache2 envvars

1315157
jobs	cron
the format for the cron jobs is

1315178
apache	nginx
for example nginx is much faster than apache

1315179
mvp	presenter
using the mvp pattern in winforms is predicated on the presenter knowing about which controls to access as defined by the iviewinterface

1315231
jboss	weblogic
personally i would choose jboss community version over weblogic server because it s free you know like in freedom

1315251
portrait	landscape
i have a uiimage that is uiimageorientationup portrait that i would like to rotate counter-clockwise by 90 degrees to landscape

1315319
perforce	svn
i currently have a set of scripts that copy from the perforce area in my home directory to the svn area sync it diff it and commit it

1315328
background-image	background-color
you should be able to supply both a css background-image and background-color

1315337
post	put
when the user causes a post back you ll put the addeditgame.ascx control in the holder again and wire up the event so the control that caused the event addeditgame.ascx will be in the control tree for the event cycle

1315337
post	put
when the user causes a post back you ll put crudquestions.ascx in the place holder during init etc..

1315346
folder	directory
also suppose you want the folder c dev to be your source code directory on each of the windows installations

1315355
background-color	transparency	background-image	background-color
as i remember if you set background-color and background-image that would not work with transparency pngs over the transparency you will see background-color

1315361
udp	tcp
technically udp can be fragmented into multiple ip packets - but lose one of those and the entire udp is lost as opposed to tcp which will re-try

1315367
post	get
you ll also need to determine the type of request get post etc. - you can do this by inspecting the characters transmitted before the first space

1315448
lisp	scheme
lisp scheme was what we were tasked with using back in uni

1315487
ada	vhdl
ada and its cousin vhdl directly support the concept of units

1315568
cpython	ironpython
i wouldn t be entirely surprised to find that say one form was faster on ironpython and a different one faster on cpython

1315576
width	height
the left and top divs have as suggested above height width and overflow-auto in their css

1315586
pow	sqrt
on the type of math used i d say parenthesis and add sub mul div pow sqrt

1315613
debugdiag	debugging
but to debugging iis problems now you should use debugdiag

1315618
hash	salt
if no i would suggest to store the passwords hash sha-2 or something like that with a salt

1315631
firefox	safari
for the client side that s entirely dependent on the development priorities in the firefox and safari teams

1315636
base	fractions
i can give a hint - repeating decimals in base ten are all fractions with the denominator having at least one prime factors other than two and five

1315645
accessor	properties
is required in the properties accessor

1315673
yacc	bison
the most commonly-used ones are antlr coco r and lex yacc and the gnu implementation flex bison

1315675
int	chars
i need to filter alphabetic and non alphanumeric chars from a string to make it an int

1315688
profiler	visualvm
try to use the profiler in the visualvm as it will tell you the biggest consumers

1315760
.htaccess	httpd.conf
mod_rewrite .htaccess in your document root directory or somewhere in your httpd.conf

1315784
folder	directory
when i run the file inputfile is null - this suggests that the directory containing the test folder is not in the classpath

1315789
width	height
so i calculate a hash value of every image and append this with the width height and file size of the image

1315807
swfmill	swc
1 you can include one swf library instead of a swc while compiling using the -swf-lib compiler argument and if you need more than one lib you can merge multiple using the swfmill tool

1315836
sequence	permutation
creating sequence getting the next permutation you have a permutation p and call rank p then unrank rank+1

1315907
.htaccess	httpd.conf
just add an include directive in your httpd.conf file or use .htaccess to your project s apache configuration

1315921
distance	polygons
my first thought was to get the bounding box of the polygons then measure the distance of each vertex from the corners of the bounding box

1315954
rss	feed
when creating an rss feed that shows a subset of a larger html doc first x characters i ve run into an issue where some tags begin in the first x characters but the ending tag is outside that range

1315954
rss	feed
i m assuming this is a common problem that rss feed writers and readers solved long ago but i cannot seem to figure out how to achieve it short of trying to parse the html in the feed and add missing end tags which could get messy

1316005
executable	upx
it would be at a size where upx would actually result in bigger executable

1316114
disk	ram
i ve written my own protocol since i need it to be lightweight and i m sending files that may be bigger than the ram available on the device â â therefore the files are being streamed straight from the network to disk

1316139
mouse	keyboard
there is a little more to it a buttonclick is originated by the button itself when it handles and processes mouse and or keyboard events

1316193
mbunit	nunit
nunit is good mbunit is good

1316206
jruby	mri
i personally use 5 mri yarv jruby ironruby and rubinius.

jruby	rubinius
the ffi api was first developed by evan phoenix as the native extension api for rubinius it was then adopted by charles oliver nutter and implemented by wayne meissner for jruby

1316251
move	drag
the drag mechanism is already implemented but when the list is too long and i want to move an item to a position not visible i can t

1316253
hide	show
all the data are already on the page so the search simply show or hide relevant results without needing to retrieve any new information from the server

1316308
opml	rss	opml	feed	rss	feed
i am writing some code to generate an opml file from a list of rss feed parsed on my site

1316308
button	checkbox	rss	feed
the user will select checkbox from a datagrid of rss feed on my site and when pressing a button the heavy lifting will happen

1316308
rss	feed
list is a collection of feed objects hanselman rss feed codinghorror rss feed etc

1316308
button	checkbox
the datagrid will have a checkbox and pressing the button below this grid the code above will execute i have also got the code for the xml declarations etc

1316363
tinyint	boolean
here is a bug report for mysql mysql tinyint 1 boolean conversion fails and relevant commit fixed situation where treattinyasboolean had no effect with default database character set

1316398
hash	md5
a fast hash function like md5 or sha1 is great for this application

1316464
postgresql	mysql
otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since it is more standards compliant and has a nicer license

1316473
inherited	properties
it shows lines for inherited not each individual field properties

1316481
ubuntu	linux
if you are working in ubuntu or any other linux platform provide

1316484
width	margin
given that the style seems to get applied correctly in the first place this is likely just an effect of your particular window composition width margin and placement of the related controls

1316484
width	margin
according to this assumptions i ve indeed been able to reproduce the issue presumably it is easily overlooked because width and or margin of a textbox are often provided explicitly and visible either way due to the default textbox border while this is less common for a radiobutton and its border is invisible by default

1316555
inherited	properties
inherited your viewmodel classes from a master viewmodel with a user properties

1316580
centos	linux	redhat	fedora
besides i find it much more convenient to manage than redhat based distributions such as scientific linux fedora or centos

1316580
ubuntu	debian
edit ubuntu which another poster has suggested is essentially an advanced debian customization towards desktop use

1316580
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian

1316582
centos	linux
centos - a free version of redhat enterprise linux which is the most common server linux distribution

1316592
redhat	fedora
i might consider fedora for a home server as there appears to be lots of support on the web for redhat fedora

1316607
free	malloc
but ld has --wrap which you can use for anything like malloc or free or anything else i do this

1316623
integer	fractions
so you can see that altough they are both stored on 8 bytes at least the float 25...53 the internal representation of datetime is not a float with integer part being day and fractions part being time as is often assumed

1316679
dxcore	coderush
i am also happy to answer questions on the topic of dxcore and coderush refactorpro via or alternatively via email rory becker at g mail dot com

1316716
debian	linux
also i ve seen projects like alt linux hasher fedora mock debian pbuilder sbuild but never used any of them

1316731
versioning	upgrade
however the very latest oo 3.1 i believe comes on all platforms with the very latest python 2.6.2 i believe so if you can upgrade your openoffice to the very latest released versioning on all platforms you should be just fine

1316736
free	malloc
these features include such trivia as malloc and free dlopen some string processing and a whole bucketload of stuff that appears to have to do with locales and internationalization although i can t find any relevant man pages

1316777
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
what you ll need to do is provided on an onmousedown onmousemove onmouseup event to the form itself or some control in the form that updates the position of the control when the user clicks and drags

1316903
min	max
test simply everything with values min max average usecases and do negativ tests - tests that have to fail if the software works correct

1316904
hash	salt
i guess if i hash and salt the extcss it could be more secure

1316917
disk	ram
it will probably not be as fast as memcached as data is not store in ram but on disk though.

1316941
installation	downgrade
in this case installing simbl can t really hurt -- the author doesn t update simbl often at all these days so it s very unlikely that you ll accidentally downgrade a user s simbl installation

1316950
prepare	execute
this is done as an potential optimization - if you know in advance that you will need to execute the statement many times in a row preparing it upfront can save some work on the database server since it does not have to re- prepare the statement for each call

1316950
prepare	execute
pg_query_params as well as its simpler version pg_query just execute the statement query directly forcing the database server to re prepare the statement each time the function gets called

1316950
prepare	execute
the only difference is that in the second case you still have the prepare statement ready to reuse for more calls to pg_execute - which is why you can give it a name since that way you can have different prepare statements on the same connection that you can execute as you please many times in arbitrary order

1316954
merb	ruby-on-rails
when you re talking about ruby and web apps chances are you re talking about ruby-on-rails or merb which is the same thing from v3.0 onwards

1316956
post	get
this will get the created_at and updated_at columns for the post and the name for the associated user

1316961
int	chars
the bignumber problem in most computer science classes is designed to make you have to do the arithmetic by hand precisely as you describe convert each chars to an int subtract and borrow where appropriate

1316962
wifstream	wofstream
i have a program that i built on darwin that reads and writes to files using wifstream and wofstream

1316962
wifstream	wofstream
when i move the code over to windows and try to build in using the mingw tool chain and eclipse i get a compile error on wifstream wofstream and wcout

1316989
verilog	vhdl
it understands c c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a number of other languages

1316996
button	checkbox
in this code i have checkbox for each item that give user ability to delete multiple items at once but if the user press the remove button without checking any item it gives an error

1316997
verilog	vhdl
it understands c c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a number of other languages specifically including fortran

1317012
verilog	vhdl
it understands c c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a number of other languages

1317019
verilog	vhdl
it understands c c++ c# cobol java ecmascript java xml verilog vhdl and a number of other languages

1317045
cdr	cons
car and cdr return the two children which can be nil atoms or other cons cells

1317055
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i can get my tests to work in firefox safari opera ie 8 but not google-chrome

1317055
google-chrome	firefox
this always loads up firefox though and not good google-chrome

1317068
cdr	cons
if the cons cell is in the variable c then car c returns the first value and cdr c returns the second

1317068
cdr	cons
by convention a list consists of cons cells where the car of the cell contains the node value and the cdr contains the reference to the next node or nil the empty list to indicate the end of the list

1317068
cdr	cons
therefore for the list l car l gives the first element the value in the first cons cell and cdr l returns the tail of the list the next cons cell in the list

1317096
versioning	upgrade
we use a visible versioning number so that our admin sales team and customers can tell that the upgrade worked

1317117
vim	emacs
i strictly use vim but i was playing with emacs and really like ido-mode when opening files

1317131
google-chrome	firefox
so the fact that it s firefox that is launched and not google-chrome is normal

1317140
for-loop	arrays
to fix it keep track of the size of your arrays pass it to the function and then use a for-loop to iterate up to it rather than using pointers

1317149
g++	gcc
in recent mingw gcc g++ versions 4.40 you can link against a shared dll rather than the default static library by using the flag -shared-libstdc++

1317193
ubuntu	linux
on linux ubuntu the packages bundled by ubuntu are ok too

1317193
bazaar	git
if you want something a distributed revision control software you can take a look at tools like bazaar mercurial and or git

1317193
bazaar	git
each one of those is used by some big projects well at least for bazaar mysql uses it i think and git linux kernel uses it

1317235
width	height
i want to find out the total width and height of the virtual desktop of which each monitor is showing only a part

1317254
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can tell apache and php to issue the correct charset headers setting adddefaultcharset utf-8 in httpd.conf .htaccess and in php.ini respectively

1317254
post	get
if you re worried about somebody posting incorrectly encoded stuff on purpose i believe you shoud consider html purifie r to filter get post data before processing

1317262
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview which binds to an objectdatasource objstudentdetails

1317286
post	get
the only real difference is that you are using post to search whereas i am using get

1317286
google-chrome	firefox
the one on my site definitely works in ie8 google-chrome 3.0 and firefox 2.0+

1317297
width	height
naturally the table is 100 width and height and my 3 colspanned content cell is 100 width

1317297
width	height
the problem lies in getting my swf to occupy the full height width of the cell

1317301
submit	submission
the way to ensure a user-agent submit in utf-8 format is to serve the page containing the form it s submission in utf-8 encoding

1317327
gedit	aptana
scratch be as close to just a text-editor as possible i use gedit for everything and i d recommend aptana in a heart-beat

1317365
maya	blender
or else you ll want to create it in a modeling animation package like maya houdini max sketchup blender etc

1317380
mef	prism
we ve got frameworks in place today ie prism mef that will help you here but we are working hard to bring the two technologies back to parity for you all

1317403
id3v2	id3-tag
you should also remove any id3-tag from the files both versions id3v1 from the end and id3v2 from the start as these are not valid mp3 data and ensure that the files do start and end on a frame boundary

1317435
stdio	fflush
you can also use stdio fflush fd

1317435
stdout	stderr
where fd is one of stdout stderr stdin

1317465
google-chrome	firefox
i ve written a firefox extension to rig the window title with this information but it became outdated and i need this for google-chrome now anyway

1317467
post	get
this might mean a large http get url or a post

1317467
post	get
dotnetopenid dotnetopenauth is careful with the sizes of requests and jumping between get and post as needed

1317499
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
that works perfectly on firefox but doesn t quite work well on ie7 ie8 or google-chrome i didn t test with opera or safari yet..

1317510
yacc	bison
yacc or bison may be what you are after

1317522
put	get
or at least imagine you are going to and get the project finished in such a way that you would not be shamed to put it out into the open

1317532
submit	submission
the ajax submit means that instead of submission the form back to the server in the traditional sense you create an ajax request back to the server with the form data

1317597
post	get
but forms can be submitted in two different ways get or post depending on the method attribute of the form tag

1317597
pop-up	dialog
as i said these are only conventions and there is not much technical difference between them but a very important difference is that browsers will warn the user if they try to repeat a post -- clicking refresh will pop-up a dialog box warning the user that this may cause an operation to be repeated and confirming that they really want to resubmit

1317597
post	get
this splits the database update post and the view get into two operations

1317629
kermit	xmodem
you need to use some protocol like xmodem kermit etc

1317638
postgresql	mysql
conceptual object that represents a block of data as steven said there s a difference in the benefits you get from being database agnostic so you can switch between mysql and postgresql if need be and being schema agnostic so you have an object full of data that fits together well even if it came from different relational tables

1317645
width	height
i don t need the array to grow i ll know the size i want when my grid manager is created but the grid will be constructing with a runtime height and width

1317686
datalist	repeater
maybe a datalist maybe a repeater

1317701
addclass	removeclass
addclass and removeclass exist to save you from doing all that work yourself

1317702
gif	png
as for library assets the optimal speed is achieved by setting jpegs to use imported jpeg data and pngs gifs as loosless png gif

1317710
mvp	presenter
to summarise the differences controllers in the mvc have more control over the ui and handle events while a presenter in the mvp is more passive and just presents information through the ui

1317733
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

1317736
punctuation	words
again this doesn t take into account punctuation or anything and just assumes all words are separated by spaces

1317856
pull	push
the data model given above is represented in memory but a database is then used to push or pull data as monolitic entities

1317879
opensolaris	netbsd
it s not linux but you can check out the opensolaris source for ls or the netbsd ls.c online

1317923
uicontrol	uibaritem
uibaritem is not derived from uicontrol so casting to uicontrol really isn t the correct thing to do

1317940
libevent	epoll
currently libevent supports dev poll kqueue event ports select poll and epoll

1317961
ant	maven
or use a tool like maven ivy ant or even an ide like eclipse to ensure the required jars are packaged into your war

1317971
min	max
another approach just for functional fun since i wouldn t recommend it for performance could be to separate the x and y values to two arrays using array.map and then call the min and max functions with apply

1317971
min	max
the min and max functions can take an arbitrary number of input arguments math.max val1 val2 ... valn

1318082
onmousedown	onfocus	onclick	onmousedown	onclick	onfocus
i tried returning false from onmousedown and onclick i tried calling this.blur in onfocus i tried setting the readonly attribute none of this seems to work in firefox

1318251
pylons	turbogears
this isnt really specific to a certain framework but it is fully implemented in pylons and turbogears 2.0

1318262
datalist	repeater
---if you are getting product randomly from db then repeater or datalist could be the best choice

1318266
keydown	keyup
handle the keydown keyup keypress event and set the e.handled in the eventhandler to true for the keys you want to be ignored

1318268
postgresql	mysql
my requirements for the server are quite standard latest versions of apache mysql php probably python and postgresql

1318287
postgresql	mysql
use prefork-worker apache mysql 5 php 5 postgresql 8.4

1318291
google-chrome	firefox
it seems fine in firefox and ie but in google-chrome sometimes nothing shows up

1318301
copying	overwrite
note that this is implemented by executing a subshell using popen and copying the standard output to the current file specified in the bufferfile setting and then reading that file so be careful you don t overwrite something you don t intend to

1318324
innodb	myisam
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb

1318328
fseek	fgetc
to iterate backwards one line use fseek combined with fgetc

1318346
button	checkbox
you should turn your checkbox to radio button so that a user can only select one country

peer	p2p
it s a p2p peer 2 peer routing algorithm

1318470
srt	subtitle
i want to format srt subtitle text files to avoid wrapping problems on my media player

1318488
google-chrome	firefox
i would suggest modifying your selector slightly to ensure that it works on browsers that append a to tables like firefox and google-chrome

1318510
cos	sin
from my experience sin and cos are pretty expensive operations

1318550
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works great in firefox 3 + 3.5 ie 6 + 7 safari 4 google-chrome 2 + 3 and opera 9 + 10

1318594
postgresql	mysql
it uses mysqldump to backup mysql and pg_dump to backup postgresql

1318615
innodb	myisam
use -r to backup stored procedures but also keep in mind that if you want a consistent dump of your database while its being modified you need to use --single-transaction if you only backup innodb or --lock-all-tables if you also need myisam tables

1318638
postgresql	mysql
check out astrails-safe for mysql postgresql plain_files subversion backup with encryption and upload to s3 sftp

1318646
many-to-many	one-to-many
whenever you have situations like this you need to determine whether the relationship is one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many

1318680
min	max
this may be just a typo but the sql query you have entered actually has min cmt_id not max cmt_id in it

1318687
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
an aggregate-functions min max count sum ...

1318711
treemap	treeset
if performance is important you can use a treeset or treemap to hold the country names and do the following can be used to identify countries that start with a given string

1318714
draggable	droppable
jquery ui s droppable lets you define a function to run whenever an acceptable draggable is dropped onto that droppable

1318719
post	get
thus you get to do a post without all the work that this guy went through

1318726
rss	feed
this datasource needs to be capable of either itself attaching to an rss feed reading it parsing it and turning it into something sensible for display

1318726
rss	feed
specifically you will need an nsurlconnection object to get the rss feed either synchronously or async

1318726
rss	feed
you will also need to implement the nsxmlparserdelegate category on a handler object and run an nsxmlparser on your rss feed

1318729
lisp	scheme
primarily i m a bit more interested in learning about some of the lisp that have been around a while like scheme or common lisp

1318729
lisp	scheme
and do you think it s a good idea to say implement scheme in common lisp or vice versa

1318751
lisp	scheme
both scheme and common lisp are fine for your task

1318756
voip	sip
the voip support isn t through a standard like sip instead it is done through rtmfp a new protocol developed by adobe

1318762
codeigniter	cakephp
there are quite a few for php though codeigniter zend framework symfony or cakephp to name a few

1318765
perforce	svn
i don t see why not if you can make perforce ignore the .svn directories then a svn wc is just an ordinary directory of files

1318816
xval	fluentvalidation
validation framework for model binding validations xval or fluentvalidation

1318856
jar	war
in the web-inf lib of each application war file there is a common jar that is shared by all applications

1318881
war	manifest.mf	jar	manifest.mf	jar	war
nest common.jar in each war bundle then modify the bundle class path in manifest.mf to include the nested jar bundle-classpath . common.jar

1318888
free	strcpy
you should store the pointer of makedna before passing it to strcpy so you will be able to free it once you re done

1318900
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
web server for php apache iis lighttpd nginx ...

1318912
free	malloc
however had you been storing malloc d memory inside your structure the key point is that you can t just free the structure and expect the other memory allocations to be free

1318918
free	malloc
this avoids at least one set of messing about with malloc and free

1318923
free	malloc
it is better to do the malloc and free at the same place

1318928
hpricot	libxml-ruby
alright switching from working hpricot to libxml-ruby due to speed and well the disappearance of _why looked at nokogiri for a second but decided to look at libxml-ruby for speed and longevity

1318928
hpricot	libxml-ruby
i just want to loop through the 150 entries and then grab out content and attributes but i m having a hell of a time with libxml-ruby had it working fine with hpricot

1318989
children	parent
note only children of parent which are also on the display list will obtain a valid reference to the stage

1319027
wordpress	joomla
the solutions available through their current webhost are php asp asp.net 2.0 drupal joomla and wordpress

1319028
tostring	string.format
another note you can use string.format and it will automatically call tostring on items

1319029
folder	directory
when you uncompress the directory you get from the download you will see a folder bin

1319051
doc	rtf
if you were to print your rtf doc the printer should go to the next page

1319065
wordpress	joomla
drupal joomla wordpress or anyother open source cms is probably going to give you the features you want and more without having to learn a programming language

1319066
agile	sprint
we are adopting agile practices such as scrum and we execute sprint to build new features for our product

1319089
mouse	keyboard
second keyboard second mouse of course

1319136
put	get
i need to get the current xls filename so that i can put that at the end of my static path

1319179
rss	feed
feed is like an rss feed and story is like a single story from that feed

1319245
chown	chmod
what i ended up doing was creating an objective c method i was planning on using this in a cocoa app anyways that finds out the permissions of a file using a perl script then uses chmod chown to apply those permissions

1319252
mouse	keyboard
polling mouse or keyboard states works in a game where you have direct access to update methods that are the heartbeat of the application

1319259
rss	feed
i am writing some c# code to parse rss feed and highlight specific whole words in the content however i need to only highlight words that are outside html

1319264
put	get
put them all into my java lib ext directory made sure they re on my eclipse build path removed the mac com.apple.quarantine extended attribute did a chmod a+x on the .jar files and i still get the following error trying to import javax.xml.stream.xmlinputfactory

1319293
elf	coff
it supports a range of object file formats including linux and bsd a.out elf coff mach-o microsoft 16-bit obj win32 and win64

1319300
16-bit	64bit
the standard only requires that int be larger than 16-bit and no larger than a long so it s not 64bit safe

1319314
stdout	stderr
additionally you must consume stdout and stderr concurrently to prevent blocking

1319321
keydown	keyup
once you application window is closed it will not raise keyup keydown

1319383
hash	salt
the usual way is to store a salt hash of the password in a database

1319388
folder	directory
apparently the silverlight application is calling the web service in my development folder not the service in the iis virtual directory c webs silverlighttest he call to the web service did not work when i opened the page from a different computer in the workgroup

1319406
teamcity	nant
teamcity supports nant

1319406
teamcity	nant
we also have one-click deployment builds set up in teamcity using nant

1319433
post	get
this method is called by the webapp infrastructure if any of your get post etc methods return an unhandled exception

1319436
hash	salt
you should instead be storing a hash version of the password and salt using a cryptographic hash function like sha-2

1319436
hash	salt
always use a randomly generated salt to make it infeasible for attackers to use rainbow tables to crack passwords in the event your stored list of password hash is compromised

1319454
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop check to get the size of the arrays will not work

1319454
free	malloc
if you use malloc free or new delete then you ll have to specify the size of the array you want beforehand

1319465
width	height
notice that i created the constants width height

1319465
width	height
you should use these to get the width height of your elements

1319481
width	height
the font is 9x5 a value that i divide by 2 to obtain width height and render the object from the center

1319481
width	height
so with 4.5x2.5 pixels i use floats for x y width and height of simple rectangles the texture is messed up if rendered somewhere other than x.5 or so

1319674
postgresql	mysql
queries are written in sql not specific to any rdbms but your code remains compatible with any of the supported dbs sqlite mysql postgresql and others

actionscript	haxe
you will need haxe for that either using swc output or actionscript 3 generation .

1319726
google-chrome	safari
i have a web page that links to another web application which unfortunately only completely functions in ie so when viewing the original page with another browser like google-chrome or safari i display a warning that the application won t operate fully operate unless opened in ie

folder	directory
if d svn some directory is within your solution folder then you can add somedll.dll to your visual studio solution and set copy to output directory to copy always in the file properties

1319780
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
if you are considering either mstest or nunit then i recommend you look at mbunit

1319780
nunit	mstest	mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest
the only difference is it doesn t care if you wrote your tests in nunit mstest xunit or mbunit

1319780
mbunit	nunit
all features in nunit are supported by mbunit

1319785
entity-relationship	diagram
you can then take this information and begin drafting an entity relationship entity-relationship diagram to depict these objects and relationships

1319791
width	height
4 change the height and width with a storyboard set the duration on the storyboard

1319804
webrat	cucumber
i ve been having trouble using cucumber and webrat to test authlogic-openid authentication in a rails app

1319804
webrat	cucumber
openid works when i login using the browser but so far i ve been unable to test the app using cucumber and webrat

1319804
post	get
again this works when i try it in the browser but webrat won t doesn t correctly follow the get post redirects required to authentic with the dummy open id server

1319834
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
first in accordance with darren s suggestion i m wrapping my modal view controller in a generic uinavigationcontroller which contains it s own uitoolbar uinavigationbar that comes with a title

1319872
titlebar	window
decorations titlebar system menu minimize etc depend on window flags passed into constructor

1319900
strtol	atoi
to convert a string to an integer meaningfully you ll need to use atoi strtol stringstream etc

swt	swing
if i did it in java i d probably favour eclipse swt or netbeans rcp over swing

1319917
post	put
i put forward that this would be a wordpress job due to the designed features tag cloud dated categorized post ability to be updated rss etc

1319923
x86	64bit
i downloaded the wrapper 3.2.3 source and compiled a macosx x86 64bit version which got rid of the native library warning

1319939
x86	64bit
one alternative option is to have both the 32- and 64bit versions of the unmanaged dll have the same name but have them live in separate folders in your build output say x86 and x64

1319944
qsqlquery	qsqldatabase
it insulates you completely from the database driver qsqldatabase qsqlquery and qsqlresult at the forefront there are some abstractions that also insulate you from actual sql qsqltablemodel and qsqlrelationaltablemodel but those are geared for use in any of the qt views

1319962
hash	salt
with hashing you need to be very careful that you have included a salt otherwise it can be trivial to determine a matching hash

1319983
vtune	xperf	profiler	xperf	profiler	vtune
i d suggest looking at this under a profiler like xperf the f1 profiler in visual studio 2010 beta 1 it has 2 new concurrency modes which help see contention or intel s vtune

1320022
hash	hmac
hmac essentially rolls a secret key known only by your server into the hash so even someone who knows the algorithm can t generate a hmac that will be recognized as valid without knowing the key

1320022
hash	salt
just using a plain old hash is trivially bypassable because the attacker can generate valid hash of their own data and all the salt in the ocean won t fix that

1320022
hash	hmac
so in summary don t just hash it use an hmac

1320036
fgets	getline
if your implementation supports it you should use the safer getline instead on scanf or fgets

1320083
filtering	grouping
how can i add a filtering to show only max logs.date before 2009 08 03 because line 3 where max logs.date 2009 08 03 causes an error invalid grouping by function

1320096
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
create a sqlconnection open it create a sqlcommand execute it to get a sqldatareader voila

1320103
post	get
for your flash app there s no difference if the backend is python php or anything so you can follow a normal php + flash contact form guide and then build the backend using django or any other python web framework receive the information from the http request get or post probably the last one and do whatever you wanted to do with them

1320128
inject	interceptor
and yes i know about event listeners and will be using them on another project - but i wanted to see if i could get around having to inject the interceptor in code - thank you

1320172
cpu	affinity
web gardens only make sense if you use something like sql server for session state and want to have affinity with a particular cpu core

1320202
mergesort	timsort
natural mergesort which tim peters fashioned into python s timsort of today is a wonder in this respect

1320220
doc	rtf	docx	xlsx
in my testing i found that it supports xls doc ppt pdf but not xlsx and docx rtf

1320220
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
it supports image files like jpg png gif bmp not sure about tiff or

1320294
put	get
if i get a chance in the next few days i ll try to put something together for you but give it a try don t wait for me

1320332
integer	unsigned
edit thus for reading a foreign processes memory which is a form of interop i would definitely be using an unsigned integer

1320338
vmware	virtualbox
create a windows xp virtual machine with your favorite virtualisation solution vmware virtualbox virtualpc etc

1320372
move	drag
as soon as i begin to drag the highlight goes away and the cell stays put - literally it never move at all

1320386
qcombobox	qpushbutton
i would really appreciate an example of declaring initializing and populating any data structure of any qwidgets qcombobox qpushbutton etc.

1320394
daemon	cron
the bottom line is that if you leave some echo statements in a php script and set it as a cron job then you will start getting emails from the cron daemon

1320401
ubuntu	linux
returns the string linux not ubuntu 9.04

1320446
cfstring	nsstring
you ll find a few options that are directly relevant to literal nsstring s and their toll-free-bridged counterparts cfstring s

1320478
textview	imageview
i hava a complex listview two textview one imageview so i used newview bindview to display data

1320526
google-chrome	firefox
i was doing the browser recognition tutorial on w3schools and i found that when using firefox and google-chrome i received netscape 5 as my result

1320527
for-loop	arrays
store the email addresses as an arrays and using for-loop just keep adding each email address as a string to the mail- addaddress field

1320667
merb	ruby-on-rails
i had heard about ruby-on-rails and merb for web development in ruby

1320677
post	get
you could also detect http post get variables and that would tell you if it is a command line vs web request

1320679
merb	ruby-on-rails
also merb is merging with ruby-on-rails

1320814
implements	extends
moreover when other classes extends note not implements and therefore you can also have just one abstract class per child class your abstract class they are not forced to implements all of your methods of your abstract class unless you specified an abstract method in such case it works like for interfaces you cannot define the method body

1320835
implements	extends
another frequent pattern is to implements the main functionality in the abstract class and define part of the algorithm in an abstract method to be implements by an extends class

1320844
put	get
poor ejemplow i want to get a reference to a configured instance of ilog from a logmanger.getlogger method and put it into the fluent flow early enough to inject it into properties of my downstream objects

1320844
factors	matrix
and whether the log4net ilog object is static seems to be the deciding factors as to whether it is serializable and can be mashalled between assemblies without the dramatic the runtime will become unstable warnings which are truly meaningful only to matrix fans

1320887
subclass	abstract-class
an abstract-class is used by creating an inheriting subclass that can be instantiated

1320887
subclass	abstract-class
an abstract-class does a few things for the inheriting subclass

1320924
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you move from underscore-separated to camel case you ll be ok since jpa implementations are designed to work with case-sensitive as well as case-insensitive databases

1320938
ssl	https
for 1 you can use ssl and https

1320938
ubuntu	linux
plus tools for running an entire linux system on a encrypted hard drive are pretty matures on ubuntu lvm let you do that almost transparently

1320950
children	parent
i want the bind the parent to the first band of my ultrawebgrid and the children to the second band

1320966
children	parent
a child has a reference to its parent and a parent has a list of children

1320966
children	parent
this means that when i remove a child i get holes in the children list after saving to the database and fetching the parent again

1320966
children	parent
if i remove the bidirectionality by not having a many-to-one from the children to the parent and no inverse true the listorder is updated correctly

1320978
erlang	ocaml
ocaml is a great language -- one of my favorites -- but if your interest is distributed systems than i d recommend going with erlang which is head and shoulders ahead of the other fp languages with regards to distributed systems although there s an offshoot of ocaml called jocaml which has some interesting aspects

1321025
memcpy	memset
the means you could get rid of unused library functions like memset memcpy and reduce crt0 size

1321043
maven	pom.xml
when you want to open the project in eclipse you have to check out the sources setup maven repository path for eclipse with mvn eclispse add-maven-repo build them with mvn install and then run target mvn eclipse eclipse which creates the eclipse project setup from the maven s pom.xml configuration

1321082
post	get
i ve implemented a partial solution code below using this post but 1 i can t get the generic view function to recognize the type of strong view pages unless i create a code behind for the strongly typed view and 2 intellisense and refactoring don t work properly with this method which makes me doubt the reliability of the method i m using

1321144
post	get
i want to programatically download the contents of a web page but that page is generated as the result of a post and i cant seem to get it working

1321146
mouse	keyboard
i need to have an application simply record mouse gestures and keyboard strokes that will then be able to play this recording back

1321155
width	height
is there an easy way to implement this can you bind the x and the y coordinates of a javafx node to its own height and width

1321190
button	checkbox
goal on button press of an unrelated button disable the checkbox and the textbox

1321275
width	height
the scrollbar template reaches out for system parameters to determine its width height depending on orientation

1321289
titlebar	window
you can remove the titlebar from a window using the getwindowlong and setwindowlong gwl_ style function to remove the ws_caption style bit

1321312
inherited	subclassing
1 thing to expect with multiple inherited is that your pointer can change when casting to a typically not first subclassing

1321326
width	height
all you have to do is make sure the progress bar has a fixed width a height and an overflow hidden

1321355
folder	directory
i want to copy a file example a.jpg to all folder in a directory

1321387
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

1321435
put	get
if i make any changes in code of the structure of those objects and i put a new version live any logged user will get an error as their session objects the old version ones do not match the structure that the new version expects while deserializing

1321506
filesystems	ntfs
the windows filesystems fat32 and ntfs only recognizes the pe file name so two assemblies with the same pe file name but different culture version or public key token cannot exist in the same windows folder

1321579
width	height
essentially the area height width that you specify is what we try to deliver in the content area of the dialog barring window restrictions on scriptable minimum sizes 250px wide x 150px high

1321610
inherited	properties
the first thing to do is to add the following attributes to each properties of the reporttype class that needs to be serialised and inherited the class from applicationsettingsbase

1321627
cos	sin
it is easy to move robot in angle direction by multiplying movement step on sin angle and cos angle

1321711
ant	maven
the build-jsps.xml ant script runs the org.apache.jasper.jspc task to precompile jsp in the a webapp that maven is building

1321726
post	get
my understanding is that the get and post methods are distinct from the basic authentication method but that basic authentication is not often used on the open net

1321775
subtraction	addition
here s a slightly nicer but longer solution that uses mapaccum to do a sliding subtraction and addition

1321777
hide	show
note my version does not remove the row from the dom because i just want to hide show it but it should be fairly easy to adapt

1321798
hide	show
i use the following code to find a particular table hide it then show it on click

1321832
int	chars
you can also use the string.indexof chars value int startindex method which has as its parameter says a start index from which the scan is started

1321920
r-tree	quadtree
i recommend to use some smart data structure such as an r-tree or a quadtree

1321925
instances	transient
the deleted instances gets transient in memory

1321925
instances	transient
references to the transient instances from other will cause an exception

1322000
mp3	wav
i want to play in my web site 3gp amr mid mp3 wav files

1322003
post	get
other ways are cookies post and get parameters

1322011
client-side	server-side
there are two forms of javascript client-side and server-side

1322011
client-side	server-side
in client-side javascript it is not possible while in server-side javascript it is possible

1322011
client-side	server-side
so it depends on whether you are using client-side or server-side javascript

1322011
client-side	server-side
that said client-side javascript is much more common and if you were using server-side javascript you would probably know the answer to your question

1322057
ready	each
if you can make use of each result without having to rely on all of the results being ready simultaneously the single

1322128
getter	setter
i think the best solution is a container handler and all access getter setter to the container through the handler

1322198
hide	show
when a button is clicked i want to show the corresponding div with the show method and to hide the other divs

1322215
button	checkbox
hidden fields radio button checkbox text inputs etc

1322248
onchange	onblur
however if you ever encounter a situation where you do need to fire an ajax request based on the user editing data in a form field you can accomplish this by listening for javascript events like onchange and onblur and fire the ajax request from that event listener

1322284
udp	tcp
if it was udp it would maybe work but you also can not rely on packets to represent whole message either udp or tcp

1322328
pow	math.h
you can now call the pow function found in math.h using this friend function.your power function can now be defined as

1322331
uploadify	swfupload
one thing to keep in mind if you use session variables in your upload action being hit by swfupload uploadify is that flash gets its own sessionid and anything placed in the session after a flash upload request is placed in the flash session

1322335
post	get
what is the best java library to use for http post get etc

1322339
sharepoint	spsite
a better approach for elevating permissions within sharepoint is to use spsite impersonation

1322354
put	get	post	put	post	get
full implementation of all http methods get post put delete

1322354
ssl	https
supports encryption with https http over ssl protocol

1322359
boost	stl
the stl boost and maybe for productivity and ease in the beginning qt

1322371
webkit	gecko
read up on trident gecko and webkit - three very popular layout engines

1322393
folder	directory
which creates a default project with compass for the blueprint css framework currently there s a bug in compass with the creation of the grid.png file in the images directory for compass so you need to copy the original grid.png from the source folder

1322393
folder	directory
the sass cache creates a bunch of temporary folder in your project directory which probably would have poor outcomes if they ended under source control

1322493
temp	tmp
the path specified by the temp environment variable if tmp is not defined

1322493
temp	tmp
the current directory if both tmp and temp are not defined

1322520
hide	show
the overlay grid hide everything else the normal content and is only show under special circumstances if the network connection goes down

1322553
jndi	jta
the problem i am faced with is the following hibernate seems to require jndi to work correctly with jbossts jboss s jta implementation

1322569
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to the latest 0.10 versioning

1322655
puts	gets
once the user has uploaded and scaled the images they are directed to an album viewer which gets the photos out of the db and puts them into heads

1322664
put	get
either you re trying to put the headers in the body or one of your headers preceding content-type has a spurious newline in the value ending the header lines early and making your content-type line not get counted as a header

1322675
put	get
i understand that i can add in a .contains or similar and put in keywords from a keyword box split into individual items and that should get the list of results

1322694
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
works in internet explorer firefox safari opera google-chrome others a plus

1322771
momentjs	datejs
nowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained so use momentjs which is much better as pointed out by t.j

1322833
google-chrome	firefox
update as of june 2015 page speed plugins for firefox and google-chrome is no longer maintained and available instead google suggests the web version

1322839
hide	show
i need to use the title attribute because of slimbox but i want to hide the title-text that show up when hovering the mouse over the link

1322877
children	parent
in pl sql getting a list of all of the children of a parent is simple enough

1322884
put	get
i ask because if i put a free stringvar at the end of method1 i get a warning that stringvar is unitialized inside method1 which is true

1322936
put	get
if i declare the header file and don t put anything in the cpp i get the following error

1322982
folder	directory
alternatively if you re trying to create a new repository you can just copy the folder delete all of the .svn folder and check in the entire directory to the new repository

1322996
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
you can have a look at sharpdevelop and or monodevelop two spen source .net managed ide

1323030
jar	war
for one artifact i need to build is a war file which excludes certain aspectj files from the build and the other is a jar file which needs those aspects to be weaved during the build

1323042
g++	gcc
gcc c++ linker g++

1323043
ready	each
one approach is to keep each feature on its own branch and only merge it back to the main branch when the new feature is ready

1323044
switching	accessory
i spent ages fiddling around with custom uitableviewcells with a simple label and switching on it before i discovered i could just add a uiswitch as an accessory view

1323046
hash	md5
assuming uniform spread in the range of md5 and sha-1 hash for random strings which isn t the case and assuming we re only talking about two strings and not talking about a pool of strings so we avoid birthday-paradox-type complexities

1323046
hash	md5
an md5 hash is 128 bits wide and sha-1 s is 160

1323130
post	put
i d like to be able to change the value of the post item and then put it back on the post

1323143
int	boolean
ie before version 8 confuses attribute access with js object property access resulting in confusing errors when the attribute is named differently class vs classname or the type of the property is different boolean or int properties where an attribute is always string

1323174
google-chrome	firefox
but the function vad does not get called in firefox nor in google-chrome

1323270
jar	war
make the war project have a dependency on the jar project and the jar project have a dependency on aspectjrt

1323270
jar	war
if you need to build both projects at once define an aggregator pom and specify both the jar and war projects as modules

1323278
firefox	safari
ie 8 behaves correctly and looks very close to firefox and safari which was a pleasant surprise.

1323281
width	height
by default the img element and other replaced elements flash etc are inline-block - this means they flow inline like text but have a width and height

1323292
folder	dir
you can of course create a specific folder on the same mount point not accessible to the application suited for this task simulating this way a tempfile on the same mountpoint if you don t want to see any spurious file in the destination dir

1323305
width	height
if you want a something that would constrict the size of a loaded image to a maximum width and height mantaining the ratio you could use something like this

1323309
srp	principles
this would allow you to properly isolate your concerns across multiple classes and not violate srp single responsibility principles

1323355
unsigned	short
unsigned short shortvalues

1323390
hide	show
the script and html below creates a nice hide show menu when you click the navheader the navitem becomes visible

1323404
postgresql	mysql
i can comment on how mysql and postgresql compare in a few areas that might be important but without information it s hard to say which of these actually matter to you

1323404
postgresql	mysql
i ve written up a bunch more background information on this topic at why postgresql instead of mysql comparing reliability and speed

1323404
postgresql	mysql
mysql can do a good job with a small number of clients at higher client counts the locking mechanism in postgresql might do a better job

1323404
postgresql	mysql
if not it s easier to turn more of those features off in mysql which gives it a significant speed advantage compared to postgresql

1323463
gridview	sqldatasource
i made sure the gridview has the correct sqldatasource control as its source

1323514
width	height
the rectangle has a specified size lets say width 150 and height 30

1323556
tinyurl	bit.ly
the site i am working on wants to generate its own shortened urls rather than rely on a third party like tinyurl or bit.ly

1323576
short	base
so in short all of the higher-level classes you use that are installed when you install the .net framework are part of the framework class library but not necessarily part of the base class library

1323586
uilabel	uifont
set the font property of the uilabel with a uifont that matches that size

1323586
uilabel	uifont
you can get more information from the uilabel and uifont documentation

1323587
x86	64bit
note that this approach requires that you build your application for the x86 platform since the flash player is currently 32-bit only and you cannot interact with its activex object from 64bit code

1323591
getter	setter
also if you create a property on the object to handle this make sure to only implement a public getter in the property and not a public setter

1323601
versioning	upgrade
.net versioning is 2.0 i can upgrade if its necessary but i dont think its the issue

1323622
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
dave hyatt who used to work on gecko used by firefox and others at mozilla and now works on webkit used by safari google-chrome and others has an old blog post explaining some of the complexities of this process

1323647
post	get
with register_globals set to on any variable in is automatically injected as a vartiable in your application -- well actually this depends on the variables_order configuration option but this one almost always includes get post and cookie at least

1323782
xlib	xcb
xcb which replaces xlib at the moment

1323782
clutter	cairo
xrender cairo clutter that may do what you want already

1323829
uilabel	uifont
what you want is the textcolor property that belongs to uilabel -- uifont depends on other classes like uilabel to provide other gui-related properties like the color of the text

1323831
uilabel	uifont
instead of setting the color in a uifont you set the uilabel s textcolor property which is a uicolor

1323889
children	parent
it looks like you only want the children back so you need to change your criteria to get the type of the child objects then use the parent id as the selection

1323936
gridview	sqldatasource
if i bind gridview via datasourceid attribute to sqldatasource and set selectcommand and updatecommand attributes then everything works perfectly

1323937
hash	md5
there are multiple implementations of md5 and sha1 available in javascript that turn any string into a hash string and that can easily be used with jquery

1323999
stdout	stderr
if i wanted to use the same file for stdout and stderr or if i wanted to replace a file handle with some other number then i would need to call the dup2 system call to achieve that result

1324030
thickbox	simplemodal
simplemodal looks great but i found it so much harder to implement than facebox or thickbox

1324090
apache	nginx
you can read the file from s3 and write it locally to a non-public directory then use x-sendfile apache or x-accel-redirect nginx to serve the content

1324120
getdate	dateadd
i m sure it s with a dateadd and getdate

1324138
intersect	contains
this will completely constrain the polygonization with no twisting and should be much easier to solve than the general case - simply find the point on the plane contains the second circle that is closest to that selected in the first and intersect the line passing through that point and the second circle s center with the second circle s perimeter

1324140
getter	setter
the setter in myspecificclass shouldn t be a problem but the getter definitely is - internally a call to an instance of myspecificclass s status will be making a call to itself to see which value to return which will make a call to itself to see.

1324161
getdate	dateadd
select dateadd yy datediff yy -1 getdate 0

1324165
mouse	keyboard
via the api i would look into hooking the keyboard and mouse messages so that your app can pre-process every mouse click on other applications - start with setwindowshookex and read everything you can about hooking messages

1324268
getter	setter
the abstract property declaration in the base class just states derived classes must implement a property called status with a getter and setter

1324276
photoshop	coreldraw
suppose if i am using coreldraw or photoshop there is always an option for align distribute

1324278
content-length	content-type
keep in mind that you also need to add proper headers like content-type content-length etc the readfile manual page has some examples

1324412
put	get
i personally do not put the .text property on my commands simply because i get no reuse out of these commands

1324466
getter	setter
in ruby they are used for some meta-programming tasks like generating getter and setter for member variables for example attr_reader name to generate a getter for name

1324513
children	parent
for instance i need the links to the children pages to only show up when a parent page is showing

1324588
cpu	affinity
you will not be able to do anything smarter than sql already does in regard to partition the data access per cpu it simply has access to information you don t buffer pool fill state page lifetime expectancy cpu numa affinity etc

1324619
hash	md5
i have some mysql tables that are currently using an md5 hash as a primary key

1324624
children	parent
as for your i need the links to the children pages to only show up when a parent page is showing problem you can organize wordpress pages hierarchically then make use of that hierarchy in the theme php

1324650
hash	md5
furthermore though very unlikely there is a chance that md5 hash of different strings could collide i seem to recall the probability as being 1 in 36 to the power of 32

1324674
hash	md5
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys

1324680
subtraction	addition
dear professor subtraction should be defined in terms of addition

1324688
hash	md5
calculating an md5 hash and using it as a key for something that s already unique is redundant

1324688
hash	md5
on the other hand if name is not unique then the md5 hash won t be unique either and so it s pointless that way too

1324688
hash	md5
generally you use an md5 hash when you don t want to store the actual value of the column

1324688
hash	md5
for instance if you re storing passwords you generally only store the md5 hash of the password not the password itself so that you can t see people s passwords just by looking at the table contents

1324705
post	get
however when you make the request via jquery you need to pick either get or post

1324707
rss	feed
an rss feed of the last 15 errors from the log

1324720
firefox	safari
moving the stylesheet below all js indeed shows that the js including the ready function runs much earlier but even then the jquery-applied class --which is yet unknown when the js runs-- is used correctly in my quick tests in safari and firefox

1324742
mef	prism
take a look at this sparkling client podcast on mef and prism

casting is potentially worse since with some compilers it will quell any warnings that would be issued if the literal value is outside the range of an unsigned short

1329178
unsigned	short
if nothing else this only works if the unsigned short version actually exists whereas a call with the cast performs the usual overload resolution to find the most compatible version available

1329207
put	get
both projects have had allot of effort put into them by different people to get a good sepperation of concerns in the context of asp.net mvc and domain driven design

if you need to use databinding because your application design prevents you from accessing the service directly i d recommend binding to a property with getter and setter functions that you control

1329554
uilabel	nsstring
i have an nsstring that then sets a uilabel

1329587

1329619
integer	fractions
nsdecimalnumber is a fixed precision and scale integer scaled to a certain size to represent fractions numbers

1329624
stdout	stderr
2 sending the stdout to null nul will only keep the stderr output set into e

1329624
stdout	stderr
with those being said you have to test the script and see if the exception is actually sent to stderr or like some other softwares to stdout even if an error occured

1329641
range	minimum
if you don t have a sequential id you end up using a minimum id and rowcount to select a range

1329646
actionscript	mxml
unfortunately the latest stable releases of flashdevelop does not support code completion in mxml although the feature is fully implemented in as you can browse packages in libraries with code completion in actionscript

1329664
cvs	svn
i ve seen this happening once in a while usually with a user b who does not really understand svn s or cvs ftm workflow

1329724

also you could use different methods to show hide the tips like fadein fadeout slidedown slideup on the hidden element

1329860
oodbms	db4o
i ve considered using the db4o oodbms with a recent silverlight ria services project but there s one point that i could use some advice on - how to make associations work

1329860
oodbms	db4o
the problem that i see with using db4o or any oodbms is that foreign keys and primary keys do not and need not exist - and the result is that i wouldn t need the racer.carid and car.id properties

1329860
getter	setter
doing that by hand would be prone to error so i d want a lot of that handled in the property getter and setter but i m not sure of the best way to implement that

1329882
redmine	trac
try bitnami packages for redmine or trac they are easy to use installers that you can run on your server there are also virtual machines available as well

1329891
hide	show
the biggest reason i could think to use show and hide instead of append and remove is that when you use .remove it will destroy all event handlers and cached on the dom objects you are removing

1329894
min	max
the first is an info table that has a search id identity column and has the min and max row numbers

1329894

war	manifest.mf
i have tried some other things including manually adding core.jar to the war s manifest.mf file changing usejbosswebloader to true in the jboss-service.xml file under the jboss-web.deployer and various combinations of the above to no success

1330067
jar	war	folder	directory
i either lose the classes directory from the classpath lib folder and none of my properties files get picked up or the war can t access the proper class from the jar

i could use emacs diff mode but i m a vim user and i don t want to learn emacs

1330132
ksort	asort
pretty much all of the core sorting functions with all the sort ksort asort variations depending on whether you want to maintain key association and so on

1330144
for-loop	arrays
the most prevalent one that comes to mind is that an indexed arrays can be looped over using a traditional for-loop whereas an associative one cannot because it does not have the numeric indexes

1330162
datalist	repeater
i first tried using a datalist with repeatlayout in table mode and repeatcolumns to a set value of 10 with a repeater within containing a label control

1330188

i ve constructed a simple test with jquery to see if i can get an element to show hide upon the clicking of a button

1330607
hide	show
regardless you can simply call .toggle to show or hide the element

1330657

1330682
folder	directory
then to ls the directory in a folder

1330686
des	aes
blowfish and triple des use 64 bits blocks but remember that those algorithms didn t receive the same scrutiny as aes

ienumerable	iqueryable
any collection object that implements ienumerable iqueryable or other interfaces like these can be queried using linq from i in entityset.

1330771
inherited	subclassing
a class that doesnâ t need to inherited any special behavior from another class should nevertheless be made a subclassing of the nsobject class

1330793
superclass	subclassing
subclassing of nsobject may have their own specialized init routines and at the beginning of such they should call their superclass init routine something like so

1330845
inherited	subclassing
since it is possible to inherited from different root base classes yes you must explicitly declare you inherited from nsobject when you make any new class unless of course you are subclassing something else already which itself in turn probably subclassing nsobject

1330886
queue	fifo
they are queue but the order is not guaranteed to be fifo

1330935
validationsummary	customvalidator
if you use a customvalidator control and a validationsummary control within an aspx page for server side validation you can set the errormessage of the validator and its text value will appear in place and the errormessage value will be displayed within the validationsummary control

1330935
validationsummary	customvalidator
so that the validationsummary would display its usual headertext along with your additional errormessage and the customvalidator would display its text value

1330975
rss	feed
i m trying to make a webcomic rss feed with django but i can t put an image in the description field because the html code gets escaped even if it s in an autoescape off block

1330982
opera	firefox
it s very easy in firefox and opera as far as i see

1331119
button	checkbox
when i click the checkbox with the mouse left button the declared event is not fired

1331131
getter	setter
basically all i care is that it has a getter it does not matter if the property has a setter

1331139
nfa	dfa
oh and just to give a little hint when you describe the nfa dfa in paragraph form try describing it as if you were going to draw a picture you can replace the draw work with something later in the actual application but it can be a nice placeholder for now

1331146
nfa	dfa
you could have an nfa input stream and a dfa output stream

1331150
inherited	subclassing
since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept

1331150
superclass	subclassing
if ireadwrite is a subclassing of ireadonly then the inverse is true-- ireadonly is a superclass of ireadwrite

1331186
validationsummary	customvalidator
the rest of the customvalidator control s behavior will tie in with the validationsummary just like any other validator including putting the errormessage up in the header etc

1331266
button	checkbox
the checkbox inherits from buttonbase which add a class handler for the left button down event onmouseleftbuttondown

1331270
put	get
rather than teleporting the unit to get it where it s supposed to be i can start its movement late and then mess with physics to speed it up slightly so that it can catch up to where it s supposed to be and then slow it back down to put it in the correct place

1331270
interpolation	splines
if i don t get a movement update by the time i re-transmit that update its value will be so old that it s no longer relevant so it s better to just send another move and use a local perception filter to catch up or use a cubic splines to interpolation the movement so that it looks more correct or something of that nature

1331295
post	get
i m not sure exactly and i ll update this post once i get chance to try it out on a clean machine i m still mid-project so it s not a very good time to be faffing about

1331295

the way i fixed it was to get the dlls from c program files episerver cms version bin and put them in the bin folder for the application

1331308
qlineedit	qlabel
i m trying to create a standard two-column form where the first column is a text label qlabel and the second column is an interactive widget typically a text field qlineedit

i have a launchd daemons that every so often uploads some data via a web service using nsoperationqueue

1331503
many-to-many	one-to-many

rss	feed
rss feed framework

1331563
objectdatasource	formview
now i m trying to bind the object to a formview with the objectdatasource

1331601
codeigniter	cakephp
if you decide to use kohona cakephp codeigniter which are all php frameworks you can achieve very fine grained control over your websites behavior and control every aspect as needed but it will take you much longer to deploy a fully fledged standard site than using a standard cms

1331646
post	get
subsequently if they say clicked on a category name to get a list of all post with that category they d probably get an error unless you were handling that sort of thing

1331670
git-svn	svn2git
caveat i haven t tried this but as far as i know svn2git just converts those into the -t|t|b options for git-svn .

1331673
post	get
when you add a post and get the response from your php script through ajax the response contains a p tag with class editme

1331913
realloc	malloc
unless you can be absolutely sure at compile time of the amount of data you re going to read in and you can t or at least shouldn t you re going to have to use pointers to arrays allocated with malloc and realloc

1331913
atof	strtod	strtol	atof	strtol	atoi	strtol	strtod	atoi	atof	atoi	strtod
my personal favorite functions are strtol and strtod but there are also atoi and atof functions that may be avaliable

1331925
int	chars
if it had an asterisk before the x such as int x 10 int chars void it would be an array of function pointers and would be used like a normal array

i have a form with a select all button and a bunch of checkbox

1331955
button	checkbox
i want to have it select all checkbox when the user clicks the select all button

filesystems	ntfs
then you need to edit the permissions on the ntfs filesystems for the other files

1331980
waitpid	fork

1331997
button	checkbox
having your button call this when clicked will select all checkbox on the page

1331999

int	chars
int main int arg_count chars arg_vec

1332212
nsstring	nsxmlparser
i know apache has an option where you can turn on directory indexes so you could do that then download the generated directory index and parse the html using an nsxmlparser or some other parsing library adding an nsstring to an nsmutablearray every time you find a file name

1332247
vb.net	vb6
i m trying to solve this exact same problem myself right at the moment for an application that i am migrating from vb6 to vb.net

1332372
icmp	udp
well php supports a set of socket functions that allow you to deal with udp i ve used them myself to build a nslookup class which i could specify the name server all in udp and a ping class raw icmp

1332377
client-side	server-side
is it client-side processing client bandwidth server bandwidth or server-side processing

1332427
accessor	properties
you should almost never call properties accessor from within the implementation of the same class

1332474
accessor	properties
if you re using core data you should essentially always use the accessor since some properties may not be loaded from the persistent store until needed

1332474
accessor	properties
if you re modifying the value of myobject you need to use the accessor in order to make sure that any other objects observing the value of that properties are properly notified

1332533
mouse	keyboard
allows sharing keyboard and mouse

1332534
width	height
keep in mind that block-level elements which are not re-sized in some way using height width or float or margins will always take up the width of the window even if the content of the element does not

1332537
width	height
in the case of those plugins they make it cover the entire page but in your situation just position it at the same position as the panel giving it the same width and height

1332543
mergesort	heapsort
sort the array o n log n at worst - mergesort heapsort binary tree sort etc

1332549
int	boolean
for example if you knew the list was large and only contained int from 1..n where n is fairly small you could use a pair of boolean arrays or a bitmap and do something like this

1332551
keydown	keyup
i don t know of any specific problems with this approach but i opted against it simply because i wasn t comfortable simulating input without looking at how the clr handles the actual input and without at least raising the complete lifetime previewkeydown keydown previewkeyup keyup i was wary of unintended consequences

1332571
keydown	keyup
if the data is not one of your special barcodes then inject them as keydown keyup windows messages so that it will seem to work in the same fashion as in keyboard emulation mode

1332583
imagemagick	mogrify
for each subdirectory my script scans the text file then calls a few external programs one detects blank images custom exe then a call to mogrify part of imagemagick which resizes and converts the images and finally a call to 7-zip which pacakges all of the converted images and text file into a single archive

1332602
serializable	deserialization
but there will be problems with loading as registration will be dynamic not static as i understood you must register classes prior to serializable deserialization

1332626

also if clspatients is self-refreshing make sure it implements inotifypropertychanged or inotifycollectionchanged as appropriate in order for the binding targets to update when the data changes

1333065
easymock	powermockito	mockito	easymock
an alternative approach would be to use a testing library such as powermockito it currently works with easymock and mockito to clear the static fields in testb s initialisation this avoids the need for any jvm forking and ensures your tests are portable

1333065
easymock	powermockito
powermockito is a framework that extend other mock libraries such as easymock with more powerful capabilities

1333065
easymock	powermockito
developers familiar with easymock will find powermockito easy to use since the entire expectation api is the same both for static methods and constructors

1333065
easymock	powermockito
powermockito extends the easymock api with a small number of methods and annotations to enable the extra features

rss	feed
i would like to edit the rss feed so it shows the image and the description rather than the complete post

int	double
the best way around is to not use the built in double - use int only if possible with power of 10 coefficients sum everything up and display the final useful figure after rounding

1333264
integer	fractions
you cannot expect to be able to store any random fractions with perfect results just as you can t expect to store any random integer

firefox needed both data width and height

1333303
testdriven.net	xunit.net
previously when executing unit tests with xunit.net testdriven.net i could see output written to the console via console.writeline displayed in the output window

this is intended to work on a directory level - i ve assumed your admin pages all run from say mydomain.com admin with a physical admin folder in your webroot where you put the .htaccess file

1333857
base-class	subclassing
the simplest way to do this is to decorate the base-class with the subclassing we know about

1333882
folder	directory
where script can check user home drive server1 home user1 path in active directory and go to that path to cut user1 folder from server1 home user1 and paste in server1 home leavers archive

qnetworkaccessmanager has a signal finished qnetworkreply reply which is fired whenever a file is requested by the qwebpage instance

1334017
ubuntu	debian
when running remotely terminal as root on my ubuntu and debian servers it gives the following error

1334061

i have a list of figure names and width and height informations in separate xml file

1334176
width	height
i need to match the figure name in the source xml file and need to insert the width and height information as a attribute in the source xml file

1334176
width	height
for all images i need the width and height values

1334224
width	height
your example will only get the first height and width regardless of the name of the image

basically my milesperhour property should have an int getter but an object setter

1334252
firefox	safari
this doesn t work in ie6 which may be an issue but it ll work in ie7+ and firefox safari etc

1334336
filtering	grouping
here s one approach you first create the query with all the correct inner joins then you create the outer grouping using a distinct filtering then create the xml from the grouping using a where clause to join them

1334379
onkeyup	onkeydown
implement it on the onkeydown or onkeyup attribute of the textbox

1334396
peer	p2p
fms is not peer to peer to this date therefore you ll always pay for the bandwidth as long as you re not going p2p

1334402
hide	show
this allows users to hide and show the header when needed

1334451
public	protected
actually it s not just about public private protected but rather the whole range of keywords that enforce some rules abstract final internal

1334473
post	get
i m sure getting a partial view might be as simple as using the jquery load get or post methods

1334477

filtering	grouping
you can add information about countries and states to your cities list and then grouping by them and avoiding the second join and filtering

1334620
width	height
as i understand you have an xml file with a lot of different elements and want to add the width and height to all the elements without touching the rest of the xml

1334620
width	height
it copies all elements and attributes as-is unless i made a mistake but treats elements specially by also adding the width and height as looked-up in the figure.xml file

1334689
rss	feed
it s a php tool which you install on your own server which allows you to combine group rss feed

1334689
rss	feed
a group of rss feed has its own rss feed in gregarius

1334689
rss	feed
you don t need to look at the frontend you can just use gregarius as backend and use the group rss feed to visualize your project

1334802
ant	maven
i do not want to use ant or maven

1334831
folder	directory
the client remembers which directory you do not want to update and does neither fetch the updates nor create a checkout for this folder

1334857
gauge	progress
this would give the user a relaxing sense that things are happening and if the directories are all ordered alphabetically they can even gauge for themselves the overall progress of the operation

1334873
multicastdelegate	delegation
all events are delegation types they all inherit from eventhandler that inherits from multicastdelegate which interits from delegation

1334929
free	malloc
not sure what exactly malloc does here but every call to malloc or free can have far-reaching consequences to all dynamic memory of the virtual address space of a process

1334929
free	malloc
somehow malloc or some system call malloc uses zeros the already free memory where the pointer itself is located not the data it points to the pointer itself is in dynamic memory

1334933
versioning	upgrade
i know that i can download and upgrade to new versioning of the silverlight oob-app using application.checkanddownloadupdateasync but i don t know how to restart the application after that

1335030
cng	cryptoapi
i found that microsoft provides the next generation cryptoapi cng key store and certificate services

1335056
min	max
of course averaging a bit columns is kinda pointless but max min is useful as a or and spanning multiple rows

1335058
filtering	grouping
i recently learned that a having clause can filtering the results of an aggregate query by targeting the results of a grouping by

1335071
cvs	svn
with cvs svn and other version control systems you can do an export

1335107
spaces	delimiter
you should set for spaces not to be considered delimiter more info here

1335107
spaces	delimiter
if you don t have inverted commas and spaces in the text you can use alexander s trick and wrap the text between delimiter in inverted command so that hello hello bye bye turns to hello hello bye bye

1335107
versioning	upgrade
maybe it s time to upgrade to a newer versioning of delphi

1335126
google-chrome	safari
and this is the equivalent for webkit-based browsers safari google-chrome

1335151
onfocus	onblur
there is an onblur but no onfocus as far as i can tell

1335173
free	malloc
in that case malloc could be modifying the memory thinking that it is free

1335186
put	get
add a css class to the image that hides it and put something random or the current date in the query string so that it doesn t get cached just to be on the safe side

1335211
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
use autoresetevent or manualresetevent

1335239
free	malloc
you only need to call free on values which are explicitly created via malloc

1335242
free	malloc
if you use malloc the space is allocated on the heap which must be explicitly free

1335245
free	malloc
if you don t malloc it then you can t free it as far as i remember

1335246
free	malloc
good rule of thumb if you malloc you must free

1335247
free	malloc
note that you only free what you malloc

1335249
free	malloc
compare this to memory allocated on the heap via malloc which you must explicitly free

1335285
range	max	range	min	min	max
however a cheap hack that might serve your purpose is to select out the min max of overly_specific_date in your original query to show the offending date range which is turning up

1335315
post	get
i feel that the same code which determines whether a user can get or post to the edit action should also be responsible for determining whether to render the edit link on the index or details views

1335325
packets	pcap
or pcap is an option for the raw packets data

1335345
innodb	myisam
as a key the row_pointer being a file offset for myisam or the value of the row s primary key for innodb

1335401

there are a lot of attributes that are used by screen-readers and other usability tools that are not standard yet

1335422
freebsd	solaris
similar mechanisms freebsd has kqueue and solaris has dev poll

1335447
getter	setter
with regards to the generated classes if you went the class generation route i m betting every field has a getter setter whether fields should be read only or not did somebody say thread safety and mutability and that you can t add behavior because it gets overridden if you regenerate the classes

1335490
gif	png
this will now replace the first part of the path for jpg png and gif and keep the filename

1335492
nsmutablestring	nsstring
problem ehre assuming you initing your array properly could be that foobar assings an nsstring not an nsmutablestring so its failing because if distinct types you should do

1335511
post	get
if the business rule changed so that anyone who had rsvp d could edit the dinner you d have to change both get and post methods and the view and the get and post methods and view for the delete operation too although that s technically a seperate business rule

1335576
perforce	svn
by the way i ve been in each of these 3 situations and used both svn and perforce

1335630

groupbox	panel
i changed the background color of the panel to red and the background color of the groupbox to transparent and those ares of the groupbox are properly transparent

1335876
pop-up	dialog
if the error requires some sort of output logging pop-up a dialog write message to stdout i let it pass down to some centralized point at which point it is caught and distributed to the appropriate output mechanisms

1335916
inherited	subclassing
but the second - and maybe more important - is that inherited requires you to understand the workings of not only the parent class but all of the ancestor classes which makes extension harder but also more brittle because a change in the parent class implementation could easily break the subclassing

1335920
client-side	server-side
you need to mark the property secure for it to pass from the client-side installuisequence to server-side installexecutesequence

1335972
pascal	delphi
the first use of properties was as far as i know in delphi object pascal 1994

1336003
cvs	rcs
i m not certain of the exact reason but one possible influence may have been the versioning imposed by code repository systems such as rcs cvs - which of course find the numbers much easier to manipulate than strings

1336041
postgresql	mysql
i ve been working with postgresql firebird oracle mysql mssql more than 6 years ago and my preferred are firebird and postgresql

1336130
width	height
therefore a more feasible approach would be to load the wiki page into an iframe and then using javascript code to modify the properties of the controls you want to hide by either setting their visibility to hidden or their width height to 0

1336151
merb	ruby-on-rails
my solution was to run the cucumber script directly without rake but this can require a some configuration in ruby-on-rails with merb it works out f the box

1336177
for-loop	loops
since we re changing data within the loops the current implementation needs a for-loop to prevent the exception

1336184
cobertura	emma	emma	jdepend
there are plugins for many of the major reporting tools such as cobertura emma junit jdepend etc

1336269
textinput	textfield
the textinput does not use keyboardevent textevent for text input it uses internal flash textfield objects that interact with the flash player keyboard

1336271
distance	altitude
the mean square distance between the altitude of the surface at the sample point and the actual measured altitude at that point

1336278
cpython	ironpython
this would probably be easier to implement in c++ c# or ironpython than in c or cpython directly since they provide very easy high-level synchronization tools for handling the threading issues especially when using .net

1336320
ilist	iqueryable
the only issue is that now my service isn t returning ilist but instead iqueryable

1336335
boyer-moore	knuth-morris-pratt
optimal algorithms include knuth-morris-pratt and boyer-moore and a few more complex ones

using converters which are dead-simple to write you can bind boolean to visibility settings strings to images int to background colors and so on

1336460
draggable	droppable
i m using jquery s sortable not draggable or droppable and i was wondering how i could highlight the potential drop areas using css that a user has when the user has begun sorting

1336481
width	height
validate the minimum width and height of those images in flex or if they have to

1336507
valgrind	gprof
you should use a tool like qprof valgrind or gprof to profile your code and see where the most execution time is being spent

1336509
stdout	fflush
after all printf calls use fflush stdout

1336513
public	protected
so if you have any protected public variable declared inside partial code behind class and you populate that variable with some value in page_load and if you wants to print on .aspx page using variablename it should print the value which is assigned in page_load on web page

1336534
width	height
assuming you re talking about client-side validation you could always load the image to an object in flex and test the width and height of the loaded image object manually

1336534
client-side	server-side
however this should be done in addition to server-side checking if this limit is important as client-side checks can be circumvented by crafty users

1336546
versioning	upgrade
.net framework 1.0 service pack 3 â message box â net framework 1.0 sp 3 â the upgrade patch cannot be installed by windows installer service because the program to be upgrade may be missing or the upgrade may update a different versioning of the program

1336604
rss	feed

min	max
calculate the min and max x and y from the above points

1336826
vmware	virtualbox
the vpc images are intended for use in virtual pc and can also be made to work in virtualbox or vmware workstation since each of those can import vpc images

1336845
qtreeview	qabstractitemview
i ve a simple question regarding the update of a qtreeview or any subclass of qabstractitemview when a model object changes externally

1336879
opera	firefox
note this only happens in firefox and opera

1336880
many-to-many	one-to-many
at the moment datamapper can use strategic eager loading sel for one-to-many relationships but not many-to-many where n+1 queries occur

1336884
hash	md5
assuming that a collision between two md5 hash is p 2 -128 this gives an expected number of 2 -59 for the number of collisions

1336884
hash	md5
hence even the probability that the md5 hash collides for two inputs is already very small

1336905
portrait	landscape
in other words since you can t rotate the screen on these netbooks if you display a portrait mode image on landscape mode screen there will be large blank rectangles on either side of the image

1337030
min	max
anywhere the arc intersects an axis will be a max or a min

1337030
min	max
find the max and min of those coordinates to draw the rectangle

1337085
portrait	landscape
in terms of image resources within the application such as is the case with background images it is a common practice to have different image set for landscape and portrait mode or even different screen sizes

1337085
portrait	landscape
it will adapt the video frame height to landscape mode and it will play the video in the landscape mode whether or not a portrait mode is more suitable

1337124
accessor	properties
a properties access is an implicit accessor message so this both retains the array or copies it once you correct the properties as i suggested above and posts kvo notifications

1337125
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller visible at the same time

1337142
cos	sin
the thread here mentioned in another answer gives the parameterization formula for a 3d circle p r cos t u + r sin t nxu + c where u is a unit vector from the centre of the circle to any point on the circumference

1337210
cpu	processors
i have watched the cpu time graph in task manager on my machine and one other and neither of them is using a significant amount of the processors more than 10 while these programs run

1337265
profiling	instrumentation
if you don t have access to a profiling you can add timing instrumentation to various phases of your program to see which phase is taking longer

1337283
width	height
the size is 225 52 width height

1337291
vb.net	vb6
the other way round vb.net to c# could be harder because people might be used to making use of the my namespace and other things put in there to make vb6 developers feel at home

1337293
rpm	yum
there s a red hat rpm package for tomcat 6 - just yum install tomcat6 and it will put everything in the right place for you and fix up the security by running tomcat as a dedicated user not to mention taking care of updates and patches by putting tomcat into the rpm repository

1337315
stdout	stderr
have you thought about redirecting stdout and stderr to a file ex

1337317
ifs	dash
the maintainers of dash maintain that ifs is not supposed to interpret escape sequences see for instance here

1337328
width	height
i want to create a textblock or some other element with text in it for display only that is vertical -90 transform angle but i want that element to fill up the vertical space it is contained in but have a defined horizontal amount i m using vertical and horizontal terms instead of height and width since it s swapped when i have the textblock go vertical and have it aligned to the left side of the container

1337343
width	height
to height 80 width 90

1337343
width	height
note the only attributes i m trying to change for this particular script are height width and border because our client utilizes a tool that automatically applies styles to elements that they drag around with a wysiwyg-style editor

1337343
width	height
obviously using a regex to strip these out of a lot of places works fairly well as you just let the table cells be sized by their content which looks okay but i figured a quicker way to deal with the issue would just be to replace those three attributes with width height and border attributes which behave mostly the same as their css counterparts excepting that css allows you to actually customize the width color and style of the border but all they ever use is solid 1px so i can add a condition to replace solid 1px with border 1

1337343
width	height
this one only replaces width and height the border attribute we re scrapping for now

1337354
interpreted-language	compiled-language
c# is not an interpreted-language it s a jitted just-in-time compiled-language which means it s compiled from msil at runtime

1337357
ant	maven
note that if they don t use maven they might use ant ivy for the dependency resolving

1337392
udp	tcp
i would like to enumerate the process tcp and udp sockets and see how much data they transferred during a given period

1337404
put	get
i would like to get the out put of a stored proc call and create a permanent table with out specifying columns

google-chrome	safari
iex google-chrome on windows ff3x safari 4x on mac are rendering fine

1337480
maven	pom.xml
note it is now generally considered good practice to version all your plugins from maven 2.1 onwards the common plugins are now versioned in the super pom.xml

1337510
width	height
meta name viewport content width device-width height device-height

1337510
width	height
width and height these specify the width and height that the viewport should be set at for this web page

1337510
width	height
the values can be set in pixels or you can use the device-width and device-height values respectively to specify that the width and height should be set as the full width and height of the deviceâ s screen

1337510
width	height
the default value of height is calculated from the width of the device and its aspect ratio and it can be set from 223 to 10 000 pixels

1337510
width	height
it is recommended that width and height values are not hardcoded for a single device such as the iphone

1337566
post	get
also always try to post links to your site on other websites to gain visibility and get importance for crawlers

1337622
width	height
within a line you can bind the width or height depending on which way you are drawing the line to that of the parent container to achieve what you want

1337630
min	max
problem is how do i get the aggregate min max avg sum values for those â œgroupedâ counts

1337634
stdout	stderr
altering the encoding via the -d switch is going to affect all your default encoding mechanisms including redirected stdout stdin stderr

1337643
min	max
for min and max you can order by and fetch the first row

1337664
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
i think you want a concrete item superclass since it will likely have common fields ie title copyright_date publisher etc and subclassing for each subtype and further sub-sub-classes if you like ie from toy to actionfigure with number_of_joints field using multi-table inherited

1337665
folder	directory
edit i just turned on the ability for the images directory to be listed browsed to it and i was able to see all the previous images that were in the folder but not the new one

1337761
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
cfpreferences seems to have most of the same issues as nsuserdefaults

1337786
websphere	ibm
after some trying i was able to get this up and running on eclipse ganymede on mac os x 10.5.6 using glassfish but i m still having no luck with ibm websphere and application server toolkit an eclipse derivative on windows xp

1337871
inherited	subclassing
joined table inherited enables you to have foreign keys to subclassing enforced by the database it s a lot simpler to have non-null constraints for subclassing fields

1337882
subtract	add
the subi instruction sets c carry and h half-carry cpu flags for use with subsequent instructions there is no addi in 8-bit avr btw so to add an immediate value of x we subtract -x from it whereas inc does not

1337893
stdout	fflush
typically stdout is line buffered so you ll need to call fflush stdout --

1337897
firefox	safari
i m looking at the xhr requests in the debugger in safari and firebug in firefox

1337959
kerberos	ntlm
you do an ntlm kerberos negotiate sspi exchange loop

1337971
vbo	normals
for opengl es on the iphone apple recommends that you place all of the vertices that you can draw at one time in a vertex buffer object vbo and that you interleave the vertex normals color and texture information within that buffer in that order

1338007
profiling	debugging
great if you want to analyse a program in some way ie for debugging or profiling purposes

1338026
for-loop	loops
im not sure what you are trying to accomplish with the for while loops but here is an example of a basic for-loop that creates a bunch of loader variables

1338044
getter	setter
you can call methods on this within the constructor and property setter getter are just syntactic sugar for method calls

1338075
folder	directory
i have the same config file in multiple different directory in my development folder

1338089
x86	64bit
the x86 fpu uses 80 bits for its internal registers but values in memory are stored as 64bit doubles

1338116
udp	tcp
for ethernet assuming the 5000 byte payload is not encapsulated in an ip + tcp udp frame you will have 18 bytes of overhead for every packet sent

1338151
rss	feed
inspecting the feed contents shows the pubdata element nicely displayed no issues with the rss or the element contents

1338169
floating-point	fractions
then the comparison compares the 80-bit sum to a 64-bit sum and they re different primarily because the fractions part 0.3 cannot be represented exactly using a binary floating-point number so you are comparing a repeating decimal actually repeating binary that has been truncated to two different lengths

1338293
stdout	stderr
one cheesy but effective way to capture all script output stdout stderr verbose warning debug is to use another host like cmd.exe

1338303
autofac	castle-windsor
you don t have to have the empty constructor if you setup a custom controllerfactory to use a dependency injection framework like ninject autofac castle-windsor and etc

1338387
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried the site with most of the main browsers - firefox 3 3.5 ie 6 8 safari and google-chrome and all appears well to me

1338412
gridview	sqldatasource
i have an asp.net gridview that is originally bound to a sqldatasource control but when the user presses an external button it instead gets the contents of a datatable rather than a sqldatasource control

1338441
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
your example renders the same for me in ie firefox opera google-chrome and safari

1338451
post	get
you might want to pursue that thread of discussion to see if you can get any information from jon or if nate received any information but based on his post today sounds like he didn t get any further

1338524
stdout	stderr
add for each context so stdout stderr will go to your own log

1338597
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries

1338606
try-catch	exception-handling
it s a hunch but if you re assigning the value of img2 inside a try-catch block you might be hitting an exception-handling that prevents the assignment from taking place

listview	gridview
in my view i have a listview gridview with itemssource bound to a datatable

1338853
hide	show
try un hidding it so you tell it to hide it hide but then you tell it to not hide it i dont know if it re show it if you set this to no but it looks like it isnt either that or u are telling it to not hide when the view controller you want the bar in has been pushed already and it does not un hide the bar until the next view controller has been pushed so you should try to set it as unhidden youself

1339028
submit	submission
i believe you re only allowed to submit just one at a time - this might be a bad practice but how about basically duplicating each forms code and replicating it in an iframe submission the form there either that or relying on xhr .post to mimic what the forms would do

1339077
superclass	subclassing
and then using that subclassing as the superclass of the view controller that you want to show the bottom bar

then you could speed up your compareto by first comparing each string s rank fast int based comparison and then only performing a full string compare if the ranks were equals

1339967
children	parent
every depth level has its own cd entity with parent children isleaf properties

1340014
profiler	hprof
--openfile open file specified by file can be application snapshot netbeans profiler snapshot or hprof heap dump

1340066
valgrind	gprof
gprof would be the obvious choice if you are using gcc and i suppose valgrind should work too

1340069
button	checkbox
i have a listview bound to a datasource each row has a checkbox control on it what i want to acheive is when i press a button i want to check through all of the checkbox in the listview and check if any of them have been ticked

1340069

what i tried first was to add a onclick event to a button and loop around the listview.items and check the checked state of the checkbox control however this always returned false even if they have ticked the item

1340072
sorting	grouping
you have one sorting pass o n lg n and then a second pass where o lg n comparisons are performed for each grouping so this is done at most n times also yielding o n lg n

1340088
profiler	yourkit
alternatively any java profiler should work yourkit as you ve already mentioned

1340088
profiler	visualvm
visualvm has been bundled with the jdk since 1.6.0_10 and it is based on the netbeans profiler

1340207
nunit	mstest
if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest

clicks on a link button checkbox or

1340217
button	checkbox
clicks on a link button checkbox or

1340253
hide	show
now i need to show tooltips when button is pressed and hide tooltips for example when 3 seconds has passed

1340269
client-side	server-side
you probably heard that client-side validation can be circumvented so there is still a need for server-side checking

1340281
folder	directory
a sure shot workaround is to navigate to the jre installation directory c program files java navigate to the bin folder from command prompt and then run java -version

1340372
x86	64bit
also bear in mind that many programs exist in the c program files x86 folder on 64bit versions of windows

1340491
gridview	onclientclick
i put a button outside of the gridview with an onclientclick event

1340553
width	height
the problem with this approach is that you either have to pick a titlebar width and stick with it and not respond to global theme adjustments that change the titlebar height or you have to take many different bmp snapshots at different sizes

1340598
hash	hmac
one method you could look into is one which many including some amazon web services and the likes of ebay i think which is hmac hash message authentication code

1340656
int	chars	int	double
for c objective-c you have the basic datatypes you would expect int float double chars

1340669
nfa	dfa
the nfa dfa part comes into play in the implementation of the accept method

1340671
integer	fractions
distinguish the integer and fractions

1340694
portrait	landscape
if you have a portrait layout res layout gallery.xml you can create a landscape equivalent in res layout-land gallery.xml and android will automatically load the latter layout file if the activity is launched in landscape mode

1340724
folder	directory
go to the bin debug directory folder and right click on the directory

1340796
inherited	properties
update luke is correct that the concrete implementation will need to specify that properties is an override otherwise you ll get a does not implement inherited abstract member error

1340806
unsigned	short
unsigned short

1340853
superclass	subclassing
when you do that kind of refactoring you don t lose any coverage on the account of having only one of your subclassing tested for its superclass behavior

1340853
superclass	subclassing
therefore i m of the opinion that it s generally ok to test just one of your subclassing in order to test a superclass behavior

1340923
public	protected
i searched on the forum internet for the solution how a propetryinfo object of a public property can reveal if it has a private protected setter .

1340934

personally i create a tests folder in my source directory and try to more or less mirror my main source code hierarchy with unit test equivalents having 1 module 1 unit test module as a rule of thumb

1341034
apache	lighttpd
if you have freedom to switch from apache to lighttpd then the most straightforward solution would be to use mod_secdownload which would do exactly what you want that is provide application authentication while serving the actual files via web server

1341041
jdom	xerces
there s nothing wrong with the jdom api but i don t like having to include xerces with my deployments

1341065
post	get
a post to your save action and the rendering of the resulting view isn t fundamentally different than a get to your recent comments page - and if querying from a database is okay on the comments page then it should be okay on the save in my opinion

1341079
put	get
i have inherited a web application and when trying when trying to put it on the same server on a different ip and iis site i get a page full of stuff like this in all browsers

1341082
jdom	xom
the best lightweight alternative is in my opinion xom but jdom is still a very good api and i see no reason to replace it

1341107
mouse	keyboard
here is a codeproject sample that demonstrates how to set up global mouse and keyboard hooks in c#

1341168
set	bag
final note you might need more permission to set the property bag value to spweb

1341236
set	bag
i m inclined to go with what s easiest until you identify that performance is an issue in which case i would set a flag on the list s rootfolder s property bag

1341262
accessor	properties
once you have the propertyinfo for the properties you can call its getsetmethod function to return the methodinfo for the set accessor

1341262
accessor	properties
you can then check the methodinfo s ispublic properties to see if the set accessor is public

1341269
solaris	bsd	solaris	irix	solaris	aix	bsd	aix	irix	linux
no matter if you re working with aix solaris irix bsd or linux if there s a compiler installed there s also make

1341316
width	height
to be more precise on this the scene s width and height are declared as public-init

1341316
width	height
the stage s width and height are declared as public meaning they can be updated

1341343
gridview	objectdatasource
you can use objectdatasource - to wrap call selectforgrid also you can direct bind list to your gridview

1341345
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
but if i hit .read again i start at 6 and not where the bufferedreader stopped so if 3 is a line break and i told the bufferedreader to print the first line it prints 1-2 and then using .read from the fileinputstream gives me 6 and not 3.

1341403
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
if your users use only opera 9.5+ safari 3+ internet explorer 9+ and firefox 3.6+ then the answer is yes

1341425
affinity	processors
you can query the processors affinity with getprocessaffinitymask

1341425
affinity	processors
if you haven t set processors affinity i m unsure how useful the result will be though as the thread can flit between processors

1341426
super	implements
there s also a myriad of ways you could either call this via ajax or web-service from the parent blog or implements a memcache solution so that this data can be centrally stored and managed if this becomes an issue but i think if you use the object cache here with something like wp super cache on the front end you should be fine

1341462
firefox	safari	webkit	gecko	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
mozilla firefox 4.0+ gecko 2.0+ microsoft internet explorer 9.0+ opera 10.0+ safari 4.1+ webkit 532 and google-chrome 3.0+

1341465
rss	feed
that runs in the loop for every item in the rss feed

1341470
affinity	processors
as others have said you can use getprocessaffinitymask or getthreadidealprocessor but those will only work if you ve already set an affinity mask or ideal processors for the thread

1341478
firefox	safari
ie firefox safari etc.

1341494
post	get
if i can get some specific error messages i will post them here for further clarification

interbase	firebird
since long time they are using multigenerational records as firebird before interbase before groton databases did since the begining

1341539
pop-up	dialog
there is a point in time though that my tool really needs to know what the dialog result is from when a user responds to a message dialog box that pop-up once tfs or team foundation server is done doing a merge

1341540
getter	setter
and instead of your implementation of the setter and getter let the system synthesize them for you

meaning it must be x86 on a 32-bit os or x64 on a 64bit os

1341776

and here i am stuck with the maven site plugin version coming from the super pom.xml ie

1341801
super	self
cocoa-dev self super init debate

1341801
super	self
if you didn t assign the return value of super s initializer into self then you could potentially be dealing with a partially initialized object because the object that super initialized isn t the same object that you re initializing

1341822
put	get
- get pyparsing.py from here and put it in your app engine app s directory

1341825
gridview	repeater

fadein	fadeout
you may have to do something equivalent from the fadeout fadein

1341984
cvs	svn
btw i have seen miscellaneous issues with not only eclipse svn plugin support i wish the svn plugins were half as good as eclipse cvs support but with the command line subversion tools sometimes

1341992
postgresql	mysql
try mysql or postgresql instead

1342011
sorting	grouping
due to some complicated reason with paging sorting and multilevel grouping behavior i cannot achieve appropriate paging behavior with this query

1342026
pop-up	dialog
when the checkin modal dialog pop-up even though it shows your entire list of pending changes by default only items that are currently in the solution will be checked

1342100
iboutlet	ibaction
if it s not and it s a uibutton event you are trying to listen to chances are you wired something up incorrectly with your iboutlet and ibaction

1342112
mouseleave	mouseenter
the others blur focus mouseenter mouseleave change submit are all events which don t bubble therefore they can t be used with live

1342130
for-loop	loops
i need to make a for-loop and between every loops wait 2 seconds and continue

1342142
put	get	post	put	post	get
by rest style that means using http get put delete post instead of sql dml and for returning results it uses json and atom pub an xml format kind-of similar to rss instead of a binary result structure and protocol like microsoft sql servers tds the protocol used for sending tables back to clients

1342152
validationsummary	customvalidator
i have added validationgroup to my validationsummary customvalidator textbox and button but still the validation summary updates for the button click but not the textbox onblur event

i need to get the full text of the request in this case it s a post request so the url doesn t help

1342221
struts	wicket
in order to make better suggestions about particular frameworks though you could certainly build most webapps on any given framework some are slanted more heavily in one direction than another struts and wicket have a pretty different focus

1342238
width	height
the width and height are exactly the same as the jpg image

1342249
jsf	seam
if you liked jsf and want to use it i would recommend the use of seam

1342249
jsf	seam
you can also use spring but i think that using seam makes the use of jsf much easier

1342268
hash	md5
the way i have always done it is to concat the user agent and ip address into an md5 hash in some cases this will allow people from the same ip to vote long as they are using different browsers and store that as a fingerprint for the vote the the database and add a unique key to it

1342315
width	height
you could then have them scale a slider or something similar to meet the width or height of that object

1342315
width	height
by holding a credit card something with a relatively known height and width up to the screen you can easily determine the ratio of pixels to inches and use that to your hearts content

1342337
config	ini
if you re talking about jparameter which is the default class for handling config presented in the ini or xml files you ll find the api docs helpful

1342361
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately the default debian ubuntu installation initializes the system-wide packages for cedet and ecb before my .emacs file is called and the 1.0pre6 files i then try to load throw errors trying to use symbols not defined in 1.0pre4

1342415
entities	entitymanager
added clear method to entitymanager interface to allow entities to be evicted from the persistence context

1342465
post	get
if you post information on the internet someone can get it it s just a matter of how many resources they want to invest

1342524
validationsummary	customvalidator
you also need set validationgroup somegroupname for customvalidator validationsummary control and also the control which is causing postback

1342546
hide	show
i want to change the toggle function so that it changes the text of the link to say show hide or expand collapse

1342546

1342618
prepare	execute
abstract out the database prepare execute etc

1342658
google-chrome	firefox
the div has an onclick call to a javascript function that changes the color of the div inside the label and also checks the checkbox for some reason ie and firefox didn t want to check it correctly google-chrome worked fine

1342658
google-chrome	firefox
ok so using this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie 7 haven t tested other versions yet it will only check the checkbox if you click the image inside the div

1342663
width	height
i receive error messages when attempting to encode files in expression encoder when the file width or height is not a multiple of four or is smaller than 64

1342714

1342750
lan	intranet
ok if the user was on the same lan say in a company intranet for example this could be determined by having the ip address and using command line tools like arp

1342756
free	malloc
when you do malloc since malloc guarantees that it returns a continuos block of memory the crt will try to find 1 gb of continuos free memory which may not be avaiable hence the malloc fails

1342871
pop-up	dialog	opera	firefox
when i attempt to navigate to the service in firefox or opera the basic authentication dialog pop-up and i enter credentials

1342892
width	height
1 garbage poller looks for background containers that are 2 times the stage width or height away from the player s x or y coord respectively

1342899
division	subtraction
since threshold 25.0 note the decimal point it s a float so the subtraction and division will all work as long as you re not using uints

1342900
width	height
i have .las lidar data file now i wanted to know the size of it for example how long it s width and height in kilometers

1342945
implements	extends
it woudln t have been my first choice to implements it this way but given what s there i want to extends it to cover .js too instead of including another different redirection rewrite method iis redirection configuration a rewrite module etc. which may complicate deployments and testing of the app especially on iis6

1343027
mouse	keyboard
some other sql tools have shorcuts that run the query that is under the cursor which keeps the hands on the keyboard and away from the mouse

1343046
for-loop	loops
i m reading about stl algorithms and the book pointed out that algorithms like find use a while loops rather than a for-loop because it is minimal efficient and uses one less variable

1343046
for-loop	loops
the while loops consistently reports taking around .78 seconds and the for-loop reports .67 seconds

1343100
vim	emacs
if there is a shortcut to recover this file in emacs i will switch to emacs from vim

1343110
inline	inlining
as a rule of thumb if inlining this method improves performance the jit will inline this method

1343211
put	get
in short they get both put on the stack at the same time you execute your main

1343229
folder	directory
set your iis application to windows authentication right click the app folder in iis select properties directory security tab

1343270

also if your application gets a lot of use and needs a serious database you can always upgrade to the regular versioning of sql server

1343311
button	marquee
while this is running i will have a marquee progress bar and would like to disable all button

1343321
accessor	properties
note that unless you add a properties for your tableview you won t call self because there is no accessor

1343328
stdout	stderr
2 you will probably need to call getstdhandle to get stdout stderr

1343346
width	height
given a square described by x y width height and an angle in radians i need to calculate a vector that originates at the squares centre and terminates at the point that collides with the edge of the square at the given angle

1343392
width	height
given the square s width and height you can then determine the center of the square x+.5w y+.5h

1343409
width	height
i also want to set the height and width of the button but i imagine the method for doing this will be the same as for setting the caption

1343428
width	height
it even does not crash if width or height are zeros

1343471
stdout	stderr
i have a bash script that simply calls different calls and redirect stdout and stderr outputs to different files

rdf	owl
look into rdf and owl you might find some c libs to handle data in those formats which i think is more adequate than trying to fit graphs into a relational database

1344432
ienumerable	iqueryable
i only tested it with ienumerable so i don t know for sure that it ll work properly with iqueryable

for-loop	loops
how could i write a for-loop to go from 1 to 10 and then use loops var as part of the line that updates the image

1344460

i have an index view of the children table inner join d to the parent table note i m only indexing some of the fields from either table .

1344672
mouse	keyboard
so if you want to write a program that runs without an os your program will have to replicate at least some features of an os taking over from the bios during the boot process initializing devices communicating with the disk controller to load code and data communicating with the display controller to show information to the user communicating with the keyboard controller and the mouse controller to read user input etc etc etc

1344688
hash	salt
still it s preferably to hash your passwords with salt

1344691

i would guess that the command pragma table_info probably can t be execute directly as a prepare statement

1344762
hex	binary
use hexdump or a hex editor to view a binary in hexadecimal bytes

1344772
uicontrol	uibutton
this method is on uicontrol which uibutton inherits from which is why you might have overlooked it at first glance.

1344812
mouse	keyboard
an operating system includes all sorts of functions for doing this -- disk i o screen output keyboard and mouse input networking etc. so forth and so on

1344870
free	malloc
if it happens to fall to zero -- which it might not for a variety of reasons -- then the objective-c runtime will invoke the method -dealloc which will then invoke -release on all of the object type instance variables and free on malloc d memory if any

1344912
memcpy	malloc
some many provide full blow c c++ libraries so that you can call functions like memcpy and sometimes even malloc and printf

gif	png
i am creating a webpage and i am trying to put a png buttons over gif files

1345210
gif	png
when the page renders it makes the png file appear after or under the gif file

1345220
gif	png
use the background-image css attribute on a block-level element etc. for the background gif then place the png buttons inside that block element

1345234
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the mutable types are classes which can be changed after they ve been initialized like nsmutablestring vs nsstring

1345236
gif	png
first set the gif image as a background to the cell and place the png button in the cell and position it inside the cell

1345278
folder	directory
all ideas i ve seen to perform such a check involve iterating over the entire directory and counting every folder

1345290
post	get
i posted this question on another site but didn t get an answer i ll post it here

1345312
min	max
you could use the max and min functions

1345324
minimum	max	min	max
you can use the max min functions as they will return an array containing the maximum minimum of each index

1345326
min	max
get the first element assing the count to both min and max

1345326
min	max
iterate over the rest compare count to each min and max if smaller larger assign the new count value

1345340
concave	convex
what you need to do is to define an indexing vocabulary for each face of a jigsaw puzzle such that the index of a right-facing edge can can tell you what the index of a corresponding left-facing edge is e.g a simple vocabulary convex and concave with convex on a face implying concave on a matching opposite face and then classify each piece according to the indexing vocabulary

1345340
concave	convex
for instance you may have flat edge straight-edge-leans-left straight-edge-leans-right concave convex knob knob-hole ...

1345400
post	get
counter-intuitively on any post dx8 hardware ie any dx9 or 10 hardware you ll find that the use of this post transform cache and extra simplicity of triangle lists means that you ll actrually get better performance from a triangle list than a triangle strip

1345473
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
in firefox 3.5 ie 8 opera 9.64 safari when we click on the scrollbar the input field will not loose focus

1345528
min	max
in contrast to what others have posted you cannot use the min max functions for this problem as these functions do not understand the datastructure array which are passed in

1345528
min	max
the reason why the use of min and max seem to yield the correct answer is related to type-casting arrays to integers which is an undefined behaviour

1345528
min	max
actually min and max do work with arrays but not in the way the op needs them to work

1345528
min	max
when using min and max with multiple arrays or an array of arrays elements are compared element by element from left to right

1345528
min	max
translated into the op s problem this shows the reason why the direct use of min and max seems to yield the correct result

1345528
min	max
the arrays first elements are the id -values therefore min and max will compare them first incidentally resulting in the correct result because the lowest id is the one with the lowest count and the highest id is the one with the highest count

1345630
maven	pom.xml
the second pom.xml will retrieve any packages required from the maven repository and invoke adt to compile them

1345652
hide	show
if i manually use show hide in conjunction with visible expression it ll work just fine

1345652
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried in firefox 3.5 ie 7 8 and google-chrome 4...all with the same results

1345660
google-chrome	firefox
i use the kohana framework it works fine in google-chrome and firefox but i just seems that ie8 keeps

1345691
ssl	https
both the credentials and the data in this session is transmitted via https ssl

1345753
getter	setter
i have seen member variables given a private modifier and then using getter setter methods just to set and get the values of the variable in the name of standardization

1345753
getter	setter
why not then make the variable public itself other than cases like spring framework which depends on getter setter for ioc etc

1345753
getter	setter
in c# i have seen getter setter with capitalization of the member variable

1345760
getter	setter
getter and setter are used to provide a defined interface to a classes

1345763
getter	setter
these are really just getter setter under the hood but with a more concise syntax

1345766
getter	setter
even back in 2003 it was known that getter and setter methods are evil

1345771
getter	setter
this is done so you can change the getter or setter implementation in your public api after you release it

1345772
tiff	bmp
this really depends on the extension - a bmp is totally different to a tiff or whatsoever.

1345789
getter	setter
it s part of encapsulation abstracting a class s interface the getter and setter from its implementation using an instance variable

1345793
post	get
i ve read here that loading a bitmap loses the alpha value but it post to a solution which is for another file type and i don t understand enough of the example to get it working with the png

1345805
listview	gridview
i have a gridview in a listview contained in a scrollviewer element

1345842
pull	push
an alternative is to switch to using the stax parser see pull vs push

1345859
addclass	removeclass
also the addclass removeclass stuff in the tabs.js file doesn t scale too well

1345861
getter	setter
the most and foremost use for getter and setter in java is to annoy the developers

1345861
getter	setter
the define if you ll have a getter or setter generated for you

1345861
getter	setter
so the only solution was to force people to write all the getter and setter manually

1345865
getter	setter
getter and setter may very well be the greatest lie ever told

1345865
getter	setter
new programmers should be taught proper encapsulation not to write dumb data carrier classes that contain nothing but getter and setter

1345865
getter	setter
the idea that you need getter and setter to future-proof your code if you want to change the implementation later on is an obvious case of yagni

1345869
int	chars
as you say you re capable i m sure you ve seen the tables you need are the eav_ tables for you chars and int etc etc

1345876
getter	setter
when the developer believes that encapsulating stuff really just means getter setter rather than encapsulating behavour

1345876
getter	setter
the valid reasons for having getter setter are

1345876
getter	setter
by using a getter setter rather than direct access to the variable means that you can do some pre-processing on said variable first such as validate it is with a set range or change the underlying implementation switching from an int to a biginteger without changing the public api

1345879
getter	setter
hence to access a field through an interface you need to have the getter and setter

1345892
post	get
after having done some more looking around and have chatted a bit in irc it seems that what i should do to keep the get parameter away from users containing payment info is to send them as post instead

1345932
jdom	dom4j
i find dom4j to come out on top of anything else i ve used especially jdom which i find to have a particularly poor api

1345967
min	max
if so using min or max together with group by is the simplest and most efficient solution

1345974
getter	setter
in the case in question there is no need for getter and setter if the value is simply read or written

1345985
libjpeg	libpng
luckily for most formats you can find libraries that do it for you like libpng or libjpeg

1346123
interbase	firebird
the application used to connect to an interbase 6.x database using dbexpress but the new version needs to connect to a firebird 2.x superserver

1346139
for-loop	loops
if you need to iterate the table then you can either use a for-loop or a foreach loops like

1346161
keydown	keyup
to capture function keys reliably across all modern browsers you ll have to look at using keydown and keyup events

1346188
pull	push
there are two kinds of streaming api - push and pull

1346188
jdom	xom
there are several more convenient dom-like apis such as xom my favourite for the same reasons that adam batkin gives above or jdom

1346196
pull	push
plus you will need your own ssh and httpd for your user to push pull to from that server

1346196
pull	push
git itself didn t include smart http which meant the only protocol with authentication for pull clone and push operations was ssh convincing users to generate and manage public private keys is.

1346196
gitolite	gitosis
authorization layers was clunky gitosis and gitolite was barely starting

1346198
mouse	keyboard
after uninstalling resharper 4.5 from vs2008 the normal code editor context-menu mouse right click doesn t work the way to let it work just one time is to let it appear by click the keyboard key near the altgr key and the clicking again the mouse right button

1346296
keydown	keyup
unfortunately depending on how the browser interprets the function keys it may require preventing keydown and keyup events being raised for that particular key in addition to the behaviour here

1346364
min	max
and of course set min and max of scrollbar to 0 image.width .height

1346394
direct3d	directx
i m absolutely new to directx and i d like to draw some untransformed primitives with the most basic direct3d configuration for learning purposes

1346436
put	get
however if we put a custom constraint in to stop this happening using regular expressions we get a 200 and an empty response rather than the expected 404

1346466
kerberos	ntlm
if your other web application uses windows integrated authentication ntlm or kerberos authentication or even basic authentication then it can act the same way

1346517
put	get	for-loop	loops
so what i ve just decided to do is put it in a for-loop and once there are the right amount of files that have been downloaded onto my hard drive then i ll get myself out of loops

1346518
min	max
in my experience swing components respond better to preferred size than min and max size

1346549
equals	compareto
in the .net framework version 2.0 this method uses the equals and compareto methods of the array to determine whether the object specified by the value parameter exists

1346549
equals	compareto
in the earlier versions of the .net framework this determination was made by using the equals and compareto methods of the value object itself

1346568
implements	extends
for example there is a possibility that author of the parent class that i m extends will decide to implements some side-effect in the method that i m overriding and without that side-effect the state of the object will be incorrect

1346578
disk	ram
i would like to monitor cpu disk ram network.

1346578
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
it would be great to have a library to monitor not only linux but even freebsd windows solaris and mac

1346604
int	chars
in short order i came across the integral types table which listed sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong and chars

1346616
google-chrome	firefox
- so you can target firefox v2 firefox2 firefox v3 firefox3 google-chrome google-chrome etc

1346621
yacc	bison
if you are using c try f lex and yacc bison

1346702
websphere	ibm
typically these would be provided by an application-server vendor ibm websphere or jboss

1346748
gina	winlogon
but you need to implement your own gina dll which is loaded by winlogon

1346794
hide	show
i ve never been a fan of toggle in jquery and would only ever consider using it to hide show itself

1346794
hide	show
even then i just use standard hide and show methods

1346794
fadein	fadeout
i changed your toggle calls to a fadein fadeout and closed off the function calls with semi colons

1346802
rss	feed
with some basic rss feed stuff thrown in

1346820
vim	emacs
a number of people at the company i currently intern at prefer emacs or vim

1346836
vb6	vba
basically vba in access is mostly vb6 but with sufficient differences to drive one slightly mad.

1346838
vim	emacs
the efficiency provided from vim emacs is mostly afforded by their heavy keyboard use

1346838
mouse	keyboard
in these programs you can do most anything directly from the keyboard rather than having to stop and use the mouse

1346855
inherited	properties
it s a hassle having to inherited of every type of control i want to specify custom properties for not to mention overriding shadowing the properties and setting the defaultvalue attribute

1346856
vim	emacs
i d say the actual vim emacs editors are far superior to the eclipse text editor in terms of the shortcuts they offer

1346909
put	get	post	put	post	get
for example if your rest api has a resource named mailboxes which supports get post put and delete and accepts and returns representations of type application json you could model the resource and its methods by creating the following soap methods

1346917
vim	emacs
vim emacs

1346955
children	parent
i have 2 types of objects parent and children

1346955
children	parent
there are 2 types of parent parenta parentb and there are 2 types of children childa childb

1346955
children	parent
each parent has a collection of children

1346955
children	parent
type a parent can only have type a children and type b parent can only have typeb children

1346969
getter	setter	inherited	properties
the trap class inherited from movevariables many getter setter functions structured as properties

1346976
client-side	server-side
you are mixing client and server-side code -- the code you wrote seems like you re expecting a javascript function on the client-side to magically set a php variable on the server-side when in reality that type of operation is not possible

1347024
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works in firefox ie 8 and google-chrome

1347082
folder	directory
2 to get a list of all the system directory issue the command reg query hkey_local_machine software microsoft windows currentversion explorer shell folder and read the lines

1347124
draggable	droppable
for example i have two list of members in two divs i want them to be draggable n droppable in across the divs

1347127
post	put
some time ago i put my thoughts on skill matrices in a couple of blog post

1347156
post	get
you don t get anything preformatted like from wp_get_archives just the list of post but you get the post by author

1347192
jobs	cron
is there any danger in scheduling and deleting cron jobs from php

1347196
ienumerable	ilist
an ienumerable is just an interface for an iterator design pattern whereas list ilist is a data container

1347215
jobs	cron
i would suggest that you do not add or delete cron jobs using php

1347218
draggable	droppable
you can make the container divs droppable and the list element divs draggable

1347250
client-side	server-side
there might be some client-side javascript but it doesn t compare to the amount of work done server-side

1347306
post	get
i m still going to try and get this working and i ll post back with update- but if we can t get this going soon we re going to have to drop amazon

1347387
rss	feed
this is example code puts your rss feed into a collection of syndication items

styles applied to parent elements also apply to their children

1347462
margin	height
with a bottom margin height of the green div

1347508
int	chars
don t store them all in the same directory use some technique to put them on several dirs for instance you could use last two chars of a guid or last two digits of an int id and then store the path on db

1347573
rss	feed
rss feed for weather news etc

1347625
perforce	cvs
i use perforce at work having previously used cvs at my last job

1347625
perforce	cvs
it s probably easier to learn from scratch than cvs but i don t have experience that way. if someone needed a centralized source-control system i would recommend perforce as long as they had the resources to license it

1347625
bazaar	git
on the other hand i ve recently been looking at some distributed source-control systems git mercurial and bazaar specifically

1347646
postgresql	mysql
i get the following error when inserting data from mysql into postgresql

1347675
width	height
the width and height attributes distort the image -- as far as i can tell this is because they refer to whatever attributes the container may end up with which will be unrelated to the image

1347683
chown	mkdir
the functions you re asking about actually fall under several categories - file stream i o fopen fread etc. lower-level file descriptor i o open read etc. and filesystem directory manipulation chown mkdir etc.

1347687
ienumerable	iqueryable
if i have an ienumerable method called list what s the general best practice for an iqueryable

1347701
width	height
only set the width or height and it will scale the other automatically

1347711
x86	64bit
i m assuming you mean x86 and x86_64 here when you talk about 64bit

1347723
width	height
3 living with it and setting the width and height this although will make it look distorted but the right size will still result in the user having to download the full-sized image

1347760
interpreted-language	compiled-language
this is usually seen in dynamic interpreted-language but is less common in compiled-language

1347793
ant	maven
this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java

1347846
button	checkbox
i want the user to select the checkbox click the register button outside the gridview and have a title from the selected row displayed

1347846
button	checkbox
from what i ve read i should put the checkbox check in the button click event

1347850
webclient	webrequest
use the webclient class or the underlying webrequest based classes if you need to programmically make requests

1347863
gif	png
if your image is some sort of png gif on a solid background you may be able to do something like this

1348018
treemap	linkedhashmap
this makes it much easier to change implementations to a treemap or a linkedhashmap in the future

1348023
mouse	keyboard
this class is used to generate native system input events for the purposes of test automation self-running demos and other applications where control of the mouse and keyboard is needed.

1348077
addition	modulo	division	addition	division	modulo
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself

1348399
children	parent
i have a parent thread non-ui which creates some child threads to do some jobs these children are from a different class sounds odd but the code sample will illustrate it - at some point the parent must wait for certain tasks to be completed by the child thread - this does not mean the child is finished but only that it has reached a certain point and the parent can now continue processing .

1348458
udp	tcp
2 use udp instead of tcp

1348458

there seem to be efforts under way to come up with something similar to a wsdl for rest called web application description language wadl but i don t know how far that effort has come and as far as i know the wcf rest starter kit doesn t support any of that just yet

1348658
maven	pom.xml
however it s worth pointing out that the maven super pom.xml configures central to have snapshots disabled so maven shouldn t ever check for updates for snapshots on central unless you ve overridden that in your own pom.xml settings

1348903
free	malloc
it is not the c runtime that python links with so you shouldn t call the malloc free from msvcrt

1348911
int	double
i can see how the msdn article can be misleading they should have specified that while the result is an int in this case meaning whole number it is still of type double

1348917
int	double
don t cast the original double as an int because the rules for floor are different iirc for negative numbers

1348958
int	double
the range of double is much wider than the range of int or long

1349339
rss	feed
there are rss feed and atom feed so i will assume you are talking about one of those

1349393
uitableview	uipickerview
you can use the built-in uitableview with a uinavigationcontroller to create a hierarchy of screens so your users can drill down from say a list of players to the player s stats then perhaps a detail view or a uitextview or a uipickerview to change those stats

1349413
versioning	upgrade
the only downside unfortunately there s no good way around it at the moment is that if you upgrade django you ll have to be on the lookout for any changes to that index.html file and copy those changes over into your versioning as well

1349443
inherited	properties
you class that contains dependency properties must inherited from dependencyobject

1349549
rss	feed
ok i m assuming you are talking about rss feed

1349549
rss	feed
point it at an rss or atom feed it will give you back php arrays and objects

1349576

try-catch	exception-handling
sometimes there are some isolated cases where it is known that this block of code occasionally throws exception-handling and i ve handled it in with a try-catch

1349660
touchesbegan	touchesended
store it in touchesbegan and fetch the duration in touchesended as this

1349707
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode which even if resharper does it for me is extra needless code

1349777
hide	show
right now i m able to show all 4 sub-divs at the same time where it should hide the currently visible one then show the new one

1349887
rss	feed
fortunately most search engines understand rss or atom so be sure to include a news feed with your site

1349930
inherited	base-class
where a derived class of virtualroot hides a member from the base that member of the derived class is dominant over the member of the base and will be used even though the base-class member can be reached by other path in the inherited tree

1349932
width	height
i want the script to get the width and height of each image then format this into an img tag that would include the url i m using

1349935
mouse	keyboard
in order to do anything that invokes a prompt flash requires user interaction like keyboard or mouse input

1349979
wan	lan
however it seems to me that this roadblock is evaporating as new technologies and robust api s eliminate many integration difficulties created when running applications outside the lan wan

1349982
width	height
furthermore i don t understand why you would want to include image height and width in the img elements as there is no need to specify those

1349982
width	height
the height and the width are only used to modify the image dimensions as the browser automatically display s the actual size

1350013
webclient	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest response and webclient will catch most of the redirects but not all of them since there are pages that do the redirect via javascript

rss	feed
i basically want to pull information from my netflix queue provided from an rss feed and i m trying to decide if serialization is feasible possible or if i should just use something like xmlreader

1350155
udp	tcp
with socket.sendfile since sockets are by definition protocol-agnostic you could potentially send the file via udp or tcp with the same code but i would only recommend that if you re sending via a lan where packet loss is virtually 0

1350167
rss	feed
you can then use linq to xml to query against and render the rss feed into something usable

1350170
rss	feed
the system.servicemodel.syndication namespace provides a bunch of types to manage feed feed content and categories feed formatting rss 2.0 atom 1.0 etc

1350180
integer	unsigned
as stated below it turns out after a tiny bit of investigation that for positive floats in intel ieee754 format of size n-bits that are +infinity treating the concatenated exponent and significand as a n-1 bit unsigned integer adding one gets the next higher and subtracting one get next lower

1350183
mouseleave	mouseenter
the pseudo-event-name hover is used as a shorthand for mouseenter mouseleave but was handled differently in earlier jquery versions

1350183
mouseleave	mouseenter
still a popular question so it s worth drawing attention to dennis98 s point in the comments below that in jquery 1.9+ the hover event was deprecated in favour of the standard mouseenter mouseleave calls

1350188
rss	feed
if you can use linq linq to xml is an easy way to get at the basics of an rss feed document

1350188
rss	feed
this is from something i wrote to select out a collection of anonymous types from my blog s rss feed for example

1350192
public	protected
but if you then or in the future declare a protected or public class that inherits from the package-private class then the visibility of the members of the original class do matter

1350195
put	get
i m trying to get data from isnare and put them into mysql table

1350209
websphere	ibm
this is more or less born out of frustration with the jax-ws 2.0 implementation in the web services feature pack for ibm websphere 6.1 - apparently wsdls are not generated for jax-ws webservices if they have a soap 1.2 binding defined using the bindingtype annotation

1350231
actionscript	mxml
in actionscript and mxml the whole concept of fluid layouts

1350232
client-side	server-side
if you treat asp as the server-side and flex as the client-side then you just need to sort out what the api will be

1350234
uiview	subviews

1350315
integer	unsigned
additionally it returns an unsigned integer for the resultant color

1350315
integer	unsigned
anyhow i don t see anything in the api for converting a color to an unsigned integer or for simply interpolating between two instances of color

1350318
post	get
you should be able to do all the relevant includes inside your script.php and pass any parameters that need to carry through from post or get via ajaxsubmit

1350332
unsigned	short
i ll bet they re doing a + on an unsigned short

1350332
unsigned	short
the result of the addition gets cast to an int implicitly then needs to be downcast back to an unsigned short for the assignment

1350335
setinterval	settimeout
flex has enter_frame events timer calllater settimeout setinterval all which delay calls and create new execution stacks

1350335
pull	push
the idea being that you push functions closures into an array and the active object controller pull the next one off the list when the previous one has run to completion

1350346

innodb	myisam
if innodb doesn t exist mysql will automatically substitute myisam unless you change the default sql_mode to avoid this substitution

1350548
prepare	execute
you could however build a string with those variables and then prepare and execute it as dynamic sql

1350566
int	double
the numbers are either int or double

1350566
int	double
i can t use int because some of the input i get are double s

1350567
int	chars
however if the client violates that precondition as in the example you provide above where chars is not the same as int then it will be up to the client not you to correct the compile-time error

1350598
width	height
this worked fine until i realized that i needed two pieces of information from the view in order to make this operation complete the way users expect the width and height of the canvas specfically

1350601
int	chars
the inputiterator can be of either unsigned chars chars or std string iterators and t is expected to be a signed int such as signed int int or long

merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails merb sinatra or any other web framework would work

1350641

basically the fx option is used to call animate you can specify a single option or two in an array that will be used to do the show and hide effects

1350737
vim	emacs
alternatively a good editor such as emacs or vim should help you make that type of mechanical change semi-automatically and fairly quickly if you can drive the editor well

free	malloc
dynamic allocations with new delete are said to take place on the free-store while malloc free operations use the heap

1350819
free	malloc
free store and heap not new malloc

1350831
yslow	pagespeed
you can also use firebug yslow pagespeed as firfox plugin to help you

1350832

superclass	subclassing
it is similar to how normal extension can add methods except the subclassing is only coupled by a reference which means that any superclass can be used

1350893
int	double
in both of your examples one list contains one number that is an int last 1 in the first case and 2 as the first element of the second list the rest of the numbers are double

1350893
int	double
if you also try it with scala 2.8 then it should use numeric instead of anyval as it became the supertype of both double and int

1350893
int	double
in this case the int values you gave will be converted to double

1350917
post	get
i want id to be sent with post not get

1350952
post	get
post requests can contain get variables too whereas get requests can t contain post variables

qt containers can be converted to from stl containers e.g qvector tostdvector qlist fromstdlist

1351008
post	get
the variable contains both post and get data

1351895
jruby	mri
the size of the jruby runtime is already a big problem in terms of memory consumption and startup latency especially compared to mri or yarv and even more so if you actually include the jvm itself in your measurements and rewriting it in a language that adds its own runtime to that weight is simply a no-go

1351922

1359654
integer	unsigned
preferred output would be a single unsigned integer to assist in matching purposes

1359665
firefox	safari
behavior definitely occurs in safari 3 + 4 and does not occur in firefox 3 or 4

1359672
hash	salt
so i advise you to use any cryptographic hash sha-256 for example with a salt

1359690
folder	directory
where file is the protocol mynet is the server and folder image.jpg is the directory location under the share

1359795
python-daemon	daemons
i m getting the following error when using the multiprocessing module within a python daemons process using python-daemon

1359795
children	parent
the daemon process parent spawns a number of processes children and then periodically polls the processes to see if they have completed

1359806
post	put
but if it simple data i think you can use rest to post or put data to the server

1359822
opera	firefox
firefox uses w3c standard node textcontent but its behavior differs slightly from that of mshtml s proprietary innertext copied by opera as well some time ago among dozens of other mshtml features

1359847
folder	directory
put them in folder in your project directory then add the top-level folder s to your project

1359856
tostring	gethashcode
ok to be clear what s confusing me is that i m starting with the assumption that even though int derives from system.valuetype that in turn derives from system.object because it contains tostring gethashcode etc

1359875
int	double
2 the bigdecimal consists of an arbitrary precision int unscaled value and a non-negative 32-bit int scale while the double wraps a value of the primitive type double in an object

1359887
apache	nginx
apache iis nginx et

1359952
client-side	server-side
the security of your system should never rely on client-side javascript all your authentication and so on should be done server-side

1359970
nsmatrix	nspopupbuttoncell	nsbuttoncell	nspopupbuttoncell	nsbuttoncell	nsmatrix
as i haven t dealt much with nsform myself and haven t heard of nsformcell before i would personally use an nsmatrix for this task adding the appropriate cells nstextfieldcell nsbuttoncell nspopupbuttoncell etc where necessary

1359973
multi-query	mysql
the vulnerable code has since been identified and is being corrected but it got me wondering about some of the differences between how mysql and sql server process multi-query strings

1360029
gif	bmp	tiff	bmp
compare jpeg gif tiff bmp and other file formats

1360053
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however you may wish to take advantage of some css3 styles such as box-shadow which will work in safari google-chrome and firefox

1360095
prng	random
note that while mac osx uses a different method for it s prng and therefore does not block my personal benchmarks done in college have shown it to be every-so-slightly less random than the linux kernel

1360173
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
use malloc to make one realloc to change the size of one and free when you re done with it

1360202
wadl	wsdl
both wsdl 2.0 and wadl seem to have a rather small following atm and it seem to be little return for the effort of creating and maintaining the description documents

1360202
wadl	wsdl
do you rely on wsdl wadl to consume others services

1360216
superclass	subclassing
in c# you can only cast to classes in a class hierarchy superclass subclassing

1360216
superclass	subclassing
but is neither a superclass nor a subclassing of even though decimal implements icomparable

1360232
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview and sqldatasource as gridview s datasource

1360264
hash	salt
however django adds salt to the password before it computes the hash so you cannot reverse django passwords

1360314
put	get	post	put	post	get
specifically we are hoping to use get post put and delete

1360379
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
window - uinavigationcontroller - uitabbarcontroller - uinavigationcontroller - child view controller

1360381
uiview	subviews
this uiview is a subviews of a scrollview actually it s a subviews of another view which is a subviews of the scrollview

1360395
google-chrome	firefox
putting the favicon in the root works in firefox and google-chrome but not in internet explorer

1360397
post	get
you will get as many naming convention standards as you get post to this question

1360400
vb6	vba
that s mainly a carryover from old-school vb6 because vba is so closely related

1360406
put	get
try to put breakpoints around the presentmodalviewcontroller animated line to see what lines get executed before the error occurs

1360406
viewdidload	viewwillappear
try putting breakpoints in the viewdidload and viewwillappear methods of the browseruiviewcontroller class as well to see which of those if any are being called before the error occurs

1360412
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in a complex web app with numerous non-absolutely essential features and animations is it worthwhile to start thinking about cordoning them off for say these sets of features should work in all browsers and these sets of features only in google-chrome and safari and these in firefox and google-chrome and safari and opera and so on because enabling certain features in certain browsers would be too slow

1360417
width	height
just iterate over the array and position the images by using its width and height properties

1360442
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
if i want to use the canvas tag then i can add that in a different file since ie and firefox opera safari differ in how they create the canvas element

1360466
outputstream	inputstream
if so you ll have an easier time wrapping the outputstream in an outputstreamwriter and write the char s from the reader to the writer instead of trying to convert the reader to an inputstream

1360492
width	height
this is needed for the height and width animations to work

1360564
disk	ram
if it s true that the amount of data exceeds your disk write speeds then you will have to either increase your disk write speeds eg raid faster disk ram disk or distribute the load across many servers

1360578
versioning	upgrade
major number change means that the new versioning is incompatible with the old one and any dependent of the prior versioning will require code changes to upgrade to the new package

1360594
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
we have developers using windows with tortoisecvs which uses cvsnt

1360594
cvsnt	tortoisecvs
now as i understand it tortoisecvs uses cvsnt which assumes unix line endings in the repository

1360594
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu the cvs clients does no conversions as the repository should be unix line endings and linux also uses unix line endings

1360626
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the menu is working fine in firefox opera safari ie8 but not in ie6

1360675
arp	icmp
i tried many kinds of pings - arp icmp tcp.udp

1360675
udp	tcp
tcp and udp ping take lifelong to

post	get
what i can t get working is finding the post id for the latest post per author

1360695
post	get
my attempt to get the latest post id for each author latest_post_id

1360707
ubuntu	linux
i only tested it on a fresh install of ubuntu 9.04 with openjdk 6 but i m quite sure i have seen similar issues before on linux

1360707
pdfrenderer	icepdf
i also tried to open the pdf with other java pdf applications like the swinglabs pdfrenderer and the icepdf demo applet and they had the same problem

1360720
maven	pom.xml
download it from here or copy the pom.xml dependency into your pom.xml file if using maven

1360770
hash	md5
my first idea was to md5 the requestparameters and then write a cache file using the hash as filename

1360830
mouseup	mousedown
you can use two global variables to record the time of mousedown and mouseup and have a substract

1360870
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
however it does seem to be preferred over the overflow fix for modern browsers opera firefox 3.x safari google-chrome ie8

1360881
uiview	subviews
when inspecting a uiview instance in the debugger the variable view of xcode does not show the subviews member of the uiview class

1360886
onmousedown	onmouseup
when onmousedown is fired you can hang an onmouseup event on window

1360909
width	height
anvaka what i mean by perfectly right is that the document should dock in container that is the fonts should resize it should fill the container in height and width

1360909
width	height
but the parent container is not filling out its parent container so when i zoom or change font size i would like the documentpageview container to grow in width and height but remain centered

1360952
arp	icmp
you can use arp icmp ping to know the hosts present on your network provided you enter the correct subnet information

1360967
versioning	upgrade
then you can use gem update --system to upgrade to rubygems versioning 1.3.5

1361072
profiling	instrumentation
on the other hand when you run instrumentation profiling counts every call and measures execution time of every function

1361077
wordpress	joomla
i seem to be getting the impression that wordpress is more popular than joomla nowadays

1361110
git-pull	git-clone
git-clone does not appear to allow for specifying a path and any other commands that i found git-fetch git-pull seem to require an existing local git repository to work

1361119
free	malloc
you haven t malloc ed the memory block - the string is allocated in static storage - and later you try to free that memory block

1361119
free	malloc
you can only free blocks allocated with malloc otherwise you risk running into undefined behaviour

1361119
free	malloc
you could either only put pointers to statically allocated strings into frag seq fields and never free them or you could malloc memory for these strings and copy the strings into malloc ed blocks

1361120
wordpress	joomla
if you find that for your needs there is not yet the right image gallery script in wordpress joomla then i would start developping that

1361126
memcpy	strncpy	memcpy	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy
you have to use strcpy or strncpy or memcpy depending on your religious perspective on the whole mess to copy the contents of one string into another

1361198
vb6	vba
phoenie i don t think there s anyway to look at the private class variable in vb6 vba once you have something in local scope that hides it i had a good old google search but nothing came up

1361221
spweb	spsite
both the spsite and the spweb need to be disposed and according to the best practices document this situation is called a cross method dispose pattern.

1361263
versioning	upgrade
as i wrote in my answer i maintain two sets of scripts one set that can build the database from scratch and one that can upgrade a given database from one versioning to the last

1361263
versioning	upgrade
in a perfect world i should be able to perform an upgrade from versioning n-1 to versioning n of the database and compare the obtained schema to the schema of the previous database

1361291
folder	directory
to fix the problem i have to delete the bin and obj folder from the mvc project directory which allows the solution to be opened again

1361295
button	checkbox
you can t put html controls in a pdf but you can add form fields to a pdf which support button radio button checkbox text fields etc

1361323
youtube	vimeo
i m looking for a lightbox to show videos from youtube and vimeo

1361331
post	get
in asp.net mvc you can distinguish between get and post using the acceptverbs attribute but that is just akin to ispostback looking at the request object

1361500
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried firefox and google-chrome but get the same behavior

1361515
google-chrome	firefox
in the menu google-chrome or as one line first last option first last option firefox

uiview	subviews
i want to add a uiview of smaller frame as subviews to parental view but i am not getting the needed

1361531
post	get
now the blog post might get created by sending an email

1361552
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
jquery generally works with konqueror and firefox 1.0.x but there may be some unexpected bugs since we do not test them as regularly as firefox 2.0+ ie6+ opera 9+ and safari 3+

1361570
postgresql	mysql
i am using and working on software which uses mysql as a backend engine it can use others such as postgresql or oracle or sqlite but this is the main application we are using

1361570
hash	md5
the software was design in such way that the binary data we want to access is kept as blobs in individual columns each table has one blob column other columns have integers floats to characterize the blob and one string column with the blob s md5 hash

1361583
implements	extends	ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable extends ienumerable and is intended to be implements by linq providers

1361583
ienumerable	ienumerator
a type implementing ienumerable basically declares that i can give you an iterator object via the getenumerator interface method exposing an ienumerator interface which you can use to access the current element in the collection and movenext to move to the next element in the list

1361584
union	distinct
union its like a join command.when using the union all the selected columns need to be of the same datatype.only distinct values are selected

1361584
union	distinct
union all it almost like union.there is no distinct operation so it will take all the values

1361630
ubuntu	centos
are centos and ubuntu the same os or different ones

1361637
firefox	safari
it works for both safari and firefox

1361646
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
some browsers implement proprietary extensions ie google-chrome other implement rfc 2231 firefox opera

1361646
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
update as of november 2012 all current desktop browsers support the encoding defined in rfc 6266 and rfc 5987 safari 6 ie 9 google-chrome firefox opera konqueror

1361706
int	chars
as mentioned already the terminating chars of a c-string is a null byte int value 0

1361714
tcpclient	networkstream
the networkstream has been retrieved from a tcpclient

1361722
implements	extends
there are various ways to implements it we have found following way is the best because you can not override static methods so in future if you want to inherit and extends functionality its little bit difficult

1361783
button	checkbox
next i put a checkbox and a button on the

1361791
inherited	properties
i would like to use properties from an inheriting model s meta class to configure a field defined in an abstract model higher up the inherited tree

1361826
profiling	instrumentation
the irony is that instrumentation is not required to do profiling coverage analysis as .net has an api for this

1361838
getter	setter
it is silly to write a test for every setter every getter and so on

1361922
width	height
i am sizing the popup by having jquery determine the img width and height so that each window will have a unique size based on the first image

1361953
subtract	add
just store the value you add and then subtract it from the total before adding a new one

1362016
button	checkbox
and here is a case if you want to highlight all controls button checkbox choice and edit if horizontal manager is focused

1362036
width	height
whose width and height values are

1362039
firefox	safari
this seems to work in ie6 ie7 windows firefox 3.x and safari os x

1362062
vrml	x3d
for using the writing to file approach you could investigate x3d which is the successor to vrml

1362156
cvs	svn
ask hudson to check periodically the cvs svn ... and if there are changes since the last build then it will start the build

1362171
postgresql	mysql
orm based on propel doctrine so you can use mysql postgresql or sqlite

1362198
hide	show
may be hide all div.actions at first and show only when parent was been hovered

1362203
children	parent
each row should have two columns a text box showing the parent s name and a datagridviewcomboboxcolumn containing that parent s children from which the user can select the parent s favorite child

1362203
children	parent
i d like each instance of the combo box to bind to the list of each parent s children

1362203
children	parent
it s not too tough to make a separate list of all the children and filter it by parent

1362251
post	get
alex feinman describes how it works and how to get around it in this blog post

1362444
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie7 and google-chrome browsers and one friend tested on firefox 3.0 and it worked

1362447
int	chars
since x is always passed in as an unsigned chars then it will always have a value between 0 and 255 inclusive regardless of whether you cast x or 0 to a signed int in the if statement

1362452
hash	md5
store the results into a session a good idea would be to create a hash of that data using md5 then using that cache the session per multiple users

1362458
int	chars
since an int is bigger than a chars casting unsigned chars to signed int still retains the chars s original value

1362465
int	chars
all the values of an unsigned chars can fir perfectly in your int so even with the cast you will never get a negative value

1362499
profiling	debugging
don t profiling or otherwise judge performance in the debugging configuration

1362584
getter	setter
sometimes a lot of helper classes is a symptom of an anemic model if are related to classes that mainly have setter getter in those scenarios helpers grows up from behavior that isn t correctly assigned to domain objects

1362620
post	get
if you are creating a client application only you will need to set service.useproxy to false and use either get or post

1362651
floating-point	integer
it s not entirely clear but i think you re asking how to convert a floating-point value myduration to an integer in bash

1362677
cvs	svn
i ve seen various schemes along these line using cvs no externals here so it was checked-in scripts that had to be executed and svn

1362704
post	put
i started series of post about great plains automation success story where i put all the details and steps of my investigation along with sample code

1362704
mouse	keyboard
of course without any use of keyboard mouse hard-coded workarounds

1362723
width	height
i tried all sorts of things even going through the windowmanager to expand the window to full width and height manually but nothing works

1362723
width	height
for instance i show a progress bar circle which has width and height set to fill_parent so does its layout container but still the dialog wraps around the much smaller progress bar instead of filling the screen

1362725
hide	show
this code is going to hide all the images in the popups and then only show the first image in the collection which is inside the a.effect projectpopup

1362725
width	height
the problem with resizing the popup has to do with getting the size of the first img using width and height

1362725
width	height
to fix this while looping through the projectpopups temporarily show them off screen so you are able to get the width and height of the first image

1362755
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade it to the latest versioning 1.03 via cpan

1362762
equals	gethashcode
two rows will only be joined when gethashcode of left and right are the same and equals returns true

1362773
width	height
width and height are both int properties

1362794
children	parent
and i would like to eager load all parent and children for a given grandparent

1362842
hash	md5
otoh if you need a cryptographically strong hash function i would avoid md5 and use sha-256 nowadays

1362857
range	max	range	min	min	max
i m dealing with lots of data that have a min max range and i need to group these together based on the same min max values

1362857
min	max
basically this could be a linq query on the dictionary of all values where the provides value is between the min and max value

1362883
equals	gethashcode
using a key in a dictionary is a matter of overriding gethashcode and equals

1362894
hide	show
with this method you can then return true or false depending on whether you want to show hide the button

1362908
unicode	ucs
the specification defines unicodeâ s character set the universal character set ucs and some encodings to encode that characters the unicode transformation formats utf-7 utf-8 utf-16 and utf-32

1362923
width	height
if a do that i get a problem when i rotate the image for the image width can be bigger then height of the image so then i need to reset the image x y coordinates to 0 0

1362993
equals	compareto
first don t confuse equals with compareto

1363052
pop-up	dialog
i want to show a modal dialog pop-up window when the user has not filled in a text field on the page instead of using an error text field on the page

1363054
equals	gethashcode
type t basically has to be dealt with as an object using only the lowest common denominator of operations available to everything assignment gethashcode equals

1363067
prepare	execute
prepare statement is just a parsed and precompiled sql statement which just waits for the bound variables to be provided to be execute

1363067
prepare	execute
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute

1363071
getter	setter
in java defining getter setter instead of defining public member variables does not result in performance degradation as the jit inline the getter setter

1363100
countif	sumifs
edit i also recommend that you google advanced excel functions like sumproduct sumifs and countif

1363117
profiling	benchmarking
i guess it doesn t really matter but i tend to think that when gather information about what will run in production it is best to test exactly what will go to production this goes for analysis profiling benchmarking etc.

1363119
nsmutablestring	nsstring
since nsmutablestring is a subclass of nsstring you may have been given a mutable string at assignment so other code may modify the string s value without your knowledge unless you are using key-value observing to observe those changes

1363119
nsstring	nsdata
for this reason it is usually appropriate to use copy semantics for properties that you intend to hold an immutable value nsstring nsdata nsarray nsset are the common--though not exaustive--suspects

1363128
excel	listobject
i am trying to save a listobject from a .net 3.5 excel 2007 vsto workbook to a new sheet done and save that new sheet to a new workbook done without that workbook requiring the vsto customization file

1363147
public	protected
the only additional access that making it public would provide would be to allow instances of the class to be declared as variables in scopes that cannot access its protected members but instances of abstract classes cannot be declared at all

1363170
post	get
in the controller you should have two methods one to respond to the get the other if required is for responding to the post

1363171
put	get
i don t think that 2 is true because i put calls to append to a file in the shared new the public new and finalize functions and all i get are

1363171
percentile	max	min	max
i ve replaced min max average stdev small percentile skew kurtosis and a few more

1363214
public	protected
my opinion would be that the public constructor might be seen to be confusing and as you say making it protected would be correct

1363252
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have a weird scenario i need to use the ajax scriptmanager and updatepanel on two specific asp.net 2.0 pages

1363295
division	modulo
this is done using integer division and modulo mod operators in your programming language

1363295
division	modulo
however if the page size is 4 a power of 2 then 4 in binary is 100 and integer division and modulo can be computed using special shortcuts you can strip the last two binary digits to divide and you can keep only the last two binary digits for modulo

1363301
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie8 but in firefox and google-chrome the nested table is ignoring the colspan and is only sown in the first column

1363303
button	checkbox
on the application s properties i used the signing tab set on the checkbox for sign the clickonce manifest clicked the create test certificate button and entered passwords

1363308
direct3d	directx
i know wpf is based on directx direct3d even for simple controls but i cannot find any reference on the topic which provides a good overview of borderline scenarios

1363325
google-chrome	safari
i have tested it for ie safari and google-chrome revealing no errors

1363338
uiview	calayer
you can do something similar to extract the content from a calayer-backed uiview although we had to subclass calayer in order to get vector elements to render to a pdf properly

1363485
spweb	spsite
it is almost always better to use dependency injection to provide an spsite or spweb reference for your class to use perhaps through the constructor

1363485
spweb	spsite
however you should track and dispose the spsite rather than the spweb

1363492
bazaar	svn	bazaar	cvs	cvs	svn
note that i said a vcs so it can be svn cvs bazaar .

1363509
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
i m reasonably familiar with the various forms of vb that existed prior to .net vb6 vba vbscript... but have yet to delve into the sweet new flavor that is vb.net

1363518
children	parent
i want to retrieve all anchor tags + all children and parent and their attributes for every anchor tag

1363524
vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
what you can do is contrast with vb.net with vba or vb6 or vbscript or some other variant of visual basic

1363528
directx	gdi
additionally on modern hardware 2d gdi or gdi+ can be about as fast as 2d opengl or directx

1363534
put	get
to put it simply you get inner joins if you use the first form

1363582
gridview	repeater
instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater

1363654
width	height
i figured it out by the way - the solution is to use the regex module to substitute existing width and height values for new ones

1363665
cos	sin
you can change cos to sin

1363665
cos	sin
dont forget that sin and cos are periodic

1363733
inherited	properties
i would like to have a role base class that has properties for activedate and deactivedate that each role like applicationadministratorrole can inherited from so that every role is forced to have these properties

1363747
width	height
this will allow you to measure the width and height of your text taking into account font size etc

1363796
nunit	mstest
without integration of nunit one of us has resharper while the other does not we are leaning toward mstest

1363817
int	double
it looks like there is a shared lock that is used whenever is called when formatting an int and presumably double

1363818
fontfamily	font-size
i recommend doing fontfamily helvetica neue helvetica arial font-size 20pt and setting the font weight to the lowest possible 100

1363845
int	boolean
i could have overloads for all the different underlying types they re all dates int boolean and decimals but i wanted to see if i could get the generic version working

1363850
button	checkbox
depending on what sort of back-end is handling your form after it s submitted some people name radio button and checkbox with a after their name to make them convert nicely to arrays in the form handling system

1363873
mbunit	nunit
it includes mbunit but its runner can run tests from other frameworks like nunit xunit etc

1363880
wordpress	phpbb
or if your site will be hosting an install of wordpress or phpbb there are ways of leveraging those technologies authentication modules to sign in to other pages of a site

now your csv code would only need to access and loop through the key value pairs within the properties hashtable it inherited from the domainobject to get the names and values

1364770
accessor	properties	inherited	properties
but obviously this only works if you have a level of control over your objects necessry to make them inherited from the domainobject and it wouldnt involve 30 years of drugery to rewrite all your properties accessor

post	get	inherited	subclassing
you could deploy this check-and-redirect-if-needed or other behavior alteration of your choice in any of various ways decorators wsgi middleware inherited from an intermediate base class of yours that subclassing webapp.requesthandler or whatever other base handler class you re currently using and method names different than get and post in your application-level handler classes and others yet but i think that the key idea here is that os.environ is set by the app engine framework according to cgi standards and so you can rely on those standards similarly wsgi builds its own environment based on the values it picks up from os.environ

metaclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
if your programming language and environment do not allow similar tricks like dynamic creation of subclassing python s metaclass - some kind of inherited hook etc

rss	feed
we have a site that is serving some rss feed and we d like to know how many people is subscribed to each one without using a system like feedburner to serve them

1364930
rss	feed
being google s property now it can surely find out how many people are subscribed to a certain feed in greader specifically but i m sure there are other online rss feed that would pose the same problems

ingres	firebird	ingres	postgresql	ingres	oracle	ingres	mysql	postgresql	mysql
it gets us much closer to making applications truly db-agnostic - you can swap out the sql server provider for mysql postgresql oracle firebird sqlite ingres - and all the linq expressions stay exactly the same

they differentiate fixture from testcase

1365460
chunked	transfer-encoding
setting the binding to use transfermode streamed was causing a transfer-encoding chunked

1365502
opera	firefox
note i realize dom is handled differently in different browsers and so the innerhtml from opera will look different than the one from firefox

1365585
required	placeholder
this page would contain a the buttons and textbox required to make up the inner browser ui and a placeholder that would contain the page that the user requested

1365606

put	get
you say the jsp page s encoding is not unicode but rather big5 so what are you doing to get that string out of the attribute map and put it on that page

1365761
equals	gethashcode
if you always want author objects to be compared based on the name values then override gethashcode and equals or implement iequatable

1365761
equals	gethashcode
the two members on the iequalitycomparer interface are equals and gethashcode

1365773
equals	gethashcode
you ve overriden equals but make sure you also override gethashcode

1365795
equals	gethashcode
if you have not overridden equals and gethashcode then it uses the default implementation on object which compares references

1365795
equals	gethashcode
the simple solution is to add a correct implementation of equals and gethashcode to all classes which participate in the object graph you are comparing ie book and author

1365795
equals	gethashcode
the iequalitycomparer interface is a convenience that allows you to implement equals and gethashcode in a separate class when you don t have access to the internals of the classes you need to compare or if you are using a different method of comparison

1365849
textmate	gedit
i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - gedit is lightweight and i actually enjoy using it more than textmate on os x

me i use vim usually in the gvim incarnation as my python ide and i ve seen emacs-using colleagues do at-least-equivalent wizardry but i just can t get used to emacs myself

1365900
qsort	strcmp
another reason strcmp returns the codes it does is so that it can be used directly in the standard library function qsort allowing you to sort an array of strings

if you want to profiling your iphone app with symbols using file- symbolicate i believe you need to profiling the debugging version on your iphone not the release version

1366186
width	height
in size width or height whatever is

1366224
uiview	subviews
i have added several uiscrollviews as subviews of a single uiview and set the frames so that each one is clearly visable

1366224
for-loop	loops
i do this in a for-loop and with each pass of loops i release the uiscrollview though the object is still stored because it has been subviewed into the uiview

1366224
put	get
i can t even get the viewforzooming method to get called at all if i put in an nslog call

1366244
gentoo	linux
i have an external tomcat server configured to run j2ee applications on my development gentoo linux install machine

1366263
getter	setter
a property is just syntactic sugar for a setter and or a getter

1366263
uiview	subviews
so the read-only subviews property of uiview only guarantees that it has an implementation for this method

1366336
background-image	background-color
require that they explicitly write background-color background-image

1366344
public	protected
this can either be done by making the controls themselves public or protected or you can create properties on your form class that will set the properties on the controls

1366414
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
i ve tried looking around in nsobject nsmanagedobject docs but found nothing

1366419
uiview	uiwindow	uiview	subviews	uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow

you are primarily asking how to package the lift application as a single jar war

1366512
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i understand that css3.0 supports the font-face tag correctly in the latest opera safari and firefox browsers but that internet explorer still requires the microsoft .eot format

1366535
maven	pom.xml
note this is a flat structure for maven as all non-leaf projects have a packaging value of pom.xml

1366535
maven	pom.xml
the maven parent pom.xml notion would be fine but it is already used by the modules so it is not available for our requirement

1366552
dictionary	map
all you need to do is map the url profile password check to a view and within that view fetch the value for the key oldpassword in the request.post dictionary do with it what you will and return either true or false

1366564
visualvm	jrockit
beside visualvm which nick mentioned another good and free for development piece of software is oracle jrockit mission control

1366564
visualvm	jrockit
personally i would go with visualvm or jrockit mission control first

1366574
datarow	bindingsource
i then tried sending in the actual datarow and even the datarowview object of the parent bindingsource and using the find method on the details bindingsource - but they all just return -1

1366654
int	double
i would advice to use int or enumeration for the priority as priority doesn t sound to be a good candidate for beeing double

1366725
many-to-many	many-to-one
instead of many-to-many use two many-to-one relationships

1366761
width	height
of course by using either the height or the width as the anchor one way or other the new image will cause scrolling assuming the original image is larger than the window in the first place

1366768
powerpc	i386
depending on your target customers you might also want to test on powerpc i386 and x86_64 architectures

1366770
sorting	grouping
this site shows the various sorting algorithms using four grouping

1366770
sorting	grouping
in addition to the four grouping in norman s answer you want to check the sorting algorithms with collection of numbers that have a few similarities in the numbers

1366785
width	height
find the largest of the two values width w and height h

1366785
width	height
say your maximum width x height is 100 x 80

1366806
public	protected
derived can be only classes sou you can create a myusercontrolbase class which can create some common controls output and provide it by protected public properties to derived class myweatherusercontrol for example which can common controls output modify

1366829
client-side	server-side
but here lies the problem the logic deciding what to show or not has to be written once in the server-side and once in the client-side language

1366908
superclass	subclassing
another warning even if there were a conversion from subclassing to superclass it would incur slicing of the subclassing object since you provide the arguments by value

1367020
avr	microcontroller
i have experience with avr microcontroller but i think this will be pretty much the same for all of them

1367052
rss	feed
as gs mentioned also check out mike ash s articles and also subscribe to his rss feed as i m sure more blocks-related posts will come up

1367162
uiview	subviews
you can add a hidden uitextfield as a subviews to your uiview and then make that subviews the first responder

1367162
put	get
you have to put some text into the hidden text field because textchanged will only get called if the text actually changed

1367174
hash	salt
it hash and salt all the passwords and provides a backend interface to manage users groups and permissions

1367216
hash	salt
hash the passwords with a salt

1367216
hash	salt
you should hash the hash value again with a salt on the server

1367228
ant	maven
you would get much better results by having an ant or maven build

1367228
ant	maven
update as for the question of integrating ant or maven with eclipse see my answer on best way to share jars across multiple projects

1367243
width	margin
if you can t a simple way is using divs a wrapper with width margin same with both box models and another inside with border-width and padding

1367245
range	minimum
adjust your weighting criteria -- perhaps you want to make sure that the weights fall within some minimum maximum range so that all user have some minimum chance of having their pictures selected and no user can dominate the selections

1367245
multiplying	add
you may need to tinker with it -- perhaps add or multiplying by a constant -- to get the distribution the way you want

1367282
google-chrome	firefox
the code is working fine in firefox and internet explorer but it is not woking in google-chrome browser

1367303
maven	pom.xml
my project is built with maven-2 and i use spring-core 2.5.5 i tried to look in maven central repo for artifact to include in my pom.xml and the only one i found is spring support

1367328
vb.net	vb6
i have a large project where we have 2-3 dll projects that are converted from vb6 to vb.net

1367345
xna	slimdx
there are already several wrapper libraries exposing opengl or directx to .net such as slimdx which as the name implies is a much thinner more light-weight wrapper than something like xna

1367380
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade macports to 1.8 removed all previously installed ports and reinstalled them in 1.8 which i assume would have installed a 64-bit versioning of the ports including freeimage

1367384
width	height
i have an uitableview in my app and i have to load some images that have a fixed width but different height

1367416
opera	firefox
this standard applies to ie firefox opera browsers

1367416
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
but the above code only works in safari and in ie and firefox and opera it will become 1020px overall width

1367453
chunked	transfer-encoding
i run into all kind of funky encodings for example transfer-encoding chunked have to parse all that stuff manually and i feel like coding c not python at the moment

1367468
post	get
ie will then detect that the form contains a utf-8 character and use utf-8 when you post or get

1367474
nsurl	nsdata
resulting in boilerplate code to just to decide if i should open the image with nsdata datawithcontentsoffile or nsdata datawithcontentsofurl sadly you can t create an nsurl from a local file name

1367533
webrat	celerity
however i still think that this will be the way the headless browser tests will go and apart from the immature webrat culerity interface you could probably create some decent test suite based on celerity htmlunit

1367579
width	margin
i guess under the w3c box model a box having a width of 100px with 2px padding on each side a 3px border and 7px margin on each side will have a visible width of 114px

1367579
width	height
not 124 as w3c excludes the padding and border from the width height of an element

1367609
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1367645
post	get
if you want to post to the server use jquery s ajax get post method s

1367702
button	checkbox
a proper ui solution is to have a select whose contents are dynamically populated based on a search field - either typed text think google s new search box or browser s address bar or sometimes checkbox radio button

1367708
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i ve got the jquery validation plugin working beautifully in firefox opera safari and ie8

1367711
keydown	keyup
put another way keydown + keyup keypress

1367720
keydown	keyup
however the noncharacter keys do raise the keydown and keyup events

1367735
onclick	preventdefault
either live with letting the button look like a button or use onclick and preventdefault on a link

1367741
keydown	keyup
depending on the typing delay settings there can be multiple keydown and keypress events but only one keyup event

1367746
keydown	keyup
the keydown event happened once before the first d appeared on the screen the keypress event happened 6 times and the keyup event happened after the last d appeared on the screen

1367775
keydown	keyup
keypress is a higher level of abstraction than keydown and keyup

1367775
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup are hardware related the actual action of a key on the keyboard

1367865
keydown	keyup
notice that keypress occurs in between keydown and keyup not after keyup as many of the other answers have stated that keypress is not called when a character isn t generated and that keydown is repeated while the key is held down also contrary to many of the other answers

1367865
keydown	keyup
for the curious keydown roughly correlates to wm_keydown keypress to wm_char and keyup to wm_keyup

1367870
tapestry	wicket
tapestry 5 has many similarities with wicket and works very well with scala

1367933
hide	show
the function you call should assess if the field is valid and show hide the hidden text box accordingly

1367962
mouseleave	mouseenter
it s supposed to have an effect on hover - i turn border on on mouseenter and off again at mouseleave

1367977
xna	spritebatch
in c# i saw already the spritebatch class in the xna plugin for xbox games

1368007
mouseleave	mouseenter
first focus enter and leave are different events than mouseenter and mouseleave

1368007
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave deals with where the mouse is right now

1368009
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then what you should do is make sure your application uses a uinavigationcontroller and have each uiviewcontroller that needs a toolbar set it s toolbaritems property to an nsarray with the uibarbuttonitem objects you need

1368039
portrait	landscape
i need to test how viewcontrollers react to device rotations switch between portrait and landscape device orientations

jar	war
thus when ask maven2 to build my war the my-lib jar is added in the web-inf lib directory of the web application

1368101
folder	directory
i mean the flex or air will receive the inputs on what the folder and file names will be and when i press create it should create a directory structure.

1368127
post	get
but as per your description any click on the submit button will try to do the post method and not the get method

1370091
awt	swing

1370800
ostringstream	std
better fix since you re using c++ look into the std string and ostringstream classes which will resize themselves to prevent buffer overflows

1370803
fortran	ada

inside set_values you can use the members width and height and they would be the members of the object whose set_values was called

1371201
width	height
on the other hand you cannot use identifiers width or height by themselves inside duplicate because it is not a member function and therefore it does not have the implicit parameter i

1371246
nsstring	nsdata
alternatively you can use nsstring if your file contains only text or nsdata for non-text data

1371246
folder	directory
if you have a file in your documents folder of your home directory called data.txt then you can use the following code to access it but i wouldn t recommend hard-coding paths like this

1371279

1372011
move	drag
the problem i have yet to resolve is the fact that if the user drag the mouse quickly it can leave the window area and then no more mouse move events are received

width	height
you will also want to set the autoshow false visible width and height properties and change the windowstyle property to make it a child window

width	height
calculate height width for each rectangle

1373035
width	height
if scale source width to fit the destination width and scale height by the same ratio

1373035
width	height
otherwise scale source height to fit the destination height and scale width by the same ratio

1373059
integer	fractions
this takes advantage of the fact that date time columns in excel are just numbers integer portion is the date fractions portion is the time

1373072
width	height
another option might be to scale to maximum width and then check if the scaled height is greater then the maximum allowed height and if so scale by height or vice versa

1373078

it does not work over https although the problem does not appear to be directly related to https the ssl session is negotiated fine and some back and forth happens

1373195
direct3d	directdraw
as a follow up tho this and this other question i am now trying to understand out of curiosity if wpf totally mostly relies on direct3d calls and not 2d directdraw ones even for standard controls such as buttons or even the container window itself

1373197
opera	firefox
can a windows update install plugins for firefox opera or whatever browser the user prefers

1373220

floating-point	integer
it may in fact be 4-byte integer or more likely 4-byte floating-point sample values in which case my sample code would still produce noise

1373249
swt	swing

1373372
filesystems	ntfs
i thought the f drive was ntfs formatted but in fact it used the fat32 filesystems

1373419
securitymanager	classloader
this attempt fails in the above example the securitymanager check in classloader s constructor throws a security exception but the attacker simply ignores any exception and waits for the virtual machine to perform finalization on the partially initialized object

1373421
mkmapview	mapkit
as well as my question removing mkmapview annotations causes leaks. i have discovered that if you create a view based project add a uisearchbar and mkmapview into the view s nib wire up the delegates i m not creating any methods as we don t actually need to do anything to trigger the leaks link in the mapkit and fire up the project then simply clicking in the uisearchbar causes a 1k+ leak

1373426
gif	png
it should only be able to do jpeg gif and png files

1373453
put	get
i would be much better to get a connection to the header rows read all of your objects put them in a collection and then iterate back through them and read the detail objects with separate result sets

1373467
inherited	properties
the problem i m having is while using linq2sql with inherited after declaring a new instance of the inherited class the discriminator properties is still set to its initial value not the correct value for the sub-type

1373467
inherited	properties
there are times where i want to declare a new object of the inherited type and call methods on the base class with the base class knowing inherited type it is working with and the most logical choice would be to use the discriminator properties

1373518
integer	unsigned
the fact that this feature is defined turned on means that perl will use an unsigned 64 bit integer for file offsets

1373566
postgresql	mysql
just had a discussion at work about the merits of using postgresql over mysql and vice-versa

1373566
postgresql	mysql
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.

1373570
put	get
if i put home.html in the sites folder i still get the error

aside from jdk7 features i m guessing so you can use extends and super

1373720
serializable	deserialization
when i added serializable i run into the problem that after deserialization the mconnection will sometimes have an empty string and sometimes will have the ip address that was serializable

1373720
serializable	deserialization
so let s say at the time i serializable the object graph i have an isntance of a client with a reference to an instance of a server and a connection and one sequence of events during deserialization just a single call to readobject might be

1373723
lxml	libxml2
if you later need to do complex things like schema validation or xpath querying then i recommend the third-party lxml module which is a wrapper around the popular libxml2 c library

1373756
postgresql	mysql
and then we get to the question of best and this assumes that mysql or postgresql are the only two options

1373852
postgresql	mysql
i have used both and even migrated projects from mysql to postgresql and in my experience postgresql was the better choice

i am writing a vsto add-in for word 2007

1374034
jsr168	jsr286
liferay also supports jsr168 and jsr286 portlets so in respect to that you can use the same api s as you are using in websphere portal

when i try to get the eventinfo of a wpf rectangle if the routedevent is a native event to the object mousedown it works assignments are for example only

1374145
width	height
what if you had one class that took a length and a width which for some reason override a class that took a width and a height

1374168
superclass	subclassing
if i have two classes subclassing and superclass

1374171
width	height
it appears that if i want to set a maximum width of a form then i have to set a maximum height as well

1374274
boost	stl
this is a part of the boost library though and not stl so it may not be available on your particular platform

1374283
ubuntu	linux
i have a fresh install of rsa 7.5.3 in linux ubuntu 9.04

1374291
accessor	properties
obtaining a properties value using the get accessor would have an observable side effect

1374340
width	height
if you are unfamiliar with what this line is doing it is responsible for ensuring that the user s default printer is set up to print whatever is provided to it in landscape mode and also provides landscape orientation dimensions height width on the printer object so following code can properly base item placement coordinates on the page

1374346
iprincipal	iidentity
first have a look at the definitions of iidentity and iprincipal

1374346
iprincipal	iidentity
they ve chosen to implement an additional property called role on their implementation of iidentity sampleiidentity and then they ve used it from their implementation of iprincipal

1374355
powerpc	i386
this would be doable on i386 and not really on powerpc

1374382
width	height
if by collapse you mean hide this will work by setting the height and width on tgrid1 and grid2 to 0

1374386
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i ve had trouble with attribute selectors in firefox once or twice so if you ve only tested in firefox check google-chrome ie safari opera etc

1374394
client-side	server-side
everyone has focused on server-side client-side but in truth we don t know why you are asking this question and it s important

1374419
bluetooth	usb
nokia series60 devices should have a javax.microedition.io.commconnection that would allow the use of usb infrared and or bluetooth comm ports via the generic gcf api

1374448
http.sys	httplistener
and also don t forget - http.sys much more customizable than httplistener

1374448
http.sys	httplistener
you can t do streaming with httplistener but you can do that with http.sys - question about httplistener streaming

1374463
gridex	janus
they will save you time very quickly - some like janus gridex control costs relatively little a few hundred quid and will save you hours - which if you work in a commercial environment can translate to much more than the cost of the control

1374467
button	checkbox
i m trying to iterate over checkbox in an asp.net web page and if any of the checkbox are checked then i want to enable the button on the page but if none are checked i want to disable the button

1374500
width	height
yes you do have to set the max width and height together using a size instance

1374565
inherited	properties
if you don t want a child class to inherited a properties you can declare it as private

1374584
put	get
if i copy something to the clipboard from visual studio before running the application there are a total of six objects in the clipboard various string formats and a locale which all get put in the cache

1374614
superclass	subclassing
the reason is when you define parameterised constructor in subclassing you want to override something from superclass

1374619
superclass	subclassing
what bothers me more is when i have a superclass a with two subclassing b and c and b and c both require the same 10 constructors with a bunch of parameters

1374694
postgresql	mysql
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation

1374750
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
in my dropdownlistfor i have a list of checkbox and textblocks this works fine

1374768
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
the amount of physical ram in your box does not directly correlate to how much memory you can allocate with calloc malloc realloc

1374811
superclass	subclassing
the concrete class compiles fine because b extends a and since java 5 a return type on a subclassing can be a subclassing of the return type on the superclass

1374908
cat	tee
another way is to use cat and tee as follows

1374914
width	height
i m not really interested in the merits of this approach but rather wish to understand why jquery seems to be unable to get the width and height as defined in the css for a anchor in safari

1374914
width	height
onclick pop-up alert in other browsers toolbar no directories no location no resizable yes menubar no scrollbars yes status no width 800px height 560px top 20 left 240

alert in safari toolbar no directories no location no resizable yes menubar no scrollbars yes status no width 0px height 0px top 20 left 640

1374918
vb.net	vb6
darin has it right but just one stylistici point to expand on pavel minaev s comment unlike vb6 in vb.net setting your sw reference to nothing has no real effect

1374927
google-chrome	firefox
i am looking for a way to launch a file located on our local file network for use via our local intranet using firefox or google-chrome

1374931
children	parent
the parent owns its children which in turn owns its children and so on

1374931
children	parent
the children a parent owns may also be the children of other children the parent owns

1374982
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome

1375003
distance	altitude
also keep in mind that if i have 2 points are at the same ocean altitude but a mountain exists between the 2 points - the distance package should account for this

1375012
msisdn	sms
for example we send large numbers of sms using a 3rd-party aggregator service and each sms has an originator field which can be a phone number specifically a msisdn or a text value

1375020
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome take in the html source code and render it as the character ã latin small a with acute

1375021

file start of my network file.xlsx appears to work in google-chrome as well sometimes firefox hics up on it

1375026
iconvertible	iequatable
the numeric value types are icomparable iformattable iconvertible icomparable and iequatable but nothing that seems to have any arithmetic capabilities

1375036
rss	feed
as there was no obvious way of sharing map data from the map page itself i thought maybe i could pull the location data out of the rss feed

1375043
int	double
i hesitate to even suggest this but you might consider runtime checks against the type of t in the method and throw if t is not an int long short float or double

1375045
post	get
you could have pagename.html resubmit as post via ajax if it s loaded as a get request though

1375061
distance	altitude
if the distance formula you re using does not take the altitude of the two points as parameters in addition to the latitudes and longitudes of the two points then it does not factor in altitude to the distance calculation

1375061
distance	altitude
in any event altitude difference does not have a very significant effect on calculated distance

1375061
distance	altitude
as usual with gps the difference in distance calculations that altitude would make is probably smaller than the error in most commercial gps devices anyway so in most applications altitude can be safely dispensed with altitude measurements themselves are pretty inaccurate with commercial gps devices although survey data on altitudes is quite accurate

1375088
ironruby	ironpython
as for dynamic - it doesn t really help in this case unless you fancy letting your users write code in ironpython ironruby

1375105
nspanel	nsmatrix
now i want the nspanel object which contains this nsmatrix to resize to wrap nicely around it

1375105
nspanel	nsmatrix
the nspanel also has a button at the bottom which should be under the nsmatrix

1375149
distance	altitude
postgresql does not factor in altitude when calculating distance

1375155
internationalization	translation
i ve found that the simplest approach to internationalization is to simply maintain a list of all the different pieces of text in your application labels buttons form captions etc. in a spreadsheet or tab-delimited file of some sort and then send this file to the translators to add in one additional column for each language all the translation

1375258
arcgis	proj
you can create such linestrings automatically with softwares like arcgis and others using a line between two points and a surface file such as the ones provided freely by nasa srtm proj

1375261
inherited	properties
to be able to change properties and subscribe to events of controls inherited from your parent form or usercontrol the parent form should set those controls modifiers properties to protected or in general to any value such that fields generated for controls in parent form are visible to the child form

1375263
cos	sin
asin sin lat1 cos d r +

1375263
cos	sin
cos lat1 sin d r cos î

atan2	sin	cos	sin	cos	atan2
atan2 sin î sin d r cos lat1

1375263
cos	sin
cos d r âˆ sin lat1 sin lat2

1375265
inherited	properties
then in your inherited form you can either set up an event handler for the execinvoked event you can probably do this using the events list in the properties grid or you can override the onexecinvoked method

1375308
button	checkbox
i was given the code below to disable a button on an asp.net page if none of the checkbox are checked and to enable it if any checkbox get checked

1375308
button	checkbox
it disables the button fine when the page loads and no boxes are checked but never hits the .cb .change setbutton code to enable the button when i check one of the checkbox

1375314
unix	aix
this has to work on windows xp server 2003 8 etc and 3 different distros of unix aix sun and hp

1375400
mouseover	mouseout
the trouble is that the mouseout event of the menu item fires before the mouseover event of the div

1375405
post	get
i would post this under the top answer but apparently this site by design requires that you get 50 reputation points before you can respond in the thread-appropriate location.

1375419
mouseover	mouseenter
you can use mouseenter instead of mouseover

1375444
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
if it s because trygetvalue doesn t throw an argumentexception but instead throws an argumentnullexception you should be safe in fixing it

1375488
qobject	qwidget
however when looking in the property editor only the qobject and qwidget properties are visible

1375499
rss	feed
this is great for things like atom or rss feed which was the original reason i designed the library

1375591
client-side	server-side
the advantage is that you use standard mechanisms and that you can access them for doing server-side as well as client-side validation

1375605
min	max
i guess i would try a max or min on the two other tables

1375641
int	double
if p is a primitive numeric data type float double int etc it should probably be in lowercase

1375641
int	double
also since it translates to if x and y where int and p were float or double you might not get the answer you expect

1375646
firefox	safari
it works fine on firefox and safari but when i test it in ie the background is being removed

1375741
min	max
t make sense from a business perspective but hey... then you can use min or max whichever you prefer

1375747
getter	setter
it actually populates the object using the fields setter getter

1375877
put	get
while i dont think it can be put in the place of the actual start menu search going to thier site and getting involved will probably get you a lot closer to where you want to go

1375882
min	max
i cannot perform abs max min or conditional checks with the scripting applicaiton i am using

1375920
postgresql	mysql
mysql vs postgresql for web applications

mbunit	mstest
we had a test project that started out as mbunit v3 gallio but decided to go to mstest

1376046
mbunit	mstest
we took out the gallio mbunit tests and added the reference to the mstest stuff microsoft.visualstudio.qualitytools.unittestframework and swapped out the c# attributes to use mstest verbiage testmethod etc but when attempting to run tests visual studio doesn t see the tests at all

1376054
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout do transitions from 0 to 100 but the above will allow you to fade to an arbitrary opacity

1376089
rss	feed
i got the urls from the rss feed but the feed does not include the full text

1376095
pull	push
you need to push state to the client as well as pull state

1376163
for-loop	loops
the other comments about the test in the for-loop looking suspect are probably correct but in addition if you re getting this segfault the first time you try to go into loops then it s possible that you re working with a dictionary that has no entries

1376186
put	get
if i put the list initialization before the class i get

1376230
jobs	cron
i think you can use memcache on other systems and set cron jobs on them tool

1376284
freebsd	linux
this linux computer was followed by a hp ux machine the hp ux followed by a freebsd

1376337
multiplying	add
to calculate the total bytes over a given time interval you should find the index closest to the starting and ending point and multiplying the value of y by the spacing of your x-points and add them all together

1376347
hide	show
jquery to allows the user to go back to an image that they have previously seen and hide the last show div at the bottom

1376358
int	double
how does the serializer know whether it should be an int a string a double or something else .

1376375
post	get
you should think about ajax requests like you think about regular form requests and their get and post

1376394
prepare	pdostatement
within pdo use prepare statements the pdostatement object

1376415
ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	centos
yum install php-soap for centos or apt-get install php-soap for debian ubuntu etc

1376416
post	get
you should use get and post requests in ajax calls just as you would use get and post requests in normal calls

1376426
int	double
the key and value types are both restricted to the basic .net types bool byte all the int float double guid datetime and string

1376455

1376595
filtering	grouping
the authorize filtering allows you to specified grouping of users that can access a controller or action

1376596
globalization	localization
i d recommend reading the wpf globalization and localization section on msdn since this is usually done a bit differently in wpf than it was in windows forms

1376619
google-chrome	firefox
this appear to work fine too until i reload a page and then the page is all messed up in firefox and in google-chrome if i use any comments like this in css

1376634
fixed-point	fractions
unless you can represent the number ranges you need whole and fractions part using a 16-bit fixed-point number there will be no storage difference between float and 32-bit int

1376635
subtract	add
you can still compare sort add or subtract speeds

1376669
division	modulo
incidentally another old approach is to perform pairs of integer division and modulo operations .

1376684
int	chars
make the two chars a short and drop the last 4 bits which is the same as dividing it by 16 and getting the int part

division	multiplication
you also have a performance gain in that sinse using bitwise operations is a little bit faster than using multiplication division despite this gain is almost insignificant for actual computers

1376696
winpcap	libpcap
take a look at libpcap winpcap

1376723
osql	bcp
you could use system.diagnostics.process to run the sqlcmd or osql or bcp programs to dump out csv files

1376763
width	height
if you need sizes changed dinamically try to put your content inside a vbox for example of any relative container and use minwidth minheight to set it up otherwise canvas is a component so is whould have width and height properties

1376784
unix	bsd
although the application apis are the same or similar for unix and windows and both implementations are historically based on the same berkeley sockets bsd code the operating system architecture and hence the ways you access low level os functions such as network io are completely different

1376787
children	parent
you can then easily locate arbitrary nodes and find parent and children

1376793
openbsd	linux
i don t know if it will work on all unixes i ve tested linux and openbsd but you can try this instead

1376837
qtoolbutton	qpushbutton
if neither of those help you might investigate how qpushbutton and qtoolbutton are declared to see if that gives you any hints

1376852
width	height
to get the swf width and height in

1376866
sin	sqrt
then let r sqrt -2 log u and return x r sin 2 pi v

1376891
getter	setter
the person class is a simple getter setter each type being of string name address except dateofbirth which is datetime

1376892
rss	feed
you should definitely be able to get the coordinate data from the mymaps rss feed

1376947
g++	gcc
windows vista eclipse 3.5.0 and gdb make gcc 3.4.4 g++ 3.4.4 enabled through cygwin and environmental variable is already set

1376947
g++	gcc
my second problem is that i have set up path but i cannot run g++ --version and gcc --version in the windows command while make gdb gcc-3 and g++-3 work

1376967
ggplot2	lattice
i am trying to plot lattice type data with ggplot2 and then superimpose a normal distribution over the sample data to illustrate how far off normal the underlying data is

1377042
lemmatization	stemming
by the way stemming or lemmatization is the term you re looking for

1377049
stdout	fflush
btw maybe you have to add fflush stdout

1377060
nswindow	nspanel
the origin of an nspanel nswindow frame is always the bottom-left corner it s measured from the screen origin

1377145
retaincount	dealloc
the nsmutableset will retain the place so the retaincount will never go to zero and dealloc will never be called

1377167
verilog	vhdl
we sell obufuscators to people designing circuits in vhdl and verilog

1377169
mvp	presenter
the way i have done mvp is to have the presenter have a single method called initialize which takes the view as an argument

1377169
mvp	presenter
one way to think of mvp is that the presenter is manipulating the view through the views interface

1377174
disk	ram
i know others have talked about swap and memory availability and i would recommend that you set up at least a small swap partition ironically even if it s on a ram disk .

1377190
width	height
width 250 height 250 status 1 im

1377246
move	drag
every second time the control size shrinks ie drag the the border one pixel i get a scroll bar on the bottom which can t move at all not even one pixel

1377264
minimum	max
if you only need to know the minimum or max remaining in the stack then esrogs is optimal

1377318
punctuation	words
what has worked best for me is to sanitize and tokenize the addresses get rid of punctuation split things up into words and then just see how many tokens match up

1377377
put	get	post	put	post	get
if not then either add the variables to be sent via post in .send or change the method to get and put your variables in the url

1377384
versioning	upgrade
also because the maintenance release only contains one small change they don t need to go through an extensive uat process whereas if they upgrade to the next normal release which could be several versioning on they would be receiving maybe 30 or 40 product changes that in their risk-averse opinion require extensive uat

1377408
versioning	upgrade
you ll have to put up with supporting multiple versioning of your software because some customers just won t upgrade

1377486
mouse	keyboard
it seems like you re already halfway there to your own custom solution but as an alternate you might want to check out synergy an open source keyboard and mouse extender

1377497
munin	cacti
there are a lot of monitoring tools out there that can be taught how to watch db2 but one of the most versatile and widely used is rrdtool either on its own with a collection of custom db2 scripts or as part of a cacti or munin installation which automates many but not all aspects of working with rrdtool

1377518
g++	gcc
some tools in eclipse need to launch gcc or g++ to generate some sort of info

1377570
multiplying	multiplication
squaring a number is just multiplying the number with itself so that is just a simple multiplication

1377593
width	height
this seems to be it just googled for xna screen width height myself

1377641
versioning	upgrade
this is the default from sql 2000 onwards but if you ve upgrade from an older versioning then the old default will still be active

1377652
pypdf	xhtml2pdf
you will also need to install the following modules xhtml2pdf html5lib pypdf with easy_install

1377691
wordpress	joomla
when working with open source project like wordpress drupal joomla i always find in the php pages a syntax like this is an example from drupal

1377749
firefox	safari
i don t know how cross browser compatible it is it works in firefox and safari but you could try this solution

1377750
pull	push
i intend for them to push pull into their individual repository when they complete an assignment or are given a new one

1377780
width	height
it would only search for .jpg files but for every file i would calculate a hash value over the first 1024 bytes then append the width height and size of the image to it to get a string like 875234 640 480 13286 which i would use as key for the image

1377861
javadb	hsqldb
if not you could either use the javadb or hsqldb and the use sql scripts to create the database

1377868
hide	show
those tools would show the php tags as just that or even hide them completely

1377871
google-chrome	safari
i m having an issue with the visualization of my site on google-chrome and safari both using webkit rendering engine the site is built upon symfony framework version 1.1 unmaintained version

1377888
hide	show
i want to hide that input and browse button which show when i type

1377895
post	get
if you want to see the code for yourself i suggest you either get reflector and do it yourself which everyone should have already or more simply look in the revision history of this post since there is nothing i can do about that

1377995
post	get
i would suggest checking the value received by php the one in the _request array if that has missing characters check the post or get request that is sent on the wire use firebug or similar

1378013
stdout	stderr
with ipc run i run commands like i would do with system array which is much more secure and i can bind to stdin stdout and stderr separately using variables or callbacks which is very cool when you ll be in situation that you have to pass data to external program from long-running code

1378025
google-chrome	firefox
i have linkbuttons inside table columns and want to display tooltip even if it is disabled..this worked fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8 as ie8 disabled elements don t receive any events i tried this workaround

1378025
google-chrome	firefox
but again ie8 applies the jquery generated code to the table cell as well as the span and so my tooltip generates 2 times making it appear bolder.......i don t want this.this works fine in firefox and google-chrome

1378066
onfocus	onblur
i like to know what the onfocus event is if there will be any when i receive an onblur event in my javascript handler

1378066
onfocus	onblur
so if an onblur event occurs i only want to forward it when i notice that it s not followed by an onfocus event on another textbox in the group

1378078
prepare	execute
prepare statements get cached and the resulting access program similar to an access plan but actually a jvm program is reused the programs for execute statements are not cached

1378092
multiplying	add
if you assume the simple o nâ² approach to multiplying a by b then for each bit in a you have to shift b and add it to an accumulator if that bit is one

1378129
ant	maven
i m migrating a medium sized java application s build from ant to maven

1378129
ant	maven
the easiest way would be to call the original ant scripts through the ant plugin but i thought maybe i should look around first for some maven support

1378129
debian	linux
for linux now i think we only have a tar.gz and some bash scripts to start the daemons - a debian rpm package would be much nicer maybe with dependent package definitions too

1378133
versioning	upgrade
if people are running scripts that they do not check or maintain when they upgrade oracle versioning then let them suffer the consequences of that choice

1378151
hide	show
i could also create dozens of loaders one for every image and hide every loader except the one that i want show

1378151
hide	show
when i want to animation to continue i hide the current one and show the next one

1378164
mouse	keyboard
which suggests the error occured during cgxgriduserdragselectrangeimp onlbuttonup which seems a bit odd as i don t think there was a mouse keyboard screen button pressed at the time

1378180
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
if you know that the stream will always contain a bitset don t use an objectoutputstream - and if space is a premium then convert the bitset to a set of bytes where each bit corresponds to a bit in the bitset then write that directly to the underlying stream a fileoutputstream as in your example

1378198
retaincount	dealloc
in dealloc its retaincount goes down by one but it won t be released completely since you now have ownership

1378255
karatsuba	strassen
there exist algorithms more efficient than o n 2 to multiply two numbers see karatsuba pollard schã nhageâ strassen etc.

serializable	deserialization
system.invalidoperationexception error during serializable or deserialization using the json javascriptserializer

1378333
webrat	cucumber
i have been using cucumber and webrat for a while

1378336
pygtk	gio
as important as the toolkit is its underpinnings with pygtk you use glib as well with its filesystem abstractions python module gio that are very important for the linux desktop its high-level cross-desktop functions such as glib.get_user_data_dir and its other application framework tools and gobject and its property and signals model

1378349
tostring	icomparable
instead of adding strings create a class that implements icomparable and overrides tostring

1378366
dictionary	map
if you need to map a 1-n relation and map it as dictionary rather then list then read dictionary based collections

1378399
folder	directory
i ve been developing my first iphone app part-time and would like to start using a more rigorous form of version control than i ve been using over the past four months copying source code folder to another directory and time stamping them

1378419
cvs	svn
if you don t like svn i think xcode supports cvs too

1378429
post	get
rather long winded post but this will get you started

1378446
perforce	cvs
i just looked in xcode 3.2 though so it may not be exactly the same and the options for source control integration are subversion cvs and perforce

1378483
post	get
it varies especially when it comes to get queries or post requests but i d estimate it about 0.5â 1k

1378486
distance	polygons
test if the next point of the polygons is inside or outside a circle with a radius of detailradius around the current point that is if the distance between the current and the next point is smalleer or larger then detailradius

1378545
for-loop	arrays
make an empty arrays data at the beginning of for-loop

1378563
opera	google-chrome
ie8 ff3.5 google-chrome 2 opera 9.5 correctly renders these elements without the spacing

1378569
for-loop	loops
assuming loops length is an integral constant expression the most probable outcome it that a good optimizer will recognize both the for-loop and the memset 0

1378686
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

1378686
equals	gethashcode
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two object do not have to return different values

1378686
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode method for an object must consistently return the same hash code as long as there is no modification to the object state that determines the return value of the object s equals method

1378686
equals	gethashcode
types that override equals must also override gethashcode

1378686
post	get
i can then create one post as the accepted answer to get it on top with just a table of contents

1378720
ubuntu	linux
i m using qt 4.5 2009.03 on linux gnome ubuntu 9.04 and would like to display video captured by my webcam in a phonon videowidget of my qt application

types that override equals must also override gethashcode

1378796
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

1378796
equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode question

post	get
i have read many different post on forums and articles on how to try and get around the en-us problem but i cannot seem to get around it and hope that someone here can help

1378955
folder	directory
you should place your view in the views employment folder of your mvc.net application directory

1378995
ant	maven
the non-dvcs way to handle it is to set up your build process to read the connection strings from separate config file and then preprocess it during the build process in java you could use ant or maven to filter from a properties file i don t know about ms-land

1379046
liferay	alfresco
for examples of such programs checkout alfresco liferay etc

1379078
versioning	upgrade
if management is nervous about changing framework versioning you could upgrade to vs2008 and use c# 3 but still target .net 2.0

1379109
versioning	upgrade
it s always easier to upgrade versioning by versioning than it is to jump several versioning

1379109
versioning	upgrade
upgrade that jumped multiple versioning required a signficantly larger amount of extra code and testing

1379127
ubuntu	centos
the following code works as expected on centos and ubuntu o s but not on red hat

1379127
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 2.6.24-19-generic #1 smp wed jun 18 14 43 41 utc 2008 i686 gnu linux

1379163
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
well the file name would be server-side so it shouldn t matter if you use ie6 or firefox or google-chrome or opera

1379190
centos	linux
i ve got both red hat enterprise linux and centos boxes here i know they re the same thing

1379197
versioning	upgrade
so if you get a new mac with snow leopard or you upgrade to snow leopard it includes both a 32-bit and 64-bit versioning of java 6

1379275
for-loop	loops
but if i have a loops that needs to some post statement i d use for-loop like this

1379291
for-loop	loops
refer to the other posts - looking at for-loop someone thinks the incrementor is declared within loops

1379303
getter	setter
that said you may want to use getter and or setter methods and use delegates on those

1379308
int	chars
i m not relying on ascii int conversion and am rather using an array of chars

1379311
boost	stl
as to your rationale against boost its templates are an order of a magnitude more flexible than what you can find in stl functional header

1379340
int	chars
about 1 2 of the data is text and the other half is either chars fields or int

1379346
post	get
i would use the http post or get interfaces with curl

1379363
division	modulo
you need integer division and modulo

1379367
comparator	comparable
see comparable or comparator for a

1379375
profiling	instrumentation
do some profiling using the instrumentation app found in the same directory as xcode

1379407
nunit	typemock	nunit	moq	moq	typemock
typemock is a commercial product meaning you ll have to pay for it but will allow you to mock concrete objects - unlike rhinomocks nunit moq which can only mock an interface abstract class

1379422
tiff	png
however in the article i believe it explains a way to convert the tiff image to a jpeg or a png which is supported by silverlight

1379436
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation is your friend in this regard and has many excellent profiling tools for finding memory leaks how much memory you re using detailed tracing of what code is running when and so on

1379436
profiling	instrumentation
personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time when it matters

1379446
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
a tiff file is a multi-page format so rendering it is not as simple as a png gif or bmp

1379485
nunit	moq
mocking sharepoint classes is not possible with rhinomock moq nunit etc since i believe they require interfaces to mock objects rather then being able to mock the actual concrete classes

1379497
operands	scalar
they differ in how the operands are evaluated as well as whether or not they operate on arrays or scalar

1379509
gif	png
when you load bitmap from gif png jpg formats they will be opened as an encodedimage anyway and if you do this many times it may beat performance ex 50 seconds to load 14 png from resources to bitmaps on bold avg size 80 kb tuned up to 2 seconds loading into encodedimages

1379542
hide	show
to switch between the widgets i simply hide the one i am leaving and show the one i am going to

1379551
stringwriter	xpathdocument
then instance the xpathdocument by retreiving the xml string from the stringwriter

the min and max functions can take an arbitrary number of input arguments math.max val1 val2 ... valn

1379607
jsr168	jsr286
the two sun specifications in question that we want to duplicate are jsr168 and jsr286

1379607
jsr168	jsr286
also i suspect this question has been caused by a misunderstanding on our part of how the jsr168 jsr286 specification works

1379607
jsr168	jsr286
i think that jsr168 jsr286 is an arcane protocol for communicating some sort of content between separate applications but in the java world that tends to be done by other methods such as soap

1379668
folder	directory
ignore the bin and obj folder for each directory when it comes to commits as well

1379680
sunos	aix
it seemed to on sunos but always said no on the other two aix hpux and i couldn t seem to come up with a library off the top of my head i could guarantee it would find

my app launches in landscape mode rather then portrait

1379816
formview	detailsview	gridview	formview	gridview	detailsview
for any column in a gridview or field in a formview or field in a detailsview there can only be one templatefield

1379845
for-loop	loops
in the specific case of an infinite loops i might choose a for-loop over a while loops for that reason

1379875
post	get
you can also get the id of the current post being displayed by

1379878
folder	directory
it obviously is looking on the wrong directory cause the project folder is in my desktop

1379902
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
setting the datatemplate s grid s width and height to be larger than the cell with a negative margin can produce a close result but if you resize the column the problem shows itself again

1379969
stdout	stderr
i don t see any sort of log file and no output is written to stdout or stderr

1379973
floating-point	integer
beyond number.max_safe_integer + 1 9007199254740992 the ieee-754 floating-point format can no longer represent every consecutive integer

1379979
for-loop	loops
you might want to use a do-while loops instead of a for-loop so the code is processed at least once before conditions are checked and met or not

1379992
qstackedwidget	qwidget
then it adds this qwidget to a qstackedwidget pagestack using

qstackedwidget	qwidget
later i want to connect a certain signal from a different qwidget hub to setcurrentwidget ... of the qstackedwidget in order to switch the page

1380017
hex	binary
a hash function might be defined to avoid â fixed pointsâ where hash x x but your hash-quine differs a little in that you re taking the string representation in hex of the hash rather than the raw binary

1380064
ready	each
pretty much creating a new instance of the program which will be passed along each user control until the user is ready to submit to the database

1380071
int	boolean
you should also ensure that get_original_passhash is returning the right type of variable - int string boolean etc

1380089
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work fine in google-chrome ie firefox

1380121
django	web2py
once you ve learned web2py you have to be careful learning django that you start fresh with no translation from old concepts to new

1380144
client-side	server-side
a lot of the solutions i ve seen are client-side - i think a server-side solution makes more sense for my needs since i can give feedback to the user if the javascript is invalid and only save it on the server once it s clean

1380153
post	get
many many times on a page i will have to set post and get values in php like this

1380172
onclick	onchange
onclick or onchange for a selectbox is the same thing as a onselect

1380175
ienumerable	icollection
use icollection product or ienumerable product or iproduct productbase . br

1380203
pop-up	dialog
pop-up is a dialog extended from a jframe

1380203
pop-up	dialog
i tried using a boolean variable and a loop to check if something was entered in the pop-up but it doesnt work the dialog is desplayed but there is not textfield or ok button so the only thing i can do is to kill it

1380273
pop-up	dialog
if possible you should re-implement pop-up to inherit from dialog instead of jframe and call dialog s setmodal true method which will prevent subsequent code from running until the dialog is dismissed

1380290
width	height
for example the list would contain the best data type and size for id ip address email subject summary description content url date timestamp and human readable geo points media height media width media duration etc

1380296
equals	tostring
you ll get 714341252076979100 instead of this number because tostring as described by ecma-262 â 9.8.1 works with powers of ten and in 53 bit precision all these numbers are equals

1380303
children	parent
well i m a little worried about where to put the user controls and the forms children and parent the helpers classes and so on

1380324
post	get
this post talks about boosting the default sample rate of the accelerometer functions so that you can get a pretty fine-grained picture of the user s movements

1380334
pull	push
google was at least initially going to implement a gchat api you could use for a push pull implementation

1380340
post	get
and when you do get a small sample that reproduces the error you ve also got something you can post here for us to peek through

1380364
int	boolean
as written the boolean conversion will also succeed to convert to any int type

1380369
serializable	deserialization
boost has a very nice serializable deserialization lib boost.serialization

1380390
decltype	auto
and since the inner class here is private no client code can possibly declare a variable of that type auto and decltype in c++0x provide a way though

1380391
union	distinct
solution use union all instead unless you really need the implicit distinct that it forces

1380480
opera	google-chrome
in ie8 opera and google-chrome it works just the way

1380503
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m dealing with uinavigationcontroller in my application all handled by an uitabbarcontroller

1380512
fadein	fadeout
the reason you need to use animate rather then fadein and fadeout is because of a weird bug with fadein fadeout and the hover event

1380517
accessor	superclass
the idea of having to open up a superclass to make changes to an accessor may not be simple and may not always be an option

1380517
superclass	subclassing
the real reason that you would want to keep a member private is so that an instance of a subclassing could not have unexpected access to the members of an instance of a superclass that should remain locked

1380566
getter	setter
the three getter and setter are all identical except for the object property they are modifying x y z

1380567
boost	stl
i m already using stl to maintain platform portability and would prefer not to add another library dependency like boost

1380601
multiplying	multiplication
second if you you want your multiplication to be correctly rounded as in ieee-754 you will sometimes need the low part of the multiplying in order to deliver the correct rounded result

1380608
rss	feed
also u can once define hooks like generating an rss atom feed for all the operations on particular table

1380650
nsmutablestring	nsstring
that way it can t change out from under you if somebody passes in an nsmutablestring which is valid â it is a kind of nsstring

1380656
gridview	formview
i would suggest using a gridview control with autogeneratecolumns set to true instead of a formview control

1380678
int	double
3.0 is considered a double 3 is considered an int

1380717
sorting	filtering

i would like to run these on a project that is now in a bazaar repo so i was wondering how i could get a copy of the bazaar repo on my machine and then translate it to a svn standard so pysvn can use it

1380756
bazaar	svn
i found some documentation on going svn to bazaar but not the other way around

1380778
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i haven t used it for bazaar but i have used tailor to keep an svn repo in sync with a git repo

size on disk might be different if you move the file to another filesystems fat16 ntfs ext3 etc

1380883
put	get
what i would do is get firebug and put in the following just before your loop

1380899
min	max
the sql functions max and min

1380919
put	get
to get the arrow in the cell put this in your tableview cellforrowatindexpath method

1380920
integer	fractions
if you want to exactly represent all the possible 3-decimal-place fractions you would be better off using an integer and multiply the values by 1000

1380953
folder	directory
when you run your web application your current or working directory is most likely the bin folder of your application server

1380958
integer	unsigned
numeric id auto_increment primary keys use an unsigned integer

1380970
autofac	castle-windsor
i like autofac because i like the philip k dick reference but castle-windsor is great

1380988
gtk	wnck
import gtk wnck

1380989
put	get
if not tweak it until you get the appropriate behavior and put the new expression in the linq statement

1381066
vtk	paraview
there are other packages built on top of this such as mayavi and paraview but the vtk wrappers alone are often easier to use

1381136
children	parent
so you would have the parent run a loop to fork off 10 processes and in the children you do whatever you wanted to do concurrently

1381164
hash	salt
the garbage prepended to the passwordproxy is a salt to avoid the rainbow attack mentioned it will make your password hash different from just hashing the base string

1381175
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have the following drop down menu and the background looks black in google-chrome but white on firefox ie safari across windows linux mac

1381184
hash	md5
it replaces the default insert with something you define for example an md5 hash of one of the inserted columns

1381187
children	parent
i have a parent children classes as follows

1381200
background-color	transparency
why are you using background-color transparency

1381201
serializable	deserialization
most languages not sure about c# give you some way to read and write raw bytes so do all of the serializable deserialization memberwise instead of a singular memory block and the packing padding problems go away

1381227
hash	salt
if you use safe hash function see hash function and hash algos in php documentation it should be pretty safe you may consider using salt hash and also add some protections to the form itself

1381233
bazaar	svn
you can use bzr-svn plugin to push bazaar branch into svn repo

1381309
put	get
to get the installer to put entries under hklm the installation has to be marked as permachine the default seems to be peruser as done below

1381326
int	boolean
is a struct containing a boolean hasvalue and an int

1381327
int	boolean
i m not 100 sure but i believe it should be 8 bytes 4 bytes for the int32 and since every thing has to be 4-byte aligned on a 32 bit machine 4 bytes for a boolean indicating whether the int value has been specified or not

1381334
postgresql	informix
i have done simple python utilities that shows schema info for informix oracle and postgresql

1381340
put	get
the closest you could get it to use codedom to generate some code - you ll need to produce a wrapper module and a function with return then put the expression from the database into that return - compile it and check for compile errors run it and see the result

1381346
rss	feed
i have a website which fetches information from rss feed periodically well currently manually and this is my problem

1381376
division	multiplication
multiplication and division of decimals will result in a decimal that has a scaling factor that is the sum of the scaling factors of the two decimal operands

1381377
x86	64bit
agree with previous commenter that this is probably something you don t want to do but for me setting a conditional breakpoint at the last instruction on eax or rax if you are on 64bit x86 works just fine

1381386
opera	firefox
edit havenard made me realize i was typing the wrong characters because my browser opera was displaying them badly so now i m using firefox to edit this question and hopefully it ll be clear

1381393
getter	setter
if your getter and setter are a carryover in practice from something like java then do not write them

1381393
getter	setter
on the theme of getter and setter in python the general consensus as i understand it is don t write em til you need em. only write setter and getter if they actually add value to your program like protecting an internal data structure perhaps

1381441
client-side	server-side
you might think of the field as an analogy to javascript validation - we might do a quick client-side check for the user s convenience but we still do a proper server-side test and enforce it for all requests

1381448
hash	md5
i ve got an old application that has user passwords stored in the database with an md5 hash

1381448
hash	md5
the first time the user authenticates after this replace the md5 password hash with the sha password hash and set the flag

1381448
hash	md5
the first time the user authenticates after this hash the password with sha and store it in the new field probably delete their md5 hash at the same time

1381454
versioning	upgrade
currently the easiest solution if you have a 32-bit intel processor is to upgrade to snow leopard which includes 32-bit and 64-bit versioning of java 6

1381464
hash	md5
there s no way to reverse the md5 so you have to wait for the user to authenticate again to create a new hash

1381481
opera	firefox
on the page linked to by the answer to my previous related question it states for firefox and opera a simple check of event type will determine if it is domcontentloaded

1381482
salt	md5
if the md5 s aren t salt you can always use a decryption site rainbow tables such as to get the passwords

1381485
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
hashtype is either sha1 or md5 salt is a random string used to salt the raw password and at last comes the hash itself

1381493
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	centos	linux
for that simply install some linux distro ubuntu or centos for example and play with it for a while to learn the libraries and apis

1381530
hide	show
if a user picks usa then a state dropdown list is below it if any other country is selected then it will show a different text input box and hide the dropdown list

1381574
versioning	upgrade
alternatively you can recommend that you don t have to upgrade frameworks just because there s a new versioning out or because the framework is no longer being maintained

1381589
versioning	upgrade
if ci comes out with a newer versioning i have to go back and upgrade multiple apps

1381612
exponent	modulo
the rsa encryption algorithm is based on the fact that if you have two publicly known numbers which are two parts of one public key the exponent e and the modulo n then given a message m it is easy to compute c m e mod n

1381635
post	get
however in trying both post and get data for the three variables i need userid tag hour and tag minute the page 404 s

1381635
post	get
tried using both post and get data

1381683
jar	war
and i added the jar to the web-inf lib and make the war all this with maven and deploy in tomcat and it works also i deploy it in websphere 7 and also works

1381684
accessor	properties
you can hide the internal memory optimizations behind your properties accessor and the xmlserializer wouldn t even know

1381739
mouse	keyboard
however every time my program executes the java program a java window is created in my dock with an annoying animation and most importantly steals the focus of my mouse and keyboard

1381785
filesystems	ntfs
these documents are stored on a windows server with ntfs filesystems

1381826
temporary	tablespace
they are not cached in memory they are written to the temporary tablespace

1381864
jar	manifest.mf
the classpath set in the manifest.mf file in the jar that you build must specify the classpath for finding all related jars on the remote machine - you have to find where that jar is installed and then add that path to the manifest classpath

1381865
tstringlist	tlist
do everything above the same way except use a tlist instead of tstringlist

1381871
julian	difference
i would convert the two dates in julian day and then do the difference but i would have to check if this is a good solution with no drawbacks first

1381875
opera	firefox
if you want it for yourself then use opera has them built-in very well implemented and integrated with fast forward which guesses next page on most sites add extension to firefox search for mouse gestures - few options are available or install system-wide gestures xgestures for os x stroke-it for windows

1381877
onclick	onsubmit
in my case i had a button with an onclick event so i moved the function call with the added return keyword to the onsubmit event

1381895
single-quotes	double-quotes
the lookaheads assert that if there are any double-quotes single-quotes or parentheses ahead of the current match position there s an even number of them and the parens are in balanced pairs no nesting allowed

1381921
perforce	svn
practical perforce the red bean book svn eric sink s blog vault etc all have good insights

1381982
onclick	onchange
onenter and ongotfocus seem to be too early and onchange won t fire just for clicking a link but the control s onclick event might do the trick

1381983
hide	show
if a user selects usa then it will show the usa state list and hide the other state text input

1381983
hide	show
if a user selects a country other then the usa then it should hide the usa state list and show the state input text box

1381983
hide	show
however if you select the usa it will show the state dropdown list which is great but it fails to hide the state text input box

1382010
ssl	https
i m not sure about iis 6 but in iis 7 you select the site and go to bindings and click add select https it will automaticaly chose port 443 and then chose your ssl cerificate

1382024
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
locations.xcdatamodel waypoint.description warning waypoint.description -- property name conflicts with a method already on nsobject or nsmanagedobject

1382024
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
locations.xcdatamodel waypoint.description warning waypoint.description -- property name conflicts with a method already on nsobject or nsmanagedobject

1382083
phpunit	simpletest
take a look into the simpletest plugin for eclipse it has phpunit support although i cannot verify if it works or not

1382105
put	get
basic operations get and put

1382116
folder	directory
i only want it to affect the uploads folder not the directory in which it s placed though

1382157
put	get
the next one is 1 query that would get you the whole results set and put the comment s order in all rows so you could then just check the first row s relevantcommentorder field inside php and then slice the array so it d display only relevant comments this one is only efficient if the whole results set is not too big

1382164
hide	show
your selection method clicking images seems ok as you d detect which image is clicked and show hide the corresponding panels

1382200
put	get	folder	directory
your customers appear to have their directory structure enforced -by you- but finding things that they did last week is easier if they only have to traverse the date remembering where they put something last week when they get to the six-digit unique number-named folder is going to be well difficult

1382231
hash	md5
if you wanted to hash using md5 you could do the following with the password before constructing the sql statement

1382243
hash	md5
note md5 as suggested above isn t the saffest sollution since currently there s a lot of databases over the internet with keywords associated to md5 hash variables making it easier to someone who wants to hack your system

1382245
x86	64bit
if the application you are trying to use to connect to oracle installs into the c program files x86 path on 64bit machine you will have to change the install path to something that doesn t have the in it like c program files_x86 due to a known bug in the oracle drivers that has yet to be fixed to my knowledge

1382318
post	get
i know there were similar post but i still do not get it

1382318
unsigned	short
bcc32 error unit1.cpp 830 e2357 reference initialized with unsigned short needs lvalue of type char

1382319
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
i know formats such as mp3 ogg and flac have tags such as artist album etc

1382323
width	height
setting the css of an anchor that has nothing to do with the presentation of the anchor seems kind of backwards just set it in the javascript to look for a.popup.large and set a certain width height for the popup

1382323
width	height
else look for a.popup and set a different height and width

1382330
unsigned	short
bcc32 error unit1.cpp 830 e2357 reference initialized with unsigned short needs lvalue of type char

1382330
unsigned	short
but key in somefunc1 is instead a word which i understand to be a typedef for unsigned short

1382330
unsigned	short
it seems to me that your c-style remedy is brutally reinterpreting which is the address of an unsigned short as the address of a char

1382337
hash	md5
1 create a new field in the users table that stores an md5 hash

1382340
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
give the special cookie a name like autologin and a value that contains their username and a salt md5 hash of their user data

1382340
hash	md5
split off the username and hash then fetch the account out of the database based on the username and re-do the md5 to compare to the cookie hash data

1382346
flac	ogg
ogg vorbis be careful to point out vorbis and flac share a tagging format called vorbis comments

1382406
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
as far as browser support goes itâ s great on all the majors and even some of the minors pc ie 5+ safari firefox opera 7+ omniweb and even konqueror

1382411
perl	tcl
unfortunately there are no global variables in pl pgsql although you can find ones in other pl languages that come with postgresql specifically in pl perl pl python and pl tcl

1382476
width	height
it would involve inserting an empty div in the main text and giving it a set width and height then placing the post-it over that same location with absolute positioning

1382476
width	height
dynamically determining the width height of the empty-div so that it matches that of the post-it can be pretty easily done with javascript

1382504
put	get
sometimes there is no convenient way to get the literal into the right type so you have to use a static_cast or put a constructor around the literal

1382520
cos	sin
basically calculate the circle as the x y cos a sin a and then multiple this both terms by a radius that s the appropriate function of the angle

1382522
bnd	maven-bundle-plugin
bnd and hence also maven-bundle-plugin follows this practice by default and automatically imports all exported packages

1382529
clisp	ecl
i am wondering if there is some way to call c++ code from common lisp preferably portably and if not preferably in sbcl and if not well then clozure clisp or ecl

1382537
qgraphicsview	qmainwindow	width	height
my qmainwindow contains a qgraphicsview which should ve minimum width and height

1382553
jquery	scriptaculous
i don t know about jquery but scriptaculous definitely doesn t support this

1382558
hash	salt
if the underlying vulnerability must be fixed then it is necessary to treat the submitted hash as a password in clear text which should then be hash with a salt preferably before comparison with a stored hash

1382576
solaris	bsd
- i d focus instead on whatever else the scripts the candidate will produce or maintain if hired are supposed to do -- linux kernel and sysadm issues or maybe windows or bsd or solaris ones -- or release engineering concepts version control systems distributed or otherwise bioinformatics.

1382649
subtract	add
one sensible way to handle this would be to compute internally with ordinary numbers which go from positive to negative at zero and only add subtract 100 for presentation

1382781
cos	sin
sin x+y sin x cos y + cos x sin y

1382781
cos	sin
cos x+y cos x cos y - sin x sin y

1382781
cos	sin
you can compute sin n x cos n x for n 0 1 2 .

1382781
cos	sin
iteratively from sin n-1 x cos n-1 x and the constants sin x cos x with 4 multiplications

1382781
cos	sin
of course that only works if you have to evaluate sin x cos x on an arithmetic sequence

1382859
ant	maven
netbeans nativly uses ant as its underlying build tool and recently can directly open maven projects in netbeans

1382859
ant	maven
hence your typical netbeans project can be compiled with ant and your maven project already is a netbeans project

1382859
ant	maven
using ant or maven means that every one can choose his her own ide to work one the code

1382859
ant	maven
in case of netbeans ant or maven is used so you can get all the advantages and disadvantages of those

1382859
ant	maven
as for the build tools themselves maven is significantly different from ant

1382895
svg	vml
if you don t mind using javascript check out cufon which uses svg vml to render whatever font in most web browsers used today even ie6

1382909
getter	setter
i thought of subclassing the unit class and overriding the getter and setter but that seems too messy

1382911
touchesbegan	touchesended
this class has its own implementations of touchesbegan touchesended etc

1382915
button	right-align
i have a very simple wpf window - the only thing in it is a right-align button

1382918
dictionary	map
if you store the dictionary itself in an array the values to which the word keys map could be just a list of the indices of the dictionary entries in the array in whose description the word appears

1382918
trie	tree
if you don t want to use a trie you could either use a hash table or some kind of binary tree

1382969
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
firefox 3.5 opera 10 and safari are expected to support css3 style font-embedding using ttf fonts google-chrome does not feature safari s support for css3 font embedding for some reason

1382969
fallback	eot
other browsers but not chrome apparently will try to use the eot then fallback to the ttf rendering

1382993
postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql
microsoft sql server oracle informix mysql postgresql sybase will all handle this situation easily

1383048
firefox	safari
even firebug canâ t see it but firefox and safari are rendering it - even without css at all

1383084
irrlicht	ogre3d
irrlicht crystalspace ogre3d to name just 3 off sourceforge s trove list

1383086
submit	submission
i want to fill a text field of a http form through java and then want to click on the submit button through java so as to get the page source of the document returned after submission the form

1383104
serializable	deserialization
the easiest way of fixing this is to patch the nsdate sqlpersistence category defined by sqlite persistent objects in nsdate-sqlitepersistence.m to include the timezone in the format string yyyy-mm-dd hh mm ss.ssss z during serializable and deserialization

1383163
post	get
for more details see sending arguments with get post methods

1383164
debian	linux
remember the software should still have the cross-platform functionality and if it is not possible then how can i made it for debian linux as i have made it on windows

1383178
multiplying	add
to convert a license plate to its underlying integer multiplying out the letter position a 0 b 1 etc by the proper power of 26 and the digits by the proper power of 10 and add them all together

1383211
int	double
internally date times are represented as a double where the signed int part is the number of days since december 30th 1899 and the fractions part is the unsigned offset of hours within the day

1383228
ubuntu	linux
although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution

1383230
int	chars
one trick is to use string.format which seamlessly converts between an int and its chars counterpart you can also use casts.

1383235
subtract	add
obviously you can add what a standard html page needs or subtract if already provided

1383254
stdout	stderr
i can t figure out how to log info-level messages to stdout but everything else to stderr

1383284
free	malloc
it does make a single malloc call but in my case i simply replaced this with a stub that returned a pointer to a static block and a corresponding free stub

1383355
cos	sin
static class may be considered a bunch of methods - you would use it if you just need to group some methods sample usage mathhelpers with methods like sin cos convertxtoy or to host extension methods

1383365
temp	tmp
c temp log1.py tmp

1383365
temp	tmp
c temp type tmp

1383402
getter	setter
note the below method doesn t actually work for setter only getter

1383403
button	checkbox
suppose a user checks a checkbox reviews the data and does not make any changes and then checks another checkbox and decides to update the data by clicking the save changes button

1383437
versioning	upgrade
assuming you use a decent source-control system this scheme will allow you to easily upgrade to newer versioning of third-party libraries and then merge those changes with the changes you ve made locally

1383450
int	chars
i wanted to ask whether the following statement where printf has been provided with a type int where it expected a type chars will invoke undefined behaviour

1383473
children	parent
first-child and last-child retrieve the list items if they are the first last children of their immediate parent

1383493
int	chars	int	double
variable arguments are subject to the default argument promotion eg chars will be promoted to int float to double that s the reason why you only have a single format specifier to print both single and double precision floating point values

1383493
int	chars
so passing an int instead of a chars is perfectly valid and even desirable as chars literals are of type int anyway

1383493
int	chars
according to the c99 spec section 7.19.6.1 â 8 on seeing the conversion specifier c printf expects an argument of type int and will then go on and cast this value to unsigned chars

1383514
twitter	bit.ly
you can use bit.ly twitter uses this

1383560
put	get
the unfortunate truth is that no matter what barricade you put in the way if the honestly want in they ll get in

1383567
mbunit	nunit
flipping to the appendix in osherove s the art of unit testing i d start with nunit and try mbunit or xunit if it didn t meet my needs

1383581
width	height
when you set the minimum width and height of your graphics view it sets a flag somewhere that the window the graphics view is in needs re-layed out

1383584
client-side	server-side
see this tutorial that explains how to implement it with both a client-side and server-side version of the validation

1383585
n-gram	words
you could expand any of the algorithms to look at higher-order n-gram for example two or three words sequences or other features in the text

1383607
public	protected
as you may have heard some suggest putting public members of classes first and private protected ones after

1383642
clang	llvm
i m using llvm with clang

1383642
nsstring	nsdata
the same problem appears with nsstring instead of nsdata

1383651
strlen	strncpy
instead since you calculate the strlen s of the individual strings anyway put them in variables and then just strncpy twice

1383788
getter	setter
the property must be public and have a getter and setter to be serialized

1383823
put	get	post	put	post	get
i received a post on the kvm news group on the topic that states there is a bug in the jadtool and the author claims to have filed a bug report and posted a patch l kvm-interest f s p 9858 one interesting note that was also posted was that the cert jad params are static so once you get them from the wtk correctly you can put them statically in the ant script.

1383843
actionlistener	focuslistener
what you want is a focuslistener not an actionlistener

1383861
min	max
i want to write a ticker displaying information from social networking sites across the top of the screen but obviously i don t want to cover the min max and close buttons of maximized windows

1383871
coalesce	isnull
as you can see the structure of both lines is the same - only coalesce in place of isnull

1383871
coalesce	isnull
tags wpf sql coalesce isnull rowfilter

1383884
fadein	hide
simply set the logo s style to display hidden and call fadein instead of first calling hide

1383893
put	get
but when i put the same html file in a subdirectory tmp rewrite sub and try to access tmp rewrite sub alice.html i get alice

1383912
hide	show
i use this place holder tag to show and hide the child

1383946
uilabel	uibutton	uiview	subviews
it is a uiview with two uibutton subviews and one or two uilabel for the day and date text

1383949
aggregate-functions	sum
but your query doesn t have any aggregate-functions like sum or count

1383968
width	height
for bottom-right alignment for example you could set the x position to the width of the manager minus the width of the field and the y position to the height of the manager minus the height of the field

1383970
free	malloc
then i added a malloc and free inside the loop

1383970
printf	strlen	free	malloc
so malloc + strlen + free do not dominate the profile enough to make avoiding printf worth while

1384011
put	get
insert in the database the information about the module and about that top section of the template you should totally create a table in the database about template structure so the system can know where to put every module related with every page and just use the system to get the module needed in every page request to the right position making it load its own view s into that place

1384023
portrait	landscape
all previous view should be in portrait mode only the last image displaying view controller should be in landscape mode

1384055
vbscript	vba	vbscript	vb6	vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
vbscript is a variety of vb just as vb6 vba and vb.net are

1384073
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1384073
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

1384098
division	modulo
to access an element you should determine what chunk it s in takes one division and do a proper shift within the ring buffer sum and modulo

1384125
g++	gcc
i need to implement a simple graphical message box for a linux sdl application similar to the windows messagebox in c++ gcc g++ 4.4.0

1384128
vb.net	vb6
so to clear things up a bit both vb6 and vb.net are dialects of the visual basic language family letâ s call it that

1384128
vb.net	vb6
the differences between vb and vb.net are even bigger by some metrics because no complete vb6 code is valid vb.net

1384128
vb.net	vb6
saying like kibbee that the compilers of vb6 and vb.net are â œbasically the sameâ is flat out wrong

1384128
vb.net	vb6
let me sum up the main point of this rather long posting so it doesnâ t get lost just like java and javascript vb6 and vb.net have very similar names and for very much the same reason too marketing but this is entirely misleading

1384142
width	height
according to swf format specification i need to access movie s width and height reading bits not bytes and i couldn t find a way to do it in obj-c

1384206
put	get
to get a list of everything available on the iphone put this little snippet in your applicationdidfinishlaunching delegate method and look at the log output

1384208

also i am storing an md5 hash of the user s password + salt in the database not their actual string password so that is one less thing to worry about

hash	md5
consider sha1 or an even stronger hash instead of md5

1387309

however in ie 6 7 haven t tried 8 the width height remain 0 until the image is downloaded

1387413
width	height
if it s not possible to set the width height properties in ie i think i ll just have to create my own custom property and set it in there

it works fine in firefox safari and google-chrome but internet explorer is producing the reverse effect than what i was expecting

1388206
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
what i am expecting and what is infact happening in firefox google-chrome and safari is that the paypal radio button is initially checked and the paypal div is displayed when the bank radio button is selected the paypal div slides up and the bank div slides down and vice versa

1388223
post	get
you are using post as the method for your form not get thus nothing will be appended to the url just change all _get to _post in your php code

1388244
hide	show
i have written several subs to show hide fields in a pivottable

1388283

width	height
as an example are there any definitions that contain the best size for a text box or the ratio between the width and height of a windows form

1388304

filter is a properties not a dp of itemscollection which is not dependencyobject and so dp value inherited isn t there

1388335
error-handling	exception-handling
as for error-handling error codes and exception-handling both have pros and cons

1388371
ati	nvidia
and if i use the nvidia opencl sdk that it will never run optimally on amd chips considering the ati amd link

1388371
ati	nvidia
i ve seen that ati has a board and nvidia presumably has their own where does the opencl user developer community hang out

1388392

1388608
boost	stl
i ve added stl boost windows headers

1388652
min	max
if you want to calculate things for each path separately or calculate something like sum min max over all paths it too could be done using the dag itself

1388788
put	get
you d have to do this for updates inserts as well as queries though so it could get messy and be careful that your queries are still sargable don t put upper code in your queries - actually modify the value before putting it in the parameter

1388861
ienumerable	iqueryable
i have placed a html.dropdownlist and made an ienumerable iqueryable helper function returning

1389032
pop-up	dialog
if you build the solution manually what happens at the run tests point is a pop-up dialog box saying the test executable is not a valid win32 application

1389099

1389267
ceil	floor
you can use the c# floor and ceil method of the math class

1389300
wordpress	joomla
personally i guess a combination of a blogging tool joomla wordpress with developer related plugins - syntax highlighting - calendar project management plugin with a wiki will be best for me .

1389323
tabcontrol	tabitem
presumably this indeed important tip originates from karl shifflets blog at least he s addressing the same topic wpf validation errors disappear inside tabcontrol when switching tabitem

1389334
colorbox	thickbox
with jquery you can try thickbox and colorbox

1389350
lan	intranet
is there any open source code or free software is available for intranet lan messenger near to

1389363
x86	64bit
the programfiles x86 environment variable only exists in 64bit os versions

1389384
ant	maven
i m running an ant task that runs a junit test from within maven using maven-antrun-plugin

1389384
ant	maven
it looks like maven does some magic or invokes ant in another way

1389441
gtk	motif
whether you use motif or gtk or qt is irrelevant since the close box belongs to the wm not your application

1389489
onclick	onmousedown
previously instead of using the onmousedown event handler we had the onclick event

1389522
zoo	xts
both zoo and the newer and also highly-recommended xts package can use posixt and especially the compact posixct type for indexing

1389523
folder	directory
given how costly in time it is in some source code control systems to move files between directory i would consider starting of just using msdev folder until you are clear on the structure you want

1389565
google-chrome	safari
i have tested script in common browsers and it failed in google-chrome and safari

1389574
disk	ram
so you will experience a certain delay when the first request comes in - how much that is really hard to quantify and depends on your hardware mostly disk speed available ram

1389579
getter	setter
synthesizing a property only creates getter and setter methods and therefor won t release the ivar when the object is deallocated

1389584
actionscript	haxe
i am open to java and processing or actionscript haxe and flash but would also like to use objective c and xcode to build projects as well

1389613
post	get
this is known as the prg post redirect get pattern

1389623
ant	maven
i ve included two examples to demonstrate an ant failure causing a maven build failure

1389623
ant	maven
this trivial example shows that an ant failure will cause a maven build to fail

1389676
gridview	onclientclick
being a web forms n00b i don t know what s special about a gridview or this use case that makes it behave differently sets up an onclientclick handler to handle the click without a page load

1389698
prepare	execute
whenever you execute a sql query it has to be compiled into a prepare statement

1389699
metaclass	subclassing
subclassing modelbase to use your own metaclass

1389716
children	parent
it seems bad to me as the state of the parent is it s children

1389716
children	parent
the second way seems more reasonable to me because if you need to reject some children parent can t have some types of children or need to do some actions when you are getting new children like prepare a bedroom or buy some toys you ll be have to call all this from your child class

1389889
google-chrome	firefox
using the vb code provided here btw i could open that page only from ie7 not from firefox 3.5 nor google-chrome 2 i wrote following function

1389928
wxpython	pyglet
again i d prefer to stay in 64-bit mode but if nothing works i ll switch to 32-bit and try wxpython or pyglet again

1389937
ant	maven
of course this could be done within an ide but afaik only by invoking something like ant or maven to handle all the build steps

1389962
aggregate-functions	sum
sum can be replaced by any other aggregate-functions

1389973
postgresql	mysql
i never tried on any unix but i think that postgresql or mysql should be more mature

1389993
haskell	sml
functional languages like sml and haskell lack arrays just like lambda calculus and these are actually useful languages

1390025
postgresql	mysql
sql database - you may use interface to some of dbms like mysql postgresql etc. but it s only good for larger amount of data thousands of records

1390035
pexpect	subprocess
to avoid the many problems that can always arise with buffering for tasks such as getting the subprocess s output to the main process in real time i always recommend using pexpect for all non-windows platform wexpect on windows instead of subprocess when such tasks are desired

1390076
x86	64bit
accidentally i mixed up between 32bit and 64bit library files on my x86 embedded linux system

1390082
getter	setter
in the example module below the getter and setter are generated by adding anonymous subroutines to the symbol table

1390083
lisp	scheme
lisp scheme etc

1390089
stdout	stderr
file descriptor 0 is stdin 1 is stdout and 2 is stderr

1390137
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this combination work well in firefox but not in other browsers like safari google-chrome or internet explorer

1390221
post	get
i just want to use hyperlink and post way not get

1390237
redhat	fedora
i have tested it on fedora core 11 and centos 5.3 community version for redhat enterprise

1390237
ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
another hint for you is that firebird stable is included in ubuntu debian and opensuse

1390248
mouse	keyboard
of course some users use keyboard mouse

1390270
scipy	scikits
you can use scikits audiolab to read in any file supported by libsndfile and then use pylab numpy and scipy to do the processing

1390303
mkmapview	mkannotationview
i m trying to add a pin mkannotation and mkannotationview to my mkmapview and allow the user to drag it around

1390323
put	get	post	put	post	get
you can store the id in the session on the edit get method and put it back in the company object on the edit post method

1390359
post	get
i just want to use hyperlink and post way not get

1390361
glut	pyopengl
i haven t used the wxpython stuff with pyopengl so that s where you might be running into problems but pyopengl also includes glut which both run fine

1390383
entities	entitymanager
instead many applications create a layer of data access objects--separate from the entities--that use entitymanager instances to query load and save entities

1390384
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works well in ie firefox and opera but i can t make it going in google-chrome safari

1390422
int	chars
in short when int is 4 bytes long adding 1 to a pointer will actually add 4 to it so it s better to cast any pointer to chars before doing calculations

1390424
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome but not ie 8

1390438
int	chars
you are mixing pointers of different types pointer arithmetic relies on the pointer type int + 1 and chars + 1 have different results because int and chars have a different size

1390460
width	height
tabctrl_setitemsize sets the width and height of tabs in a

1390498
stateless	stateful
ad 1 it s used mainly for jpa and stateless stateful local session beans

1390502
getter	setter
with large numbers of attributes there will be a difference in compile time and memory use...both in favor of the generated getter and setter not the manually-written ones

1390511
children	parent
it turns out with the help of microsoft that sqlmetal generates different output than the ide s mslinqtosqlgenerator because the dbml file generated by a tool i created had some relationships defined where the parent could access the children but the children did not define the parent association

1390511
children	parent
if you only have an association from the parent to the children defined and don t have the reverse association defined or the reverse association has a different name then the .net source code for that association will not be generated in either direction

1390548
jar	war
the maven-dependency-plugin unpacks the jar s contents into a specified location in the war project

1390548
folder	directory
that folder is then specified as an external web resources directory for the maven-war-plugin

1390548
folder	directory
the following configuration will unpack the contents of my-resources into the target external-resources directory then include the contents of that folder in the war as if they d been defined in src main resources

1390567
division	multiplication
the same principle applies for multiplication and division especially when change bit widths

1390597
ant	maven
it sounds like an interesting approach but personally i think it is best to manage build dependencies using an external build tool like ant or maven rather than tying your build to an ide

1390597
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
if you use maven and the m2e plugin it will automatically set up eclipse project dependencies when loading the maven pom.xml if those other projects are also in your workspace

1390612
min	max
the statement has been terminated. my field is decimal 11 2 at the table and my max and min values are 1 603 837 393.70 -- -1 688 000 000.00 amount

1390619
int	double
that does not make sense it is like saying operator + may operator on int or double

1390641
post	get
if you do want to append the params using a get statement since the form will default to post you can add a method param

1390645
ati	nvidia
a simpler approach might be to employ cuda nvidia or stream computing ati to harness a gpu s power for image manipulation because these apis are much closer to regular array-based c++ programming

1390652
ant	maven
i wouldn t use plug-in projects personally i would use build tools such as ant maven and others

1390653
maven	m2e
osgi can be made to work alongside maven using additional libraries such as bnd and m2e

1390659
persistent	transient
the reason is because i have some transient attributes that i can t persistent to the database facebook data and when the facebook data is already loaded in memory i don t want to re-query facebook for the data

1390677
daemons	launchd
you could set up an applescript folder action arrgh or use a launchd daemons and the fsevents facility to watch your source code files

1390693
post	get
i remember having to deal with a similar issue a couple years ago i wanted to have an applicationhost use a custom config file and bookmarked this blog post which i used to get me started

1390706
instances	transient
you could make an alternate getter transient non mapped for hibernate that would provide the user instances by looking into your map

1390710
range	max	range	min	min	max
you say my field is decimal 11 2 at the table but this contradicts what you say about the max and min values which aren t within the range of decimal 11 2

1390725
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it seems like a mixed metaphor to be creating a uinavigationcontroller but then not using its usual navigation methods pushviewcontroller animated and popviewcontrolleranimated and instead using the modal methods inherited from uiviewcontroller

1390780
webclient	httpwebrequest
from my investigations the behaviour of the webclient class is the same which is somewhat expected since it appears to only offer a more simple interface to the httpwebrequest

1390780
servicepoint	httpwebrequest
the problem with all this is that once all connections of the httpwebrequest s underlying servicepoint are used up closed by the remote server there will no new ones be opened up

1390867
min	max
i m making use of q_property s in my project and i m trying to figure out the best way to add some attributes to those properties like min and max value

1390869
folder	directory
this page on latex packages says you ll need to install the .sty file in the latex installation directory my installation of ubuntu seems to be usr share texmf-texlive tex latex or you need to have a copy of the .sty file in each file containing latex source -- in your tex documents folder at the very least

1390905
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
beyond your choice of frameworks for gui-based cross-platform desktop app development of course lie many many other choices of tools and approaches -- but they re less crucial for solo development than they are for effective team cooperation so until teamwork is in prospect for you it won t hurt to use whatever tools you find simplest svn rather than a dvcs i strongly recommend a dvcs such as hg git or bazaar for team use but for a solo developer i guess svn is still quite acceptable and perhaps simpler to install and use

1390934
public	protected
in your case deriveda can t even see staticvar since it s private not protected or public so it doesn t even know there is a staticvar variable in existence

1390953
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
whenever the copy to clipboard button is pressed i want the contents of the clipboard to get copied to the clipboard and work in a cross browser way across internet explorer firefox google-chrome opera etc

1390963
getter	setter
don t use any getter setter or

1390972
google-chrome	firefox
zeroclipboard is another choice and this does appear to work well tested in firefox 3.5 ie 6 and google-chrome

1391020
int	chars
you can choose a variety of types for the code column - a single byte tiny int a small chars field or an int depending on how many values you might need

1391097
ubuntu	debian	debian-based	ubuntu
if you are on a debian-based distribution ie debian ubuntu ... you ll have the apt-get command-line command which allows you to install packages

1391138
ant	maven
i d suggest to use maven to manage your build and distribute your sources maven is widely used and like ant lost of java users programmers have it installed on their computer

1391144
vb6	vba
vba vb6 - 484 chars

1391199
exponent	modulo
for testing purposes i have a set modulo and private exponent that i want to export into rsacryptoserviceprovider

1391209
getter	setter
then use synthesize in someobject s implementation to synthesize the setter getter

1391241
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i had a quick look and it seems there are lots of git mercurial and svn options but no bazaar

1391243
hide	show
i need to show the number of results for a given category and hide any categories that give no results

1391260
ivar	nsmutableset
my other option is to put an ivar on the parent controller either an nswindowcontroller or an nsmutableset of nswindowcontroller s and then watch for the nswindowwillclosenotification in the parent controller and release it in response

1391277
inherited	subclassing
each concrete subclassing of staticinitializer gets it s own static constructor initialisation method but you keep the advantage of having true inherited

1391282
post	get
post get request cookie like it is infected

1391283
implements	extends
one thing i obviously stumbled upon is the fact that i can register multiple components that can be injected of the same type extends same class implements same interface s

1391299
post	get
all i would really need is the post id in question and i could get all the other information

1391299
post	get
basically when viewing a post i want to get its category or title but not while the loop is going

1391313
dictionary	map
a set is like a dictionary or map of key value pairs except that it only stores is a collection of keys without associated values

1391324
parentviewcontroller	pushviewcontroller
parentviewcontroller is for the purposes of navigationviewcontrollers and presenting modal view controllers there is no way to set the property without the methods pushviewcontroller or presentmodalviewcontroller

1391324
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the parentviewcontroller is a readonly property can only be read by the uiviewcontroller class and uinavigationcontroller class subclasses of these will not have access to set the property

1391343
std	ostream
this way it works with both std cout and plain cout and ostream is available when including

1391360
firefox	safari
but with firefox 3.5 and latest versions of ie and safari i think the gap is much smaller if there is any

1391395
post	get
the pages i m grabbing can accept post or get requests but it seems to be exiting either way

1391396
touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesmoved	touchesended
doing it in a pseudo fashion is simple enough - i know how many touches i have just by using touchesbegan and touchesended but the problem is that only touchesmoved sends events

1391406
post	get
i will try to edit a better program into this post when i get time.

1391418
post	put
put post in as the first argument to xmlhttp.open assuming you re using pure javascript

1391461
width	height
innerhtml iframe height 600px width 100 noresize noresize

1391467
subtract	add
to access elements on the left or right subtract or add 1 take care at the row boundaries

1391467
subtract	add
to access elements above or below subtract or add the row size in this case 3

1391495
concurrenthashmap	readwritelock
you can store the readwritelock instances in a map keyed on path just make sure that you get concurrent access to the map correct possibly using concurrenthashmap

1391541
zlib	libpng
the libpng zlib combination is just too big

1391543
width	height
if this is not defined the browser does not know the height and width of the image until it s loaded

1391566
getter	setter
i think the point being said is that use the auto implemented instead of field so that you can change it in the future if in case you need to add logic to getter and setter

1391566
getter	setter
my idea is add a new private variable and add the same x getter and setter

1391567
super	self
if self super initwithnibname nibnameornil bundle nibbundleornil

1391576
getter	setter
also you can put breakpoints on getter and setter but you can t on fields

1391578
multiplying	addition
in addition multiplying the scrolldecay vector by the decay value

1391620
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
store a hash bcrypt or pbkdf2 of the password which has been salt

1391620
hash	salt
non-random salt for password hash

1391631
irc	telnet
try connecting an irc client using telnet and check what mirc does when you use ctrl+k

1391631
irssi	mirc
you re not likely to get a standard cohesive behavior across irc clients...ansi escape codes are processed by more of the old-fare staple unix clients like irssi and mirc sometimes does its own thing

1391657
lxml	beautifulsoup
i ve been trying to use beautifulsoup and lxml thus far to accomplish this task but i m not sure how to handle the two div tags and td tag because they have attributes

1391657
lxml	beautifulsoup
in addition to this i m not sure whether i should rely more on beautifulsoup or lxml or a combination of both

1391724
integer	unsigned
for example you could define that the message sent consists of a 4-byte unsigned integer in network byte order defining how many structures follow and each structure could be a sequence of 4 signed 4-byte integers for the array followed by a single signed 4-byte integer for _data2 also sent in network byte order

1391728
hash	salt
you will want to use a hash preferably sha1 with salt

1391763
post	get
sounds like you really should sit down and read about ajax if you can not figure out how to move from a get to a post

1391801
bindparam	bindvalue
i m just learning pdo but i think you need to use bindvalue not bindparam

1391855
cdr	cons
all this means that â if you wished â you could define lists backwards with car pointing to the next cons cell and cdr pointing to the value

1391880
fgets	strtol	fgets	strtod	strtol	strtod
there s no one best way to deal with this but generally the approach is to read the whole line as text using either fgets or scanf with a sized s conversion specifier which will consume the newline then convert to the target data type using sscanf or strtol or strtod

1391892
cdr	cons
a cons cell is one third of a contract consisting of cons car and cdr with the requirement being that they behave as pairs as others have mentioned

1391900
ubuntu	linux	mouse	keyboard
on linux ubuntu the keyboard and mouse devices are found

1391953
ant	maven
to me there are as many pros as there are cons to using maven vs ant for in-house projects

1391953
ant	maven
you can do anything with maven you can do with ant but where ant doesn t encourage any standards maven strongly suggests you to follow it s structure or it ll be more work

1391953
ant	maven
true some things are a pain to set up with maven that would be easy to do with ant but the end result is almost always something that is easier to build from the perspective of people who just want to check out a project and go

1391977
cvs	svn
the only downside is that due to the licensing you aren t allowed to automate the encoding so i think you aren t supposed to script it into your cvs or svn post-commit

1392016
subtract	add
if angle is outside of 0..pi it s correct in this case to add subtract pi as many times as needed or use function fmod and for 0..pi all is clear

1392020
min	max
these columns would represent things that are common to the entire group like count sum max min etc

1392020
filtering	grouping
it filtering out entire grouping that do not satisfy the predicate in the having clause

1392073
int	double
most of the database operations are writing triples int int double of numbers about 20-50 triples per second

1392074
hide	show
in fact one action might depend on a variety of permissions and the view might hide or show certain options depending on the permission

1392074
hide	show
should i have some kind of permissionset object that the user carries around throughout the web app in session or whatever and the mvc action method would check if that user can use that action and then the view will have some viewdata or whatever where it checks the various permissions to do hide show

1392100
hide	show
in that way only two reflows will occur one when you hide the tile container and other when you finish the element manipulation and you show it again

1392114
width	height
they should scale down to specific height and specific width

1392269

my os is linux - ubuntu if that even matters just in case

1392355
domxpath	domdocument
you can use domdocument and domxpath for that

put	get
think of the difference between opengl and a game engine like the difference between getting a car building factory where you have to program all the machines yourself to get the desired car s part opengl and having all parts of the car ready for assembly already game engine and only having to put them together maybe change the color here and add a gear there

1392538
vb.net	vb6
this approach was suggested to vb6 developers who were thinking about upgrading to vb.net

sporadically i see errors in firefox only not in ie or google-chrome when trying to communicate with the embedded flash object

1393236
rss	feed
i currently use feedzirra in a production system that is continuously importing thousands of rss and atom feed

1393277
iboutlet	ibaction
you can then configure it to have three sections and connect up an iboutlet ibaction to it easily too

1393389
getter	setter
in scala when you write a var foo the scala compiler automatically generates a setter called and a getter called foo for it and sets the field as private you ll see it as private if you decompile a class having public scala fields with javap

1393389
getter	setter
in your trait you haven t defined a method and for a public field setter and getter always come in pairs

1393389
getter	setter
if you want to have similar behaviour to a var you could do something like this by having explicit setter and getter

1393394
int	chars	int	double
let us assume i have declared the variable i of certain datatype might be int chars float or double .

1393394
int	chars	int	double
note simply consider that i is declared and dont bother if it is an int or chars or float or double datatype

1393394
int	chars	int	double
since i want a generic solution i am simply mentioning that variable i can be of any one of the datatypes namely int chars float or double

1393426
put	get
even if it would be possible to get the value to serialise it it can t be deserialised as there is no way to put the value back in the new object

1393442
profiling	debugging
don t know the answer but for such debugging i use sql profiling

1393840
post	get
and i cannot change the http post to a http get since it s generated by a 3rd party java applet

1393855
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
also note you should use the actualwidth actualheight property and not the width height property as it could hold a nan value

1393865
vb.net	vb6
it was automatically converted from vb6 to vb.net

1393883
interpreted-language	compiled-language
simple question folks i do a lot of programming professionally and personally in compiled-language like c++ java and in interpreted-language like python javascript

interpreted-language	compiled-language
i know why compiled-language use static typing most of the time but i can t figure out the aversion to static typing in interpreted-language design

1393920
getter	setter
when i created the proxy class it generated all the getter and setter methods as well as a field

1394005
vb.net	vb6
have a bit of code ported from vb6 to vb.net

1394427
gif	png
select an image jpg gif png from local file system

1394428
submit	submission
further confirming my suspicions about what s going on is that when i simply submit the form without jquery catching the form submission the cart gets saved properly so that when i load the page normally the promo code remains applied

1394479
accessor	properties
setting up your picklist properties as nonatomic retain only applies if you access the properties via a properties accessor as follows

1394479
accessor	properties
you are bypassing the properties accessor methods so no retain message is sent

1394482
google-chrome	firefox
update 2014 there is also a newer extension also available for google-chrome and firefox lazarus form recovery

1394648
jquery	scriptaculous
by the way the page is using lightview wich works with prototype and scriptaculous but not jquery

1394651
interpreted-language	compiled-language
maybe it s because one of my main interpreted-language is perl and one of my compiled-language is objective-c but i never strongly felt that there was anything special about compilation vs interpretation that suggested dynamic over static typing

1394653
subtraction	addition
we re just talking addition and subtraction here

1394660

1394952
spweb	spsite
you should dispose a spweb or spsite

1394979
udp	tcp
i take it you don t want to replace the modems at the client sites the easiest thing on the server side would be each clients had its own ip software stack and used its modem to call an isp and establish an internet connection and then talk to your server using tcp or udp or http or whatever

1394979
voip	sip
voip consists of sip for signalling for call set-up and call tear-down plus some codecs h.323 for traffic encoded voice while the call is established

remember that if you choose to go the route of implementing a enum-class and find yourself in a position where the constructor isnt allowed to be private you ll need to override equals and gethashcode

1395556
nsmenu	nsstatusitem
i have an nsmenu popping out of an nsstatusitem using popupstatusitemmenu

1395561

on windows i ve read a lot of stuff will perform very well but this software the server part will run on linux or freebsd trough mono and i don t know how these methods are implemented on it

1395628
width	height
you can t set the height or width of an inline element

1395650
hex	binary
it doesn t correspond to any source-code line nor does its hex or binary interpretation correspond to a relevant location in the binary

1395663
hash	salt
honestly there s no defensible reason not to have the salt be the same exact length as the hash password

1395702

1395779
int	chars
c++ has standard conversions which are conversions between fundamental types such as chars being promoted to int and things such as array-to-pointer decay

1395787
factors	matrix
we ll work forward to generate a matrix that scales and rotates and then use that to figure out how to extract the scale factors and rotations analytically

1395796
margin	height
namely if i assign a value of 11px to margin property space above and below doesnâ t appear to have the height of 26 pixels ds + 11px 15px + 11px 26px

if you instead wanted to write java int s or other things that aren t raw bytes you can wrap your bytearrayoutputstream in a dataoutputstream

1396108
post	get
your login is a post and you should use the post redirect get pattern

1396111
udp	tcp
as far as i know the protocol assumes a process to listen on a port that is totally different from the http port and also not using tcp but udp

1396178
integer	unsigned
am not marshalling the types properly ie bool is marshalled as a bool while bool is marshalled as a unsigned single byte integer etc -- while this last one may not cause the exception it can cause decidedly funky behavior

1396242
google-chrome	firefox
check out this page in firefox or google-chrome

1396285
prepare	execute
but sometimes we had some problems with our prepare method that when execute replaces all placeholders with their respective values

1396312
pop-up	dialog
when the engine inits there should pop-up a dialog box which gives the user the possibility to choose settings

1396312
pop-up	dialog
the only thing that happens is that the dialog pop-up very shortly and it immediately closes without even waiting for user input

1396350
hide	show
...that way if the prerequisite values were both evaluated as true the dependentfield would show and hide if not

1396389
stdout	stderr
our .war would output the logs both stdout and stderr to the directory jboss server servername log

1396442
post	get
you get the value of the post in the item machinename of the form collection because that is the first param of html.textbox

1396444
m2e	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml
if you want a single one then you need to invest the time in either something like m2e which generates project dependencies from the maven pom.xml or using pax-construct which can generate the manifest from the maven pom.xml

1396452
firefox	safari
it works in firefox and safari but not in ie

1396468

any parent with 10 000 or more children is going to have sub-par performance

1396510
datalist	repeater
that looks like html that could be emitted by a repeater or datalist without a gridvew

1396510
gridview	repeater
if you use a gridview you d put a repeater in an itemtemplate in a templatefield column

1396510
gridview	repeater
you d have to bind something to the gridview so that it renders one row for the repeater to show

1396540

button	checkbox
the answers from seengee and los are much appreciated but i wanted a more integrated solution that would allow me to work with checkbox and radio button with the natural f syntax that i already use with other form elements

1396662
int	chars
you re basically using another level of nested arrays pointing to int to replace a string of chars separated by pipe chars

1396732
integer	unsigned
i m wanting to read hex numbers from a text file into an unsigned integer so that i can execute machine instructions

1396744
subtraction	addition
the speed of the native addition and subtraction opcodes is irrelevant

1396758
put	get
but if i put 0 1 0 0 only the right to read then i get redirected to and one particular thing that i have noticed is that it doesn t call the app_controller or at least the beforefilter function in the app_controller

1396785
mouseleave	mouseenter
both mouseenter and mouseleave only take one argument but you re defining two callback functions

1396812
int	chars
where the function convert_xdigit_to_int simply converts 0 the chars to 0 an int 1 to 1 2 to 2 .

1396829
strtol	atoi
atoi is obsolete due to the fact that it does not check for errors like strtol does

1396844
min	max
a better option is to restructure the data to support column based min max avg as this is what sql is best at

1396896
folder	dir
maybe you should not put the include file in your web root dir or a sub folder

1396956
hide	show
note this code only works if you have a previously selected and visible div because i am using the callback function inside hide to activate the show effect and get it nice and smooth.

1396962
division	modulo
that said at some point i tried to get the compiler to use the modulo as well as the dividend on a division result but the old microsoft compiler from 1998 was not smart enough to realize the same instruction produced both results

1396997
sorting	grouping
the sorting algorithm i m looking for is a kind of alphabetic sorting but taking grouping into account

1397032
folder	directory
add your .htaccess file to the same directory where the system folder is located so in your codeigniter root directory you should have

1397044
min	max
dimension n min 0 0 0 .. 0 -- max delta 1 2 delta 2 2 ... delta n 2

1397046
subtraction	addition
the way this experiment should be designed is to write 2 different programs - 1 for addition 1 for subtraction

1397046
subtraction	addition
if you wanted to analyze different methods of addition subtraction and looping again each of those should be a separate program

1397046
cpu	processors
experimental error might arise from heat of processors and other activity going on the cpu so i d execute the runs in a variety of patterns.

1397047
cvs	svn
if you use svn then it still okay because svn handles binary files much better than cvs

1397081
subtraction	addition
re-order your script so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again

1397187
antivirus	rootkit

min	max
it might be worth using this as it will manage multiple threads for you and you can control the min max number of threads

1397223
children	parent
so while there are no objects being violated in this awkward predicament there is a more natural way of writing addchild statements and that s to add children from parent instead of the other way around because that s the order laid down by the syntax

1397241
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
a nice thing about using json.stringify is that in browser that support native json serializing firefox 3.5 ie 8 nightly builds of safari and google-chrome it will automatically take advantage of the browser-native routines instead of using javascript

1397266
pull	push
in version 1.6.4 git gained the ability to have a remote pull from one url and push to another using the remote.name.pushurl config setting

usually this is avoided by not using noddy myisam and going to innodb instead which has row-level locking amongst other desirable database features

1399006
innodb	myisam
better migrate the bulk of the table to innodb leaving only a fulltext field in myisam

1399006
innodb	myisam
everything except fulltext searches can then steer clear of the myisam table and use only the innodb table which exhibits much better locking performance

1399006
innodb	myisam
personally i now tend to store everything in the innodb table including the text and store a second copy of the text in the myisam table purely for fulltext searchbait purposes

1400062
serializable	deserialization
this isn t exactly an answer to your question but since reflection.emit isn t supported in cf an alternative approach you could take to serializable deserialization would be to compile your classes into a regular windows application and make use of reflection.emit to programatically generate serializable and de-serialize methods for each class which could then be incorporated back into the class in the cf version

1401117
post	get
if i switch the getjson call with a .ajax get or post everything works fine

1401118
getter	setter
you do not want to blindly create getter and setter for all instance variables

1401118
getter	setter
if you have a bankaccount class with a balance instance variable creating getter and setter for it makes sense if you want to be able to check and set the balance

1401118
getter	setter
so the getter setter still allows for the implementation to vary and thus does not violate encapsulation and by extension neither do javabeans

1401118
getter	setter
if the client does not need access or modify this there is no point in creating a getter or setter for it

1401124
getter	setter
getter and setter are not required in a java bean class

1401124
getter	setter
however in order for variables to be discovered automatically when your bean is used you must provide getter and setter following a standard naming convention getvarname setvarname...

1402339
versioning	upgrade
this problem would only affect you if you try to upgrade the dependent assemblies and it would only affect users who installed your application under an earlier versioning of windows and then upgrade to windows 7 so i don t know how big a deal this would be for you

1402362
for-loop	arrays
you could then initialize the arrays linearly or with a nested for-loop

1404217
width	height
i have an issue with regards to using a scaletransform on a canvas in silverlight the canvas scales correctly however the height and width values always remain the same

1404217
width	height
a 100x100 canvas scaled so it appears 200x200 is still 100x100 with regards to the height and width values how can these be updated to reflect the new size

1404217
width	height
another related issue is how to alter the height and width of an element and have this scale the canvas or xaml element appropriately ie

1404217
width	height
setting a 100x100 element to 200x200 makes everything in it twice as big - this should be a solution where only the height and width of the element are set to alter the scale

1404217
width	height
height and width need updated so that when this canvas is in a scrollviewer the scrollbar correctly updates for the new size - this happens if the height and width is assigned manually to the new scaled size but this needs to work for all sizes

1404217
width	height
conversly i need to have another canvas that when its height and width is changed the elements inside are scaled appropriately as this will be a resizable icon for use on the same or another canvas

1404217
width	height
if this is not possible in silverlight directly is there anyway of achieving this effect in code if not in xaml as this is possible in wpf if an imagebrush is used however silverlight does not support this and need a scalable canvas and a canvas that when scaled updates it s own height and width

1404271
put	get
if you haven t put any data in the tables yet you won t get much indication of the tables being present

1406109
tlistview	tlistbox
i know it s not a listbox and it s a little bit complex than tlistbox but it can act like tlistbox or tlistview ttreeview and it s way faster than standart tlistbox tlistview ttreeview. it can add 1000000 items in 125ms

1406566
int	double
if any of the numbers you re working with are int types you ll need to cast them to double or floats or any real number type before the divisions

1406571
google-chrome	firefox
it works for my firefox 2 google-chrome 2

1406589
int	boolean
it is easier to manage you only have to deal with a single int value whereas an array of boolean would store quite differently in say a database

1406660
getter	setter
in the first method listed below the use method it looks to me like ins is an instance variable and attr is a method that provides getter and setter for ins

1406752
unsigned	short
set c unsigned short arg0

1406752
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
you don t need to worry about endianness since each unsigned short in your utf-16 uchar type holds a code point or half surrogate as a native binary integer

1406768
post	get
the ways to reliable keep state between requests are memcache the datastore or through the user cookies or post get

1406772
put	get
it s a bit of a hack yes but if you can put in an unrealistic say 1 1 1770 constant piece of data that you could insert at the database file read data input level then use the column labelfunction to render as null if the data matches that column it should work or at least the sort function will get called

1406777
int	double
you basically have to type it to a string float double int or whatever you need.

1406799
pull	push
this will most likely push them away from the base shape so you need to pull them back onto the base shape

1406845
google-chrome	firefox
firing this testpage up in ie will result in a messagebox which shows what it s supposed to while loading it in firefox or google-chrome results in a messagebox which says null

1406886
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i made some modifications to the code and with changes it at least appears to be working in firefox 3 safari 4 opera 9.5 and ie6+

1406899
google-chrome	firefox
as an experiment i tried doing ajax requests from various browsers firefox 3.5 google-chrome ie8 ie7 ie6 to a server giving a 302 status code and showing the status in the browser s request object

1406907
apache	nginx
i would recommend to use a pure http server in front of glassfish or any application server like apache or nginx that handles your domains urls

1406931
superclass	subclassing
edit the way i am do the logging is that i have an instance variable in both the subclassing and superclass so it would look something like the following

rss feed of the last 15 errors from

1407059
jquery	simplemodal
i m using the simplemodal popup in jquery and i would like to set the height of my popup dynamically depending on my content

1407082
post	get
a 501 response means not implemented and is usually taken to mean that the server didn t understand the http method that you used get post etc

1407082
post	get
either way the server is saying that it doesn t under the get or the post method whichever one your code is actually sending

1407094
implements	extends
you should make your save method virtual or abstract and implements extends the method as needed for each entity

1407098
spaces	delimiter
this is especially handy for iterating through the spaces or return delimiter results from the stdout of any of a number of unix commands

1407106
width	height
when i inspect the contentsize variable the width is 252 and the height is 36 which is expected

1407106
width	height
but if instead of 300.0f i plug in 222.0f into the width variable the width is 189 but the height is still 36 and only the first 4 longtext words are displayed on 2 lines the third line seems to be cut off somehow in the calculation

1407111
pop-up	dialog
you use ajax instead of a redirect so that you can specify incorrect credentials and the browser doesn t pop-up a dialog

1407116
postgresql	mysql
having said that i like working with it it s usable outside the framework and it will give you mysql postgresql or sqlite support

1407214
websphere	ibm
we have a webservice running on websphere 6.1 using the ibm jax-rpc based webservices

1407214
chunked	transfer-encoding
client is sending requests without http header of transfer-encoding chunked they specify content-length

1407214
chunked	transfer-encoding
the response from websphere always has transfer-encoding chunked in the http header

1407259
postgresql	mysql
django works sqllite you won t need to manage a mysql postgresql instance

1407268
folder	directory
keep in mind that libs is just a term meaning your main library class directory and may even contain models depending on the folder structure

i am curious to know the scenarios real world examples when one should use a custom object for key and thus implement methods gethashcode equals etc

1407394
min	max
add the company name to the group and perform a min max to grab one in the select list

1407395
cos	sin
e it cos t + i sin t

1407399
equals	gethashcode
since your addresscachekey type overrides the equals and gethashcode methods they would be a good candidate for a key in the dictionary and you would be able to determine whether or not you needed to take a trip to the database to retrieve a record based on more than one piece of data

1407408
equals	gethashcode
you should override equals and gethashcode whenever the default equals tests for reference equality will not suffice

1407408
equals	gethashcode
and you want two point s two be considered equals if their x s are equals and their y s are equals then you will need to override equals and gethashcode

1407410
equals	gethashcode
if you are writing a class that might possibly be used by someone else you will want to define gethashcode and equals when reference equals is not enough

1407457
int	chars
you can use a regular expression to see whether your input line matches your expected format using the regex in your question then you can run the above code without having to check for value and knowing that the int x conversion will always succeed since you ve already confirmed that the following chars groups are all digits

1407489
filesystems	ntfs
directly in the ntfs filesystems

1407510
equals	gethashcode
just to make it clear there is one important thing about and gethashcode dictionary uses gethashcode to determine if two keys are equals if is of custom type you should care about implementing gethashcode carefully

1407510
equals	gethashcode
based on ergwun s comment i checked the behavior of with special respect to tkey s implementation of equals object and gethashcode

1407526
post	get
i have been through many post on this site and examples on the web but cant get the web server to proceed after i tell the thread to wait

1407530
versioning	upgrade
i wonder how many users still have not upgrade their phones from versioning 2.2.1

1407561
getter	setter
if class1 and class2 may in fact contain a null id you want to modify your getter setter to get set integers instead of primitive ints

1407561
getter	setter
if both class1 and class2 should never contain a null id and you consider this to be a class invariant you may keep the primitive int type in the getter setter and either

1407561
getter	setter
if class1 may have a null id but class2 may not you should have class1 s getter and setter use an integer type instead of an int primitive and you should create a dozer customconverter that returns a default value when the source field is null

1407564
folder	directory
the log directory will probably be one or two folder up from the root http folder so it may not be accessible using the iis user

1407567
cvs	svn
i have a rather complicated deploy setup for our drupal site that is a combination of cvs and svn

1407567
cvs	svn
we use cvs to get the newest versions of modules and we deploy with svn

1407567
cvs	svn
unfortunately when cvs updates remove files subversions complains because they weren t removed in svn

1407568
kde	gnome
i ve found that gtk+ apps come closer to looking right in kde than qt apps do in gnome but not by enough to matter

1407579
spaces	delimiter
by default cut uses a tab as a delimiter and subversion may output spaces there

1407640
int	chars
getchar returns an int to differentiate between a valid chars and eof

1407651
atof	strtod
by using strtod instead of atof props to p daddy i was able to cut it by 90 chars

use properties to allow child projects to inherited configuration but override key values in the url for distributionmanagement

1407897
scons	autotools
it derives from the concepts of other build tools such as scons autotools cmake or ant

1407909
put	get
i am sure i am probably doing something silly here involving scope but i can t quite put my finger on it the error i get is this

1407920
width	height
then it looks at the height of the scaled image and if that is not big enough to also cover the window top-to-bottom it calculates how much bigger it must make the image in order to covert that part then scales the width up by that amount and sets the height to the window height

1407924
firefox	safari
this works very well in firefox and safari but they do not work at all for ie

1407925
strcpy	malloc	realloc	strcpy	realloc	malloc	strlen	strcpy	strlen	realloc
if you want to accumulate an array of strings instead of just processing them one by one puts b above then you ll need to get your hands dirty with realloc malloc strcpy and strlen

1407931
jsr168	jsr286
i haven t really kept abreast of jsr286 portlet 2.0 - this stuff should work with jsr168 portlet 1.0 - so it is worth checking the new api if you re using it.

1407937
getter	setter
the actions are separate classes but i m creating a new instance of them in the view passing the view into the action s constructor and providing getter and setter on the view which the action calls directly

1407972
versioning	upgrade
upgrade project we will be upgrading to the newest versioning

1407987
ant	maven
assembling large complex enterprise apps is often complicated enough that you need a mix of maven shell scripts and or ant run tasks plus dozens of profiles

1407999
post	get
karlsen - i think you should post your note as the answer so you get the credit for it

1408008
stdout	stderr
alternatively you can also pass subprocess.pipe to the stderr and stdout to suppress the messages

1408027
cassini	iis
this will work well with cassini the visual studio development web server but you will need to make an additional change to your iis website virtual directory

1408037

i have assigned the mouseup and mousedown events of a button btnright below

1408079
put	get
you can even get emacs to tell xcode where to put a breakpoint i don t remember how but i asked a question here a while back and it works great

1408084
put	get
i have used the migration - access tool to get the access db into sql server but now i need to take the data from that table and put it into the tables that our app is going to use

1408163
int	chars
my guess is that the interface was designed like this so that the one write int b method would be called for int short byte and chars values

1408164
post	get
i like to use the ajax function rather than get or post as i find it more readable and you can react to the different results of the ajax call

1408173
post	get
bhatt4982 post your comment as an answer to get credit for this

1408183
nfa	dfa
if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that

1408234
stdout	stderr
remember you can redirect stdout and or stderr to pipe and thus it won t be printed to the screen but the output is still available for reading by your python program

1408234
stdout	stderr
by default stdout and stderr are both none which means no redirection which means they will use the same stdout stderr as your python program

1408260
x86	64bit
for that you ll want to do three commands to create 2 files in tmp the first containing a list of ppc files and the second a list of 32 or 64bit x86 files

1408269
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
this is impossible unfortunately - you can remove the whole border though and then draw your own on the form and use onmousedown onmouseup and onmousemove to do your own dragging.

1408281
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
chmod chown and chgrp

1408306

1408331
children	parent
if i have a parent collection what i d like to do is get an ilist that is sorted by parent.name and also the children for each parent need to be sorted by their name

1408331
children	parent
i ve tried this which only sorts the parent not the children

1408372
udp	tcp
and you need to poke holes in the firewall to allow incomming packets to the sql broswer udp 1433 and the express listenning port tcp port number it depends as is usually dynamic for named instances

1408415
width	height
an additional tip for solidsmile s cheat is to scale the proportionate re-sizing by setting a width and using auto for height

1408421
tcplistener	tcpclient
both tcpclient and tcplistener have extensive examples in the msdn

1408442
ceil	floor
it will also fit in ceil n 3 floor n+2 3 decimal digits since 2 3 8 is less than 10

1408450

1408513
inherited	properties
when i search through the project file .vcproj and all the inherited properties sheets .vsprops there are no references left to library x

1408592
abstract-class	superclass
in some oo languages the interface is a superclass and is called an abstract-class or a pure virtual class

1408689
inherited	properties
if manually setting doublebuffered to true is a pain for you you could always create your own custom control component that inherited from the built-in control and sets doublebuffered and other properties to your required defaults

1408710
pexpect	subprocess
of course it would be easier to provide a point solution by writing python_program in the knowledge that it must spawn cpp_program as a subprocess and trick it into believing its stdout is a terminal python_program would then directly use pexpect for example

1408717
stdout	fflush
you may want to try fflush ing the stdout stream in the cpp program

1408730
stdout	fflush
what you need is for your c program to call fflush stdout after every line

1408733
width	height
the other method i was playing with was perhaps offsetting the box position by the height width and perhaps this would have the effect of having a bottom right position

1408752
implements	extends
you can have them implements a common interface or extends the same base possibly abstract class

1408781
portrait	landscape
fill_parent messes up the layout and i don t want to use absolute sizes if i don t have to - the way it is now looks great in both landscape and portrait i just don t want the edittext to resize

1408786
fflush	gets
even when i put it into tempdata it gets lost since tempdata is fflush on each separate request

1408829
stdout	fflush
if it is block buffered then the buffer will be fflush when it is full or when you call fflush stdout

1408849
post	get
generally speaking you would use a form variable on your page via get or post called page which would be a number

1408850
post	get
as per the link s referenced in other post once you go international it can get very complex indeed

1408863

1408927
super	extends
and ofcouse it can also extends the super class functionality by adding new fields and methods

1409012
calloc	malloc
you might ask like calloc does for a pair of arguments size of items in bytes and number of items rather than just one size in bytes like malloc does

1409038
accessor	properties
as far as dom peculiarities in real xhtml documents i ve heard that some things like document.write don t work and that accessing node attributes should always be performed via getattribute setattribute rather than via simpler properties accessor

1409079
width	height
i always change my window size on the layout tab to width 80 by height 65 and screen buffer size to 80 by 300

net website i would like to add button by which user can view the page in full screens mode and switching back to normal mode

1409218
for-loop	arrays
so if you must create for example inside a for-loop 4 arrays from the same arrays and you want to use the same function you can only test against a property of the class you must previously set to the value you want to test

1409250
google-chrome	firefox
i managed to get it to work with firefox and ie - i couldn t in google-chrome though it appears that it supports the dom methods

1409251
post	get
just get those post variable and use the mail function from php

1409283
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that everything is going well in google-chrome and mozila firefox but in ie8 some times it works ans sometime its not and when it worked in i8 sometime then it takes long time rather than i set the interval and need that the response will be correct so now i am confusing that is ie8 cache the xmlhttp and the same result is shown from its cache so something else

1409285
uiview	subviews
i have a subviews that has been added to my uiview

1409313

1409348
hash	md5
this for example allows you to use a secure hash function not md5 truncate the result as described and still get secure tokens

1409416
dictionary	map
what i d do in this case is to build that python dictionary to map file extensions to image mime types and than try to load the image while expecting for a notimageerror exception

1409452
move	drag
if you drag the folder using the right mouse button to the location where you want to move it you will get a menu when you drop it with several options using svn methods of moving or exporting it

1409505
for-loop	loops
however if you don t like that the upper bound variable used only in loops is accessible outside loops you can take advantage of the initialization phase of the for-loop like this

1409547
implements	extends
if it does then the generated proxy will also implements those interfaces but it will not extends the target bean s class

1409573
width	height
the maximum width and maximum height

so basicaly i must write a script that passes the post get variables to the new script on the new website or to write a .htaccess file that will redirect the post get variables to the new website

1410190
pull	push
the gang of four book has a section for this very problem and they advise against both the push and the pull models

1410190
pull	push
the pull model may be inefficient the push model may not be reusable enough

1410220
gmail	hotmail
it is a widely used tool maybe not by gmail or hotmail but i ve seen it used in several big companies and or universities which is both powerful and works very well

1410250

this has happened to me many times particularly after an upgrade to a new versioning of the sdk and iphone os

1410321
hide	show
and all use the gotab function to show or hide a specific div

1410321
hide	show
if a tab has been clicked it will show hide a specific div ie divtabcontrol_1

1410321

width	height
i had done the hori and verti width two for loops which in the hori scenario loops through all the pixels in the height and only the half of the pixels in the width

1410414
ssl	https
this makes sense otherwise a man-in-the-middle attacker could simply respond to a user s https request with a redirect to http or a different https site and take over the browsing session defeating the purpose of ssl

1410439
width	height
also keep in mind that the width and height of the image will be swapped

1410439
width	height
if your original width and height are w and h then you should use something like this

1410477
yacc	bison
i know and use bison yacc

1410538
client-side	server-side
however you can achieve this by using a customvalidator that performs validation on the client-side server-side or both at a minimum server-side validation is recommended

folder	directory
i then create the registry directory entries and assign this newly created user full access to the appropriate sub keys folder

1410701
iprincipal	iidentity
forms auth also creates an iidentity iprincipal object on the executing thread which means you can use cas principalpermission demands to protect methods classes and even assemblies which can be separated from your asp.net application making authorization the cross cutting concern it should be

1410736
tabcontrol	tabitem
if you just put tabitem into the tabcontrol with controls inside of them it will not behave this way however

1410737
postgresql	mysql
rodbc which is very mature and feature-complete but doesn t correspond to the dbi framework as the postgresql mysql sqlite oracle .

bazaar	git
the branching problem is why i use a distributed version control system git in my case but there are also mercurial and bazaar where creating a branch is trivial

1410781
accessor	properties
if the application was run through a debugger then the jit compiler will not inline the properties accessor

1410781

1410781
int	double
edit okay my initial tests used an int data type instead of double

1410804

typedef	using-declaration
a declaration is a definition unless it declares a function without specifying the function s body it contains the extern specifier or a linkage-specification and neither an initializer nor a function-body it declares a static data member in a class declaration it is a class name declaration or it is a typedef declaration a using-declaration or a using-directive

1411077

1411238
rss	feed
if you want to really see what is happening with the html your best bet is to use curl or wget to directly download the rss feed and then view the file in a text editor

1411242

we use jquery very heavily on a couple of projects and along with it we have loads sometimes close to a dozen plugins we use jqgrid jpolite jgrowl colorbox layout validate formatters mask to name a few

1411263
pop-up	dialog
the reason for this is that the flash player is single threaded and so you are blocking the ui from reacting to the dialog pop-up until the maths chunk is finished

1411296
webkit	blink
at the time of writing it is supported for contenteditable elements in current mozilla from firefox 14 and webkit blink browsers but not ie

1411448
rpyc	pyro
on the other side of the coin pyro does try to provide some security which rpyc s author claim is too weak anyway and underlies many of pyro s claimed complications

rpyc	pyro
a more independent voice david mertz offers here a good explanation of rpyc pyro has been around much longer and david points to previous articles covering it

1411460

dotnetzip	sharpziplib
in addition to dotnetzip licensed with microsoft public license that jay riggs mentions there s sharpziplib licensed with gpl

1411889
dotnetzip	sharpziplib
edit dotnetzip and sharpziplib support encryption

1411934
keydown	keyup
for example i ve seen people regularly using keyup keydown keypress events to disallow various characters and then forgetting that people regularly use copy-and-paste which negates the intended validation

1411961
free	memcpy
old or use memcpy and just free

1411961
memcpy	realloc
as to why a memcpy or realloc approach can be significantly faster

1411973
folder	directory
we have some folder that contain thousands of files so i don t want to just zip the whole directory into one large file - it would be preferrable to have a number of smaller files so that it would be easier for a user to find the data bucket they are looking for

1411989
onclick	onsubmit
one for the image s onclick to call form s onsubmit and then form s onsubmit which is the appropriate place for the false return to halt form submission

there is also a function to convert a 64 bit int to a vb double and a function to format the number in kb mb and gb

1412065
agile	sprint
what it does is that just makes a connection to the tfs team foundation to get the open and fixed bugs by sprint we actually use scrum agile process

1412075
daemons	launchd
the downside to this is of course if somebody leaves the app running for a week or two and since a portion of the app is a launchd daemons this is a definite possibility for those who rarely restart there could be a log file of non-trivial size built up during this period depending on what logging level is enabled

1412138
width	height
i would also size your image to the desired size if it isn t already then you don t need to supply width and height or worry about ie rendering the resize

1412142
post	get
if you want to use only ntlm you ll need to set that string to just ntlm and you ll need to make sure it says ntlm not windows in your transport clientcredentialtype or you ll get the exception you quoted in your original post

1412142
kerberos	ntlm
conversely if anyone is experiencing this error and they want to use kerberos certificates if available they should check to see if the metabase ntauthenticationproviders says negotiate ntlm

the tool can automatically pend edits based on file attributes or md5 hash

1412382
pop-up	dialog
then i had others try the app on jaunty and instead of a bubble pop-up with the new notify-osd system as i expected the notification turned into a dialog box

1412382
pop-up	dialog
it is unacceptable to have the dialog for me as it doesn t stay over all windows so the user won t see the pop-up right away necessarily which is the whole point of using the bubble pop-up

1412385
inherited	properties
the inherited means that your class gets inherited whatever properties and methods that the base class specifies

1412392

1412401
post	get
i tried changing the xhr call to a get call instead of post and the same issue was happening

1412446
getter	setter
you could make your life easier by encapsulating your getter and setter logic in a base class and then simply calling those methods from any new properties you create simply acting as thin wrapper around those methods

1412504
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
your problem is most likely in the method that inits and presents the method that viewdidappear is in or in the init viewdidload viewwillappear method of loadviewcontroller

1412544
children	parent
in my entity model i have made associations children and parent

1412562
post	get
i want to send parameters to next page action by post not get

1412613
width	height
most likely this is caused by your image s width being set by its parent container instead of its height

1412616
put	get
my only concern with a notsupportedexception is that generally those are the exceptions that get thrown when dark matter has been introduced to the system or to put it another way this method must go into the system on this interface but we won t turn it on until version 2.4

1412631
addition	multiplication
write your own relational operations and exclude the used of addition or multiplication as a possibility

1412688
int	chars
as mentioned in the comments below and in the linked article chars int unit empty list and some instances of variant types will have this property

1412713
innodb	myisam
you can alter your myisam tables to innodb and then define foreign key constraints with the on delete cascade option

1412719
octal	decimal
this is because 0123 is octal notation because of the 0 at the beginning while 123 is decimal

1412722
octal	decimal
because 0123 means 123 in octal base 8 which is 83 in decimal

1412725
octal	hex
prefixing a number with 0 indicates octal base 8 much the same way 0x indicates hex base 16

1412730
octal	decimal
0123 is notation for an octal number 83 decimal off the top of my head whilst 123 is a decimal number

1412775
melt	reshape
i thought of using the reshape package to melt the data but that is just a preliminary thought

1412882
clang	llvm
when i switch the compiler version to clang llvm 1.0 in existing projects i get the following build error when precompiling the .pch file

1412882
clang	llvm
additionally xcode should not even be trying to find llvm-gcc-4.2 as the whole point is that i switched from that compiler to the new one clang llvm 1.0

1412901
ready	each
the first ajax request that i make alerts the server that i want some json content and it begins building and cacheing a response sending me back status pending for each subsequent ajax request until the json is ready

1412929
mouse	keyboard
important the user could select a cell by keyboard tab or arrow and by mouse clicking

1412931

jeremy - at this point you d be better off emailing me or even better writing to the hecl mailing list rather than relying on my rss feed to notify me of so articles related to hecl

1412935
int	chars
if they are chars type of data you might need to convert them to int in the where clause to get it to work

1412956
hide	show
i made this script to show and hide these spans once clicking on a section of the image map

1412956
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in ie but firefox doesn t budge google-chrome displays it alright enough with minor problems that i think i can fix

1412990
lisp	scheme
the differences between lisp and scheme and clojure itself for that matter shouldn t be a concern especially if you are just starting to learn

1413011
post	get
the problem with the post approach is that you are not saving anything by your actions and so you are expressing your intentions better with a get request

1413042
hide	show
link how to show hide divs by select. jquery

1413072
hide	show
swap show hide so that it looks like this

1413169
int	double
however if you have multiple different types of data like string int double currencies percentages etc which all use a jtextfield as an editor then you need to create multiple custom editors

1413174
lisp	scheme
if you really want to study lisp scheme is a good place to start

1413193
boost	stl
this seems to be a common ish sort of problem but it s not one that s solved by boost or the stl

1413203
ocp	principles
ocp open closed principles is one of the solid principles

1413207
onmouseover	onclick
so all i did was put onclick handlers on onmouseover event for a table cell putting onclick hanlders immediately on td would take too long too

1413221

i need to collect data text and radio button dropbox checkbox selections on a web form store it somewhere then provide the ability for users to display similarly collected data from other users as well as search sort and filter the aggregate data

1413296
put	get
i d like to avoid reloading the first page just to get the id value but i don t want to put the id in a querystring

1413308
post	get
also in firebug where it says either post or get it says options

1413311
throttling	throttle
any system that implements throttling in php is likely just going to throttle sending it off the the mta and the mta still ends up being a point of failure

1413312
post	get
have the link post instead of get

1413324
maven	m2e
if you are also using m2e it should work ok with maven projects as well as long as you ensure that maven and eclipse are compiling to the same target folder so the eclipse incremental compiler can be used to modify the class file

1413369
int	boolean
however i don t believe its appropriate to write out that special case explicitly in your function either otherwise your function is incongruent with the way .net implicitly treats int and boolean

1413401
lisp	scheme
use the ideas that make lisp scheme powerful but rethink them around the java platform

1413403
submit	submission
put general form submission stuff in form.onsubmit rather than an onclick on the first submit button

1413484
x86	64bit
the differences between 64bit and 32 bit jits can be considerable especially on x86 platforms where calling conventions can change and enregistering opportunities are very different

1413486
post	get
so where can i post some of my code and get real programmers to review it

1413486

i m aware of dotnetzip and sharpziplib but neither support the asynchronous functions from what i can tell

1413521
lisp	scheme
they are excellent if for some reason you want to use standard scheme or standard common lisp on the jvm

1413550
haskell	ocaml
interpreters do exist for static languages haskell and ocaml both have interpreters and there used to be a popular interpreter for c but that was a long time ago

1413550
lisp	scheme
however the points he describes can be handled at run-time in a compiler and many compilers exist for lisp and scheme that have this type of dynamic binding

1413558
inherited	subclassing
the same inherited annotation is on the subclassing

1413560
postgresql	mysql
for instance many db libraries act as interfaces in that they can operate with many different actual dbs mssql mysql postgresql sqlite etc. without the code that uses the db library having to change at all

1413561
wxpython	pygtk	wxpython	pyqt
you need a graphical toolkit such as tkinter pygtk pyqt pykde wxpython pyobjc or pyfltk

1413663
processors	hyperthreading
spinwait is useful on hyperthreading processors

1413663
processors	hyperthreading
with hyperthreading multiple os scheduled threads can be running on the same physical processors sharing the processors resources

1413663
cpu	processors
spinwait indicates to the processors that you are not doing any useful work and that it should run code from a different logical cpu

1413663
processors	hyperthreading
if this thread is running on a thread on a hyperthreading processors it is consuming processors resources that could be used for other threads running on the processors

1413669
width	height
if it were up to me i would design the triangle so that it would be immutable and take in the width and height in the constructor

1413682
x86	64bit
still if anyone knows a consistent class or registry key that will output 32 64 32-bit 64bit or x86 x64 i would greatly appreciate the information

1413738
children	parent
normally this wouldn t matter since the parent would usually become large enough to contain all of the children so they would show through the parent s background

1413862
pull	push
now all is setup well and everybody is able to do whatever they are expected to they are able to pull push commit - everything looks fine except when we check logs

1413890
stdout	fflush
maybe you have to call fflush stdout at the end of your program to fflush console output

1413910
post	get
if the latter and i think you will eventually have this problem it s because you are returning the entire view regardless of whether you get the page via ajax or a full post

1413911
micrium	freertos
i know i can go with something like freertos iar powerpac or micrium to name just some of the options for the os and file system

1413913
serializable	deserialization
this is probably not the answer you are looking for but there are plans to implement proper polymorphic deserialization and necessary support on serializable for it for jackson version 1.4 or so not the next one 1.3 but one after that

1413970
cfstring	nsstring
i believe that you can t do this directly but you can create a custom static probe that feeds in the cfstring nsstring as a char which you can use with copyinstr

1414007
cvs	svn
subversions - for all revision-control checkouts cvs svn git hg etc

1414011
put	get
i have tried to put the code in linklabel_click event handler in try-catch block but i still get the error below

1414030
udp	tcp
it may be the case that i m just misthinking that a browser acts more like a udp client than tcp in this instance but any suggestions or explanations would be welcome

1414070
children	parent
if you add the children first then parent elements then their parent elements and so on you will incur a major performance cost due to invalidation of all children in the tree instead of just the path back to the root through each parent

1414086
validationsummary	customvalidator
i have a customvalidator requiredfieldvalidator and validationsummary controls on an aspx page to check the current password and make sure the new password is not blank

1414093

1414103
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the alpha versioning of the groovy-eclipse plugin v2

1414118

1414130
put	get
i have the email settings filled out properly as i can use send_mail fine but whenever i intentionally put up erroneous code i get my 500.html template but no error email is sent

1414236
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
short answer dijkstra s is your best bet if you want just a few shortest paths and the floyd-warshall algorithm is better if you want to find the shortest paths between every pair of nodes

1414255
implements	extends
his take on the program to the interface statement as you can gather from his title is that you should happily implements interfaces but very rarely use the extends keyword to subclass

1414273
mouse	keyboard
one usually on the keyboard for modifier keys and such and the other on the mouse

1414328
width	height
if your primary goal is to keep the div in it s place without changing it s height or width based on the amount of text i d go with

1414360

as far as i understand getter setter should always make copies in order to protect the data

1414388
unix	bsd
linux bsd and unix systems to

1414652
sorting	grouping
paging with grouping works with a trick but than sorting fails on complete dataset

1414670
applaud	ripple
while i applaud your idea and realization of uniqueidentifier being a really bad choice for a primary and clustering key in a sql server table i think in this particular case i d probably leave it as is - trying to convert that will cause lots of ripple changes all throughout the asp.net tables - probably just not worth the effort

1414748
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
at the moment firefox 3 internet explorer 7 safari 3 google-chrome renders this list perfectly screenshot here

1414856
ocl	uml
so if you have purchased a high-end uml tool which supports mapping ocl to code generation set up a stereotype in your tool to express what the strategy pattern is and then generate code which includes those assertions if they are runtime or applies the assertions to the structure in the model if they are meta model assertions

1414856
super	abstract
i m not quite sure whether the tools let you write constraints against the metamodel - ie assert that a strategy must provide a function which rather than just asserting the pre and post conditions but then such assertions are also checked by the type system of most languages if you make the method abstract in the super type of the strategy anyway

1414870
postgresql	mysql
the cms is build on php and mysql or postgresql

1414946
public	protected

if i put these lines below i get an error because webmessageencoding is not a recognized element

1415097
put	get
if i put the lines below a custom binding tag i get an error that wshttpbinding does not have a custommapper defined

never store passwords in a database but store a salt and hash version of every password

1415160
hash	salt
second rule calculate a hash over password with additional salt and store this in your database

1415160
hash	salt
then hash again with hash plus salt

1415160
hash	salt
better yet create a list of salt just list of words and whenever a new user account is created pick a random salt word to use to hash his username plus password

1415160
hash	salt
just store a hash with combined username and salt

1415173

also remember that once you have show it once you can then hide it and still get the hwnd

1415415
ubuntu	debian
if using ubuntu or debian

1415443
folder	directory
despite that visual studio creates extra obj folder in my source directory

1415452

1415760
getter	setter
it s quite tedious when all 3 things are needed or when i have to delete all 3 and i m wondering if there s a plugin or something where you can simply say i m going to have a variable called foo of type bar and i want getter setter methods for it

1415767
getter	setter
according to convention properties should typically not do anything substantial in the getter or setter

1415780
int	chars
bit 32 is the lsb of int 1 ... then that s the same in little endian as bit 0 is the lsb of chars 0 .

1415780
int	chars
bit 32 is the lsb of chars 4 ... in which case you can just cast a pointer to the int array to a pointer to chars array

1415786
hex	binary
i read the file in binary mode converted by the data into a string representation of the hex values and used unofficial wordperfect documentation to create regular expressions to swap out all the hex strings representing non-text formatting codes and meta data then converted everything back into text

1415797
ienumerable	ienumerator
if you just have ienumerator you could write something similar only implementing ienumerable then use cast or oftype to get to an

1415874
opera	firefox
web browser tested on ie8 firefox 3.5.2 opera 10 shows file length before i start download the file

1415884

re hash reference - generally i think its best to stick with the attribute setter getter unless like with above trigger there is no easy alternative

1415926
google-chrome	firefox
if you want to know how firefox 3.5 or google-chrome gets the geolocation then please take a look here how google firefox geolocation api works

1415926
google-chrome	firefox
basically what firefox 3.5 as well as google-chrome does is to get the list of nearby wi-fi networks and send that list using json to a google webservice which will then return the approximate coordinates

1415926
google-chrome	firefox
to get geolocation from firefox google-chrome you just call a few javascript methods

1415951
lisp	scheme
common lisp of course scheme might be an easier introduction though and easier to get a stable simple common environment

1416008
haskell	ocaml
for the record i mainly work with .net f# c# and dabble in haskell and ocaml

1416042
unix	bsd
the winsock api is based on unix bsd sockets

1416064
hash	salt	dictionary	map
the point is since salt is different for each user you cannot use a prebuilt dictionary of hash to map the hash passwords to clear text rainbow attack

1416068
hash	salt
when creating the hash password you should use double salt

1416068
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
create a salt random md5 or sha1 then use format something like sha1 -- password-- salt-- and then store hash password and salt in database

1416075
apache	lighttpd
if you are using apache or lighttpd you can use the x-sendfile header to send files that are not in the web root provided you haven t changed the configuration of mod_xsendfile

1416077
mef	prism
today i would say prism and mef complement each other

1416077
mef	prism
thus as prism is currently built on unity you can use it to leverage mef

1416077
mef	prism
this means with mef you have modularity from top to bottom wheras with prism modules are more granular units

1416082
unsigned	short
i have a 2d array grid of unsigned short

1416090
mef	prism
as far as prism with mef the challenge at this point is you need to write a bunch of code as prism does not yet have implementations of the services necessary to talk to mef

1416090
mef	prism
it enables unity and mef to talk back to one another thus you can using the existing prism source with mef through the unity bridge

1416097
hash	salt
since the salt is some private string only you possess knowing the hash of a salt password will not help an attacker who has a run of the mill rainbow table

1416097
hash	salt
if the salt is the same for every user then when he sees that the hash xyz123 corresponds to apple and notices that another user s hash is also xyz123 he can conclude that that user s password is apple

1416097
hash	salt
if you store the hash of username+salt+password you only need to know the single global salt value at lookup time

1416103
hash	salt
you can take for example a hash of the id and a salt value and store it- you can then verify the token when the user connects

1416122
switching	screens
adobe reader tends to turn all of my open pdf documents into title bars after my laptop computer os x goes to sleep or switching screens

1416128
put	get
the thing i really don t get is that when i use sloppy and put my speed at 256kb it runs alot faster then when i don t use sloppy and just use local host

1416128
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i get the same slowness in all major browser firefox ie google-chrome opera safari

1416133
folder	directory
my guess is that it cannot find assembly because it s not in the same folder and not in the gac or other directory where the system is looking for

1416149
chunked	transfer-encoding
this is especially true if the remote http server uses transfer-encoding chunked

1416152
virtualenv	setuptools
at the moment afaik virtualenv is not supported with python 3 because among other things setuptools the magic behind easy_install is not yet supported on python 3 although there is work in progress towards a solution for that

1416185
folder	directory
there s not such thing as wipping out .svn folder you just copy the files to the the checked out directory and since they are changed i just commit them using tortoisesvn

1416195
google-chrome	firefox
i simply use ie instead of google-chrome firefox for quick and dirty programming checks

1416195
cassini	iis
the best solution would be to install iis and not use the built in cassini web server

1416197
uiview	calayer
uiview and calayer work in pairs

1416197
uiview	calayer
all uiview objects are backed by a calayer the calayer is the object responsible for layout and rendering to screen

1416197
uiview	calayer
the uiview is a delegate to the calayer and is responsible for drawing it s graphics when needed

1416197
uiview	calayer
calayer will let it s delegate the uiview draw into a cgcontextref

1416314
accessor	properties
because the predefined color objects in the color struct are not constants they are static properties with only a get accessor

1416346
versioning	upgrade
then you can in your own time upgrade to the latest versioning of the thirdparty component simply by setting the -r rev.nr. parameter to the latest revision of the external repository

aptana radrails is a free one based on eclipse does regular ruby too

1416548
aptana	radrails	komodo	aptana	komodo	radrails	textmate	aptana	textmate	radrails
you might want to try komodo edit which is more in line with textmate than say a full blown ide like aptana radrails

1416567
put	get
put b over a using a blend mode get the resulting image

1416589
octal	decimal	octal	hex
also if given base 0 it will assume hex if the string begins with 0x octal if it begins with 0 and decimal otherwise

1416593
profiling	benchmarking
you could always profiling or benchmarking it

1416596
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
the popnavigationitemanimated is used for a uinavigationitem only not for a uinavigationcontroller object

1416607
post	get
what i need is a query to get the top n post in descending order by vote score where vote score is defined as the number of up votes the post has - the number of down votes the post has

1416610
postgresql	mysql
note that this is ansi sql so will work across sqlite mysql postgresql oracle sql server db2 etc. etc

1416610
post	get
to get your top n post you would simply append to the above query

1416610
postgresql	mysql
limit is used by postgresql and sqlite a bit differently in mysql and not in oracle or sql server as an fyi

1416610
post	get
so to get the post info associated with this

1416619
hex	binary
the function nsrl_hex2bin takes a binary buffer the size of that buffer and the hex string you want to convert

1416634
folder	directory
it might be better to saving to the local files folder in the profile and popping up an explorer window for that directory

1416636
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
also you are using a for..in loops to iterate over orders if orders is an arrays you should use a normal for-loop

1416636
for-loop	arrays
another reason to avoid it is because the order of iteration used by this statement is arbitrary and iterating over an arrays may not visit elements in numeric order and also it seems to be much more slower than a simple for-loop

1416643
subtract	add
your code is doing exactly what you asked it to do because you didn t ask it to add or subtract one day you asked it to add or subtract 24 hours

1416674
put	get
you can put before your argument this way you ll always get a tuple

1416677
builtin	isinstance
typically strings plain and unicode are the only iterables that you want to nevertheless consider as single elements -- the basestring builtin exists specifically to let you test for either kind of strings with isinstance so it s very un-grotty for that special case

1416700
hex	binary
you can open the file in a hex editor which is a text editor that is more sensitive to binary data

1416714
multiplying	add
take that number multiplying by 60 and add 57 to get the minutes

1416714
multiplying	add
take that multiplying by 60 and add 19

1416727
sudo	passwd
currently it detects a sudo command and then i try and get it to bring up an authorization window for the user s passwd exactly like you would see in installer

1416742
hex	binary
hex editors are more of a tool for geeks as they also give you the computer data in hex a more readable format compared to binary

1416753
hex	binary
if you view a file using a hex editor you can see both the binary representation of the file and ascii text interpretation of the binary side-by-side

1416767
tiff	png
it takes a data that contains bytes of a recognized image format like jpg png or tiff parses thoses and decompresses the images appropriately

1416798
queue	fifo
for this you re best off a file based fifo queue

1416821
google-chrome	firefox
sharepoint works on other browsers but it s a bit more frustrating to new users of it when it s on firefox or google-chrome

1416827
lisp	smalltalk
slightly more seriously though lisp and smalltalk are still in tiny niche spaces after 60 and 40 years it turns out that the child of the two bore fruit

1416827
lisp	smalltalk
various lisp and smalltalk hackers are starting to show up speaking about their child ruby at ruby and rails cons

1416827
lisp	smalltalk
as it happens ruby timeframe 15 years has quite a bit of the lisp and smalltalk magic

1416833
boost	stl
once you get your head around programming with boost and stl it can really feel like a higher-level language

1416835
integer	unsigned
each is a big-endian 4-byte unsigned integer

1416864
int	chars	int	double
gcc vc++ partially initialized local array structure members are default initialized to zero int null chars chars string 0.000000 float double

1416895
udp	tcp

1416913
subtract	add
the calendar object has an add method which allows one to add or subtract values of a specified field

1416924
metaclass	isinstance

1416933
post	get
i m not sure why this is the case but if i can get some more info on this i ll update this post

1416966
sorting	grouping
you could grouping the strings based on guesses about the alphabet and language and then use locale-specific sorting for each grouping

1416984
instances	transient
note that the benchmark shows singleton resolution and transient resolution a singleton is there you register an instances of a class using unity

1416990
width	height
when i traced out main screen s bounds and any subview s bounds the width and height is still 320x480 rather than 480x320

1417011
hash	salt
i m considering a strategy of distributing users amongst mysql masters based on a hash of their username plus an unknown-to-user salt just as added insurance against any funny games

1417013
put	get	post	put	post	get
you need to specify the method in your link_to_remote call - either get put post or delete

1417013
post	put
put is for updates post is for creates delete is for well deleting

1417025
g++	gcc
configured gcc for mips.. g++ core

1417028
inherited	properties
i have a custom control which inherited from system.web.ui.control and some of its properties can be declaratively set using databinding expressions

1417112
hide	show
in those cases you either have to have all fields thereby confusing the user or some javascript to hide show the relevant fields again making the user experience a bit weird fields disappearing appearing as they enter the credit card number

1417136
qunit	jsunit
qunit and jsunit come to mind

1417205
disk	ram
buy additional ram and setup a ram disk and do your compilation there beware that if you restart your machine you ll loose ram disk content - this can be mitigate stable os version control sistem ... speeding up build times dramatically or speeding up the build â ditch the ssd and go for the ram drive

1417246
width	height
a binding with the grid or window with property height or width didn t work either

1417257
hash	salt
alternatively you could add a hidden field containing the record id and cryptrographically sign that field to make sure it can t be changed or take the record id hash it using the user id as a salt and check that assuming you re using the membership providers you should use the provider unique id not the login name

1417331
int	chars	int	boolean
the promotions are outlined in 6.3.1.1 arithmetic operands boolean chars and int which says among other things

1417331
integer	unsigned
the promotions are applied only to objects or expressions with an integer type with a rank less than int and unsigned int or bitfields

1417331
unsigned	short
even though the variables are unsigned short they are promoted to int since on your platform int can represent all the values of unsigned short

1417331
unsigned	short
as litb indicated in a comment if the platform had int implemented as a 16-bit type which is permitted - ms-dos for example the promotion of unsigned short would be to unsigned int instead of int since an int wouldn t be able to represent all values of unsigned short unsigned short must be at least 16-bits

1417359
sorting	filtering
filtering and group-by but not sorting on mva attributes is supported

1417362
children	parent
i have an mdi parent form that creates many mdi children at run time

post	get
register_globals means that all variables passed through get or post are avilable as global variables in your script

1417451
django	web.py
deepen your python skills by using it for everything say django or web.py python

1417451
lisp	smalltalk
it s worth looking at the origins of languages php was originally announced as an extension of ssi ruby tries to take the best of perl smalltalk and lisp but has elements of a c java-like syntax perl is intimately connected to unix and everywhere although usually invisible to end users despite some very good perl web frameworks

1417530
udp	tcp
instead of using heavy-weight tcp we can utilize the connection-oriented reliable feature of tcp on the top of udp by any of the following way

1417530
udp	tcp
it aims to provide a solution where udp is too primitive because guaranteed-order packet delivery is desirable but tcp adds too much complexity overhead

1417581
public	protected
if you have an abstract class with virtual properties they can either be protected or public and this is what the outside world will see

1417581
inherited	properties
when you extend inherited this class you can override these properties but not mark them as private

1417594
firefox	safari
in safari ie all 3 work fine however in firefox 3.5 only the news ticker seems to work

1417633
filesystems	btrfs
i suspect that the modern linux filesystems ext4 btrfs do this too

1417674
octal	decimal
vb.net supports decimal without prefix octal with prefix and hexadecimal with prefix integer literals directly

1417681
hlsl	glsl
now obviously there are the shader languages such as hlsl cg and glsl that have native support for this kind of stuff however i m looking for something that s able to at least compile to sse without autovectorization but with built-in support for vector operations

1417696
dictionary	map
to map a list as a dictionary

1417755
cpython	ironpython
as a general purpose python ide i use netbeans python ea which treats cpython jython and ironpython pretty much as equals so i can just set it to the platform i want to use today and everything else remains the same

1417757
put	get
if you put that sql_calc_found_rows and then if you put a limit you will get the full number of rows is no affected by the limit

1417783
postgresql	mysql
we are using container isolation to run different instances multiples version of the databases postgresql and mysql but the naming scheme problem is still the same

1417790
pop-up	dialog
the write can only be initiated by user interaction a button click and it will always pop-up the host os s file save dialog box prompting the user to choose a location or cancel

1417797
put	get
in terms of the external urls i think it helps to distinguish between the urls that make up the api of the system get users 1 put users 1 etc and the urls that are just there as a convenience to humans using a web browser users new users 5 edit etc

1417797
put	get
these urls are typically just the address of the resource you want to interact with and then you use the http method and the parameters to indicate what it is you want to do get show me this resource put change this resource etc

1417797
post	get
to look at your examples above then get users create might make sense and is pretty similar to get users new which is the default but post users create would roughly translate to make a new one of users create which doesn t quite make sense

1417800
ggplot2	lattice
it s not a problem for ggplot2 or lattice graphics - you always have to explicitly print them when they are called in non-interactive settings like from within a script

1417841
shadowbox	lightbox
if i remove the doc type the sliding captions function correctly but shadowbox and other lightbox type popups do not because they require the doc type to be set to work correctly.

1417841
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox and google-chrome regardless

1417854
post	get
i would interpret method as get or post or whatever but it makes no sense to me in the context of your other findings - the content of the post cd or not surely can t affect that

1417862
photoshop	fireworks
i fixed it by opening every jpg image and saving them again in a good image editor like photoshop or fireworks

1417878
pull	push
those distributed cache products use various push and pull models with pub-sub messaging to achieve consistency across the instances

1417944
implements	extends
in other words if you extends or implements something with generics remember to define the generics arguments for them

1417947
nsstring	nsdata
i apologize if my previous answer misled you i was merely printing the description to demonstrate that the nsdata can be encrypted and decrypted. instead use nsstring s -datausingencoding and -initwithdata encoding methods to convert between nsdata and nsstring

1417947
nsstring	nsdata
base64-encode the nsdata then create and return and nsstring of the encoded output

1417959
post	get
the keyword you are looking for here is cross-site request forgery or xsrf where an authenticated user can be made by an attacker via scripting or other methods to make a get or post request to your site

1417959
client-side	server-side
these attacks are not quite as immediately damaging as server-side sql command or client-side html javascript injections but they are more common than both few web programmers both to include the proper countermeasures unfortunately

1417968
vim	emacs
so there is this question for vim users that keeps popping up in my feed reader but i m an emacs person

1418085
maven	pom.xml
this container is populated with the maven dependencies by a maven builder added to the .project when the maven nature is enabled which processes the pom.xml and downloads any artifacts and sources if needed

1418085
maven	m2e
by default m2e uses an embedded version of maven to do its processing

1418085
maven	pom.xml
there is a comparison of the eclipse maven integrations alongside the maven-eclipse-plugin a goal that generates the eclipse metadata files from the pom.xml contents

udp	tcp
facebook for example changed some kernel level thingys in linux changed how memcached works for example they wrote a memcached proxy and used udp instead of tcp

1418102
temp	tmp
if you re not using a full-blown programming language you should place temp files in the folder whose name is stored in the environment variable temp or tmp

1418114
post	get
also what if a resource can be updated at any time would the method to return it be a get or a post

1418117

children	parent
every nodes children has a left right value that is between the parent nodes left and right which makes it very easy to find for example all children parent of a node

1418229
quicksort	mergesort
be aware of the real-world impact of the so-called hidden constants too - for instance the classic quicksort algorithm is o n 2 in the worst case and o n log n on average whereas mergesort is o n log n in the worst case but quicksort will outperform mergesort in practice

1418302
int	chars
on most platforms int and chars are examples of types that are primitive but can be boxed

1418329
int	boolean
autoboxing allows java to automatically convert things like boolean and int to their object versions boolean and int automatically in most cases

1418334
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
say for example that the variables are the letters x y z t and the operators are a for addition and s for subtraction -- strings of adjacent letters implicitly mean high-priority multiplication as in common mathematical convention

merb	ruby-on-rails
edit as pointed out in a comment merb and ruby-on-rails are merging and according to merb creator ezra zygmuntowicz see this blog post merb is ruby-on-rails and ruby-on-rails is merb so i guess merb isn t that light

svnadmin	svnlook
both svnadmin and svnlook are considered server-side utilitiesâ they are used on the machine where the repository resides to examine or modify aspects of the repository and are in fact unable to perform tasks across a network

1418642
for-loop	arrays
edit i just noticed that you don t even have to use an arrays since you convert it to a space separated string in the for-loop anyway

1418645
ubuntu	opensuse
i usually am on either opensuse 11 or ubuntu 9.04

1418678
post	put
according to this post no one ever put it online.

1418685
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	move	drag
ideally when the drag exit event is fired the button would stop receiving touch move events the customview would get a touchesbegan event even if i need to fake one myself somehow and all future touch events touchesmoved etc would be sent to the customview

1418741
put	get	post	put	post	get
yes get and delete map pretty cleanly but put can do create and update but complete replacement only and post is a wildcard verb

put	get	post	put	post	get
post is really to handle everything that does not fit into get put and

1418781
super	implements
if implements properly an object will release any objects it owns before calling the super this them to get deallocated if their retain count is also zero

1418791
udp	tcp
mmorpg s that i m familiar with probably don t use web services for communication since they are stateless but rather a custom server-side program a service that listens for tcp and or udp messages

1418791
udp	tcp
they probably use a custom tcp and or udp based protocol look into socket communication

1418867
int	chars
the second parameter to memset is typed as an int but is really an unsigned chars

1418869
int	chars
the second argument to memset is a chars not a int or u32

1418869
int	chars
c automatically truncates the 0xbaadf00d int into a 0x0d chars and sets each chars in memory as requested

1418890
margin	height
i d try putting a negative margin or other positioning method equal to half the page height on the target anchor tag

1418901
udp	tcp
online games are going to have their own protocols built on top of tcp ip or udp

1418934
gcov	lcov
for instance gcov or lcov both count the number of times a line is executed so certainly you could modify the source to print out that line and sleep instead of just incrementing a counter

1418965
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	debian	linux	debian	centos	centos	linux
the resulting executable must be installed in a number of linux distributions slackware arch ubuntu debian centos and a few more and i am completely clueless on how to achieve it

1418965
debian-based	centos
all i know centos and debian-based oses has package managers like apt or yum but i am not sure those apply to my case

1418970
implements	sealed
i m a bit confused on the best way to implements idisposable on a sealed classâ specifically a sealed class that does not inherit from a base class

1418970
implements	sealed
i m assuming that because memblock is completely sealed and never derives from another class that implements a virtual protected dispose bool disposing is not necessary

1419042
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

1419130
implements	extends
for composition the stack class should have a list not implements or extends a list-based class

banking	billing
i don t want declined authorizations showing up on their billing statement as seen in an online banking system as pending

1419175
post	get
i just saw this code while studying the wordpress source code php you can see they mergre turn all get and post values into 1 request array

1419180
post	get
this is so if you have a get variable and a post variable with the same name it will choose the post variable over the get one

1419199
put	get
on a sunday afternoon to put something together in a few hours you would need to know a framework and buy some plugins and get everything up and moving without much work

1419201
free	malloc
valgrind uses its own malloc and free so it can alert you to incorrect news and deletes

1419240
cout	cin
in this code cout in usually stdout and is receiving the characters enter first name firstname which is presumably a variable is receiving the data from cin which is probably stdin

1419244
put	get
get and put would work just as well if they didn t conflict with alas-too-common other uses

1419244
cout	cin
but that doesn t seem to have much to do with right-to-left vs left-to-right just with your q s title about reading aloud -- cin absorb x or essteedee cout emit blach emit essteedee endl kinds of reading code aloud on the phone

1419254
accessor	properties
when using an object properties instead of variable it is interesting to know that the get accessor of the intermediate value is not called

1419254
accessor	properties
only the set accessor is invoked for all properties accessed in the assignation sequence

1419289
int	chars
from the documentation one can assume that 0 can be either an int or a 1 chars string to signify empty

1419320
nunit	mstest
both nunit and mstest as well as most of the other xunit frameworks can also be used for full integration tests ones that use the actual dependencies such as calling web services

1419320
nunit	mstest
mstest see msbuild nant nunit mstest and frustration

1419320
nunit	mstest
for a strict comparison somewhat biased in the other direction see comparing the mstest and nunit frameworks

1419320
nunit	mstest
from a personal standpoint pure opinion the key features i need have been available in nunit so i ve seen no reason to evaluate mstest

1419379
distutils	buildout
i m working on a buildout script that needs to install a distutils package on remote server

1419438
hide	show
i will show and hide it using jquery with

1419453
stdout	stderr
for example send data to stdout and errors or informational messages to stderr

1419453
stdout	stderr
you can also redirect data from stdout and messages from stderr independently

1419459
width	height
have you tried setting the height and width of the picture to 100

1419528
folder	directory
edit another reason for this behaviour in git is that it can t track things that are above the root repo directory above the folder containing .git folder which would definitely be required if you want your super-projects and sub-projects refer to the same repositories

1419563
accessor	properties
the properties directive declares the accessor methods not the underlying members

1419570
awt	swing
that is an awt component and you should not be using awt components in a swing application

1419570
awt	swing
awt components are painted on top of swing components which could be causing the problem

1419570
awt	swing
i ve never mixed awt swing components so i don t know what wierd painting artifacts you will encounter

1419610
for-loop	arrays
how to identify s length where is an arrays so that i can use that in the for-loop now i have used as 15 by default.

1419621
width	height
need to check this one they probably affect the width and height of the element differently

1419640
jobs	cron
if you have a light workload you can use the approach used by django-mailer which is to define a jobs model save new jobs into the database then have cron run a stand-alone script every so often to process the jobs stored in the database deleting them when done

1419650
debian	linux
i just installed it with apt-get on debian linux with

1419662
ienumerable	ilist
most of the time i end up going with ilist over ienumerable because ienumerable doesn t have the count method and you can t access the collection through an index although if you are using linq you can get around this with extension methods

1419710
children	parent
of course there is one view that is the parent of all others and the view controller keeps track of that one and can then follow the tree down to handle the children for the purposes of handling touch or updating etc.

1419723
post	get
look at this post about using xmlrunner.py to get python working with hudson

1419813
post	get
as other post mention you couldn t rely on the browser to do this automatically but since you re writing the web pages you can get the browser to do the compression you re after with a little work

1419839
client-side	server-side
considering php is executed on the server-side you cannot have this kind of pop-up in php you ll have to go with some javascript code that s executed on the client-side ie in the user s browser

1419845
put	get
i decided to put this issue aside and continue development which included adding things after level five so the user can loop through levels and return to the main menu and so on and so forth...and i m not sure why but the userdefaults are saving for level five now so i don t know if it s because before level five was the very last thing the application did and even though it didn t terminate itself and did other things maybe it wasn t actually writing the defaults to disk...i m still not sure what was wrong but it s working now and i can t get it to fail to see if i can get an error with the synchronize.

1419882
metaphone	soundex
i ve been studying soundex metaphone and other string search techniques the past few days and in my understanding both algorithms work well in handling non-english words transliterated to english

1419908
vbscript	jscript
you could use windows script host which comes with vbscript and jscript by default and install perlscript from activestate

if you click on that it opens the xml file for the notifications rss feed

1420216
hide	show
i know i can hide a table but anyone who knows just a bit about access can show the hidden tables anyway

1420246
lisp	scheme	rational-numbers	integer
another approach for some expressions would be scheme or other lisp family languages which support rational-numbers - so 1 3 is represented by storing the integer 1 and the integer 3

dxcore	coderush
that said there is a very powerful engine under coderush called the dxcore which can be used to create a very wide variety of functionality

i d guess the servers will be running on linux bsd or solaris almost 99 of the time

1420452
addition	multiplication
in boolean math and op is like multiplication and or op like addition in regular math

1420467
mouseup	mousedown
you could try to set up document wide event handlers for mousedown and mouseup

1420467
mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown you store the element under the pointer and on mouseup you check if there is a selection

1420511
stdout	stderr
if the only i o support is to a uart to stdin stdout stderr then it is simple

1420519
put	get
your objective here should be - get rid of mootools 1.11 put the compatibility code in and try to get the panel to work there may need to be some slight changes here and there but it s not that big a task

1420568
implements	extends
in this case there is no simply way to extends compile-time range checking to exclude the unused members but a couple of set types will simplify the business of implements any necessary runtime checks

i m currently working with an asp.net cms that keeps close to 500 code files in the app_code directory as well as hundreds of web forms with code-behind in various folder of the site

1420665
width	height
if there is no child control then you can use the width and height attributes to control the size of the element

int	chars
the int list implementation takes 8 bytes of memory per chars

1420836
width	height
but as i have specified the height and width here the images displays outside the image there is white space around the image which make the user looks that images is placed inside the panel

maven	cobertura
according to mcobertura-65 the maven cobertura plugin still doesn t know how to aggregate reports of sub-modules into a consolidated one

1420969
maven	cobertura
some work has been done to implement a merge target on the maven cobertura plugin see mcobertura-33 but this code hasn t been included in the plugin yet

1420981
stdout	stderr
the syntax will redirect 2 stderr to 1 stdout

1420987
udp	tcp
however i think most people that take the time to understand it and who know the shortcomings of tcp appreciate it -- it is a well designed protocol that builds on our 30 years of knowledge of tcp and udp

1420987
sctp	tcp
streams provide usually i think you can turn it off an order guarantee within them much like a tcp connection but there can be multiple streams per sctp connection

1420987
sctp	udp	sctp	tcp	udp	tcp
my personal summary of sctp is that it doesn t do anything you couldn t do another way in tcp or udp with substantial application support

1420987
sctp	tcp
diameter clients must support either tcp or sctp while agents and

also try bypassing the mouse altogether with the keyboard shortcut for build ctrl+shift+b

1421026
put	get
i would put blatantly wrong values so that you get a clearly wrong value when this occurs

1421039
stdout	stderr
is to redirect stderr toâ stdout as strace writes to stderr by default

1421056
affinity	processors
to do so i call getprocessaffinitymask to retrieve the system affinity mask and then switch the process to each processors in turn

1421056
affinity	processors
it returns exactly the affinity mask i expect but apic ids can still be the same for different processors

1421065

equals	gethashcode	equals	icomparable	icomparable	gethashcode
types that implement icomparable must override equals.types that override equals must also override gethashcode

1421294
stdout	stderr
keep in mind that you have to read everything the app send to stdout and stderr else it might get stuck writing there

1421320
equals	icomparable
icomparable is an interface that defines that two instances of the implementing class can be seen as greater than less than or equals to one another

1421320
equals	icomparable
in the above example i have implemented icomparable but not overridden equals

1421320
equals	compareto
if you call compareto with two separate instances of the class that have the same value it will say there are equals

1421320
equals	gethashcode
two equals items should return the same hash code which are used for quickly finding items used as keys in hash tables so if you override equals then you should also override gethashcode

1421320
equals	icomparable
so if you are overriding equals then you should also define all of the above to ensure consistency if you are implementing icomparable then the same applies

1421328
equals	gethashcode
there are two ways that objects in your code could be compared equals and gethashcode

1421328
equals	gethashcode
for your object to be compared properly in all situations when you override the equals method used for some comparisons you must also override gethashcode used in the rest

1421332
equals	icomparable
icomparable is used for comparing two objects - if these are considered equals then compare will return 0

1421332
equals	gethashcode
when a class overrides equals it should also override gethashcode since two equals objects should hash to the same value and this hash should be based on the fields properties used in the implementation of equality

1421364
mouseup	mousedown
an ugly hack will be to use the mousedown or mouseup events

1421491
free	malloc
from what i know correct me please a memory allocated with malloc will never be released back to the system ever until the process ends i.e the allocator will simply keep it in the free list if i free it

1421510
mouse	keyboard
you can override wndproc update program.lastactiontime on each relevant keyboard mouse event message

1421532
free	malloc
this applies only to your current system based on the documentation you have provided for free and mmap and malloc but as the previous poster has stated behavior of these is implmentation dependent

1421559
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
i parsed a text cal code with bufferedreader and bufferedwriter in java unfortunately lines which i red and wrote with outstream.write line

1421587
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
well bufferedwriter and bufferedreader are encoding agnostic - they never deal with the actual encodings as they re just buffering existing readers and writers

1421587
outputstream	inputstream	bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
to work round this you should usually use an inputstream inputstreamreader or outputstream outputstreamwriter pair possibly wrapped in a bufferedreader bufferedwriter and specify the encoding explicitly

1421594
free	malloc
if you were to free the remaining allocation glibc s malloc implementation should be able to return most of the pages allocated back to the system

1421613
tooltip	scrollbar
as we know ie selectdrop down list has limitations on tooltip on individual option items and also horizontal scrollbar

1421635
instances	transient
if you do not specify a value for the lifetime the type is registered for a transient lifetime which means that a new instances will be created on each call to resolve.

1421650
daemons	systemd
to manually run the script the same way the systemd does use service daemons start if you have that command or else try

1421662
hash	md5
yes if you hash the ip address with md5 or sha1 you ll get the same hash for a given ip but without the ability to easily reverse it

1421662
hash	md5
if this is a concern instead of a 128 bit hash like md5 use a 32 bit hash so that the hash space is the same size as the ip address space

1421662
hash	md5
to do this you could simply truncate an md5 hash

1421697
put	get
i admit i m not a c++ expert i m certainly not as seasoned in it as many of you seem to be but if i can cut and paste 99 of the code from c# to c++ and get it to work in 5 mins then i m a little put out that it takes twice as long to execute

1421718
int	boolean
the one downside of this approach is because matlab doesn t have a way to marshal or serialize arbitrary matlab objects into java you re limited to floating point numbers int need to cast them in matlab using int8 etc. boolean strings arrays and java objects

1421770
button	checkbox
the click method is intended to be used with input elements of type button checkbox radio reset or submit

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
true i do have a uitabbarcontroller waiting in the wings and it has tabs with uinavigationcontroller and other vcs in it

int	double
the big difference between converting int to long and converting float to double is that the int types have two components sign and value while floating point numbers have three components sign mantissa and exponent

1421901

1421950
free	malloc
for your specific implementation there is no reason to free since the malloc won t release to system memory and so it will only release memory back to your own allocator

we use an md5 hash function to create the unique 32 character string for indexing purposes

httpconnection	downloading
you can downloading image using httpconnection and inputstream create encodedimage from stream and then display it

1422040
multiplying	add
on an x86 environment where floating-point evaluation is actually done in the specified type using sse registers conversions between float and double are about as expensive as a floating-point add or multiplying unlikely to be a performance consideration unless you re doing a lot of them

1422132

ant	maven
i was wondering if anybody has seen a technique for adding maven dependencies to ant

1422427
ant	maven
it seems to me that if somebody extended ant to be able to reference maven dependencies perhaps only for open source libraries ant could piggyback at least one great feature of maven without having to re-invent the wheel

1422460
cvs	svn
in cvs there is a cvsinfo file that takes care of this i am wondering if svn has such a thing

1422476
ant	maven
the maven has a set of maven ant tasks that can downloaded and placed in your ant lib directory

1422476
ant	pom.xml
after that you can declare a classpath in ant that is defined by the dependencies in your pom.xml

1422482
ant	maven
there are also maven tasks for ant though they are not as fully featured

1422485
cassini	iis
note the blank page is coming from cassini if you move the app to an actual iis server you will see the 401

add a mouselistener that consumes mouse events to the transparent glasspane this will get you modality feature #2 background seems non-responsive

1422629
firefox	safari
this works perfectly in firefox and safari but internet explorer is generating an error

1422647
switching	screens
this approach can get very tricky and feel hacked together if you don t debug it properly because you need to be aware of all the enabling disabling going on otherwise you may find that you re unable to submit the page when everything appears valid on screens but in actuality something was left enabled when you should ve disabled all validators on each call before the switching then enabled just the ones you need

1422650
rbac	acl
it is a common antipattern in the php world that frameworks like ruby or django are cloned only as a subset of what these modern frameworks deliver - as a typical syndrome yuo see a lack of good acl or rbac integration into these frameworks - what essentially is a joke

1422657
put	get
i could put the dance program in a network database but i d have to shove instructions in fairly quickly and there d be a lot of readers using a rather thick protocol dbi sqlclient etc.. to get a small bit of text

portrait	landscape
how it works the dimensions of your poster image determine whether your video opens landscape or in portrait mode

1422711
portrait	landscape
so poster images that are wider than high will open landscape poster images that are higher than wide will open a movie in portrait mode

i think what would be feasible would be a container format with a encoder decoder or something like that

1423238
put	get
you ve spoke your piece now shut up and do the work they tell you to do do it well do it fast and if you want put as much mvc into it your part as you want as long as you don t tell anyone else how to write their code if you re so good you get it done extra fast then ask them for more work to do and repeat above steps

simply because the initializer method is an instance method and class_eval is defined for objects of type class which means they can be executed only in class-method or inside the class body

1423939
client-side	server-side
if i controlled the server-side as well as the client-side code i could also consider compiling such script fragments on the server instead of on the client and then sending it as precompiled code to the client side to be executed

partialfunction	implicit
if you are coming from groovy background where they have an implicit iterator or even from scala where you can do without this |i| using partialfunction then you might find it a logical question however at the current moment the best you can do in ruby 1.9 or even inside rails is to use the symbol#to_block method like jrl mentioned

1426591
int	chars
there is performance degradation from this specifically because you re using chars rather than int for lookups but unless you have a large 1 million+ rows or data it probably won t be an issue in practice

1426600
width	height
apparently you just have to specify the width and height after initialization

1426618
post	get
but if you really don t want visitors to access your pages directly a simple quick-fix is to use post instead of get

1426638
implements	extends
extends any class or implements any

1426664
post	get
but how to handle changing value in current form which is not lead to form post or get simply handling onchange functionality

both of these can be accomplished with a combination of chown and chmod

1427031
post	get
the query string is used for http get requests and form variables for http post requests

1427031
post	get
so when i say that the two are not interchangable i mean that you cannot change the page from using a get to a post without breaking functionality

1427031
post	get
so imho the implementation of the page can quite clearly reflect the fact that you intend it to be called by a get or a post request

1427051
svg	vml
i wanted something javascript which could be included in my web page and which would silently convert all my svg to vml in a fashion similar to what excanvas does for canvas

1427158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey

1427158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist tkey tvalue is faster than sorteddictionary tkey

1427167
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist and sorteddictionary pretty much do the same thing but are implemented differently thus have different strengths and weaknesses explained here

1427191
mp3	wav
the best way to do this is to apply the 30-second truncation fade in and fade out to the wav audio data before converting it to an mp3

1427191
mp3	wav
either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file

1427199
oncreate	ondestroy
i need to catch onactivate oncreate and ondestroy events of child form in the main parent form code

1427213
versioning	upgrade
databases tend to survive longer than most applications since administrators are smart enough to not fix things that aren t broken so they often don t upgrade their systems with every new versioning

1427213
versioning	upgrade
still it s a real pain when you upgrade your database to a newer versioning yet the extensions aren t compatible with that one and thus won t work

1427264
pull	push
aside from the discussion on whether this should be a push or a pull what s the best way to get what is effectively a software update out

1427302
for-loop	loops
the general rule is that if you have to break out of a for-loop then use a while loops instead

1427320
versioning	upgrade
the first is the actual live website the second is the last versioning in case we need to roll back and will be the target of the next upgrade

if i put everything in one single i will have that output which i don t want to get

1427550
cldc	midp
most mobile phones use some combination of the mobile information device profile midp and the connected limited device configuration cldc

1427558
xlsx	.doc
the xlsx extension is not because the file is hosted in sharepoint but because it is an office 2007 template all office 2007 extensions have an extra x behind their extension so .doc becomes .docx

1427575
integer	unsigned
a dword_ptr is not a pointer but rather a pointer sized unsigned integer so rather than ref uint it should be an intptr

1427581
subtract	add
rectangular problems with only add subtract bitshift + table essentially doing rotation by angles of the form tan -1 2 -n

1427581
cos	sin
although if multiplies are cheap enough to allow using dot product then don t bother with cordic perhaps use a table of sin cos pairs for rotation matrices of angles pi

1427641

range	max	range	min	min	max
i think this interpretation of the standard is wrong a subsequence of expected form should always yield a valid integer value if out of range the min max values are returned and errno is set to erange

1427689
post	get
besides here i have posted my original problem to the developer s forum if i ever get an answer i ll post it here unless else post it here first

1427701
getter	setter
there is a setter and a getter for the effectivefromdatejulian which is a number representation of the date

1427701
getter	setter
it is a getter only though and relies on the setter for the numeric property to get its data from

1427718
post	get
if you use ajax to dynamically do the get post and all you are doing is trying to show a loading icon while this is happening its fairly simple to throw up an asynchronous activity indicator

1427718
hide	show
the above code sets a dom object with id loading to show and hide when any asynchronous request has been initiated and stopped

1427718
hide	show
this is also possible without jquery of course there s just a bunch of browser compatibility javascript and its not as easy as simply subscribing to the ajaxstart and ajaxstop events to show and hide your loading img

1427784
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you re asking whether you can move the mod_rewrite configuration from .htaccess to httpd.conf then yes

1427865
jar	war
if the 3rd party jar is defined as a dependency in your war project it will automatically be bundled into the web-inf lib folder of the war when it is packaged by the war plugin

1427865
maven	pom.xml
also note that if the 3rd-party jar is a properly-defined maven project it s dependencies will be defined in its pom.xml

1427865
jar	war
once the jar is on the war s classpath you can reference any spring configuration files it declares by importing them into your war s application context

1427872
mvp	command-pattern
without using css-based ui design event bus command-pattern based gwt-rpc mvp presentation tier and google-gin gwt implementation of guice it s hard to overcome complexity in gwt just like in any other heavy gui framework

1427908
restrict	shared
i am developing a site on a shared host and have to restrict my data schema to a single provided database

1427921
nsstring	nsdata
you really need to change the nsstring object into either a utf8 representation to send or to archive it as an nsdata object you send with the full length - you can t just cast an nsstring as a c string either for sending or receiving

1427923
free	malloc
using rcpp and with stl container classes like vector etc means you never have to explicitly call malloc free or new delete which removes another frequent source of error

1428112
width	height
i was able to get around it by setting the height and width of the image tag however when if the margins on the print preferences changes the image will be chopped when printed

1428138
webkit	gecko
hopefully ie will come along in performance but that has clearly not been their focus over the more recent revisions so it s unrealistic to expect it to keep up with engines like webkit and gecko which have put a high priority on performance and have improved in leaps and bounds over a relatively short time

1428178
width	height
the only way to get a map to display in a tab at all is to set the css width and height of #map_canvas to be absolute values

1428178
width	height
changing the width and height to auto or 100 causes the map to not display at all even if it s already been successfully rendered using absolute width and height

1428178
width	height
but as i said i appear to be stuck with applying only absolute width and height css to the map div

1428193
width	height
i would like panel a to be sized to the height width of the frame and maintain that size on frame resize but i would like panel b to overlap a

1428193
width	height
b will be at a fixed position 0 0 to make it easier with a fixed height and width

1428298
awt	swing
do not mix lightweight swing and heavyweight awt components within a container where the lightweight component is expected to overlap the heavyweight one

1428305
kerberos	ntlm
now from what i have read this is telling the service to use ntlm rather than kerberos

1428323
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome etal

1428328
slideup	slidedown
there are the slidedown slideup and slidetoggle functions native to jquery 1.3+ and they work quite nicely.

1428357
post	get
now i do not get the double post back in ie8

1428371
for-loop	arrays
make a regular for-loop around your stream and use the counter as index in your totx arrays

1428379
width	height
a grab the current coordinates width height and zoom of the currently displayed dynamic map the one the user is seeing

1428418
jsf	seam
i recently sat down to port a simple rails app i have to jsf using seam to get a feel for which i would be more productive in

1428418
jsf	seam
jsf seam appears to be very popular but it doesn t make sense to me that it would forbid all http methods but post

1428433

annotation public protected private

1428444
coalesce	nvl
to supplement the rest of the answers here which deal primarily with null values and coalesce nvl nvl2

1428499
postgresql	mysql
something that would allow me to port schema from say microsoft sql server to postgresql or mysql to sqlite

1428508
width	height
as far as i can tell it appears that disabling a second monitor is done by calling changedisplaysettingsex on the second monitor and providing a width height colour depth and refresh rate of 0

1428523
for-loop	arrays
if order is unimportant sort the new arrays the old arrays will naturally always be sorted and then do a for-loop through the list

1428526
firefox	safari	svg	vml	opera	safari	opera	firefox
raphaã l uses the svg w3c recommendation and vml as a base for creating graphics and supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

1428537
getter	setter
getter and setter specifically are

1428541
exif	jfif
effectively when you mention jpeg jpg you are actually talking about jpeg jfif although there is a spec for jpeg tiff and jpeg exif usually digital photos is where you ll see these

1428541
exif	jfif
a lot of the time whatever produces the exif file will also include what jfif parsers need to decode properly so it is transparent to the end user but not entirely a valid and to spec exif file

1428558
mousemove	mouseup
matlab slider has a problem that it fires callback only on mouseup and not on mousemove so pure matlab implementation would always feels strange

1428602
equals	tostring
a frame object contains few properties but doesn t override equals yet overridden tostring seen above

1428606
sorting	filtering
more on queries filtering sorting complex lookups

1428626
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme
i would highly recommend picking a functional programming language you are comfortable with f# ocaml haskell or scheme and taking a long look at how its standard library is structured

1428647
mxml	haxe
if you want to target the avm2 use either flex through mxml with least possible ammounts of as3 or haxe .

1428647
mxml	haxe
but you really should just build a clean app from scratch using the best of what the language you use provides being a subset of oop aop and fp haxe avm1 would allow all of these things or a declarative approach as allowed by mxml .

1428678
innodb	myisam
i converted my primary tables over to innodb and now many of my queries are taking over 1 minute to complete where they were nearly instantaneous on myisam

1428748

kerberos	ntlm
here is a blog post explaining ntlm versus kerberos with respect to wcf

1428897
int	boolean
if you re using votefu which it looks like you are then i d recommend that you convert to using int to store the vote values instead of boolean

1428900
debian	linux
could threads work just as well it s debian lenny linux

1428970
gif	png
i have used it extensively to dynamically create class instances from remote jpg gif png

1429003
inherited	properties
the second feature is a little harder to implement but if you inherited from all your controls and add a command properties which is triggered by an internal event such as click which is binded to a command instance in the viewmodel

1429005
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
solaris freebsd osx have dtrace linux has oprofile

1429033
button	checkbox
otherwise it is possible that a value of inappropriate type to your button filed reference to checkbox instance will be assigned to a variable you pass

1429038
cpu	affinity
use cpu affinity masks for both sql and iis asp to isolate the two on separate cores configure sql to reserve less ram so that it leaves free memory for iis asp configure your app pools to recycle aggressively to prevent application pool growth

1429076
fink	macports
i downloaded macports used easy_install tried fink

1429076
fink	macports
this predates the macports fink apt approach but you have much more control on it although you have to do everything by hand

1429159
jsf	seam
in my personal experience jsf seam aren t actually very popular due in large part to these sorts of issues

1429197
folder	directory
i ve played with the idea with subversion of having a myproject_eclipseproj folder that only contains the the eclipse project files and directory with an svn externals prop that pulls in all the myproject files directory

1429197
versioning	upgrade
you could also have specific folders for different eclipse versioning so each developer wouldn t be forced to upgrade if something changed in the .settings or .project file between versioning

1429215
updatepanel	scriptmanager
controls can register with the scriptmanager directly or via an updatepanel

1429221
cpu	processors
if it uses 5 times as much processors power but completes in 1 5 the time then the cpu used is basically equivalent

1429228
for-loop	arrays
a length property is also set which is why the matched elements of a jquery object can be iterated over like an arrays using a for-loop or commands such as

1429266
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to save a file using getsavefilename and want to have a couple extra pop-up at the bottom of my save file dialog to allow the user to specify further options

1429273
innodb	myisam
innodb needs tuning as a final note about myisam to innodb migration i should mention about innodb tuning

1429273
innodb	myisam
tuning myisam from defaults rarely gives more than 2-3 times gain while it can be as much as 10-50 times for innodb tables in particular for write intensive workloads

1429273
innodb	myisam
just for the record the people behind mysqlperformanceblog.com ran a benchmark comparing falcon myisam and innodb

1429273
innodb	myisam
the benchmark was really supposed to be highlighting falcon except it was innodb that won the day topping both falcon and myisam in queries per second for almost every test innodb vs myisam vs falcon benchmarks â part 1

1429317
opera	firefox
when i tested it at home at work on windows 2000 ie6 xp four different machines and a virtualbox instance ie6 7 opera 9 firefox 3 and vista ie 7 as well as through konquerer and firefox on ubuntu on two different machines it worked fine i don t have a mac

1429367
udp	tcp
rv is udp ems is tcp

1429403
udp	tcp
basically i am trying to convert activestate code recipe 392572 using the win32 iphelper api to getting the active tcp udp connections using the getextendedtcptable function

1429411
viewdidload	dealloc
so if you are adding your subview viewdidload gets called and you initialize your player then perhaps you are removing the subview and adding it again since you didnt release the view assuming you have only one copy dealloc does not get called i dont think so anyway then if you re add the view masscheersoundid will get overriden and leak.. another problem might be that since you have masscheersoundid as a property you allocate it and the setter generated also retains it so then you are left with a +2 reference count when it should only be +1...so assuming my assumptions are correct i would suggest to write viewdidload like this

1429453
draggable	droppable
i am using jquery draggable droppable bound to a live mouseover event

1429453
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari i m getting a strange behavior where when i initially load the page only some of the droppable areas work

1429508
fseek	ftell
fgetpos and fsetpos use a fpos_t so can potentially work with very large files in scenarios where fseek and ftell won t

1429525
children	parent
an easy and common fix for this is to simply put something after the floating children set to clear them and therefore force the parent to have height - for instance

1429651
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
in short that solution uses the mousedown mouseup and mousemove events of the controls to allow them to be dragged around

1429672
appkit	nsapplication
you need to link against foundation and appkit especially the latter for nsapplication or whatever gnustep s equivalents are

1429681
invokelater	invokeandwait
if i take the whole thing which runs for about 0.4 msec from outside the swing thread and wrap every call to a mutator in an invokelater or invokeandwait the ui is a lot more responsive

1429713
button	checkbox
for this to be possible through pure button pushing the browse dialogs popping up after selecting add external jars... and add external class folder... would need something like a checkbox to specify if you want to add the relative or the absolute path

1429718
ant	maven
you can either use ant + ivy or maven to manage your library dependencies

1429726
ssl	https
https is the protocol used to request a page from the server using ssl or tls encryption

1429741
awt	swing
btw it s awt s event dispatch thread not swing s.

1429767
maven	m2e
maven 2 has a steeper learning curve but provides a much richer set of functionality for building your projects and eclipse integration through m2e or iam

1429805
haskell	ocaml
here is ocaml code that uses functors to give a strict implementation of haskell parameterised over the monad in question

1429821
hide	show
this is a link to using a windows function to hide the horizontal and force vertical to be show at all times

1429834
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i can get a download prompt for text files fine in opera google-chrome and firefox but not ie

1429858
tolower	toupper
this search is case sensitive but you can just as eaily use toupper or tolower to change it

1429916
sorting	filtering
alternatively consider supporting filtering rather than sorting to accomplish the same purpose

1429929
put	get
in fact i want to put connection string for sql database in this file and get it when needed so i need to change it if the connection changed

1429933
entity-relationship	diagram
at the top of the section he talks about e-r entity-relationship diagram

1429961
comparator	comparable
this depends on either comparator from the comparable interface or compare from the comparator to ensure uniqueness

1429999
move	drag
so if you try to drag an item from the main list to a sublist it will consider the entire sublist to be a single item and try to move over it as such

1430043
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to troubleshoot why ie is slow slow processing this javascript compared to google-chrome and firefox

1430043
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox there is no delay for any onclick events but in ie it pauses for like 5 seconds before doing anything

1430096
for-loop	arrays
i had declared some variables as const which ie doesn t recognize and i was also using the for..in construct on arrays which i replaced with an indexed for-loop

1430110
post	get
i would suggest that you change your form submission to use the post redirect get pattern to avoid a resubmission if they hit refresh on the demo page

1430123
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
i agree with you as far as firebug s performance goes in recent releases therefore i have found myself using the excellent webkit inspector - in both google-chrome and safari - and opera dragonfly a lot more recently

1430148
folder	directory
right click in package explorer - import - file system - browse to the directory containing your jars - check the boxes next to the jars you want - browse to the workspace folder you want to import to probably your lib folder - finish

1430154
post	put
i have a form that i use jquery i don t think i need to put code in this post the question is pretty basic

1430171
vim	emacs
the biggest difference for me in choosing to use emacs over vim was the built in gdb support in emacs

1430188
vim	emacs
there is a huge difference on a day-to-day level - vim or any vi variant is inherently modal you go into command modes where you cannot edit and emacs along with most other editors are not

1430188
vim	emacs
that is at the heart of the vim emacs debate

1430199
vim	emacs
also emacs shortcuts are mainly accessed through modifiers and obviously the vim interface is famously modal giving access to an absurd amount of direct keys for manipulation

1430199
vim	emacs
emacs used to be the only editor of the two that was proagrammable and while vim has a lot of weird levels to it s programmability with the addition of python and ruby bindings and more i forget vim is also programmable in most ways you d care for

1430213
stdout	stderr
i m trying to redirect the output of a third-party native dll which outputs to stdout stderr from within c#

1430213
stdout	stderr
the output of both stdout and stderr should go to a log file

1430227
mousemove	mousedown
the alternative is listening on mousedown instead of mousemove which fixes the previous issue however the nested button loses it s click

1430231
inherited	properties
it doesn t inherited from known properties of your other projects

1430235
readonly	temporary
readonly queries can be load balanced across all your n readonly nodes and if your read write master goes down temporary at least your app will be able to service read operations

1430280
width	height
doing this will require you to rework your layout but in theory it should allow you to change those elements either via normal means like their height and width properties or via strange stuff like zoom and not have them affect the layout of anything else as absolutely positioned elements are not supposed to affect the layout of anything else on the page

1430288
ant	maven
a third choice besides chssply76 s options is to use ant with the maven ant tasks

1430304
puts	gets
asp.net mvc page has one link ajax.actionlink which gets the form to create and puts it in one of the div

1430419
restrict	shared
if you don t have a shared memory location which is accessible from multiple threads or you can write your code to either eliminate that shared memory variable or restrict access to it to only one thread then there is no possibility of a race condition and you don t need to worry about anything

1430419
restrict	shared
to eliminate nbr 4 you have to restrict write access to the block of code that accesses the shared memory from more than one thread at a time using lock or some comparable synchronization methodology

1430434
vim	emacs
vim was always faster to start up than emacs

1430434
vim	emacs
i m saying that on any machine out-of-the-box installs of vim will start up faster than out-of-the-box installs of emacs

1430434
vim	emacs
and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs

1430452
int	double
for an anonymous type with an int and a double as properties i disassembled the following c# code

1430475
punctuation	words
punctuation is defined to be included with the words it is closest to

1430478
nstextfield	nscolorwell
i m attempting to bind an nscolorwell to the nstextfield value and implementing an nsformatter subclass

1430478
nstextfield	nscolorwell
the nscolorwell is bound to an ivar in the app delegate which is also bound to the nstextfield

1430546
kerberos	ntlm
i can see in the windows event viewer that it s not using kerberos to connect to the box iis is on it s using ntlm

1430615
hide	show
at this point once the user logs in he will see the master tempdb and will also see the new db which he is a db owner of..you may want to go to tools option and enabled the option to hide system objects so that you don t show the master tempdb etc

1430624
put	get
get rid of the semi-colon after scrolltop and put it at the end of the line-

1430657
google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome and works in firefox but not in ie

1430662
action-filter	onactionexecuting
aside i ve also written a list action-filter attribute that picks up these values from the route and if the model is a collection automatically applies the sorting and paging in onactionexecuting

1430669
ienumerable	iqueryable
using linq particularly with extension methods on ienumerable iqueryable you can build up your queries using your standard and custom logic depending on the inputs that you get

1430704
post	get
in methods that respond to search or paging i first load up any values from the session then override them and set the session values if necessary with values from the querystring or form parameters depending on whether it is a get or post

1430725
width	height
so canvas.left and top could be 1 2f s while width and height could be 3 4

1430735
cakephp	kohana
i m not sure what the right term for this piece of software is but i m calling it an application platform or an application framework but this isn t anything like cakephp kohana or zend - it s another level higher than that

1430747
portrait	landscape
however if content in landscape mode requires the user the scroll down then when the user returns to portrait mode the screen is zoomed out so to speak

1430798
mouse	keyboard
i am quite new to driver development and trying to write a simple filter driver that will enable or disable a keyboard or mouse device

1430808
ant	maven
if you build with something other than an ide like with maven or ant two popular build tools you would need to set the classpath using the ways they specify

1430851
google-chrome	firefox
i am using plugin here and i got a problem in internet explorer and google-chrome not firefox

1430862
vb6	vba
for vba and vb6 it s free

1430900
apache	nginx
unless you are running a very non-standard setup your web server apache iis nginx etc. will have multiple processes that run php separately for each request that comes into the server

1430913
post	get
to create an easy way to get the last number post comments etc

1430917
cpu	processors
while listening for an event your program has no need to consume cpu time and thus will sleep until an event occurs freeing the processors for usage until then

1430929
postgresql	mysql
i m facing the same issue with running part of an application off postgresql for where it will benefit and the rest of mysql where it s better

1430939
vim	emacs
i started with vi went to emacs then to vim

1430939
vim	emacs
cut and paste in vim takes more steps than in emacs iirc

1430939
debian	linux
i ve been in the bare minimum linux to fix something just a month or two ago in a debian distro

1431019
action-filter	onactionexecuting
the easiest way to do this is to write a common base class that all of your controller types subclass then stick an action-filter on that base class or override its onactionexecuting method

1431045
width	height
it has stretch uniform and no explicit width height set

1431069
put	get
you should probably rewrite this to put things like start increment and span somewhere in static storage rather than in function arguments because this will get rather confused if they change but i m feeling lazy about that

1431080
google-chrome	firefox
the same url works fine in rest of the browsers ie firefox and google-chrome

1431102
punctuation	words
as a first cut you can try b which will match any string starting with at a words boundary non-word character such as whitespace or punctuation

1431115
width	height
my intention is to create a web login for a c# application which need to be opened in ie in specified width and height and needs to call a function in the application program

1431125
width	height
i don t think is possible to specify new ie window width and height values you may need to use javascript for that

1431126
stdout	stderr
if the user does not want the warning from stderr to go to a downstream process that is parsing stdout they don t have to do anything special

1431126
stdout	stderr
if the user wants the warning from stderr to go to a downstream process that will parse stdout and stderr the user can use 2 1 to redirect stderr into stdout

1431132
ftp	smb
this is automatic and you dont need to do anything other than making the folder you talk about to a network shared folder via smb or ftp server

1431158
translation	localization
localization like this takes consideration of the languages you want to translation to

1431226
google-chrome	firefox
but with firefox and google-chrome the value for user.identity.name and isauthenticated is always empty

1431226
google-chrome	firefox
when using ie it s fine but with firefox and google-chrome it s not

1431283
google-chrome	safari
i have made it work in google-chrome safari by making the following two changes

1431283
google-chrome	safari
the effect is quite jittery in google-chrome safari this seems to be something to do with webkit reporting the newly applied height of the textarea as 4px less then you set it to i assume this is due to the box model and some browser applied styles but i don t know

1431288
folder	directory
pack uri scheme is only used for files inside resource directory where else if you just add a file or add a file as a link and set its type to content it will only copy the file in your bin folder but it will not be packed inside application resource directory

1431318
ubuntu	linux
if you are trying to install boost on ubuntu linux just run sudo apt-get install libboost1.37-dev

1431318
ubuntu	linux
for example using the package system s version of boost will make it more likely that your software will run smoothly on other ubuntu linux deployments which use the package manager s version of boost

1431331
vim	emacs
to extend vim functionality you must recompile vim emacs not

1431331
vim	emacs
emacs has vim in self viper-mode

1431331
vim	emacs
emacs usually need manually installation vim typically preinstalled on all unix like os but if you have ssh access to host tramp-mode win vim

1431331
vim	emacs
if you try vim you hate emacs so start from emacs first

1431374
getter	setter
you may need to move the attribute if you need the code to execute only after the setter rather than the getter

1431383
implements	extends
i m still quite new to spring and i ve found it to irritating making all these crud daos so i ve made a public class genericcruddao extends hibernatedaosupport implements cruddao

1431388
folder	directory
well my example is a wpf app that adds files folder in a directory to a treeview but you should get the general idea

1431418
hide	show
when you show one you want to hide the others so something like

1431418
hide	show
or you may wish to hide them all before the switch and then show the one specified

1431444
hash-collision	key
hash tables do have an even larger advantage over sorted trees when the key comparison is expensive as with strings because for large sets fewer items will have a hash-collision than a search tree is deep and because it s possible to cache the hash code for key already in the set skipping the expensive comparison for probably all but the matching result

1431461
installation	upgrade
i suggest you upgrade your java installation

1431490
hide	show
your newcustomerviewmodel will contain those fields and might depending on your flavour of mv be responsible for some presentation logic to show hide parts of the view and basic validation ensuring that both password fields match

1431491
inherited	properties
you d need to update the inherited properties of the view to be the code-behind file

1431530
cpython	ironpython
but there are certain portability issues between ironpython and cpython

cpython	ironpython
if there are scripts written in cpython which use these you will have a hard time porting them to ironpython

1431530
cpython	ironpython
also if the ironpython scripts use any .net libraries you will have a hard time porting them to cpython

1431563
getter	setter
dtos in mvvm and mvp are usually very dumb objects and are basically just a bunch of property setter and getter

1431606
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the npapi plugin mechanism is the standard mechanism for browser plugins on macos and linux -- everything other than ie really -- if you use the npapi your plugin will work on safari firefox and opera

1431666
daemons	launchd	children	parent
daemons sets sigcld to sig_ign when launchd which at least on linux causes terminated children to immediately be reaped rather than becoming a zombie until the parent invokes wait

1431671
antivirus	mcafee
i disabled the antivirus mcafee and corrected the user name i unnecessarily gave the domain whereas it was not required

1431675
put	get
you can put some php file into the root and get

1431722
width	height
in other cases capturepicture returns a picture with height and width values 0

1431741
keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown	keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown
the movie clip continues to receive events for example mousedown mouseup keydown and keyup

1431806
spweb	spsite
one option is to build in some protection where if a valid spcontext can t be found this is created with new spsite spweb objects as necessary to provide that context

1431806
spweb	spsite
this may require some rearchitecture depending on how the expression builder was designed particularly because you would now need to correctly dispose of the created spsite and spweb objects something that s not required when using spcontext

1431843
font-lock	slime
i am doing small modification to slime so that i can get all currently loaded symbols from lisp analyze them and make font-lock fontify them

1431863
font-lock	cperl-mode
i hack on cperl-mode mostly and it is a simple matter of cperl-init-faces which sets the internal font-lock variables and a restart of font-lock

1431875
gif	png
the images could be png gif jpg while the header content-type seems to only have space for one type

1431892
width	height
i played around with width height as auto but that didn t work

1431966
nonetype	iterable
returns me a nonetype object not iterable error

1431988
pascal	delphi
for delphi developers a company called peganza created two useful sourcecode analysers pascal analyzer and pascal browser

1431991
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome etc but if i load it in ie none of the jquery functions run and ie s script debugger shows

1432029
hide	show
as for show and hide even when the selectors will work this isn t defined as you expect

1432067
keydown	keyup
different browsers have different keycode values in keyup and keydown events which will not necessarily correspond to the ascii code for the corresponding character

1432208
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.5 and google-chrome already support it

1432273
pylons	turbogears	django	turbogears
python is also a very good choice for web development with good frameworks like django pylons turbogears etc

1432273
wxpython	pyqt
python is also great for cross-platform desktop applications using wxpython pyqt tkinter gtk etc

1432285
versioning	upgrade
here s a way to execute your upgrade commands only if a certain versioning is in place

1432316
lisp	smalltalk
javascript for instance is a scripting language with object oriented aspects smalltalk c++ functional aspects lisp and the syntax of c

1432317
firefox	safari
unless jquery is being super clever and it is clever but i don t think its this clever you aren t getting a resize event because firefox and probably safari only support the resize event on the window object

1432317
width	height
note i use the settimeout method here because ie often lags when sorting out width and height parameters when content has changed

1432317
width	height
by using settimeout it lets ie sort things out before the height and width properties are accessed

1432320
implements	extends
i have implements a class that extends system.timers.timer object

1432328
g++	gcc
and then you can execute gcc g++ from any directory

1432334
vb.net	vb6
vb.net not vb6

1432400
subtract	add
if status can only have two values then what you need is add those two values then subtract status

1432401
opera	firefox
firefox seems to have different padding i would need to have the submit box 1px smaller in padding to fit but that would throw opera 10 off and ie7 is just way off

1432419
vim	emacs
but the emacs styles mixed tabs and spaces are not that much friendly to vim

1432422
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
due to wrapping the sqlconnection and sqlcommand around using blocks the sqldatareader gets closed after the customexecutereader is called therefore i can t read the sqlreaderresultset at the business level layer

1432462
stdout	stderr
this is a quick-and-dirty stdout and stderr replacement and also does not handle any raw_input related bugs obviously since it doesn t touch sys.stdin at all

1432474
versioning	upgrade
it was a versioning issue such that i started the project with a beta versioning of mvc and have since upgrade to mvc rc 1.0 it was not a mvc versioning issue from development machine to production server

1432559
hash	salt
hash the password use salt for added security using your favorite algorithm and store the hash and the salt

1432559
hash	salt
compare salt hash input with stored data to check a password

1432584
firefox	safari	opera	safari	opera	firefox
components developed in visual studio 2008 should work ok in ie firefox safari and opera there was a problem in vs2005

1432589
hash	salt
adding a salt accounts for additional security because the same password will not result in the same hash

1432621
portrait	landscape
if you can afford the memory overhead it may be the best thing to add a new landscape view on top of all the portrait views not discarding them as you suggest

1432621
portrait	landscape
the user then interacts with this landscape view as desired until going back to portrait

1432630
subtract	add
for each firing of the history function you will subtract the oldest value from the historyrunningtotal and add in the new history value

1432649
hash	salt
so you hash + salt the password and store that in the db for the user who want to access the service and when the user wants to authenticate you apply the same algorithm to create the hash and compare those

1432699
children	parent
this problem occurs because linq entities tend to have links between parent and children items in both directions

1432741
actionscript	haxe
unlike actionscript 3 haxe even can use alchemy opcodes .

1432755
onclick	onmousedown
the solution i want to use is forwarding onmousedown events to onclick

1432758
width	height
the standard tscrollbar class is a wincontrol itself where the scrollbar is taking the whole width and height of the control

1432836
hide	show
i m writing a simple bit of javascript to hide show items in a list depending on the checking unchecking of checkboxes

1432847
hide	show
while i ve gotten as far as to show a div layer at a particular location after clicking an image i m not sure how to hide the layer if i click on any other part of the webpage

1432867
range	median
we all love robust measures like median and interquartile range but lets face it in many fields boxplots almost never show up in published articles while means and standard errors do so all the time

1432867
ggplot2	lattice
it s simple in lattice ggplot2 etc to draw boxplots and the galleries are full of them

1432886
post	get
use the pricing post request to get the estimated pricing for the image

1432889
outline	text-indent
as a result i did the trick but i want to know how i can do it with the text-indent trick but fix the outline

1432926
wordpress	expressionengine
i ve looked at others about wordpress expressionengine etc all of them have excellent features

1432945
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome but in opera and ie i should manualy reload page to see an effect

1432946
cassini	iis
our web service is running under ultidev cassini instead of iis which runs under the system account

1433012
r5rs	r6rs
if you are using one of the standardized versions r5rs r6rs etc. you can define build-vector yourself for example like this

1433057
super	abstract
i have a super abstract class

1433057
superclass	subclassing
and this last superclass has also two subclassing andquery and orquery annotated with xmlrootnode

1433057
super	extends
i also have a propertyquery class which extends query super class

1433064
apache	nginx
in the apache or nginx conf file where passenger s settings live you set a passengerruby environment variable

1433074
many-to-many	many-to-one
if your association table stores additional information as they almost always do you should just break your many-to-many relation into two many-to-one relations

1433076
mouseevent	mouseenter
the above code compiles and run but if you move the mouse inside someuicomponent the â œdo somethingâ code will note run because actually you are not overriding the base method mouseenter mouseevent ev

1433088
sorting	filtering
so you can see that is filtering by date but the thing is when i have the same date the sorting loses the focus

1433113
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
i would suggest using a nsoperationqueue with a nsinvocationoperation

1433131
wordpress	joomla
although this is easy to do i would lose the handy ability within my content management system joomla wordpress to easily reference and link to these images

1433190
int	double
for eg double val 35 then i want int 40

1433200
bazaar	git
benchmark test 2009-08-16 git 1.6.3.3 hg 1.3.1 bazaar 1.17

1433200
bazaar	git
bazaar has improved in leaps see upcoming 2.0 and the shared repositories in bazaar is as fast as git branch

1433200
bazaar	git
the development phase and development discussion messages of both git and bazaar suggest that in the future git and bazaar will advance quicker than hg

1433205
hide	show
my page have a menu when the user click it hide div blocos and show the content using url parameter setted in menu

1433205
fadein	hide
all menu links hide and fadein the content.

1433205
hide	show
when user click on that the start content show up but it hide after .

1433205
google-chrome	firefox
only in google-chrome ...ie8 and firefox 3.5 works fine..

1433213
serializable	deserialization
the benefit being you don t have to deal with handling all the xml serializable and deserialization

1433232
opera	firefox
opera 10 for this example firefox 3 for this example and internet explorer 7 for this example all display an button differently

1433232
opera	firefox
this focus-inner property is default 0 on opera 10 something like 5px for firefox and must be 6px for internet explorer

1433251
wordpress	joomla
joomla wordpress to easily reference

1433264
ssl	https
edit https ssl tls support has been available in monotouch for a few years now

1433315
vim	emacs
even though i use emacs all day every day and love it unless you intend to spend a lot of time in the program you choose i would pick vim

1433320
vsto	add-in
on your machine when you run the add-in from visual studio it should create a registry key in hkey_current_user software microsoft vsto security inclusion someguid

1433351
width	height
that includes width and height font sizes line widths - every visible component of the control

1433387
int	double
of the files declared i as a double instead of as an int c s

1433387
int	double
a machine with 64-bit int and double you d not even get a warning

1433387
int	double
on a machine with 32-bit int and 64-bit double you d probably get a

1433387
typedef	struct
definitions enum struct or union types or typedef generally do not

1433483
hide	show
i wish it may help you im using this to hide and show some fields in a jsp you may arrange it to fit your need

1433504
versioning	upgrade
or you could specify a versioning for the file so upgrade rules will treat it like replacing a non-versioned file with a versioned one but then patches can get antsy about having the wrong versioning of this file

1433505
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you roll along the menu you will see in google-chrome safari firefox ie7 etc

1433532
min	max
for example say the scale min is 0 and the scale max is 10 000

1433545
division	modulo
the answer appears to be at prb overflow with integer division and modulo

1433545
division	modulo
modulo and the integer division

1433545
division	modulo
perform integer division and modulo

1433568
stdout	fflush
flushing stdout after the printf isn t normally needed for terminal io but can be if you re piping it to a disk typically when you re logging a crashing program it will lose the most interesting bit just before the crash if you don t fflush

1433568
fgets	getchar
because fgets reads up to and including the end of the line there are no characters left in the buffer so you only need one getchar and slightly awkward input such as 1234 space enter doesn t cause the program to terminate without pausing

1433597
rss	feed
yes i had tried to create an rss feed using the toolkit

1433602
swt	swing	awt	swing
i never liked to design windows in java awt swing swt too much work for an ugly interface

1433623
opera	firefox
now for the question is there a way to set the bloody colour in opera for this focus event which would solve that issue or to have it in firefox without having to bloat the design in every other browser or a way to make ie conform at all

1433736
getter	setter	public	protected
i would personally stop using a protected field as well - consider adding an indexer to your base class with a protected setter and a public getter

1433745
opera	safari
you can also use firebug lite wich works on ie opera and safari

1433768
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing this in firefox and google-chrome

1433808
children	parent
i know that it will be recursive delete if i will delete parent it will delete his children

1433855
128bit	64bit
for testing purposes i need to find two 64bit integer values that exactly multiply to a 128bit intermediate value with a specific bit pattern

1433880
width	height
everything has a width height set to fill_parent except for the tabwidget which has its layout_height set to wrap_content and the layout_gravity set to bottom

1433880
width	height
first thing i noticed is that webview s donâ t show anything until all the parents have width height set to fill_parent

1433889
children	parent
the problem is that when you delete a child you won t delete the link from its parent and when you delete a parent you won t delete any links from its children to any grandchildren

1433898
opera	firefox
i gave it a couple tries and found that opera and firefox both render it wrong

1433898
opera	firefox
it would render correctly in opera and firefox however now its wrong in ie7

1433909
128bit	64bit
i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem

1434047
button	marquee
the problem is that i have a marquee that slides when you click the next button

1434061
sorting	filtering
from here i have access to the all the objects from via icollectionview via sourcecollection in which i for now presume sorting and filtering is respected

1434063
sorting	filtering
i definitely support the add filtering idea as well if feasible - i find myself using excel for 50 of the work with tables lists originated from any app website due to its exceptional combination of filtering and sorting

1434100
mouse	keyboard
pair programming is about one having keyboard and mouse and the other one providing feedback

1434100
mouse	keyboard
you can switch these roles or give the keyboard to one and the mouse to the other but you will always have to work on think about the same piece of code for it to be pair programming

1434135
maven	buildr
finally buildr is an excellent way of using maven s dependency management and plugins while also supporting ad-hoc tasks

1434139
next	except
this layout is working fine except in ie6 where at certain page widths it bumps the right column to the next line

1434139
google-chrome	firefox
edit i m using a cross browser inline-block hack that works great in firefox ie s google-chrome

1434146
post	get
what s more odd is that i ve been inspecting the post data that google itself uses and attempting to replicate it exactly but i still can t get it to work

1434159
move	drag
when i drag the width slowly over time from about 800px to 1600px it randomly move the right column around

1434192
versioning	upgrade
you should know exactly what s in the database and your upgrade script should do the create or alter as appropiate based on the current versioning of your application schema versioning control and your database

1434337
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but doesn t work in google-chrome

1434377
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you go to via firefox google-chrome or safari it looks the way i wanted which content and sidebar is next to each other

1434385
mp3	wav
i ve tried saving in a variety of formats -- wav mp3 asnd etc and having no luck

1434405
128bit	64bit
and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit

1434452
folder	directory
i currently have it setup so the link hits a page inside the directory structure of the website and this page s folder is set to integrated windows authentication

1434459
pow	sqrt
if you are just comparing relative magnitudes of distances you can probably get away with using the manhattan distance which will save you two calls to pow and one to sqrt

1434462
nunit	mstest
that doesn t mean that you can t use a unit testing framework such as mstest xunit.net nunit etc. to drive your service tests

1434486
unix	bsd
and yes on unix including linux bsd and mac os x or in a unix shell on windows you can use a shebang line at the top of the file to make the file automatically run using python

1434511
pow	math.h	pow	floor	pow	ceil	floor	math.h	ceil	math.h	ceil	floor
the aforementioned ntdll.dll exports only a few of the math.h functions floor ceil log pow ...

1434513
kerberos	ntlm
you need to know that the user is who it claims it is and the only way to do that is to let ntlm kerberos authenticate the user ie

1434530
width	height
for example if you had a class rectangle it might make sense to make the constructor rectangle double width double height and make the rectangle constructor private

1434550
vbscript	jscript
as far as i understand the scripts could be ported to jscript vbscript or plain batch which shouldn t be a problem

1434567
decimal	ieee
as for decimal digits of precision ieee binary64 has 52 binary digits

1434571
jsf	seam
jsf with seam can do get fine

1434571
post	get
jsf usually uses post to get your field data to the back end

1434582
qpainter	qimage
i m trying to open a png image and write some text to it a watermark via qimage and qpainter

1434587
pull	push
so it sounds like you have an existing database schema and an existing entity model also known as a repository and you want an orm to push pull data to from your database and your application

1434604
post	get
no method in jquery but you can just use xmlhttprequest object returned from the jquery get post ajax functions

1434612
google-chrome	firefox
i found out by trying a different browser that is firefox google-chrome instead of ie

1434619
min	max
also you can control the pooling by using your connection string min max pool size etc.

1434622
postgresql	mysql
we are able to use oracle mysql postgresql hsqldb and of course other open source databases

1434662
int	boolean
i want my users to use spinedit for int checkbox for boolean etc

1434714
free	malloc
the pointer from the malloc in create_bitmap_data_provider is never free

1434720
dxcore	coderush
i recently installed coderush and have been playing with the dxcore framework

1434758
draggable	droppable
i use draggable droppable jquery feature as follows

1434824
post	get
so i am looking for some sort of reverse mechanism then get and post

1434851
post	get
perhaps the simplest way is to submit the job and get an id back via a straightforward page post

1434887
button	checkbox
i have an html form that works fine it shows a list of things with checkbox the user checks some of them and clicks the remove button which submits the form

1434887
onclick	onsubmit
as the onsubmit method in the form tag or the onclick in the submit button tag it works fine but uses the ugly browser-native confirm dialog

1434907
folder	directory
the other option you have is to create another folder beneath the original folder and then that folder will be deployed to the out directory

1434907
folder	directory
and then in the testrunconfig you still select the testfolder folder and the testdeployment folder will be deployed to the out directory

1434981
google-chrome	firefox
it looks good on firefox and google-chrome but on ie6 the width looks terrible for the home page and other pages

1435020
clang	llvm
imho real useful program slicing tool often come within static analysis tools for example codesurfer for c++ and clang of llvm

1435021
equinox	knopflerfish
what is new is that a few items have been standardised which should enable for better interoperability between different osgi engines like equinox felix and knopflerfish

1435026
width	height
you can not define the array with non-constant dimensions width height outside of the function that is - not in the stack frame because the dimensions aren t known at compile-time

1435056
width	height
you might be able to get away with just including a loading message container at the top of your page which is 100 width height and then removing the said div on load complete

1435073
hash	md5
as pseudo-random generator i used only the last of the 128 output bits of the hash function md5 choose whatever function you want instead

1435107
put	get
more important than which database you use is to get up to speed on relational database design before you start to put this together

1435173
std	ostream
is there any way to coerce the outputstream to a std ostream in the jni layer

1435268
put	get
this does the following get input and put it into a stringstream

1435333
firefox	safari
i want the solution to work in ie firefox safari etc

1435418
merb	ruby-on-rails
i would be more concerned going from merb to ruby-on-rails 3

1435433
erlang	ocaml
i think ocaml is a great way to get started in fp and erlang is not very difficult once you have the basic fp concepts down

1435516
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my subversion repository to versioning 1.6 and i m connecting to it with eclipse

1435525
pop-up	dialog
select delegating members in the pop-up and it will open a dialog in which you can select the methods you want

1435540
width	height
ideally i need a function like image crop image source int x int y int width int height which returns a new cropped image instance and does not require source cropped images to be placed to canvas

1435543
folder	directory
in my case i ve created an user in active directory by code then i create a folder for the user

1435548
post	get
the query i am using now to get my post with their categories are

1435549
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the same page works as it should in firefox google-chrome and opera

1435557
versioning	upgrade
this started happening when we upgrade to the release versioning of s#arp architecture 1.0

1435626
spaces	delimiter
you can also set a different delimiter but it uses spaces by default

1435666
width	height
width and height can vary idependently but square violates that contract

1435682
puts	gets
this form puts the name of the field inside the text box and uses a really simple script to clear the field name when the the field gets focus

1435682
firefox	safari
this has worked fine in ie6 ie7 firefox and safari but seems to have broken in ie8

1435698
hide	show
or show the first and hide the other one

1435699
google-chrome	firefox
also the prompt is showing in both internet explorer and firefox but isn t in google-chrome

1435733
post	put
i ve put out a quick cheatsheet around that framework - see the september post at my blog

1435780
mouse	keyboard
another big bonus i like about intellij compared to eclipse is that it s much less intrusive - i really hated how eclipse would manage to get popups on top of popups and mouse focus would be somewhere but keyboard focus is stuck on something underneath etc

1435788
post	get
true it s not maintained by its creator but when i get the time i m going to create a new sourceforge project for it so people have a place to post their patches

1435843
width	height
assuming the tilecontainer idea you just need to iterate over all the children and make sure they have the same height width max child height max child width and then do the layout steps mentioned above

1435848
children	parent
you can always use the delegate method in your children model to fetch the date from the parent

1435848
children	parent
finally add in a before_save callback or whichever callback is appropriate for your case in the parent model that saves the date to all of the children

1435878
spaces	delimiter
if you just want to remove consecutive spaces delimiter you might use text to columns

1435913
std	ostream
conceptually speaking the way to get foo print ... to write to an existing java outputstream instance is to write a c++ std ostream implementation that actually does a callback into java to do output

1435913
std	ostream
outputstream to a std ostream in the

1435956
cassini	iis
you should be able to debug iis just as if you are using the visual studio web server cassini

1435970
post	get
so either you have to transfer the variables using the _session array this stores a cookie on the client computer so don t sent any sensitive information through that array or you can either post or get between the scripts to send the variables

1435982
keydown	keyup
for keys that have printable character equivalents you should use the keypress event because you can retrieve character codes from the keypress event which is generally not possible for keyup and keydown events

1435983
put	get
i see that if i put a colon between the hours and minutes i get the desired output

1436069
hash	salt
so use a hash of username password and a site specific salt value should make a globally unique hash subject to the limitations of the hash algorithm itself

1436069
hash	salt
i ve made the assumption that hash should be sufficiently unique that i m not ever likely to end up with duplicate hash and therefore duplicate keys please correct me if i m wrong in that assumption. authentication is done by recreating the hash from the user name and password supplied by the user plus the secret salt and checking if that hash exists in the db

hash	salt
it should be safe to store the hash password with the user you can also have random salt for each user too so the same salt isn t used for each password

1436123
hash	salt
if you orphan a password hash and if your salt never changes then you have to prohibit any future use of once-active usernames to prevent former users from getting into their namesakes accounts

1436123
hash	salt
someone would have to figure out both your scheme for hashing passwords and the scheme for hashing timestamps and the scheme for generating timestamp-hashing salt before the association of a user name to a password hash would be likely to compromise anything

1436159
children	parent
the best thing i can suggest is a query for the parent records followed by a query for the children using an in parent id list query

1436159
children	parent
one for the parent and one for the children

1436159
children	parent
on the client side you can then take a parent id and get a set of children records

1436197
udp	mtu
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented

mason you can use iswow64process wow64 is the x86 emulator that allows 32-bit windows-based applications to run seamlessly on 64bit windows

1436295
comparator	comparable
you can rely on the natural ordering of the key as in its comparable interface or you can do custom ordering by passing a comparator

1436301
yacc	bison
i would keep the lexer flex lex as dumb as possible it should just provide a stream of basic tokens identifiers keywords etc... and have the parser yacc bison do the error detection

1436315
int	boolean
however you don t necessarily want everything to be ref-counted every little int every string every boolean every element in an array .

folder	directory
all these files folder were maintained under a single project working copy in tortoisesvn under a single directory

if this is so consider using regex.replace inputfromtxtfile s as this will replace all forms of white spaces including spaces tab linefeed and newline

1436377
activemq	rabbitmq
i have looked at rabbitmq activemq openamq tibco rendezvous and websphere mq

1436402
ssl	https
the simplest solution by far is to just use a ssl socket instead of a normal one a la https ftps style

1436402
ssl	https
there is no difference at all in the protocol between http and https the only difference is that they operate on different ports 80 vs 443 normally and one uses a normal socket and the other uses a ssl encrypted socket

1436408
disk	ram
if you exceed physical ram for your working set you ll be paginating and swapping in and out to disk and your performance can rapidly degrade up to a state known as thrashing were basically all available cycles are going to the tasks of getting pages in and out and negligible amounts of actual work can actually get done

1436411
int	boolean
i m attempting to shorten the memory footprint of 10b sequential int by referencing them as indexes in a boolean array

1436419
cpu	hyperthreading
at one extreme where the processing time dominates the i o time the benefit that threading gives you is just the ability to take advantage of multiple cores and possibly hyperthreading to make use of the maximum available processing power of your cpu

1436434
powerpc	i386
you can build 64-bit python or- gasp - a 4-way i386 x86_64 powerpc ppc64 universal binary from source but unless you really need to work with absolutely huge disk files amounts of memory i m talking multi-gigabyte memory maps for example chances are you do not need 64-bit anything right now

1436480
children	parent
i have updated the setvaluefor method to iterate over a node s children and set the checkboxes as selected or deselected when a parent has been modified

1436483
put	get
from my understanding each of these methods get and put are atomic

1436531
g++	gcc
i will speculate that there is no math.h header in usr include - because if there was gcc g++ would normally pick up from the same place as

1436571
superclass	subclassing
a different subclassing for each implementation with shared functionality either in a common superclass or using the template method pattern

1436593
int	boolean
only use null true for non-string fields such as int boolean and dates.

1436656
hash	salt
use the salt hash of the password given by the primary user as one secret

1436656
hash	salt
use the salt hash of the password given by the first secondary user as another secret and so on for each additional secondary user

1436656
hash	salt
don t store the salt hash

1436656
hash	salt
when a user enters their password you retrieve the protected shared secret use the salt and hash of their password to produce the salt hash decrypt the protected shared secret and now you ve got the original primary user password

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is not how the select dom element behaves under firefox 3.5 google-chrome 1.0 or safari 3.1 where the options property is exposed as a javascript array.

1436705

x86	64bit
to check if it s a 64bit issue you can build the test project as x86 and run the tests with td.net

1437092
children	parent
when that parent qobject is destructed its children will be destroyed as well

1437092
qobject	qwidget
qt provides no additional guarantees beyond standard c++ if you re not using qobject or a subclass of qobject such as qwidget

1437099
width	height
from what i can tell size i did not specify the sizetocontent attribute the default is manual so it will use size of a window is determined by other properties including width height maxwidth maxheight minwidth and minheight

1437111
uiview	subviews
if you add a uitextfield as a subviews of a uiimageview it s important to set the userinteractionenabled to yes since it defaults to no for that superview it s usually yes by default in most uiview s

1437116
wav	speex
if you need speex and you have a wav file then consider sending it to a server for compression

1437133

1437171
post	get
create a web service which can take parameters through get or post and output the data in json or xml

1437171
post	get
here its passing the parameter through get but you can also use http post to post the data to the web service url

1437186
post	get
edit to get an idea of how a hook procedure looks like i post a fragment from my personal utility

1437249
int	chars
you should use int and not chars

1437279
int	chars
the documentation for getchar is that it returns the next chars available cast to an unsigned chars and then returned in an int return value

1437279
int	chars
the reason for this is to make sure that all valid chars are returned as positive values and won t ever compare as equal to eof a macro which evaluates to a negative int value

1437279
put	get
if you put the return value of getchar into a char then depending on whether your implementation s char is signed or unsigned you may get spurious detection of eof or you may never detect eof even when you should

1437288
int	chars
if the int value returned by getchar is stored into a variable of type chars and then compared against the int constant eof the comparison may never succeed because sign-extension of a variable of type chars on widening to int is implementation-defined

1437293
width	height
given the height and width properties you should be able to work out the halfway position remembering that y is positive downwards

1437303
put	get
put also the type of the get request as xml

1437308
int	chars
i agree with all other people in this thread by saying use int c not chars

1437314
mousedown	mouseenter
just add any extra events you require such as keypress mouseenter mousedown etc in a similar manner

1437319
nant	cruisecontrol
this error only happens for one application and only in cruisecontrol with nant but not when runing the test with nunitgui.

1437358
int	chars
if which is pretty much always true then the promotion of the chars to an int will never result in a negative value and eof must be a negative value

1437358
int	chars
that s one reason why all or at least many if not all the functions in the c standard that deal with or return chars specify int as the parameter or return type

1437412
mouse	keyboard
i can set breakpoints etc. but i don t want to debug using a mouse but using keyboard

1437424
kerberos	ntlm
by default sites consider to local intranet will be sent the current logged on users credentials when challanged with ntlm kerberos

1437429
qthread	qobject
qthread itself is derived from qobject

1437429
qthread	qobject
you need to override its run method to use it therefore you have to inherit from qobject in order to use qthread

1437450
versioning	upgrade
this would mean that my customers could upgrade to the latest and greatest versioning without the hassle of using an administrator account

there is a good discussion of wm_devicechange on this forum relating to its usage with hid devices mouse keyboard etc.

1437731
width	height
instead how to get the bounds width and height at form-load

1437749
munin	cacti
tools like ab are commonly used towards testing how much load you can take from a battering of requests at once alongside cacti munin your system monitoring tool or choice you can generate data on system load requests sec

1437749
profiling	benchmarking
profiling and benchmarking code and not requests is also important to which plenty of folk have already done so for django benchrun is also not a bad tool either

1437749
apache	nginx
as for apache vs nginx in regards to your django app it seems that mod_python is indeed faster than nginx lighty + fastcgi but that s no surprise because cgi regardless of any speed ups is still slow

1437758
gridview	sqldatasource
i have an sqldatasource and a gridview and neither can be cast into a dataset or datatable

1437797
put	get
you should now be able to use the zf command line tool anywhere you need it by typing zf to get the help info and to ensure you put the paths in properly

getter	setter
you are referencing the property itself inside your getter and setter that causes infinite recursion stack overflow

1437985
debian	linux
as of wich unix to choose i ll go for linux in particular debian or fedora

1437987
vim	emacs
ide my favorite choice would be eclipse which has a c++ plugin and many more interesting plugins but i would also advice you to learn to use at least one among the sacred monsters vi vim and emacs

1437987
ubuntu	linux
os i would go for a dual boot system with some linux distro maybe ubuntu

1438013
getter	setter
put a breakpoint inside the setter getter and debug making sure that you use step into f11 not step over - this should help explain whats going on

1438053
multiplying	add
now one way to do this would be to make one global board and 32 sub-boards with a different name like sub_board 32 and then write a new bunch of board manipulation functions that work on the new 2 dimensional sub_board but this would ruin my optimization because there would need to be an additional multiplying and add for every access to the game board

1438084

in your case i think you are trying to achieve a spacer with height 356px and width 5px

1438176
udp	tcp
tcpview is a windows program that will show you detailed listings of all tcp and udp endpoints on your system including the local and remote addresses and state of tcp connections

1438233
int	boolean
there s quite a few little bits of java which come from it being a better c++ - in c or c++ there s an automatic conversion between boolean values and int so in c++

1438233
int	boolean
java concentrates on fixing this ambiguity with parsing two binary operators by making boolean and int types non-convertible so you have to join them with another operator

1438234
google-chrome	firefox
it all works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie gives priority to the the text in the table rather than the a tag so you get a text selector cursor and can t click the link when you hover over the text

1438322
post	get
test for post get parameters

1438387
set	bag
to prevent this problem you must use a bidirectional association with the many valued end the set or bag marked as inverse true

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
in all the other browsers ie8 firefox google-chrome safari opera it animates in a motion which seems like the computer is hanging

1438418
padding	overlapping
my thinking is that maybe ie sees overlapping elements as in positioned on top of one another as a possible conflict and thus makes a decision to try to accommodate both well the link is yay big but the text outside of it really isn t a link so let s treat it like normal text etc but that elements that overlap purely for style which i think padding is considered would not raise any alarms because hey it s just a visual thing

1438617
udp	tcp
i have an abstract class with multiple functions implemented using various protocols by the inheriting classes and simple tcp and udp posix sockets work fine

the product does not have a graphical user environment in the classical gnome kde fashion

1438958
post	get
get after post redirecting after form submits did not work at all neither sending utf-8 urls nor escaped utf-8 urls

1438958
firefox	safari
now if you start the app and enter something like localhost 8080 springmvctest a.abc you should be redirected to the russian wikipedia site and the browser ie and firefox safari or else possibly not should show a nice utf-8 encoded native russion url

children	parent
children always have a relationship with their parent

here are the steps that i took to successfully install pil on mac os x 10.6 without using macports or fink

1439865
fink	macports
your best solution that doesn t involve macports or fink would probably be to compile and install python from the 2.6 release branch from either the mercurial python repository or the subversion python repository

1439870
put	get
put a linkbutton inside the updatepanel and get rid of the link you currently have

1439870

mouse	keyboard
as it can be slightly annoying to have the mouse jump 1px diagonally every second i intend to use autohotkey to write a script that does basically the same thing but only after a configured keyboard mouse idle timeout and maybe use the shift key or scroll lock instead of a mouse move
