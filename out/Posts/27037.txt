safariwatir	firewatir
my understanding is that this is due tp watir-classic previously supporting multiple browsers - ie firewatir and safariwatir

why are you storing an int into a chars array

19681382
int	chars
because i don t see any reason for you to store an int into a chars array

19681419
int	chars
second this is casting an int which is most likely 32-bits to a chars most likely 8-bits

19681491
junit	mockito
i ve recently published a lightweight framework called testfun-jee for testing ejb+jpa++ code using junit - the framework takes care for injecting ejbs and mockito mocks into your test code without using a container maybe i should say the framework is mocking a container

19681493
put	get
the question is what i supposed to put as a param to get in body simply

19681498
int	boolean
nsnumber literals yes boolean 1.2 floating point 123 int

19681529

stdout	stderr
while this doesn t help your garbleness it took me a long time to find a way to launch a child-process that can be written to by the parent process and have the stderr and stdout of the child process sent directly to the screen this solves nasty blocking issues you may have when trying to read from two different fd s without using something fancy like select

19681646
stdout	stderr
everything from some child program will be emitted to stdout stderr and you can simply pump data by writing to chld_in and trust that it ll block if the child s buffer fills

19681646
stdout	stderr
to callers of the parent program it all just looks like stderr stdout

19681697
rdf	owl
now in owl every class is a subclass owl thing but that doesn t hold for rdf in general and you probably won t even get that result from dbpedia because there s no owl reasoner attached

19681697
superclass	subclassing
this does presume that there is a unique path from the subclassing to the superclass

19681697
superclass	subclassing
now the trick is to use this approach for both the subclassing and then join the results based on the superclass that they have in common using a query like this

19681698
svg	vml
i found in ie8 there is no support for svg or canvas element so the javascript charting libraries like google charts d3 and jqplot convert the charts to vml format so we cant to get the byte code as like above code

19681706
stdout	stderr	execvp	fork
i create this process with the usual fork execvp and for each stdin stdout and stderr a pipe dup2

i was wondering if it is possible to deactivate ssl verification in google-chrome or firefox so that i can use wireshark to trace the communication between a server with self-signed certificate and a web app

19681787
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that accepting the certificate in firefox or google-chrome results in a different ssl handshake

19681812
width	height
so basically i create a rectangle with the height of 96 and width of 48 to make jim a little bigger i then go through the process of creating my sprites and then adding them to the array i know texture regions with a split method would be better but it was causing problems and annoying me

19681812
width	height
i even added a super fancy console print so i could tell the loop was even initiating that the array was being iterating through properly and that the width height of my rectangle was what i put it as

19681816
hash	salt
you won t have to worry about the salt anymore no additional database field is necessary just store the hash and you are fine

19681955

textview	imageview
a mainactivity have 5 tabs imageview + textview main part is a framelayout that switch 5 fragment s

19681998
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
your own scheme is very weak first you are using md5 which is ways too fast for generating password hash then you use a static salt which defeats the purpose of a salt

19682010
width	height
you could use a 3d array array width height 2 or you can use a 2d array and store point objects in it

19682011
jar	war
what i see from log file is elements are added to jar effectively this creates a new jar the dir is deleted and the war is unwar ed so i end up with the original war file contents

in openerp version 7 i need to show or hide a field in the form view of the add object based on the values from the parent object

19682093
verilog	vhdl
this will generate vhdl or verilog

19682093
altera	xilinx
to flash into the fpga you need either xilinx or altera tool chains to generate the bitstreams and flash them

19682109
pem	pkcs#12
this includes the pem pkcs#12 ssl and s mime libraries

19682115

webclient	httpwebrequest
it s possible by using webclient or httpwebrequest

19682190
webclient	httpwebrequest
as far as i understood webclient inherits httpwebrequest providing more simply way to code

i have a relatively large mysql database over 300 tables which i desperately need to convert to postgresql and synchronise data between the two databases if not real time then something close to it

19682205
postgresql	mysql
ideally i need a bi-directional data sync or at least one directional - mysql to postgresql sync

19682205
postgresql	mysql
they don t even have a linux client which is strange considering that absolute majority of mysql and postgresql database would run on linux servers

19682245
for-loop	loops
i altered your for-loop and added an extra while loops to get it working

19682267
postgresql	mysql

i want this span black border adapts to the div width and height

19682633
google-chrome	firefox
the above works fine in google-chrome v30 and ie10 but not in firefox v24

19682633
google-chrome	firefox
i believe the problem has something to do with the fact that the click event is triggered in firefox when using keydown despite using e.preventdefault which prevents the click event from triggering in both google-chrome and ie

19682655
post	get
so get this value add a regular expression extractor post processor as a child of os process sampler with following details

19682710
mouseleave	mouseenter
there is no event called hover the .hover function is a shortcut to register mouseenter and mouseleave event handlers so you need to use it

19682739

19682768
mouseleave	mouseenter
shorthand for the string mouseenter mouseleave

19682768

so you need to replace with mouseenter and mouseleave events

19682793
apache	nginx
for the purpose of my experiment i wanted nginx to display any and all existing non-php files and to proxy the php files and the dynamic url s to apache for wordpress to do its thing

the result is that when you go to domain.com nginx sends that to apache looking exactly like domain.com index.php

19682815
width	height
im trying to create an array for each point origin x and y + width and height

19682846
hide	show
not that i see the point of this too much simply put the statement as the very first part of your code that way it just hide it regardless and show the proper one with the change logic

19682896
mouseleave	mouseenter
try with mouseenter and mouseleave events

19682918
width	height
the difference in proportion of height to width between the two devices is the issue you are having not an occurrence of non-standard dp

19682933
for-loop	loops
have a for-loop that loops through the string inputted by the user and then for every letter or number convert it into its ascii value using the ord function

19682934
bower	npm
you ll need git npm grunt bower

19682934

it works fine for me using firefox 25.0 28.0a1 + firebug 1.12.4 + firepath 0.9.7 on win7

19683834
firepath	firebug
you should create a new firefox profile just install firebug and firepath there and see if it s then working

19683834
firepath	firebug
also if you see any errors related to firebug you should post them to the firebug discussion group or if there are some related to firepath you should create a new issue in their issue tracker

19684041
accessor	properties
by the way i don t know the specifics of asp.net but your id properties looks like it s not supposed to change over the lifetime of the project so it would probably be wise to make this properties read-only without an accessor so it would only be set in constructor

19684051
width	height
i m needing to create a calculator that will adjust the size of a stage for draggable objects based on a width and height field in feet

19684051

this max width and height would be set in pixels

19684151

as you don t have a password column in your table but still need to receive the password attribute so you can process it with a salt and then turn it into a hash you need to have this accessor

19684163

which creates a specific overload for the int case to match what modern compilers should be be doing which is cast int arguments to double although this version does not cover all the cases

19684955
int	double
since around 2005 the draft standard required int argument to be cast to double this is covered in the draft c++ standard

19684955
int	double
which would be ambiguous for the int case but the standard requires that sufficient overload are provided so that int arguments are cast to double

19684955
int	double
otherwise if any arithmetic argument corresponding to a double parameter has type double or an int type then all arithmetic arguments corresponding to double parameters are effectively cast to double

19684955
int	double	math.h	sqrt
as nos points out it is possible that the version of sqrt being called is from math.h header as opposed to the overloads from cmath if that is the case and there is likely a implementation defined caveat here then we may be reverting to old c style behavior if the only version available is sqrt double which would mean that int would be converted to double implicitly

19684963

float can represent any int value that has 24 significant bits precisely double has 53 bits of relevant precision its determined by the number of mantissa bits in the type see ieee754 for dirty details

19689402
int	double
so basically float int n is only precise when approx. abs n 1 23 and double long n when abs n 1 52

19689402
int	double
since double has more mantissa bits than int can have significant bits comparisions between double and int are precise in that regard

19689493

because the eclipse toolkit needs to deploy the compiled artifacts to amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk it manages a separate locate git repo just for those compiled artifacts

19690934
getter	setter
e.g we have something like getter setter omitted for clarity

19690934
getter	setter
in this case it also seems pointless that jsf calls my setter to set the thing i just gave it in the getter for the bound property

19690944
put	get
we use arraylist when we are developing some application and we are not concerned about such minor performance issues and we do trade off because we get already written api to put get resize etc

rational-numbers	base
this is due to the fact that the internal representation of a rational-numbers might use a different base from that in the source code

19690972
public	protected
it will work without explicit initialization but you should define for better reading all your object fields as public or private protected and write getter methods

the basic idea is to have lens entity value lenses but although there is action to create getter s with side effects there is no setter or a combined lensm -thing

so my method will get storagefile height width and it will return me or resized image

19691372
min	max
there are several ways you could do this but one is to initialize two variables say min and max and assign initialize them with the first value entered

19691372
min	max
each value entered after would then get checked to see if higher than max or lower than min

19691372
min	max
you could also out all answers into a treeset which will naturally order all elements and take the first and the last elements as the min and max respectively

19691413
int	double
not sure about using int or double thought

19691439

19691805
children	parent
parent elements will collapse if their floated children are not cleared causing a lot of unexpected layout issues

19691825
children	parent
its a bit hard without your specific example but the best way is to select all children of the parent of the node of interest i assume you mean element nodes in this case

19691848
min	max
in fact this can lead to pathological cases if you have an array with no duplicates and your implementation of picking the mode always chooses the min or max value

19691855

in jquery you can use .width and height methods as they returns computed width in pixels not in percentage + you will need to listen window resize event

19691882

i understand that using something like will read an int input but leave the following newline chars in the input buffer which is why one must clear the input buffer by looking for before using getchar after a scanf call

19691885
int	chars
here is my simple incorrect program that reads an int and then a chars input and prints them back to the user

19691885
int	chars
if i leave the newline chars off in my scanf format string so just have d it makes sense that as soon as the user types in an int and hits enter that int will be read and stored in i and the program will continue to execute enter a chars immediately printed and ch storing the newline chars

19691885
int	chars
when a user enters an int and hits enter i expected enter a chars to be printed

19691885
printf	getchar
it seems odd that my second printf function is called seemingly after the call to getchar since the character read is entered before enter a char gets printed

19691904

i want to show min or max limit parameter

19692182
sorting	grouping
if we wanted to improve the performance yet again depending on how large the size of our database is we may even further consider sorting into four grouping instead of two grouping clubs diamonds hearts and spades

sorting	grouping
whether or not we want to perform this further step depends on whether or not the overhead of sorting the cards into the additional grouping is justified by the performance gain

19692183

i am working with paradox table using bde engine

19692918
width	height
if you really want to preserve the fixed width and height of the button and the font size of the text then you could do something like below

19692923
width	height
the outer container must have a width and height of 0 otherwise the cell content will get pushed around

19692970
width	text-align
doing a text-align on the input itself will simply align the text inside the button which you can see if you add width 100px to the button css

19692998

then you can have vector int vector double even and since it s now a functor and an applicative you can do a lot more with it as this example suggests

19693046
implements	extends
tried using a thread implements runnable instead of extends asynctask

19693058

the problem i m encountering is when i test passing a hardcoded salt value 0x0e5ecc235ff6bd7337ffdde5799d4eea along with the plaintext abcdefghij to simulate retrieving the hash value for comparing hash passwords for example

19693615

19707460
uilabel	uibutton

i have a report in access with 3 fields on it width height and area

19710398
width	height
width and height are pulled from the table the report is bound to whilst area should be calculated height width

19710398
width	height
in the bound table height and width are integers and are both populated in the record being viewed so it s not a null problem

19710415
hide	show
ok so i am trying to write a script that will show and hide items based on a users selection

19710451

maven	pom.xml
i ve read that to setup a selenium webdriver project i could do that by creating a maven project in netbeans and configure the pom.xml file to download the dependencies

19710482
hide	show
you cant hide and show table row s you d have to convert it into either lists or div s

19710483
width	height
and then compute the world width and height that fits the map s width and height

19710525
put	get
how do i get it to recognize the put

19710544

once these two jars were added to the pom.xml i was unable to build as maven says that it cannot transfer the dependencies to my local repository from maven s central repository due to being unauthorized

19710601
int	chars
the one explanation i could get was if an int type pointer was pointing to a chars array then when the pointer is incremented the pointer will jump from 0 position to the 2 position skipping 1 position in between because int size 2

19710601
int	double
and maybe because a pointer just holds the address of a value not the value itself the int or double

19710615
hide	show
instead use for the related span to hide show

19710719
width	height
you probably have a name clash access is picking up the width and height members of the report object rather than the fields called width and height

19710719
width	height
add the primary key and any other non-problematic field then widthvalue width and heightvalue height as additional columns

19710734
int	chars
so while a chars may be anywhere in memory an int may need to be on a 4-byte boundary

19710815
post	get
when i started learning php i thought there are two ways called get which encrypts data in the url and post which sends data in another way to the server

19710815

you can mess with the white and alpha values to get exactly what you want but that should put a gray tint over everything in your view controller s view

19710945
post	get
so i had tested this with the get actually doing post work any user inputed data and information from ma java fx app and it went direct to webservice s database

19711069

19711377
asterisk	ivr
i am working on an asterisk ivr for conducting intra-organization surveys our employees call in and answer a few questions by pressing keys

19711398
width	height
in addition you ve presumably changed both the width height and the viewbox size when you should have only changed the width height if you revert the viewbox to viewbox 0 0 32 32 then it should display larger

19711398
width	height
the width height controls how big the drawing is the viewbox controls how much area the contents covers it scales the contents so if you change both you end up with a bigger drawing scaled down no change

19711409
getter	setter
you can either check this on the game tick or you can build it in a event dispatch fashion using getter and setter for the health property

19711412

likewise sethealth has two versions so the compiler cannot figure out whether it should cast gethealth + health to int and use sethealth int or whether it should cast gethealth + health to double and use sethealth double because gethealth is ambigious

19711830
config	ini
i also understand from previous posts that there are parameters in the mysql config that can be tuned in mysql ini files but this is not something i can do as the sql server is hosted by my provider

19711904
width	height
i m creating an epub and i d like the images to span the full width of the page but to never be taller than 100 of the height of the page

19711904

ideally if the image was taller than the page and therefore clipped then it would instead be scaled to 100 height of the page the width scaling accordingly

19711909
addclass	removeclass
whenever i see addclass and removeclass i think why not just use toggleclass

19711918
avassetwriter	avassetreader
if you give a samplebuffer to the avassetwriter then destroy the associated avassetreader future avassetreaders may try to reuse the samplebuffer before avassetwriter is finished with it

19711936
children	parent
i only know that every parent have only children with the attribut

19711950
actualheight	actualwidth
i ve just come across this problem myself and i ve found a suitable solution in wrapping the scrollviewer in a canvas so that it doesn t take part in the measuring pass and telling the scrollviewer to use the actualheight and actualwidth of the canvas so that it takes up all the space the canvas has been given

19711973
fgets	fread
fread requires 4 arguments and you just need fgets

19712392
cstring	bstr
std string or if you use unicode which you should std wstring is the most common implementation being cross-platform and basically part of the language at this point but if you use microsoft code you ll also see apis that call for strings of type bstr _bstr_t ccombstr and cstring - all of these are also string types

width	height
for each wrapper i need to have a custom width height in my script with else if conditions depending on the wrapper showing up

19712456
sorting	grouping
the same proof can be extended to sorting on more than two keys by observing that adding more sorting steps keeps the results of the prior steps in the original order which is precisely the order that we want to have within the equality grouping of the keys with higher sorting priority

19712479
textview	imageview
with a textview and imageview

19712829
children	parent
a parent view may call measure more than once on its children

19712829
children	parent
for example the parent may measure each child once with unspecified dimensions to find out how big they want to be then call measure on them again with actual numbers if the sum of all the children s unconstrained sizes is too big or too small that is if the children don t agree among themselves as to how much space they each get the parent will intervene and set the rules on the second pass

19712829
children	parent
it seems they view the measurement pass as a dialog between parent and children

i ve gone from using an auto-incremented primary to using an md5 hash most of the time

19714675

unfortunately scikit-learn does not have an lda implementation but gensim does

19714760
hash	salt
with the salt and a pepper the login id is bcrypt hash

19714760
hash	salt
low entropy relying only on the login id s inherent entropy and an algorithmic process to create the salt severely limits the strength of this crypto process with knowledge of the process to create the salt and the value of the pepper it would be possible to create a rainbow table for these hash

19714760
hash	salt
still any standard pre-genned rainbow table would not work it would have to be custom done for this set of hash and would require enough programming knowledge a flexible enough generator to duplicate the salt creation process

19714760
ssl	https
this would eliminate the chance of an intercept of a hashed login id in transmittal relatively low to begin with as every step of this is ssl encoded via https and the hashed login id is folded into an sso payload encrypted via rijndael and a psk before being sent

next copy everything inside of the wp-content directory from your backup into the wp-content inside the newly created folder

19714974
folder	directory
then copy the wp-config.php from the directory of your backup into the directory of the new folder overwriting the file in the new folder

19714985
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing is mutable so although the copy still is immutable the original now is mutable but the subclassing copywithzone thanks to the superclass implementation operates on a retained instance of itself self and mycopy both point the the same instance so if i later change the value of mutableoriginal.mymember then that will also change immutablecopy.mymember which is just plain wrong

19715176
width	height
when we need to set the width and height of the canvas to the size of the window in physical pixels

19715176

the critical trick is that internally the canvas will render to a surface that is width by height pixels in size

19715199
for-loop	arrays
your ending clause for your for-loop wanted to go from 0 - length which would be wrong as you will go over the arrays index

width	height
of course if the width height ratio of the dialog is different from the one of the image i will get a grey area

one more question first i thought the drawtobitmap method will create a bmp image but when i open the saved image with a picture editor it says it is a png file

19715472

19715760
maven	pom.xml
i am new to maven so forgive my not using right terms but when i run the pom.xml file with the goal of test it simply ignores my test.xml file and runs anything with the word test in it i verified this by changing names etc.

19715779
min	max
make a second table with min max avg per day and symbolid

19715780
width	height
the preload div has no height width since the images are set to background so it doesn t show on the page and the images are ready when you want to swap them on hover

19715780
width	height
you will obviously have to set height width on the anchors

19715811

a naive solution would be to see if both the height and width of one shape are less than or equal to the height and width of the shape you re trying to put the first shape into

19715860
width	height
for the circle the width and height would both be the diameter of the circle

19715874
multiplying	multiplication
in a multiplication the base case is likely to return 1 because multiplying by 1 is neutral it doesn t affect the previous calculations

19715895
hash	salt
store the hash or salt hash of the password and compare your hash

19715905
integer	unsigned
so your integer literal is just too large for unsigned long long type

19715910
folder	directory
addin files release changes the dll location from project directory to msenvshared admin folder

19715952
pdfbox	itext
i noticed that there is a scarcity of tutorials for both pdfbox and itext

19715968
width	height
this will assign the width and the height to w and h inside the case expression

19715976
firefox	safari
lets say i have 2 servers one for safari and one for firefox

19715976
firefox	safari
i will add the first tag when starting the safari server and the second for firefox server

19715992
width	height
i have an div element width 100px and height 100px

19715992

and inside of it i have another element width 100px and height 80px with border which i make disappear on hover but i need it to disappear on hover at the parent element so also on the 20px below

19716011
g++	gcc
so far i installed gcc g++ 4.8.1 gnu make 3.82.90

19716020
mouseover	mouseenter
i don t have an answer for why but mouseenter instead of mouseover seems to work

19716028
dlsym	dlopen
read carefully dlopen 3 always check the success of the dlopen dlsym functions there and use dlerror on failure

19716029
versioning	upgrade
for no downtime upgrade you can use database mirorring to new server and fail over to new versioning

19716029
versioning	upgrade
one important task that improves performance is refreshing all statistics when you upgrade to a new versioning

19716037
typedef	struct
in c as opposed to c++ you still need to use the struct keyword everywhere or use a typedef

19716037
typedef	struct
as mentioned in a comment the node references from inside the struct still need the struct keyword since the typedef does not yet exist

19716051
portrait	landscape
if so in many cases the judicious use of constraints can keep that subview in the right place and right size even as you go from landscape to portrait

19716051
portrait	landscape
and c what other content you have in your view and whether the change from portrait to landscape and back results in any change in the vertical height of the scroll view

19716069
pull	push
using bootstrap 3 i have some questions about push pull with column ordering

19716069
pull	push
if i add the pull modifier class to the purple box for sm xs and push to the three columns it produces strange results

19716116

19716131
capistrano	bundler
i m using capistrano capistrano rbenv capistrano bundler and capistrano rails

19716141
pop-up	dialog
i also tried intent.category_launcher but it pop-up a dialog for selecting an app to finish the action

19716151
int	chars
result is an int yet all your if statments check if it equals a chars

19716188
int	chars
thus using chars instead of int will cause truncation int -1 0xffffffff becomes chars -1 0xff and may cause errors

19716228
typedef	struct
still if you are really really lazy the typedef has to be done before the struct declaration as in the example below

19716246
typedef	struct
if you do not want to refer to it as struct node as the type you can use a typedef

19716246
typedef	struct
though you still need to refer the pointers inside the record as struct node since it is declared within the typedef

19716261
width	height
i have set width and height to 100 and still does this

19716319
ostream	getline
use the result of the call to getline which is the ostream object itself after the read attempt

19716323
folder	directory
your images should be in the images folder in the assets directory

19716334
google-chrome	firefox
try editing the height via inspect element in google-chrome or firebug in firefox and see how it fixes your issue

19716362

19716378
put	get
and if i put item 222 inside oncreate i get 111null333 when toast display

19716391
google-chrome	safari
the problem is safari downloads from server when it should retrieve from cache whereas google-chrome correctly retrieves from cache

19716409
scatter	graphing
i have a google scatter graphing like this

19716429
hide	show
i would personally have the loop printed and then just hide show depending on what is checked like this

19716493
int	double
as a final comment just double check that radio buttons wonâ t be a fit for your requirements as you could easily have multiple radio buttons for the same field with different int values

19716523
hide	show
i have one form1 in windows forms and want to show and hide different sets of controls depending on which button the user clicks

19716544
children	parent
i need to get this table data into an array in the format where all parent become a potential heading with their children underneath

19716575
versioning	upgrade
today i upgrade one of them to versioning 2.4.2 and noticed to took a full 3 minutes to load the home page

19716619

i have a maven pom.xml file and when i provide parallel execution options i dont see any signs of parallel execution in the logs

19716627
google-chrome	safari
mobile browser both safari google-chrome on ios 7.0.3

19716634
fflush	gets
my question is if there s a way to fflush the queued up pinch events so whenever i get a uigesturerecognizerstatechanged event i can do my slow drawing operation then fflush all other pinch events so only the most recent one gets processed

19716640
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
first option would be to put the part of the script that needs to be run as root in a script file .sh or something and then make it setuid as root chmod go-w +sx scriptfile sudo chown root scriptfile

19716640
sudo	passwd	pop-up	dialog
applescript allows you to do shell script sudo command goes here with administrator privileges which will pop-up a graphical dialog asking for a passwd

19716679
google-chrome	firefox
i have read articles and posts that state that document.all does not work in firefox google-chrome use document.getelementbyid instead as this is the standard across all browsers

19716751
switching	screens
e.g. switching between scanner input and showing virtual on screens keyboard

19716769

i want to use a function to hide a list of elements and then show the element that i want visible by inputting the element s id as the function s parameter

19716779
whenever	capistrano
whenever i deploy using a pretty vanilla capistrano deploy script some assets are not loading - cloudfront is caching the nginx 404 page

19716785
post	get
so my question is how to write http protocol client with only get and post methods in c or c++

19716786
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
google-chrome firefox safari can do so easily without any prompt

19716832
children	parent
first of all i will suggest you to read this it s very useful for hierarchical structured data and there are available queries which will help you to get parent children etc .

19716847
int	double
since i was using decimals int didn t work so i changed to double instead and everything worked

19716855
getter	setter
what you do is you use abstractmethod to decorate the piece of the property getter or setter that you want to be abstract and use partialap as a second decorator

19716855
getter	setter
partialap defines getter setter functions that replace the property with a normal one only if both getter and setter are non-abstract

19716855
getter	setter
what you have to do is create two methods an abstract one for the getter and a regular one for the setter then create a regular property that combines them

19716855
getter	setter
the reason you can t use _mystring.str.getter is that the decorator forces both the getter and the setter to have the same name as the property itself

19716855
abc	subclassing
note that this solution requires subclassing to give their getters the right name _strget in this case in order to satisfy the abc that they have overriden the abstract method

19716881
min	max
partial answer with base plotting function and not including the min max or mean. i suspect you will need to construct a dataset before passing to ggplot since that is typical for that function

19716898
inherited	subclassing	nsmanagedobject	mogenerator
you haven t given a reason for not passing the nsmanagedobject subclassing around your app but you might want to consider using mogenerator and cutting out your middle objects and using multiple classes in your object inherited to separate out the core data parts from your custom modifications

19716899
next	except
each number has 4 spaces by which it is separated from the next except the first number in each column which has 2 spaces.

19716933
stdout	stderr
refer to an interactive device. the requirement also holds for stdin and stdout while stderr is not buffered even if one could detect that it is directed to a non interactive device

19716953
children	parent
i basically want to use the navigationmenuid and parentnavigationmenuid properties and build a json object that has the correct children nested under the correct parent

19716959
mouse	keyboard
it seems that if java is invoked without the headless option it can get stuck waiting on keyboard mouse input so i wondered if something similar could be happening here

19716971
hide	show
this program should show an image and as soon as you click on it it should hide that image and show the other and so on

19717000
comparator	comparable
but for the case where just pass your custom comparator you don t need to make stock to be a comparable

19717000
comparator	comparable
set your comparator to sorted collection like treeset and then add the stock object into sorted collection it should work without implemting comparable interface

19717026
for-loop	loops
you are not declaring x before calling it in your for-loop if you declare it within your for-loop it will reinitiate with the initial value each loops passing

19717050
ubuntu	debian
if you have etc php5 fpm php.ini used in debian ubuntu style config then changes to this file should take effect and that configuration may be further overridden per pool by making changes to specific files

19717051
mouseup	mousedown
object mousedown array 1 mouseup array 1

19717080
hide	show
it has an interceptor that displays the bar when an xhr is triggered you could change it so that it show the bar on routechangestart and hide it on routechangesuccess

19717106
macports	homebrew
i was also using macports which was as the homebrew website seems to be cognizant driving me to become a raging alcoholic

19717106
g++	gcc
eventually gcc and g++ stopped working and a lot of other things were breaking

19717118
jmeter	blazemeter
then i tried recording my actions with blazemeter and it runs on the blazemeter console but when i download the same .jmx file and try running it on the jmeter it tanks again

19717130
int	boolean
scalar values are int float string or boolean values

19717145
submit	submission
consider the case where someone hacks up a submission to your script and submit

19717171
google-chrome	firefox
my site works great in google-chrome firefox but pulls up a small white box in the middle of the page on ie8

19717179
width	height	mdpi	hdpi
i know that i have to resize the images to place them into ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi folders but what i don t know is what width and height should i use and change my image into

19717182
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i also have a jquery script that modifies the form based upon the users selection from the list however the click event is only recognized in firefox but not by safari or google-chrome have not tried ie yet

19717198
hide	show
this will hide the error and will show 0 when the sum is nil

19717216
int	double
but you couldn t declare an int and a double together

19717252
mdpi	hdpi
diaper rash with it and follow this line of proportions ldpi 0.75 mdpi 1 hdpi 1.5 xhddpi 2 xxhddpi 3

19717354
implements	extends
this is a list that extends from abstract list and implements get method

19717371
children	parent
children scopes cannot change the parent scope variables directly but they can change values inside a hash object

19717418
implements	extends
in the server side the uploadfileservletimpl extends abstractcoupleuploadcontroller and implements the upload method upload process

19717473
post	get
having the post route after the get route is what is causing the problem

19717473
put	get	post	get	post	put
when i put the post route before the get route the get route works with the filter as expected

19717473
post	get
now i was under the impression that laravel treated get and post requests differently hence the usage of the different static methods in route

19717473
post	get
i thought that these would be treated differently since one is get and the other post but this is not the case

19717473
put	get	post	get	post	put
as you can see here i renamed the as part of the array to site postlogin and i can now use different filters for each the post get and probably put delete and etc

19717480
folder	directory
so the directory structure of every client folder is such clientname admin

19717499
int	chars
and about storing chars as int in getchar output - see my answer for similar topic

19717502
hide	show
the moment the user completes payment where you receive skpaymenttransactionstatepurchased skpaymenttransactionstaterestored save a flag into nsuserdefaults so that you will know whether the user has bought the iap and show hide the iad correspondingly

19717525
bash	subshell
as mentioned by others the parens create a subshell and the exit or return command instructs bash to exit from the subshell

19717541
instances	transient
if you have a class whose instances you want to serialize using built-in java serialization not only must it implement serializable all its instances variables must also implement serializable or be primitives or be marked transient you tell the jvm that it s okay for them to not get serialized

19717545
serializable	deserialization
this class reduce the serializable of enum to printout the name of the enum value and the deserialization to get the enum value from its name

19717590
datediff	difference
the most important part is the elapsed part which uses datediff to get the difference between the two datetimes to get minute and second portions and displays this as mm ss

19717621
rvm	bundler
i also saw a stackoverflow thread using rvm gemsets bundler rubymine where someone complained about the same problem but the solution was simply to install the gems under the rvm managed path by doing the following

19717622
width	height
i would like it so that the smaller of the width and height is made to fit the element exactly and the larger dimension overflows the element

19717683
google-chrome	firefox
there are also issues with google-chrome and firefox interop

19717690
int	chars
i have thousands of phone numbers in one of my databases that are 16 chars in length an even when i strip the international dial specifier off them they don t fit in an int

19717695
post	get
i am not sure why but sometimes my post to the server to get data back takes a really long time 21s but at others times it is really fast 32ms

19717696
post	get
to sum this up client side code can communicate with the server be sending messages through get or post requests or by using ajax

19717701
post	get
the url i send is i am now expecting that when the post is made by them i will get the required information to the url

19717714
uilabel	uibutton
since uibutton and uilabel are all subclasses of uiview you can place them inside a uibutton and add this item to the toolbar

19717746
min	max
simple explanation min max does not work without index on that field

19717746
min	max
min and max are query modifiers and lte and gt are query operators

19717746
min	max
min and max can only search if that field has an index

19717746
min	max
with one min the boundary is inclusive with max it is exclusive and i do not know how to remember it

19717781
post	put
i have put some post here php code but it should be easy enough to convert

19717783
hlsl	glsl
amd s gpu shaderanalyzer is a stand-alone glsl hlsl compiler

19717783
hlsl	glsl
you can still test this with cgc nvidias stand-alone cg compiller part of the cg toolkit it compiles glsl and cg code to binary or cross-compile it to hlsl

19717826
subtract	add
if you re going to only add subtract 1 2 3 4 then one variable should be enough

19717834
entity-relationship	diagram
then use context menu to select entity-relationship diagram

19717863
for-loop	loops
as mrip says a for-loop returns null so you need to assign to an object within loops and return that object to replicate so it can be ouput

19717907
box-sizing	margin	box-sizing	border-box	margin	border-box
ie11 is ignoring the box-sizing border-box declaration and subtracts the padding and margin which i think is incorrect

19718000
mouseover	mousedown
it seems like tablets register a tap on the page as both a mousedown and a mouseover event

19718060
des	aes
note i am aware that des is insecure and that aes has superseded it

19718098
nuke	maya
background i come from a background in 3d animation where we use the software packages maya and nuke to process data in this way using node-based workflow- however the architectures are very high-level and specialized

19718112

i m using wand-py an implementation of the wand wrapper around imagemagick to import some pretty advanced svgs and so far have seen great results

19718198
folder	directory
after closing the new created firefox window firefoxdriver a folder named anonymousxxxxxxx.webdriver-profile remains in the temp directory appdata local temp

19718198
folder	directory
when using the dispose method or the using statement the folder for the new created firefox profile in the temp directory is removed but also the temporary firefox instance closes instantly

19718201
children	parent
i wish a parent object would dispatch an event to all its children listening to this event

19718229
post	get
which parts of the standard to implement to fulfill only get and post methods is best revealed by reading the rfc

19718283
pull	push
your xslt is very pull focused rather than push focused and could use some re-engineering to be more functional in the functional programming sense

19718310
for-loop	loops
a semicolon is used to terminate a statement meaning that when you add it to the end of your for-loop it runs that entire loops first then it tries your system.out.print

19718314
google-chrome	firefox
this is not happening in firefox or ie - just google-chrome afaik haven t tested anywhere else

19718344
sorting	grouping
a nice thing about xslt is that it has built-in aggregation grouping sorting etc capabilities

19718362
submit	submission
im planning on submission my app with iads but no in-app purchases for removing iads just yet due to me being frustrated with it so far could i submit my app now and just add in-app purchases on my app later in time

19718413
integer	unsigned
since an unsigned integer is not a standard data type you won t see something like an unsignedinteger or

19718430
direct3d	directdraw
according to this other document it disables our use of directdraw and direct3d

19718434
put	get
when i put the client in front internet side of my apache reverse proxy everything seems working i even get a message that the site is loading 30 to 60 but at the end before the complete content is displayed i get the following error displayed

19718447
ws-addressing	soap
but if the soap services need ws-security ws-addressing etc. support you would be better off using an existing framework

19718476
for-loop	loops
a for-loop works very similar to a while loops for example

19718495
stringstream	fstream
in particular you may want to pay attention to the fstream object which allows you to read files line by line and the stringstream object which allows you to tokenize strings split them according to a delimiter

19718523
sweave	vignette
this vignette source file tricks r cmd build to build it r s tools buildvignettes will first sweave into as usual

19718523
tex	sweave
however due to how buildvignettes is designed it will detect our static file as already being created by the sweave engine and therefore it will not compile that dummy tex file into a pdf file which would overwrite our static file

19718564
textview	imageview
this was the only way i could get it working to have the second imageview in the center and smaller than the first imageview and the textview under the second imageview

19718564
textview	imageview
it also destroys my viewflipper since any layout i tried around the second imageview and the textview makes them move or resize

19718593
treemap	treeset
i have a problem with functionality of the next sets and i really what to know what is the difference between treeset and hashset in java and also what is the difference between treemap and hashmap

19718597
post	get
i looked up another post and wrote xslt that orders attributes but i do not know how to get the whole thing working

19718643
mpfr	mpir
i met similar problem and had just resolved it by download precompiled mpir and mpfr libraries instead of gmp which needs mingw or similar on windows

19718643
mpfr	mpc	mpfr	mpir
build mpir mpfr mpc via vc++

19718656
width	height
graphics#drawrect takes 4 parameters the x y position top left corner and the width and height of the rectenagle whereas graphics#drawline takes x1 y1 which is the start point and x2 y2 which is the end point

19718672
treemap	treeset	comparator	comparable
with treemap and treeset you can choose to use the natural order of the content assuming the content implements the comparable interface or alternatively you can supply your own comparator to do the sorting for you

19718672
treemap	treeset
one difference that catches people by suprise is that you can store null in hashmap and hashset but not necessarily in treeset or as a key in treemap

19718691
int	double
i keep getting an error the method monthlypayment double int int is undefined for the type assignment 8. this error shows up in the main method

make z-index 1 a higher index to suit your needs and include a height and width as well

19718873
post	get
i have tried removing the json.stringify and changing the post to get change cache to false and true

19718874
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	fadeout
fadein fadeout seems to accomplish what you are after but if you want to use animate then you can tap into the callback parameter to hide the link

19718938
width	height
the set bounds should move your jpanel to the location and set its bounds based on height and width

19718942
folder	directory
not sure what happened but i just deleted .m2 directory in my home folder maven clean and maven install and now i m able to run the project on a server

19718945
int	chars
as for as i know prior to 1.7 switch statement accepts byte short int or chars as case value

19718945
int	chars
so when someone say enum are constant and they can be used in switch cases what type of constant they mean because switch accepts only byte short int or chars

19718993
post	get
post get or otherwise

19719103
versioning	upgrade
it can also happen after an upgrade if the browser is using a cached versioning of the old front-end javascript instead of downloading the updated versioning

onupgrade is used to upgrade the database to a new versioning but it s usually to upgrade between release versioning not during development

19719203
daemons	systemd
i ve read numerous threads on this topic and tried just about everything i ve encountered qx systemd exec fork cmd with | which worked under win32 but now i m porting to centos which uses the prefork mpm echo | at now and proc daemons but i haven t tried apache2 subprocess because it looks like it s exactly what i don t want a thread that s tied to the parent

19719206
try-catch	exception-handling
not sure if you ve learned exception-handling handling yet but if so you can use a try-catch block to catch a possible numberformatexception

19719208
width	height
then all you have to do is subtract half the element s height and width from the position using margin-top and margin-left

19719224
winpcap	wireshark
unfortunately winpcap which is what wireshark uses to capture traffic doesn t support it even on windows vista 7 8 or 8.1 so you can t capture in monitor mode with wireshark on windows

int	chars
array holds normal int and c does also consider 0 to be an int 0 as it considers all chars literal values to be int and the comparison is legal but since this is a hopefully sorted array of int that may have any values including negative values and 0 it could be that there are multiple 0s in some test data or more likely in this case no 0s in your test data

do not use the css style to resize the canvas but rather change its width and height directly either in html or in code

19729551
width	height
otherwise createjs will set the width and height which seems to default to 300x150 and the css will act as a zoom to put it back to -in your example- 500x500

octal	decimal
my approach was to build a function called oct which takes the stat_buf.st_mode copies it to a buffer in octal mode and again copies it to other buffer to eliminate the info i don t want the first 3 numbers and finally use the strtol function to get the number in decimal to compare it with the input

however there are scenarios where you might want or need to do an upgrade manually for example your subversion edge server might not be able to access the internet to pull down the updates or maybe one or more critical installation files have become corrupted and you need to reinstall using the same versioning

19731946

19732753
post	get
to get a post rather than a page you just need to supply post as the argument and usually object with no quotes as the type like this

19732753

the delimiter between the 3 fields is one spaces

19733926
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
you pass it a block of memory that was previously allocated with malloc or calloc or realloc and it frees that block of memory and nothing else

19733926
free	malloc
so to avoid leaking memory you must have exactly as many calls to free as to malloc

19733926
free	malloc
in c memory managed on the heap with malloc and free is largely treated as a black box

19733927
folder	directory
i would clearly not store an ide in an svn repository just because you cannot just copy for instance the visual studio folder to some directory and get it running again

19734063

you need somehow send the value from client to server post get ajax websocket etc

19734491
int	double
math.pow returns a double value and takes only int as parameters

sorting	filtering
the logic to check the type of a field before sorting seems a little kludgy we check in our model rather than checking the type in elasticsearch .it would be nice to always have a .sortable field around but we can t run non-string types through the dynamic template below- booleans and numbers can t be run through an ngram filtering

19735295

19740272
int	chars
i believe these are just two int offsets from the beginning of the text buffer and the reason they re the same in this case is because the region is empty no chars are actually selected by it since they re the same value which mean it s effectively the position of a cursor

the cursor for-loop first executes the query then for each record returned by the query it executes the statements between loop...end loops

19740749
for-loop	loops
if we need to detect whether the query in the cursor for-loop returns rows some rows or not then the easiest way is to declare a boolean variable and assign a value to in wihin the loop..end loops block

the diffence is that you are using the get method instead of post

19741592
post	get
see http - post and get

19741592

i am assuming that c is a tcp socket not a udp one. note that you should not assume that recv n returns n bytes

19741740
min	max
you ll see your request s success rate min max average times something like 2 seconds i guess and some more information depending on your configuration

19741862

comparator	comparable
alternatively you can replace c.reverseorder with a separate comparator instead of implementing comparable

19742056
int	chars
c means that the int argument is converted to an unsigned chars and the resulting chars is written

19742057
int	chars
a chars is passed as an int when you call a function

19742078
implements	extends
the repository class is implements using spring data jpa which is simply an interface extends pagingandsortingrepository

19742090
children	parent
however the mutable tracks changes in children by propagating them to the parent when the changed method is called and the current implementation in sqlalchemy seems to only assign a parent to someone assigned as an attribute not as an item of a sequence like a dictionary or a list

19742090
children	parent
the parent get assigned by a call listening on the load event so at the time of initialization the _parents dict is empty and the children get nothing assigned

width	height
i have written code that uses the width and height of a screen in graphicsprogram to draw boxes in which i do other things

19742315
aggregate-functions	sum
when you use group by then in select you can use only rows from group by and aggregate-functions sum count etc

19742320
min	max
it is meaningless to select all columns and group by some of them as it would be indeterminate as to what to show for the non-grouped column - for these you should either omit them if you don t need them or use an aggregation function such as min or max etc so you could do

19742328
width	height
my solution was to use a php variable and increment it on each generated then if i have let s say 13 rows it echoes but the cells must have an exact width so it may add a new line of text if i have a longer text on a cell and the table will have more than 1280px height

19742344
gruntjs	yeoman
after following this interesting guide about angular yeoman bower and gruntjs i was able tot bootstrap an angular application

19742366
width	height
1 as henry said in the comments you get an optimum if r is as big as possible so it will either have the same height or the same width as r

19742366
width	height
2 now you have rectangle r than can be slid along the height of r or along the width of r

19742398

19742430
portrait	landscape
since the uiimagepickercontroller can only be presented in portrait as per apple doc is possible to do the other way around enabling portrait and landscape orientation but fixing the orientation in landscape of everything but the picker controller

19742481
portrait	landscape
this view will be the only view with portrait orientation while the others with landscape

19742481
portrait	landscape
while not adding any code to this view controller will let this view to run in landscape and portrait

19742481
portrait	landscape
so my proposed solution that to run all the views in landscape and this one in portrait

19742496
comparator	comparable
a simple way and recommended way of sorting arraylists is using the comparable interface or the comparator object

19742499
for-loop	loops
using a for in loops within a for-loop to run through the results

19742551
int	double
you got a string and move to binary and then converts that string to an int and then vc is the power so that the whole supports a certain number of houses so it s a blast u can use paserint putting the number of homes or turns the whole into a double

19742598

don t add components directly to the jscrollpane but rather to its jviewport via the setviewportview ... method

width	height
the width and height layout is set to wrapcontent

19742678
int	chars
piere s solutions shows how to do it but i highly doubt that there s an iterator over chars array so you have to iterate over given array using an int index

19742702
plink	prompt
if i run directly plink from prompt everything works fine

19742718
hide	show
so for example you would have a converter to change an enumeration type to the selected value of a combo box or change a boolean to visible invisible or use a converter to show and hide or enable and disable different parts of the ui when a property has a certain value

now this works fine when i only have a few invoices in the selected range but given that it calls the function a minimum of three times per record the performance really degrades when i go to produce the report over a time period of more than a day we often need reports covering a two week period

19752399
keydown	keyup
next handle either the keydown or keyup events of the form and place the code in there

unless i put a jquery handler on submit event - this time i m starting to get index all the time

19753033
width	height
and i want my width to be equal to my height

19753057

folder	directory
for now i map the request url to directory structure relative to a source folder so that example.com user create maps to source user create index.php

19753315
folder	directory
so my idea is to find out whether a request url ends with a file extension and map that to a directory structure relative to a assets folder so that example.com css default.css would map to assets css default.css

19753340
folder	directory
i ve tried running the go help gopath command it just returns example paths and how they relate to each other in packages and source directory - it s doesn t actually say where i can find the go folder

a couple of days ago i couldn t get mysql to run anymore xampp after some googling i found this post xampp - mysql shutdown unexpectedly

19753594
width	margin
that is not because of width 19em but it is because of margin 0 auto applied to the ul element

19753594
width	margin
margin 0 auto brings any block element to center if it has some width applied which is less than its parent element s width

19753594
width	text-align
if you are not aware of the ul elements width then use display inline-block to it and give text-align center to its parent element

add the onclicklisteners to respective imageview and textview inside it

19753731
organization	naming
it d be nice to be able to do a similar unstacking operation with the original frame the one with all value columns x y and z either using some form of hierarchical column organization in the new frame where now columns x y and z would each consist in turn of subcolums c0 and c1 or perhaps some scheme for naming the new columns using composite names in the new frame columns x y and z would be replaced by columns columns x_c0 x_c1 y_c0 y_c1 z_c0 and z_c1 etc. but this may be hoping for too much.

19753776
screens	tablet
i looked through the less sources and it appears the hocus-pocus is the font property notice that in the example tablet body uses font-size and large screens body uses font

portrait	landscape
and i ve checked the effect with the different api levels both in portrait and landscape mode

19753910
portrait	landscape
in landscape mode the key label id is go 2 as the portrait mode while the button displayed in the input area is custom 666 accordingly to the imeactionlabel and imeactionid attributes

google-chrome	firefox
either you manage to get your browser to use a different tcp stack which is unlikely unless you re working with firefox or google-chrome or some other open source browser and compile it from source or you have to write your own browser

19754140
put	get
i have a .htaccess file in the root of the website i m working on and it is being used because if i put something invalid in there i get an error in the browser

19754173

19754196
folder	directory
but that didn t work for me - my modifications either didn t show up if i followed the advice in link #2 above or generated an error saying that meteor could not find spark.js if i tried to modify the spark.js file in the client folder of a packages folder in either .meteor or the .meteor directory of my project

19754318
width	height
i tried using before and after on the body and inside it putting a white section with 80 height and 50 width

19754337
width	height
so i made the following test fiddle and it seems that if you specify a background-size then the gradient will be resized to that size regardless of the element dimensions note that you have to explicitly define a width and a height for background-size to work properly in firefox

19754337
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i have checked this in latest google-chrome safari and firefox and looks the same in all three borwsers

19754348
put	get
and state provides get and put which are analogous to your getval and writefunc

19754362
try-catch	exception-handling
in the typical try-catch block i want to test the error message for some exception-handling

19754408
cout	cin
with windows mingw msys bash if you need to pipe different commands with binary streams in between you need to manipulate std cin and std cout as binary streams

19754428
subtract	add
now that error message user with username.. pops up all-the-time but when i click add subtract it changes to this

19754453
int	double
cast one of the int to double

19754532
associativity	operator-precedence
i think the main source of your confusion comes from the difference between operator-precedence associativity and order of evaluation

19754712
put	get
next we create the product and then put the result in a set so we get rid of duplicates

19754715
bufferedreader	ioexception
each thread should be reading from one bufferedreader at a time and you should close and set to null see below the in in a block to make sure that you properly release the memory even in the case of ioexception

19754809
google-chrome	firefox
finally i ve checked what firefox and google-chrome do

19754809

margin	height
the parent block s bottom margin unless the sibling s height is zero

19754942
hide	show
have a directive needprivilege privilege-name that uses that service and show hide disable according to its boolean result

19754976
for-loop	loops
my best guess is to have a nested for-loop and loops through one program once for every line in the other program to compare every line with every other line looking for a distance that meets my difference threshold

19754982
for-loop	arrays
for multiple terms the suggestions that i ve seen is that each word that s posted from a form should be sent to an arrays and the contents should be processed with a for-loop

19755021
sidekiq	celluloid
this gem uses celluloid actors like sidekiq does and has features to avoid minimizes sqs costs

19755052
wav	aiff
to combine wav or aiff files you can do something like this inspiration from here

19755055
sum	coalesce
instead of coalesce sum vau.value 0 as value_sum can you try

19755080
free	malloc
both malloc 3 and free are related to virtual memory and they use the mmap 2 and munmap 2 and perhaps sbrk syscalls

19755080
free	malloc
so malloc try hard to reuse previously free -d memory zones to avoid making too much mmap munumap syscalls and that memory contains arbitrary data called garbage

19755080
free	malloc
likewise free don t release memory to the kernel using munmap but just remember that the memory you have free -d is later reusable by malloc it is data which has previously been used and filled by your own application

19755080
free	malloc
take advantage that linux is free software and study the implementation of malloc free in gnu libc or musl libc

19755126
width	height
i have a div with width 500px and height 300px in the middle of a page

19755171
inherited	subclassing
the other way would be to subclassing activity with an acitivitywithoverlay which handles the overlay appearing and disappearing then have all of your activities inherited that

19755183
free	malloc
imagine a process which constantly malloc s and free s

19755183
free	malloc
if however the memory is not released immediately but added to the list of free memory blocks it or parts of it might be returned by a later call to malloc

19755238
hide	show
if they don t match it hide all and show the ones that match slider

19755314
serializable	deserialization
note this serializable works for fixed size classes attribute classes are used to specify string lengths target for deserialization must have default initializations for all components and no nulls

19755325
min	max
the form on the query string when you use filter is complicated a bit by its record mechanism which allows for some min max queries

19755330
width	height
you can then draw the string you want with spritebatch.drawstringtrim font new rectangle width height some really really long text

19755335
jobs	cron
cron runs jobs in your home directory so unless your script cd s somewhere else that s where it s going to look for create file.txt

19755408
memset	malloc
i think if you want the latency hit to come up front when you malloc you should memset there

19755418
gif	png
given that file size is also critical as it s a web game i considered swapping all the png s to gif s in order to roughly half the size - however before i embark on this journey i figured the same thing would happen because of the number of images

19755441
bluetooth	usb
via a bluetooth or usb connection. so the answer to your question is no

19755468
calloc	malloc
could simply be done with calloc instead of malloc

19755497
cout	cin
as you can see i started adding the bits from the right to left with the corresponding bits and for cin the signals t1 and t2 and cout the t2 and t1 in order

19755528
hash	md5
here is how i get the hash messagedigest.getinstance md5 .digest password+salt .getbytes utf-8

19755618

prepare	execute
so when you execute the prepare statement it will use the last value of this variable for all the parameters

19755718
bindparam	bindvalue
use bindvalue instead of bindparam and i think it should solve your problem

19755737
put	get
another solution is to get all pids and put a wait for all of these pids

19755744
width	height
the div has a fixed height but the width will be dynamic depending on the number of images

19755766
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i think good idea will be to shift all your allocaton code espacially all code define frames to viewwillappear method because in viewdidload some frame wouldn t be already set

19755773
gif	png
or you can smartly detect if the url ends with jpg gif png or not

19755816
hide	show
when expand collapse events are triggered jqm adds several classes to show hide contents as well as update collapsible button header

19755832
min	max
edit although if you want to do with the highest and lowest you can use the built in min and max functions to get the highest and lowest and then generate them as follows

19755840
addclass	removeclass
i ve tried putting the addclass into the complete function for removeclass but the behaviour of that wasn t what i wanted swinging between not being called or being called multiple times

19755840
addclass	removeclass
edit if i set the duration on the removeclass to 0 and put the addclass in a settimeout then i can set the timeout to 0 even and the behaviour works

19755855
hash	salt
authentication systems should used salt one-way hash not reversible encryption

19756541
inherited	properties
with this approach you ll however need to change the properties type as it no longer inherited from but from now

19756545
ssl	https
so if i omit ssl and just use http instead of https it wouldn t have any disadvantage to me right

19756609
required	placeholder
to use pdo to interact with a mysql database assuming named placeholder required some knowledge of the database structure

19756634
range	minimum
cartesian trees may be used as part of an efficient data structure for range minimum queries a range searching problem involving queries that ask for the minimum value in a contiguous subsequence of the original sequence

19756638
width	height
it s simply a huge image that is set as background of a div and sized as cover in css which means its width determines its height based on its aspect ratio

19756653
width	height
to cover 100 width height of the user s browser window you can do this

you need to include a similar path to the appropriate library in your game s compilation commands or likely if you are using an fmod library that has been installed on your system you just need to include the correct -l and -l flags to gcc g++

19757080
persistent	transient
transient persistent detached

19757116
firefox	safari
however i have no experience whatsoever trying to do the same in firefox or safari

19757127
many-to-many	one-to-many
edit if you want a many-to-many collection instead of a one-to-many you can modify the publish method on the server to return the cards for a particular deck and avoid the need to publish that connection table to the client

19757263
filesystems	fat
my circuit board has an sd card socket spi connected and i had previously tried writing files into a fat filesystems

19757263
fat	umount
another strike against fat is that it s quite prone to data corruption in case of power loss without prior clean umount and my system doesn t have any user interface which could initiate an umount

19757307
postgresql	mysql
those three are mysql postgresql and sqlite

19757335

note you could also toggle between show hide by using .toggle instead of .show if you like

19757648
union	distinct
keep in mind that if you remove the origin column the union statement will perform an implicit distinct on the resultset

19757653
int	chars
similarly if you want to explicitly append the actual byte value 11111111b to a std string simply appending chars 255 might be implementation-defined and even raise a signal if chars is signed and the int to chars conversation results in an overflow

19757673
public	protected
though public protected private is all upon you

19757695

you may move this object back to persistent state but there is no way to change from detached to transient

19757977
put	get
if you don t put the super in the constructor your item copies will remain 0 and you will always get system.out.println all copies of +title+ are checked out

19757987

i can successfully create a json object with the right information but when i go to post it i get a networkonmainthreadexception or my httpclient class returns null when it should be returning a jsonobject and i am very confident that my web server works correctly

19758106
width	height
note that i assume either you have the same width and height for each image or you ve stored the metric somewhere you can access it on this load

19758114
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
you can t free something unless it was allocated with malloc or calloc

start hdfs namenode and datanode

19758168
implements	extends
if you have an abstract class then you must implements the abstract methods of said class for any class that extends the abstract class

19758168
implements	extends
the only exception to this is when you extends from a class that has already implements the abstract methods or interface and you don t want need to redefine them for subclasses

i ve tried several things and while i can get it to login to both the admin page the myaccount page if i put an invalid email in it still logs in jdelor1965 yahoo.m

19758307
post	get
i want to change the get to post

19758369
put	get
when i compile i either can not put the brackets in the parameter for fileloader or i get an error that tells me that it can not find class file

19758389

this sounds like homework so i won t post all the code but this should be enough to get you started

19758390
hide	show
hide show content-list with only css no javascript used

19758393
int	double
i am trying to store a different types such a double and int inside a list

19758430
int	double
you can store a and store a double and an int

19758430
int	double
however this can be needlessly complicated to work with as every int can be stored as a double without loss

19758434
int	double
a better option would be to cast your int to double values

19758468
post	get
a post is fundamentally different from a get and both semantics are very clearly defined in rest

19758468
getter	setter
then you will need your jax-rs provider resteasy spring mvc restlet etc. to perform automatic deserialization of json typically with jackson to the candidateobject pojo which will have getter and setter mapping to the fields in your original query string of your get

19758481
post	get
i followed the steps in this post including an xml file in an xml xsl file but i haven t been able to get this to work

19758498
post	get
the body is uri-encoded just like get or some post params

19758533
width	height
height width to automatically set it as vertical

19758533
width	height
width height to automatically set it as horizontal

19758541
libstdc++	libc++
mac os x has been moving away from libstdc++ toward libc++ which provides a c++11 standard library

19758555
integer	unsigned
the object could for example contain a pointer to the location of the content and an unsigned integer to represent the length

19758555
integer	unsigned
sizeof would therefore contain the size of one pointer and the unsigned integer

19758596
onresume	onpause
i think i have set the lifecycle correct getting resources onresume releasing it onpause roughly said and the following works just fine

19758626
hash	salt
lastly i really hope that this is not a system that should actually be secure or anything because looping of a plain text file for user logins that are not hash or salt is not a very good method of securing your application

19758632
int	double
the problem is that i always get a cannot find symbol error - method changeall double int location class question10e

19758643
hide	show
try ecsstender we used this for a relatively simple one to show hide an element

19758695
queue	fifo
there are different queue management methods as well most popular on software side is fifo fifo but on drive side it probably is ncq special queue managment that selects closest data to be written read first all of those queue have limited size

19758776
google-chrome	firefox
it works reliably even in background windows in google-chrome 30 ie 11 and firefox 24

19758780
put	get
but whenever i try to put the results into an array i get null

19758787
strlen	strcpy
if you didn t alloc space for you could allocate exactly strlen msg +1 positions for and then use strcpy safely

19758833
children	parent
in c++ run-time type checking is implemented through dynamic_cast this allows you to check if the parent class if of a certain type of children class in my analogy this allows you to check if an animal is a cat

19758839
min	max
i know that uniform distribution runif n min max has some arguments for setting min max but no rnorm

19758839
min	max
since rnorm doesn t provide the argument for setting min and max value

19758839
min	max
i can see why the programs is hanging since it just generate data randomly without constraints of min max

19758841
post	get
i m not sure what the query would should be to get a total of 10 of the latest post from the people you re following

19758862
children	parent
when the parent is selected its value is reflected as changed it does not change any of the children

19758862
children	parent
iow i am surprised that the children checkboxes are not initiated with the testmodel nor are the parent values ever registered with the testmodel

19758880
post	get
the query you wrote is still there but it s been surrounded by the query to get the actual post

19758934
int	chars
x extends chars to int and that causes the difference

19758938
int	chars
you certainly want to convert the chars objects to unsigned chars before processing them as int values

19758938
int	chars
the problem is that chars may be signed in which case negative values get converted to negative int s when you cast them

19758941
portrait	landscape
start the application in portrait mode select an item then rotate the device in landscape mode

19758956
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to port my firefox plugin to google-chrome and here is my sample code

19758994
integer	unsigned
then when it is passed to printf it gets sign-extended since any signed integer parameter passed to a vararg function is widened to int but interpreted as an unsigned int due to the x parameter

19758994
int	chars
all this assuming 2 s complement arithmetic non-signaling int overflow and signed chars

19759003
ati	nvidia
for pcs you can easily name all the prominent gpu builders nvidia and ati so there you can at least know what to expect

19759008
submit	submission
contrary to submit buttons behaviour in html in primefaces such submission will not force redirection to new page but all communication will be handled by underlying ajax requests

19759011
prepare	pdostatement
there also is pdostatement setfetchmode which is useful when using repeated prepare statements

19759088
hide	show
i m using this accordion to show and hide comments in a blog

19759088
post	get
i get comments on every blog post

19759103
inherited	properties
but having it available as a public properties does allow overwriting or amending the constructor without harming the jquery function and it makes prototypical inherited possible where you might need to apply the parent constructor on the child instance

19759111
int	double
let s say you entered 5.4 the program will give you 5.4 for double and 5 for int

19759115
jrockit	jprofiler	jrockit	yourkit	yourkit	jprofiler
with java 7 update 40 oracle included java mission control originally part of the jrockit jdk - a very powerful performance tuning tool which is able to compete with yourkit jprofiler

19759166
inherited	properties
however properties inherited isn t as widely used as as class inherited in owl and in all the years since i wrote listhierarchyrootclasses you re the first person i can remember asking about the properties hierarchy

19759228
put	get
if you put these two together with your example you get something like this

19759235
cpu	affinity
if the whole program runs with then it s relatively simple to set a cpu affinity by calling out to the taskset utility from the schedutils package

19759235
cpu	affinity
i don t know of any go stdlib function to set the current thread s cpu affinity once you ve locked a goroutine to it though

19759248
rss	feed
i just tried something real simple to have an rss feed send me to the mobile version of the site instead of the full version but i guess it really isn t this simple

19759248
rss	feed
that s what i wrote naively thinking it would just alter all urls in the rss feed but sadly it only display the original feed through the echo

19759256
oncreate	setcontentview
setcontentview should be only used only one time in the oncreate multiple calls of it might give unexpected results

19759269
int	double
should it be int or double

19759280
for-loop	loops
you need to define total outside the for-loop and then do total+ â inside loops

19759282
int	double
just noticed you used double replace double with int or short

19759289
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i m looking for a solution that will at very least work in the latest google-chrome safari and firefox

19759293
children	parent
i d like for the tree to go arbitrarily deep if bart had children in my example and to accumulate parent child relationship accordingly based on names

19759300
implements	extends
you ll definitely need to write a custom class for your key as twodarraywritable doesn t implements writablecomparable even if you just extends the twodarraywritable class to add the interface and compareto method

19759300
int	double
do you arrays hold primitive types int double float etc - if so i would again say use a custom class so you don t have to worry about wrapping unwrapping the primitive values from their wrapper writables intwritable doublewritable etc when performing matrix operations downstream

19759302
lme4	glm
i have a glm that was fit with the lmer function in the lme4 pkg

spaces	delimiter
i have a file named coord that contains the following spaces delimiter strings

19759443
tolower	toupper
also in case it wasn t obvious i tried using the cctypes toupper and tolower but they take and return integers

19759471
toupper	uppercase
when you call toupper it doesn t return the function it returns the supposed character in its uppercase form

19759502
hashchange	popstate
i ve tried a couple different approaches but am new to working with hashchange popstate so am hoping for guidance

19759529
google-chrome	firefox
i m fine with using css3 so long as it works in current major browsers firefox google-chrome but i cannot apply any pseudo-elements to the inner because they re being used for another design element on the page

19759532
for-loop	arrays
i asked another question for-loop accepting an extra arrays member and then realised something that i thought might make a helpful q a for newcomers like myself

19759570
put	get
however if i try and authenticate using basic authentication i get a 401 error even though i ve put in the right user name and password

19759582

i send a post request to my server and get back json

19759600
listview	gridview

19759615
maven	pom.xml
that is currently the only supported pom.xml version for maven 2 and is always required

19759615
maven	pom.xml
if you write your pom.xml to comply with 4.1 it wouldn t be compatible with maven 3 and model 4.0.0

19759631
put	get
you need to put something in the list before you can get it out

19759644
onclick	onsubmit	hide	show
it s just a supposition but try recreating the form widget onsuccess or even hide the form onsubmit actually onclick is better and show another form to the user

19759660
stdout	stderr
i m piping stdout to a file so i can t combine stderr and stdout

19759673
int	chars	tolower	toupper
toupper and tolower take and return int but their valid range is that of unsigned chars

19759673
tolower	toupper
additionally std toupper and std tolower both take char

19759758
getter	setter
you should just make standard getter and setter to deal with those fields

19759773
width	height
i have tried changing the width and height of my gridview to make sure that it is being drawn and have looked around constantly on sites trying to fix this but i can t figure out what to do

19759797
int	double
your method signature states that you re returning an int when you re actually returning a double

19759815
int	chars
then the call to printf promotes that chars to the int with value -0x2e then printf which is not very typesafe reads in an unsigned int where you passed the int

19759866
hide	show
when i launch function loadarticle it hide div with article list and show particular article

19759878
google-chrome	firefox

nothing will prevent you from taking a pointer to an int and casting it to chars

19773537
setinterval	settimeout
if you want a more arbitrary fps then there is no point using raf as the frame rate will never match the monitor s update frequency anyways just a frame here and there which simply cannot give you a smooth animation as with all frame re-timings and you can might as well use settimeout or setinterval instead

19773538
stdout	stderr
as discussed on the mailing list the solution is to make sure you invoke chrome from the command line using the actual path to the chrome binary for example applications google chrome.app contents macos google chrome instead of using the open shell command because open does not give you the stdout stderr streams from the application it launches

as the display width and height varies i d need to set a different zoom level at width 320 as i do at 1200+

19773705

they have managed to achieve this by what appears to be to load the main images as well as the thumbnail then hide the unused main images and then once it is clicked to show the main image

19773790
octal	decimal
generally speaking it seems that javascript interpreters will treat a number with a leading zero that can be interpreted as an octal number as an octal number but if it cannot be interpreted as an octal number 08 then they will treat it as decimal

19773791
width	height
try setting the width and height of the container by hand and see if it still happens

19773844
hide	show
the correct way to do this pre-ios7 has always been to adjust the contentinset property of the uitextview a uiscrollview subclass when the keyboard show or hide

19773844
hide	show
in your case where you re using auto-layout and all you want is a full screen text view you can simply adjust a single constraint when the keyboard show or hide

19773869
put	get	post	get	post	put
however i don t see a way to do the same when using cbvs with the apiview class because then i specify the permissions for the full class with the permission_classes attribute but that will be applied then to all class methods get post put ...

libjpeg	libz
pil relies on libjpeg to load jpeg images and libz to load png images but can be installed without either in which case it is unable to load whatever images the libraries are missing for

19774150
libjpeg	libz
so i uninstalled my copy of pil installed the missing libjpeg in my case probably libz in yours reinstalled pil to register the presence of the library and now loading images with scipy works perfectly

19774331
getter	setter
not only they are slower to access by an interesting margin but also they are prone to be destroyed overnight by android and it s usually hacky to check for their references all over the place or fill your getter setter with if ssomestatic null return new somestatic

19774380
int	chars
so the chars at position i of s gets converted to an int when it is passed to this method

__u32 is an unsigned 32-bit integer

19774384
integer	unsigned
__u8 is an unsigned 8-bit integer and so on

19774535
width	height
i assume per your example code that what you mean by isn t actually loaded is not put into the page yet as there would be no way to access the width and height if the image is not loaded

19774535
width	height
the issue is that your image has not loaded by the time you request the height and width

19774535
width	height
you need to use the onload event to wait until the image loads and then ask javascript to grab the height and width

19774548
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox and google-chrome but in ie8 no validation errors are triggered

19774586
google-chrome	firefox
secondly google-chrome and firefox will throw the warning as neither one uses the trident layout engine at all

post	get
you could always post this as an idea at to get visibility for the functionality you are looking for

19774836
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it looks like getusermedia is only supported by firefox opera and google-chrome and i wasn t able to find a still image capture example using it

19774885
min	max
you can use a javascript validation library which uses the html5 input attributes like min and max for example jquery validation

19774887
min	max
then you can multiply the ratio with the zoom levels and check min and max values

19774888

post	get
i tried to echo the and inside if to check the problem in post but i get only three values abs on esp on immobilizer on

19775387
width	height
with that being said to correct your problem i d specify both height width

19775387
width	height
being that it s rotated 90 degrees it ll be default height for the width and default width for the height which is 100 width of the parent element

19775387
width	height
your height won t likely match the element width

fiddler	charles
to discover the right field names you want to proxy your browser request through a ssl mitm proxy like fiddler or charles and see what it s sending

19775407

tcp is stream-oriented whereas udp is datagram-oriented

19775604
gitlist	gitweb
i have my own git server with gitolite and gitolite has some settings to categorize repositories for gitweb but i can t see that information in either gitweb nor gitlist the later is not that surprising when the setting is for gitweb

i use implode to covert the images array into comma separated string and insert it into my db then when calling i use explode to recall single images

super	self
you should not use self.__class__ or type self when calling super

19776143
super	self
in python 3 a call to super without arguments is equivalent to super b self within methods on class b

19776143
super	self
if you use super self.__class__ self or super type self self you will hit an infinite recursion exception when a subclass tries to call that method

i know that dp is the best to use but i would like to define two new measurement units called wp width percentage and hp height percentage

19776370

comparator	comparable
for a generic comparable type overriding of the compare method of the comparator class on every sorting provides access to the comparator method of the array components

19776511
xna	libgdx
i have never used c# or xna but i can definitely recommend libgdx

19776754
post	get
i thought that these would be treated differently since one is get and the other post but this is not the case

19776754
put	get	post	get	post	put
as you can see here i renamed the as part of the array to site postlogin and i can now use different filters for each the post get and probably put delete and etc

apache	nginx
most web servers that might be used in production such as apache and nginx are written in c so it wouldn t really be practical to ship them with django

19776830
apache	nginx
apache and nginx are both complex pieces of software that require a fair amount of configuration and while there are ways to automate that during development it s not something you really want to have to deal with when you d rather be writing code

19776837
versioning	upgrade
again to keep same functionality as older ef versioning and want to upgrade to ef 6 use ef 6.x entity object generator

19776878
comparator	comparable
also for comparing you can use comparator function under comparable interface

19776933
stdout	stderr
if you redirect stdout and stderr to the same pipe then you can t control the order on the pipe because they re now exactly the same

19776933
stdout	stderr
both stdout and stderr have the same path inside the operating system

19776933
stdout	fflush
stdout is buffered but fflush every newline if the output is a tty otherwise when the buffer is full

19776933
stderr	fflush
stderr is unbufferred and always immediately fflush with every write

19776933
stdout	stderr
you can mess with the python buffers or make stdout and stderr be the exact same thing but perhaps the easiest way would be to try python -u .

19776984
free	malloc
also if you get memory from malloc you should call free when you re done with it so

onclick	onchange
i think its a bug on the calendar when it s initialized from an input the problem is that the onchange event is triggered once you click the input field you can see this if you console.log or print the date argument and not when there s a real user generated change i had the same problem you could alternatively use the onclick event this will work only when they click on the selector and not when they manually change the date or use jquery to catch the event since you re obtaining the date directly from the input field and not the date the calendar is sending

19777789
post	get
but a new requirement is to expose some of the functionality as a web service so it is accessible to get post data programatically by other applications

sorry for re-posting in such an old thread want to provide more solutions if anyone else can t get it solved via the above post

19777851
mouseleave	mouseenter
well using jquery you could use the mouseenter and mouseleave functions to add a class and remove a class accordingly thus giving you the hover effect but this would take more code than just css as you d need the jquery code plus the css style to go along with the class you re adding

19777877

getter	setter
as we can see the csstext property implements native getter setter that are invoked when we try to get set the csstext property

19778181
getter	setter
let s just redefine the custom cssstyledeclaration.prototype.csstext getter setter

19778181
getter	setter
well that doesn t work because it seems the csstext property doesn t come from the prototype and even if it would there s no way to get custom getter setter using object.getownpropertydescriptor so we would not be able to invoke the native setter from our custom function

19778181
accessor	properties
well there s probably no safe solution to do it yet but your best bet would be to replace the style properties with a custom accessor on the newly created element

19778181
getter	setter
that would be the only way since we cannot access native getter setter functions otherwise we could have redefined the csstext accessor only on the native style object of the element

19778194

width	height
the number of sub-division on height and width must be proportional to the other wall

this means that even if you use a type chars variable to obtain the desired chars from the user it will automatically get converted to type int if passed to a function having a type int parameter

19781982
int	chars
when you use with an int you get a number output not a chars

19781982
int	chars
the other problem is that you re reading the chars as an int

19781982

if you make a a chars instead of int it will be read as a single chars and will be automatically upcast to int in the function call

19782216
uitableview	uisearchbar
if i drag the uitableview down until the uisearchbar is displayed and i either click the uitextfield in the uisearchbar or click the search button in 1.1 above the uisearchdisplaycontroller gets displayed

uitableview	uisearchbar
however if i don t drag the uitableview to reveal the uisearchbar before clicking the search button to display the uisearchdisplaycontroller when i click the cancel button it doesn t work

19782216
uitableview	uisearchbar
in the 2nd behaviour when the uisearchdisplaycontroller is active it appears as if the cancel button doesn t even exist like in the state of the uisearchbar when it s still on the uitableview

mouseover	mouseout
this is based on dlo s answer but mouseover and mouseout events are replaced by touchstart and touchend events

19785426

19785828
factors	mean
these two factors combined may well mean you should use a good old vector or boost array

19785869
for-loop	loops
this is because although the code you posted has explicit n 2 run-time complexity in the middle a nested for-loop and my new version has apparently only n complexity the containsobject call contains a loops so there s still n 2 complexity

width	height
so i need to reduce all logos proportionally lets say divide the height and width by 1.5 when the view loads

19786765
width	height
if you divide the height and width of the image view by 1.5 every time the cell is loaded then it will get smaller and smaller

19786765
width	height
just set the height and width to a constant value

g++	gcc
compiled the individual cpp files with gcc and then linked everything using g++

19786867

put	get
a get request made immediately after a put should return the same resource

19787156
put	get
however if you have a filter constraint you can apply to api products that would return an empty collection on the get above then it would be fine to do the put only with the new products to that filtered resource

19787156
post	put
this might seem complicated and sometimes it looks like it s better to use post instead of put but keep in mind that the whole operation above is standardized

19787164

i do not know what happens in your example case where having initial width 1px and height 10 6 px the code sets width 10 6 px in one step schedules pulse and then height 1px second step

19787564
width	height
but even if two events are processed the first should process the entire state change both width and height so changes occur in one visual step

19787564
width	height
i guess if the first pulse event has a chance to run then the user will see a change of width - pause - a change of height

19787564
width	height
so you either extend layoutchildren if no changes to the children tree is required or either of computeprefheight double width computeprefwidth double height if the children tree will be modified

19787658
put	get
this hasn t seemed to work and i think it may be to do with the numerical instability of the code - so far i have tried changing the constants here -0.05 alpha and 80.0 and the sign in various the lines for calculating charge and mat i j and get wildly different results depending on what i put for example changing the coefficient of charge i on the last line by just 10.0 can cause the programme to get trapped inside a loop diverge to infinity or -infinity or quickly converge to 0 which is not to be expected

19787669

freeglut	glew
the easy way would be with cygwin and freeglut as well as perhaps glew

19788228
implements	extends
since you are extends baseedge one can safely assume that baseedge implements weighted and implements the method getweight

19788242

this implementation will fire a post request this is probably what you should use since the action implies user writing something rather than reading it you can still pass method get if you prefer a get request

19788267

19788948
accessor	properties
incidentally you ll learn that it s things like operators and properties accessor

19788974
filtering	grouping
but as i have very customized filtering options nested grouping of filtering the filtering string gets quite long actually too long to be able to pass it with the get request because of the length limit

19788974
post	get
so as get is out of the question the obvious solution would be a post request and this is what we can t agree upon

19788974
post	get
first solution is to use the post request and get the annoying popup every time we try to go back forth or refresh

19788974
post	get
we also break the post redirect get pattern that we use throughout the site since there will be no get

19788974
post	get
breaks the post redirect get pattern

19788974
post	get
second solution is to use the post request server side saves the data in the db gets an id for requesting the saved data returns it and the client then does a get request with this id which the server side matches back to the data returning the right filter thus retaining the post redirect get pattern

19788974
post	get
keeps the post redirect get pattern

19791178
equals	gethashcode
however the algorithm requires the user to override the equals and gethashcode functions from the c# standard libraries

19791192
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can fix this by changing your code so that you mouseenter the original element but mouseleave the clone

19791224
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox this should work should work in google-chrome too

19791233
equals	gethashcode
you can create 2 new methods that will be abstract and will be called from gethashcode and equals your class

19791250

better make fragment_container a framelayout and set height and width of fragment layout roots to match_parent

19791519
width	height
add a rectangle to your object class and use its width and height properties

19791526
abstract-class	superclass
if iobject is a drawable element it would have x y coordinates that would be inherited so it is correct to put on a superclass in this case it would be an abstract-class

19791532
16-bit	64bit
that alone would save you a considerable amount of space since strings are 16-bit per character and the long timestamp would be just 64bit

19791579
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i know the 3 most popular browser are most likely safari google-chrome and firefox

19791793
int	boolean	int	chars
note that int short boolean and chars are really the same data type inside jvm

19791793
int	boolean
you ll see that boolean were convereted to int

19791793
int	boolean
so boolean or int - really no difference in terms of performance

19791793
int	boolean
for real optimization you could use bitset or your own bit sets implementation based on int to store 32 boolean values inside one int

19791795
uiview	subviews
for the same task i m creating uiview subclasses that i add as subviews to the main window

width	margin
#container has the same width of window ignore body margin #m s left border touchs right border of #l and #m s right border touchs left border of #r

19791963
fadein	fadeout
you must remember the fadeout and fadein function are asynchronous

19791976
subtract	add
but we want a value that never overshoots if we add that value back onto the earlier of the two dates - so we have to compensate by sometimes subtract 1

19791988

19792272
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
the first click only produces the mousemove event but the second click produces 2x mousedown 1x focus 2x mouseup and 2x click events

19792277
return-value-optimization	nrvo
as to the second i believe it prohibits nrvo since std move produces and not t which would be candidate for nrvo return-value-optimization because std move removes name and nrvo requires it thanks to dyp comment

19792308
preorder	inorder
if you have a tree with only right children a list you will have its preorder being equal to its inorder traversal

19792309
equals	gethashcode
a good starting point is to completely remove the equals and gethashcode overrides the default implementations inherited from object are excellent and guarantee object uniqueness

19792309
equals	gethashcode
on the interface page on msdn it says it should be implemented for any object that might be stored in a generic collection and then on the method page it says if you implement equals you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behaviour is consistent with that of the

19792371
unsigned	short
has got over 200000 vertices so the unsigned short is not enough to store the indices since its max value is 65535 - therefore an unsigned int should be used

19792399
express	node.js
i am using node.js with express and ejs as template engine

i am trying to rename a folder the folder was created by requesting a user input and sub folder created within to rename the parent directory asset_name i am using filedialog.askdirectory but i keep getting stuck with the error

19792582
getter	setter
every public getter setter pair and every public field will be automatically bound to xml unless annotated by xmltransient

19792582
getter	setter
so my question is how can i tell jaxb to ignore the field and just use the getter setter

19792589
free	malloc
otherwise if you are not sure about the life time of the variable it can be allocated on the heap using malloc free or new delete

19792601
submit	submission
when submission with regular form everything works fine but i need to submit it with ajax

19792612
flip	slide
many view transition like slide pop and flip have been animated using javascript but i found none for this drawer effect

i have an expensive for-loop that is taking more time than it should due to dynamic casting overhead inside loops

19792672
int	chars
smart_pointer_impl.cpp in function â int main int chars â

19792712
pthreads	fork
for the full details see the pthreads specification of fork

19792720
min	max
use a loop to loop through the array starting with element zero and ending with element 4 and another loop to display 5 digits max - min + 1

19792778
button	checkbox
another common workaround would be to use hidden inputs to maintain actual values and use checkbox radio button to just manipulate the value of the corresponding hidden inputs

19792794
min	max
loop from min value to max value and put all the numbers in an array

19792794
min	max
now loop again from min value to max value

19792808
integer	unsigned
if you have the address in the form of a pointer you need to cast the pointer to an appropriate unsigned integer type

19792840
calloc	malloc
when calling malloc or calloc or indeed any alloc function you re claiming a chunk of memory the size of which is defined by the arguments passed to the allocating function

19792840

google-chrome	firefox
but for some reason firefox and google-chrome still showing code 0

19792992
oncreate	onstart
please make sure an activity starts from oncreate method then onstart is called by system

19792992
oncreate	onstart
if you override onstart method then your overridden method will be also called after oncreate method

19793055
min	max
then i just added a check for it when calculating x y max min and that gave the same problem

19793081
stdout	stderr
in order to do this one must detach stdin stdout and stderr

19793130
operands	decrement
the value of the expression differs between pre and post increment decrement even though both change the operands

19793160
vert.x	netty
only play finagle vert.x and pure netty regardless of nio support a different shared threading model and thus have different mechanisms for doing concurrency

19793193
min	max
i also think that the ability to work in registers of sse also using some min max instructions or even some relatively large register set in risc architecture will provide noticeable performance advantage compared to well known sorting methods such as quicksort due to absence of pointer arithmetic and other overhead

19793193
int	double
when the input values are known to be positive ieee-754 floats or double it s also worth to mention that the comparison can also be performed as int

19793196
mouse	keyboard
it is also important to note that the target pc has no keyboard or mouse only a touchscreen interface

19793245
google-chrome	firefox
please test demo with both google-chrome and firefox

19793256
oncreate	recreate
for the users that are upgrading method onupgrade will be executed and drop table if exist is a clean start - just in case the structure of the old and the new table is different - drop it and then recreate it in oncreate method

19793275
min	max
to imitate this you can put all the numbers from min to max in a data structure like linkedlist or arraydeque where you can easily add remove items from both ends then you d print the contents in order and shift the first entry to the end

19793275
min	max
if you repeat that process max - min + 1 times you should get the desired output

19793286
postorder	inorder
this is a rather simple question i ve noticed that when i representate a tree no matter which way i do it postorder inorder pre-order the leafs always come up in the same order left to right

19793387
matplotlib	scipy
since most people coming to python from matlab will be making use of lots of scipy numpy and matplotlib functions i would think that the rectangleselector function of matplotlib would be the closest equivalent to the imrect function in matlab

19793392
mouse	keyboard
when the window is created the first click into window make focus on embedded terminal - everything ok but when i click into the window second time the terminal seems to loose the focus though normal keyboard and mouse input is still working

19793406
google-chrome	firefox
this following code does not work as of right now november 11 2013 at 10 26 pm cdt when running it in firefox or google-chrome

19793470
versioning	upgrade
example if your app has been upgrade quite a lot of times and table structure have change enough times then its better to drop table and re-create it rather than writing code for changing structure for every versioning of db in this approach you will have to make sure that you can backup any data that you have on server side so that things remain ok

19793485
rdf	owl
owl is not the same as rdf but owl can be serialized in rdf

19793485
rdf	owl
it appears that you ve already serialized your owl in rdf

19793525
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
but memory on the heap such as that created using malloc calloc or even fopen allocate memory resources that will not be made available to any other purpose until you explicity free them using free or fclose

19793576
uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol
i have a uisegmentedcontrol that is being displayed within my uinavigationbar on an iphone app running ios 7

post	get
when retrieving the post object through wp_query i am able to return the post object id but need to get the text value of the object the title of the custom post type

19793948
min	max
they allow for the formatting of numeric values with user-defined min and max and the ability to format with symbols one for floating-point numbers one for integers

19793972
firefox	safari
ever since upgrading to mavericks an applet we have at work has stopped being able to browse for files if used from safari still works on firefox

19794050
post	get
this all is a part of moderator s interface so i use authorization for all kinds of requests get post patch etc.

19794211
width	height
what is happening now is the table cells are accommodating the cells contents by automatically adjusting the height of the cell and maintaining a fixed table width

19794300
folder	directory
i want to create a directory at run time on server and after that i want to save my image in that folder

19794327
x86	64bit
i am assuming that my ie is 64bit because in the start menu the program is under c program files -- not c program files x86 like some of my other programs. it would crash on the line

19794346
maven	pom.xml
to do so from the package explorer you would right click on either the maven project or the pom.xml in the maven project highlight run as then click maven install

19794396
google-chrome	firefox
ie 10 google-chrome and firefox apply the shadow to the select box

19794425
integer	unsigned
change return type to unsigned long long to insure you have a large enough integer

19794468
ant	maven
most methods of running sonar runner ant plugin maven plugin will always contact the sonar server and attempt to upload analysis results

19794539
memcached	apc
server real time visitors 100+ i use apc memcached and magento performance looks good

19794564
nsstring	nsdata
thus to convert nsdata to nsstring base 64 representation you can use base64encodedstringwithoptions

19794564
nsstring	nsdata
and to convert base 64 nsstring back to nsdata you can use initwithbase64encodedstring

19794570
google-chrome	firefox
it is working in firefox and google-chrome

19794570
google-chrome	firefox
it is working but not in firefox nor google-chrome

19794589
versioning	upgrade
since the upgrade to the versioning cited above i cannot have a succesfull build using the following command

19794590
post	get
so in theory whether you use https post or get for sending your data are safe... in one case attacker will have to decript your header and in other your body

19794597
x86	64bit
for example a compiler generating code for x86 may choose to use x87 floating point instructions that use 80bit floating point arithmetic while the compiler itself uses standard 64bit floating point arithmetic to compute compile-time constants

19794753
rvm	bundler
we use rvm bundler rails

19794754
for-loop	arrays
the result being an arrays you can use a for-loop to iterate and log compare each value

19794789
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
ideally i d like all mobile devices smartphones and tablets to display the mobile version of the website and be given the option to view the desktop version via a user agent switch which i know google-chrome firefox and opera on android offer at the very least

19794838
hex	binary
there are several common ways to represent arbitrary binary data as a string such as hex encoding and base64 encoding

19794909
subtract	add
now we need to subtract y and add 2

19794933
submit	submission
the normal behaviour of the button will continue and it will submit the form using the standard html for form submission instead of the js

19794940
heapsort	shellsort
so i need everybody help me write 5 sorts insertion sort binary insertion sort shaker sort heapsort shellsort

19794949
google-chrome	firefox
copy and paste the link into another browser than the link was generated from google-chrome instead of firefox

19795015
int	double
you could create a class that defines the same operations as an int or a double which wraps the int or double

19795015
int	double
it will be much slower than a simple int or double

19795015
int	double
in your code you would then use this new class everywhere there is an int or double respectively

19795046
folder	dir
since i couldn t come up with a bash script that ignores files that were already matched i created a separate imap folder for filing the filer dir

19795053
getter	setter
i would get rid of elem field and all related getter setter

19795058
hide	show
a better approach might be to create duplicate elements and show hide with media queries

19795135
width	height
when i call the method it makes the picture garbled but the width and height of the picture is switched swapped

19795136
screens	tablet
that is obviously oversimplified you can set it to whatever sizes you want and have multiple versions tablet giant screens etc.

19795171
folder	directory
when i run npm install from my project directory it works fine and installs the following required modules into the node_modules folder in my project directory

19795171
folder	directory
i ve seen that you can install modules either locally or globally so i m hoping to just be able to install the modules globally on the build server so that they do not need to be in the node_modules folder directly inside the project directory before running grunt deploy

19795171
folder	directory
if i do npm prefix -g it shows me that the global module directory is c users my user appdata roaming npm and when i look in that directory s node_modules folder i do see all of the modules

19795214
google-chrome	firefox
firefox is rather similar to google-chrome for this

19795243
post	get
and get in on the post method

19795250
client-side	server-side
the final server-side url is and the client-side url is still

19795257
hide	show
if i understand your intents correctly you probably want to toggle the hide and show then you should be able to do it like this

19795265
put	get
i want to get data from user in a for-loop and put that data in matrix

19795293
division	modulo
this requires appropriate division and modulo arithmetic

19795317
toggleclass	slidetoggle
if there is a reason that you can t use isherwood s slidetoggle suggestion like other things are tied to the classes or something then you would use the toggleclass

19795328
getter	setter
say you re writing both a custom getter and setter but want an instance variable to back it

19795328
getter	setter
for an atomic property this is as simple as wanting a custom setter the compiler will write a getter if you specify a setter for a monatomic property but not an atomic property.

19795328
getter	setter
you ve specified both a getter or setter so xcode correctly doesn t create a backing instance variable for it

19795328
getter	setter
in other words although synthesize is for practical purposes never necessary it can be used to define property-backing instance variables when you re providing a getter setter

19795339
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested in google-chrome and firefox both work

19795351
onresume	onpause
in most activities you will find that you will need to put code in onresume and onpause

19795369
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton	uicontrol	uibutton	uicontrol	uigesturerecognizer
it supports uicontrol uibutton uibutton and uigesturerecognizer

19795396
folder	directory
i m trying to display a list of all folder inside of a directory

19795405
dictionary	map
you could use a dictionary instead of a map

19795423
getter	setter
if you overwrite but the setter and the getter method then you will need to synthesise the ivar

19795423
getter	setter
you are fine if you just override the setter or if you just override the getter

19795436
post	get
get or post which data ...

19795450
jar	war
as far as i know this plugins read the pom file and based on them build the jar war and ear files

19795450
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
another way to build the ear file is using the m2e plugin right click on the parent pom.xml file and choose maven install then start the application server and use the wls deploy in order to deploy the ear file

19795450
maven	m2e
as far as i ve seen i can only add those artifacts to server which are built using the wtp plugin and not the artifacts that are built using maven command of m2e plugin

19795450
maven	m2e

laravel and slim are both imho better suited to this task at least out of the box

19798624
codeigniter	slim	laravel	codeigniter	laravel	slim
if you re building just an api and no other content then i would probably go with slim because laravel and codeigniter offer a lot of stuff that you don t need if you re just building an api

19798624
laravel	codeigniter
if you are building a full-blown web app that has an api i d go for laravel because it s easy to build an api with yet also has similar functionality to codeigniter

subscript	superscript
this can be accomplished with just words in the cells if you highlight the left word superscript in then subscript the right word and add the slash border like so

19798964
subscript	superscript
i don t think its possible through the text or similar functions i d love to be proven wrong so i ve resorted to vba which looks to be a dead end so far as well since it either sets the property to superscript or subscript but not both it ignores the subscript in the following code

19798964
subscript	superscript
i guess the root of the question is how can the cell have separate superscript subscript properties set through the format cell gui but not through vba

it is technically possible to accomplish what you are trying to do by adding one or more ec2 instances into the mix running a web server with rewrite and proxy functionality like haproxy varnish nginx or apache to rewrite each incoming hostname url to a different one including substituting elements of the path and fetch it from a back-end server which in this case would be s3 .

19802780
min	max
i have two methods to get min and max height of a binary tree in java

your user would not have a many-to-many relationship directly with your role objects instead you can have a one-to-many relationship between the user and a userrole class

19802867
min	max
you could always have two properties on each node showing the min and max height of the node

19802914

imperative	declarative
it s declarative instead of imperative and has a fairly steep learning curve

19803361
floating-point	integer
first is an integer operator so you can t use it on floating-point types

19803361
int	double
second you declared value as double but then read it as an int

19803371
put	get
if you want to print all three items as you get them you need to put the printing inside the loop

19803390
qevent	qobject
you ll need to create a class with eventfilter qobject sender qevent event as a member

19803462
integer	radix
i am writing an integer to string conversion function that accepts an integer value radix for an argument

19803462
int	chars
the valid range of the int argument radix is extremely small 2-36 smaller than the maximum size of a chars

19803462
int	chars
so i want to declare the argument as a chars but i have to multiply a long long int by said argument and i am wondering how exactly that works

19803462
int	chars
so my question is what happens when i multiply a long long int by a chars in regards to the calculation itself

19803462
int	chars	unsigned	short
also the function writes a small amount of data that is less than the maximum size of an unsigned chars at worst case so i want to use a short int to index it because when i try to dereference a pointer using a chars i get a warning

19803462
int	chars
so my question is why can pointers not be dereferenced by a chars and does using an short int for an index add anything to the dereferencing process or the calculation process when i increase or decrease the index s value by 1

19803481
for-loop	loops
your draw loops is inside of your for-loop

19803519

versioning	upgrade
i have to upgrade them because the original versioning of xcode complains of the failure that it can not compile and debug on ios7.0 ..

19803532
width	height
so of course i can create the box by explicitly giving the div a width and height property

19803532
width	height
i can also set the height and div using jquery by finding the height width of the document window and doing the size from there

19803532
width	height
last ditch i guess i could set the width and height of them for all the different screen resolutions

19803537
versioning	upgrade
then whenever you upgrade the versioning number the database will be deleted and re-created

post	get
when you are trying to find the lastrow using always use the method as mentioned in this post else you will get an error if the worksheet is blank

19817406
mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseover	mouseout	mouseup	mousedown	mouseout	mouseup	mouseout	mousedown
you may detect that focus via mouseover mouseout so the console stops updating when you hover it or on mousedown mouseup which isn t that usable since you have hardly time to press cmd + c to save your selection

19817406
setinterval	settimeout
tymejv suggestion to use settimeout instead of setinterval is a good one though

19817418
width	margin
so you have to define a width for the margin auto

19817437
configure	libtool
the . configure is ok but the make just hang at libtool

19817502
hide	show
use hide and show

19817509
width	height
you can create the image object that will append to the preview and find it s size width and height all in the same function

19817511
inherited	subclassing
i would like to mock its base class so that i can nicely play with the method defined in the subclassing but in the moment i inherited from a mocked class the object itself turns a mock and loses all its methods

19817542
getter	setter
i am not familiar with badgerfish having said that in your listwrapper try to change to and of course matching getter setter and see if that will work

19817573
contour	imshow
if you re going to use update_normal to update the colorbar it expects a scalarmappable an image created by imshow the collection that scatter creates the contourset that contour creates etc to be passed in

19817632
disk	ram
assuming you re running the exact same code using a vm adds latency to the entire stack cpu ram disk

19817646
portrait	landscape
push view controller on to stack that supports landscape and portrait

19817646
portrait	landscape
in my info.plist i support portrait and landscape

19817665
gridview	linqdatasource
a linqdatasource is bound to a gridview and or webdatagrid based on other controls on the page

primefaces	omnifaces
i am using primefaces 3.5 and omnifaces version 1.5

19817719
fadein	fadeout
you can do this during jquery animation functions such as fadein fadeout slideup etc

19817761
post	get
in your html provide links or forms to get post etc

19817761
submit	submission
you could also create an ajax solution to listen for form submission and submit the post in the background wait for a response and update the page accordingly

19817789
for-loop	arrays
i would know how insert an arrays in an if of a for-loop nested in another for-loop

19817843
maven	pom.xml
to get a maven project with pom.xml packaging deployed you have to do the normal steps of adding the distributionmanagment to the pom.xml and the credentials to the settings.xml

19817872
getter	setter
dynamic doesn t actually generate setter and getter for a method it just tells the compiler that something will

19817872
getter	setter
so i think nsmanagedobject only generates standard named setter and getter

19817873
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf if not already enabled and then put this code in your document_root .htaccess

19817904
width	height
the width 40 and the height 400 are the width and height of the cell you are creating not the location on the pdf

19817927
min	max
if you have specified the height you can omit declaration for min and max height

19817966
post	get	submit	submission
i have managed to get on to the ip camera server url and post data to the phone by submission a simple html form but i do not know how to pass data to that form and submit it through c++ nor do i know if this is even a good method of doing this

19818009
range	max	range	min	min	max
in my case i had percentage data currently going into the 20 s but i wanted a range of 0 to at least 100 with the possibility to go over 100 if required so the following sets min max in the code then if datamax turns out to be higher reassigns max up to it s value

19818025
instances	transient
org.hibernate.transientobjectexception object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing containerentity.binary - binary

19818026
width	font-size
the point becomes moot if the container is always set to let s say 200px wide--then just set a font-size that works for that width

19818026
width	font-size
if the div was switched to 25 width by either media or javascript then at the same time the font-size would need to adjust in either the media query or by javascript to the new calculation of

19818026
width	font-size
of course a minor adjustment of width for margins may not be enough to warrant any change in font-size so it may not matter

19818173
prepare	execute
just get the stub generated with wsdl2java prepare the response as pojo and execute method on the stub

19818182
google-chrome	firefox
anyway this works as expected on firefox but google-chrome bails out with the following error

the user inserts the shortcode with an id of woocommerce products category and after updating the page the user can see a table with a list of product s names and prices

19818414
post	get
when you post json application json to php it doesn t automaticaly get parsed unlike the traditional encoding application x-www-form-urlencoded

19818414

- php input is a special filename for the raw data that has been submitted by post put whatever regardless of the encoding used

19818443
httprequest	httpresponse
i m trying to crawl a web but can t get past the login using the .net httprequest and httpresponse classes

19818537
sortedmap	sortedset
note care should be exercised if bigdecimal objects are used as keys in a sortedmap or elements in a sortedset since bigdecimal s natural ordering is inconsistent with equals

19818537
equals	compareto
for example if you create a hashset and add new bigdecimal 1.0 and new bigdecimal 1.00 to it the set will contain two elements because the values have different scales so are non-equal according to equals and hashcode but if you do the same thing with a treeset the set will contain only one element because the values compare as equals when you use compareto

19818564
uncaughtexceptionhandler	runnable
when an exception occurs in an executorservice from a callable or runnable the exception is swallowed unless a uncaughtexceptionhandler is set

19818587

on the device it fails in dbenv open chars const unsigned int int with this message

19818605
public	protected
you can even decide if the using -declaration for mytype should go into the public protected or private section

19818606
skemitternode	skscene
in any case i m going to assume that the skemitternode is presented on the skscene that s the only way i know how to get your desired effect

19818631
post	get
i have a try catch block on my get and post operation to caught the timeoutexceptions as

19818643
equals	compareto
test imposed by compareto in place of equals

19818679
submit	submission
second and this is just preference but if all you are doing in your submithandler is submission the form you don t need to have it at all - just get rid of that option and it will automatically submit

19818724
stdout	stderr
as per python usually the problem is that python by default buffers stderr and stdout even if you explicitly .flush it from the code

19818733
rss	feed
i have created a username and password on my site for them to access and also a simple rss feed web app to view it from their phones but i need it to not be searchable on search engines

19818733
rss	feed
i have installed wordpress access areas but if i set the view post to logged in users the post disappears from the rss feed

19818754
qdialog	qobject
i suspected that may be caused by multiple inheritance of qobject by mydialog once via qdialog and once via mylistener

19818759
preferenceactivity	listpreference
i m trying a really simple preferenceactivity and it s working fine with edittextpreference but it always throws this error when i add a listpreference line 16 is the listpreference line

19818816
int	chars
edit your method returns -1 as your charat 0 is a single chars and not an int

19818816
int	chars
check whether and not as the second compares your chars to an int

19818826
minimum	max
2 than access the first index ary 0 for minimum value or ary ary.length-1 or max value

but entry- d_name isn t storing any of the file names from the directory and home xxx documents enron_mail_20110402 maildir allen-p all_documents folder contain files of plain text document type namely

19818923
hide	show
use class name instead and you can hide and show all buttons using the class name

19818995
for-loop	loops
in loops the iterator used by the for-loop looks at and you d move 3 to the end of the list by appending and removing

19819020
unix	solaris
i am trying to get a unix solaris and linux thread dump on a java application

19819025
serializable	deserialization
the serializable deserialization burden is pushed to the client and all data is sent over the wire

19819053
for-loop	arrays
the nested for-loop also iterates over 10 elements but its value is never used to calculate an index in the arrays

19819092
google-chrome	firefox
now it works in google-chrome and firefox but doesn t seem to work in ie10 but i did put the -ms- version there

19819202
webclient	httpwebrequest
i know if we create a virtual directory then we can definitely download the file using webclient or httpwebrequest class

19819236
folder	directory
this works however when i explicitly input the directory slash to the url it accesses the folder

19819308
clang	icc
to add to the list it does compile with clang 3.3 and icc 13.1.3

19819340
spaces	delimiter
its really interesting to see that when we specify empty spaces as a delimiter in the code

19819362
post	get
i have seen some of the post regarding this question for mvc but for the life of me cannot get it to work for standard web forms

19819406
typedef	struct
i have a struct basestorage that stores various run-time data and a struct basestatic that holds a basestorage or derived typedef and static data that doesn t get changed and is read from multiple instances of a struct holder

19819427
int	chars
let k be the smallest nonnegative int such that the chars at position k within px is different from the chars at position k within py.

19819427
int	chars
let m be the int that is the code unit value for the chars at position k within px

19819427
int	chars
let n be the int that is the code unit value for the chars at position k within py

19819481
switching	screens
than i turn my activity to background switching to home screens or similar

19819508
opcache	apc
also enable apc or any other opcache even with the default settings it can greatly improve drupal s performances

19819548
xsl-fo	xslt
the font properties for xsl-fo that you mention are xslt parameters

19819618
width	height
now if it is point 0.25 0.75 it will be positioned at 25 of the container width and 75 of the container height

19819624
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
in c you do not need to cast the results of malloc calloc realloc so you can re-write that line like this

19819656
post	get
so i ve made this post as a last resort to get someone to check it manually

19819671
folder	directory
had to delete the bin and objects folder from the output directory

19819674
opera	google-chrome
on other hand when i test this code in opera it works but it google-chrome it says upload aborted .

19819729
updatepanel	scriptmanager
for example if the linkbutton in an updatepanel and you are using a scriptmanager the static function scriptmanager.registerclientscriptblock would probably work well

19819746
post	get
i get a 400 everytime i try to post

19819756
passenger	thin
so after dealing with this i ended up scraping passenger and moving to thin

19819796
width	height
there is a setbounds x y width height method to the container class

19819815
put	get
normally your list s size is the number of elements you put into it so it won t get fixed this way

19819832
highcharts	highstock
for highstock highcharts

19819854
connect	geddy
the previous answer is basically correct but the real answer is that geddy pre-dates connect

19819873
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop only print the first 11 posts from the arrays

19819883
int	chars
x## represents a single byte or chars if you will whereas ff is a string of two chars that can then be processed with int my_string 16 but when you have a single chars you probably want ord

19819884
dns	spf
additionally using smtp relies on known-good dns spf settings of a known-working mail server - might not be the case on individual app servers that you use

19819898
spaces	delimiter
the order needs to match and they should be in the format first second i.e the delimiter is a comma followed by a spaces character

19819905
sorting	filtering
this is a fleeting thought i just had...you can save state of length filtering pagination and sorting by using bstatesave

19819950
connect	geddy
yes there is a connect compatibility mode set connectcompatibility true in your app config which causes geddy s before-filters to behave like middleware -- but it s not well tested

19819950
connect	geddy
geddy s baked-in auth geddy-passport uses passport which is structured as connect middleware so even without this compat-mode middleware can be made to work with a little bit of effort

19819999
pop-up	dialog
the pop-up could also be a custom dialog or just a div on top the main layout or whatever

19820029
jar	war
i want to create a war file instead of a self running jar containing a servlet and deploy that war file

19820029
jar	war
converting a spring boot jar application to a war

19820036
width	margin
alternatively you can set a defined width on the parent and use margin 0px auto assuming it is a block level element

19820050
put	get
notice the last instance if we put in the instance head it becomes more specific than the other instance and would get matched first so we instead use the type equality assertion from typefamilies

19820062
width	height
you ll need to get the current height and width and compare it to the previous height and width in order to determine the scale factor

19820071
integer	unsigned
the value 4014109449 happens to be representable as a 32-bit unsigned integer but not as a 32-bit signed integer

19820098
stdout	stderr
your best bet is to provide your own variant of popen that includes support for both stdout and stderr and if you search for popen source i m sure you ll have a good starting point

19820125
equals	compareto
in this case compareto precision evaluates true and equals evaluates false

19820125
equals	compareto
so compareto compares bigdecimals as numbers and equals compares bigdecimals as bigdecimals

19820133
infobox	infowindow
i have tried using the infowindow instead of the infobox and so far is working fine

19820212
accessor	properties
make sure that public instance properties have get and set accessor

19820251
loops	while-loop
and in my game update loops i ve wanted to use this instead of having to make a single while-loop

19820256
range	min
on the other hand we can see the argument to the min is understood as array in the range i4 m4

19820362
width	height
to find current height and width of the windows try this code

19820402
hive	hdfs
if you are not into writing mapreduce jobs you can probably rig something combining hive ctas create table as select and hdfs operations

19820406
width	height
assuming that your table covers all deliverable type height width border combinations try five columns six if you want an id

19820408
post	get
i have read some other so post about directives as well as have read the angular directive guide but can t seem to get past this basic issue

19820426
subtraction	addition
if we could always keep the same number of decimal places then with addition and subtraction at least we d be fine so long as the values didn t overflow

19820479
post	get
to get the type use instanceof for an example have a look at this recent post

19820493
war	manifest.mf
this causes the generated war file to have a meta-inf manifest.mf file with classpath entries that look like - that is the relative path from the war to the ear s library folder

19820518
elasticsearch	kibana
for instance have a look at the elasticsearch logstash kibana triplet

19820525
width	height
because jlist has an implemented function getpreferredscrollableviewportsize which computes preferable viewport size by computing cell width and cell height it contains

19820589
min	max
most layout managers use the preferred size to determine the optimal size and then use min max to handle resizing if the frame is ever resized

19820681
put	get
currently there isn t a problem with memory usage but as we get more and more traffic it will put more strain on the servers

19820683
width	height
i am implementing dfs and bfs to solve this maze with starting from 1 1 and ending in width - 1 height - 1

19820691
qlistwidget	qtreewidget
it sounds like what you want is a qlistwidget with multiple columns - and a qtreewidget can be adapted to do exactly that

19820698
min	max
the code will first walk through the points to find the max min endpoints to form a bounding box

19820725
cpython	ironpython
now with regard to ironpython not complaining in case a perhaps it handles the method resolution slightly differently from the way cpython does

19820725
cpython	ironpython
i am not sure the cpython behavior here with respect to old-style classes is canonical or even documented so ironpython may not actually be wrong

19820727
sublimetext	textwrangler
if anyone has used xcode sublimetext textwrangler eclipse netbeans etc they probably know this behaviour but iâ m looking for a way to set up phpstorm so that when i press tab it moves to the appropriate indention point

google-chrome	safari
if you re running it locally google-chrome safari will block .load requests from the local filesystem

for-loop	arrays
now the problem i am having is that one this model is called in side a for-loop thus i can get back many of these arrays each of these arrays is tied to a different user and two each arrays can have more then two arrays inside of it in fact some of the arrays that come back can have up to 40

19820845
google-chrome	firefox
so i m designing and build a website for school as part of a project on this page there are 3 images which in internet explorer and firefox seem perfectly fine but when in google-chrome when ever you re-size the browser they seem squashed

19820855
filtering	grouping
i did a little search and we can use the filtering like objectclass grouping memberof 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941 path_to_group1 to get the child grouping of the grouping but i want to know if there is a way to get parent grouping from child grouping

19820941
inherited	properties
i made my viewmodel inherited inotifypropertychanged and added the same observablecollection properties that my damageditemviewmodel contained

19820954
width	height
you have width and height attributes on the img tag that are not the same ratio as the original image and that is what is squishing the image

19821051
children	parent
add overflow hidden to #page_content thus forcing the parent to contain the children elements

19821124
hide	show
the reason why i want to hide it is because of the status bar the playlist and clip info is being show which generates an unwanted additional frame around the video

19821127
spaces	delimiter
to eliminate the need of delimiter commas and thus saves more spaces i tried to use only one alphanumerical character to denote delta values of 0 to 35 using 0 to y while leaving letter z as 35 plus the next character

19821128
division	multiplication
don t think of it as division multiplication - think of it as bitwise shift which s actually stands for

19821155
filtering	grouping
that means that you can remove a grouping from a filtering chain as a unit change targets etc

19821155
filtering	grouping
filtering grouping subclasses can package commonly used filtering chains into reusable units with relevant exposed properties for tweaking

19821155
filtering	grouping
you don t need to know about any of that to use this as a distinct filtering because that s abstracted away within the grouping

19821158
google-chrome	firefox
css really needlessly fails at vertical centering c mon guys but i found a solution that works in ie10 and google-chrome and it actually works in firefox too but firefox pushes the div down below the container

19821158
google-chrome	firefox
view on google-chrome then firefox

19821177
16-bit	64bit
just to confuse matters for backwards compatibility microsoft windows api defines a word as being 16-bit a dword as 32 bits and a qword as 64bit regardless of the processor

19821201
boost	allocator
also boost already provides pool which allows you to do pool allocator you could possibly use the singleton pool and use a fixed size custom allocator

19821201
calloc	malloc
furthermore you replaced malloc with calloc use a separate object like an allocator that holds the memory of all of your instances of the same size

19821234
int	double
i am having trouble in ply lex with int and double using the following program

19821254

19821309
jar	war
a war is just a jar with special properites

width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i guess it may sound stupid or lazy but i m doing a lot of css lately and that simple fact of having to type px right after every single width or height or margin and so on is drivin me nuts

19821429
children	parent
additionally in your deeper routes if their models are just children of the parent routes just use modelfor to get the parent model and filter out the appropriate item

19821475
post	get
so here i am implementing my very first ever api call and instead of re-directing back to my site to look at the post or get response nvp data i get a long response string on the paypal api page.

19821494
post	get
in jsfiddle as you can see when you start to scroll the text animates i did get this from stackoverflow but lost the link so thanks to the people who contributed to the first post what i would like is for the text to animate back to its original state when the content once again reaches the top

so i have a uiview with multiple subviews that i want to resize when the device ipad is rotated and i m trying to use the autoresizingmask but i don t think i m going about it the right way as it doesn t appear to be doing anything

19821780
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade my app s database from one versioning to another i execute the following commands

19821816
getter	setter
readwrite property with custom getter and setter

19821816
getter	setter
when providing both a getter and setter custom implementation the property won t be automatically synthesized

19821816
accessor	properties
except for the last three cases the general philosophy is that whenever you manually specify all the information about a properties by implementing all the accessor methods or using dynamic the compiler will assume you want full control over the properties and it will disable the autosynthesis on it

19821836
opera	google-chrome	webkit	blink
blink is just a fork of webkit in any case so even if prefixes were not being phased out newer versions of google-chrome and opera would still use the -webkit- prefix anyway

19821844
put	get
the idea is to get data input from user a string convert it to binary form then calculate checksum and put it in my data packet

19821846
int	chars
all examples i found are of either int or chars

19821846
strcpy	strcmp
now the error im getting is that strcmp and strcpy are not declared

19821862
subtract	add
i have a form whose purpose is to let a user add edit subtract and reorder songs

19821862
subtract	add
javascript dom manipulation lets users add subtract and reorder songs fields

19821880
put	get
for matthew s solution you probably need to put this in the loop to wait for all the values being set in order to get the correct result

19821881
profiling	benchmarking
as always with any optimization issue you should profiling first to find where your program is spending most of its time and benchmarking changes in code appropriately

is parsley listening specifically to the input type submit element rather than the submission of the form itself

19821978
int	chars
lines breaks up a string into a list based on the location of newline chars then words is mapped over the list to break each line of int into separate int based on the location of spaces str2int transforms each string representing an int to an actual int type and finally transpose like a typical matrix transpose exchanges all the rows and columns of the resultant int matrix

19821980
superclass	subclassing
my plan was to have the abstract superclass define an beforeclass method that calls into an abstract setup method that each subclassing would be forced to define but this fails as the beforeclass methods must be static and static methods cannot be made abstract nor can they call instance methods

19822004
onchange	onkeyup
use onkeyup instead of onchange for calling passcheck

19822017
width	height
to achieve the effect you wish i believe the primary problem in your own code was that you did not specify a width and height

19822058
width	height
the width should be the total width of all the columns and the height the height of all the rows plus the size of the headers

19822138

19822330
hide	show
however if i hide the div tags i cannot get them to show again

19822330
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
the code runs fine when using ie however it wont run in google-chrome or opera haven t tried firefox

19822342
for-loop	arrays
the intention was that the for-loop would draw out an arrays of bars onto a bar chart given different heights apologies for the poor formatting

19822366
versioning	upgrade
other option might ve been downgrading to python 2.6 but judging from python and windows versioning it seems you ll choose to upgrade

19822420
flying-saucer	itext
i have html css used to build my itext flying-saucer page set up like the following.

19822433
x86	64bit
the processors of the two machines are the same 64bit and i have my project build property set to x86

19822452
crypt	md5
you could also add double md5 or double crypt for password to be really secure

19822480
propertychangelistener	documentlistener
maybe to use documentlistener for jtextcomponent s instead of propertychangelistener depends on if you want to listening for all changes or final result is important only

19822532
subtract	add
everytime the right arrow is clicked i want to add 323 to the left position and when left arrow is clicked subtract 323 from position

here s what i ve done in the past for a scenario similar to yours there is bottom-positioned uitoolbar having a uitextfield in a customview bar button item for input

19822653
uitextfield	uitoolbar
the itextfield has a custom inputaccessoryview set which is another uitoolbar with another uitextfield

19822653
hide	show
this final approach listens for the keyboard to show hide and uses a cadisplaylink to synchronize animating the toolbar textfield as it detects changes in the keyboard position in real time

19822661
disk	ram
of course you ll have to re-install the game to the ram disk every time you restart your computer

19822661
disk	ram
some ram disk software will save the contents to disk for you however

19822670
implicit	shapeless
i want to notice that object types and number of objects r unknown so we cant use lots of implicit for native shapeless hmap

19822670
implicit	shapeless
i meant that we have no possibility to write manually all implicit type convertions for shapeless hmap

19822683
stdout	stderr
this way you can verify the subprocess state implicitly by checking its other outputs if any hopefully exist for it for example you may as well read subprocess output if you know it writes its errors or other messages to stdout or stderr

19822707
hide	show
jquery toggle takes a boolean for show or hide

19822734
public	protected
the key to this whole thing is to be able to create a workflow that assures the client that as long as the link doesn t get out into the public their content is protected. or at least as protected as unprotected content can be

19822748
express	node.js
i m using express mvc in node.js

19822775
junit	testng
you can read about the differences between the 2 frameworks here and it looks like they also have support for migrating junit tests to testng

19822792
oncreate	findviewbyid
then in oncreate method the gridview is captured from the layout with findviewbyid int

19822839
post	put
you re really dealing with two different representations of the resource one for what the client can send via post put and one for what the server can return

19822853
tablet	mdpi
device 10.1 wgxa tablet 1280 x 800 mdpi

19822853
disk	ram
if i look in task manager it is using 15 cpu 470mb ram and 0mb disk speed

19822887
put	get
i can t put the new calcs in the data store and i don t want to include class a inside class b just to get one piece of data with a getter

19822893
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
also i read somewhere amazon-web-services forum i believe that if you update the env in the elastic beanstalk gui interface that those values will take precedence over anything you put in the source code

19822907
typedef	typename
you have an error in your typedef concrete instance because concrete typename is used while instantiating middle

19822918
postgresql	mysql
if all your data fits in a relational database like postgresql or mysql on a single machine and you are happy with the performance then keep using that

19822918
hive	hdfs
at the moment using presto requires setting up hdfs and hive even on a single machine so getting started will be more work than if you already have an existing hive installation

19822930
int	double
the result is that 2 double are passed and these typically 2 8 bytes are received at the function and expected to be typically 2 4 bytes of int

19822949
perceptron	sigmoid
one option is to use a multilayer perceptron since it does not require binary target values and can easily handle target values constrained to the range 0 1 when using a sigmoid or tanh activation function

19822976
folder	directory
this warn appears because you run sbt from the directory that contains the .sbt folder that in your case is home alex .sbt

19822995
rdf	owl
imagine you are querying a data source via an sparql endpoint and you want to know if the underlying representation of this data source is owl or rdf xml

with a single click on load button in figure 2 as expected the view turns into figure 3 and if it is clicked again the forms for selected checkbox are loaded and it remains as in figure 3

19823262
kde	gnome
note that i can start other window managers gnome kde openbox xfce4 etc

19823297
hide	show
i would use label with hidden checkbox and use the active state to show hide a div under

19823311
versioning	upgrade
the obvious solution would be to upgrade your jzmq versioning or in this case storm versioning

19823327
hide	show
i ve done a debugging walkthrough it even reaches the parts necessary to show and hide

19823332
gridview	detailsview
i want it so that when you select the record in the gridview it shows the data in the detailsview

19823340
free	malloc
if you used one malloc to allocate the array one free is sufficient

19823340
free	malloc
rule of the thumb every malloc requires a free

19823341
fflush	gets
close fw1 prior to exiting the program or it gets removed from memory before the content of the buffer is fflush

19823353
width	height
the problem lies in the fact that the whole width of the page is clickable at the height of the button and not only the button itself that is 150px wide and is centered on the page

19823427
int	double
also size could be declared as int altogether and avoid that cast and save some extremely slight memory you re not using it as a double anywhere

19823463
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this happens in google-chrome and firefox but not in opera because of the rendering of the element

19823483
pubnub	pusher
we are considering switching the solution to something more real time maybe using pubnub or pusher

19823553

fasta	blast
i am processing a large blast file together with a large fasta file and i need to load several lines of fasta for one block of blast let s say it is one line

19823621
fasta	blast
i would expect that in the second loop line of blast it will continue on the next line from the last-processed fasta line but it is loading all the same fasta lines

19823627
int	double
when used in braces it s treated as int and results into 1 while in the other example 4 gets multiplied to a double value to result into double and then getting ddivided by 3 which results as 1.333333

19823681
versioning	upgrade
versioning 2.1 is released so now u can upgrade your libraries and use comments in your code

19823738
fast-forward	merge
that merge shouldn t break anything because it should be a fast-forward merge all the commits on master are on the release branch

19823741
devise	rolify	devise	cancan	rolify	cancan
i have a site with users devise rolify cancan with recipes and with comments for recipes

19823748
width	height
here i calculate the rectangles width and height

19823748
width	height
if the starting point coordinates are smaller than ending ones everything works just fine but when the ending coordinates are smaller than starting ones the width or height or both values are negative..

19823757
fasta	blast
as it is your first blast line would get the first set of fasta lines the second blast line would get the first and second sets etc etc

19823784
fast-forward	merge
if your merge into master branch isn t fast-forward it means that it can result in new untested code

19823810
post	get
so pumping all your get post data through this function provides a layer of security

19823827
strcpy	strncpy
to copy a string use strcpy function or its secure sister strncpy

19823830
width	margin
if i understand what you re trying to do correctly you ll need to simply pull negative top margin the container content your navigation in this case into the gray background that spans the width of the page

19823911
width	height
when i have a fixed width value css automatically expands the height of ul but in fixed height i couldn t find any way to expand its width with respect to the number of li elements

19823921
google-chrome	firefox
well i mean i got this result on firefox and google-chrome but i need it in internet explorer 8 too

19823922
inherited	properties
it seems that unlike other browsers css-appended content from pseudo-elements in internet explorer 8 and below does not inherited the text-align properties from the parent element

19823922
inherited	properties
or better yet you can make the child pseudo-element inherited the parent text-align properties

19823940
int	double
this first brace results in a double type which is then multiplied with the int 4

19823940
int	double
in order to combine an int and a double java first upgrades the int to a double to make the types compatible

19823940
int	double
double can in a way be seen as a more general type than int

19823955
maven	pom.xml
this can be easily added through maven by added the following dependency in your pom.xml file before the tag

19823978
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
nullpointerexception index out of bounds exceptions access exceptions + api which wraps propagates exceptions into runtimeexception - this is also a lot

19824051
int	chars
you could change x to a chars or string and use atoi to translate it back into an int once you determine it to be one

19824087
google-chrome	firefox
also if anyone knows an ie8 fix it seems to only work in google-chrome and firefox

19824098
width	height
the other 3 ways produce negative values for the rectangle s width or height

19824118
implements	extends
the original class implements it with the real functions and then you create another class that extends the cache decorator and implements the interface as well

19824118
getter	setter
while i found it acceptable to use magic getter and setter in a really easy-to-understand value object code which would allow to store any value in any property just like stdclass i do recommend to be very careful with __call

19824141
int	chars
if i try to send unions it works fine with float and int but dosnt work with the array of chars

19824207
int	boolean

put	get
when i use it on my pc it works fine but when i put .jar file on the server i get this error

19824374

19824403
submit	submission
i did a tutorial on youtube to create my contact form it works well content transmits however once the submit button is hit a message is supposed to show up at the top of the page that says that the message was sent successfully or that something was wrong with the submission - instead it just goes to a blank page so people don t know if the form has gone through or not

the assignment is to write a method called fractionsum that accepts an int parameter n and returns as a double the sum of the first n terms of the sequence 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 + 1 5 + ...+ 1 n you may assume that the parameter n is non-negative

19825925
for-loop	loops
bugs like these is one of the major reasons why for-loop are generally preferred to while loops whenever an index variable or iterator variable is available

19825951
getter	setter
these instance variables should be private and then i should be accessing with getter and setter like getnext and setvalue

19825957

19826003
maven	pom.xml
i can pull artifacts without any difficultly when using maven pom.xml files as you d expect

19826029
getter	setter
when you don t actually need to protect them from arbitrary access or changes such as when the value is allowed to take any integer or a simple null mapping of value retrieved to value in object it makes little sense to wrap a getter or setter around it

19826029
getter	setter
having said that i still prefer getter and setter since if at some point in the future you need to incorporate logic into the member changing a public member to a getter setter for that member will break the api for that class involving changes to all clients using it

19826030
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
probably because next viewcontroller is being loaded twice onto the heap my guess and the error message i get when i try to return with uinavigationcontroller pop from that second uiviewcontroller is

19826056
getter	setter
you aren t really going to hurt anything by allows access to x and y directly rather than forcing the user to go through getter and setter

19826068
maven-surefire-plugin	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
when maven constructs the effective pom.xml file it applies the skipslowtests profile and configures maven-surefire-plugin to exclude the groups slowtest.class

maven-surefire-plugin	pom.xml
i have put maven-surefire-plugin in the pluginmanagement section of my parent pom.xml but any dependency defined for this plugin cannot have test scope

19826082
for-loop	loops
i am declaring several uiviews that are added to my uiscroll view in a for-loop i would like to know how to change the color of each uiview background when loops progresses

19826085
getter	setter
keep in mind that unless you have some custom logic you need in your setter and getter that you don t need to define those methods at all

19826123
tolower	toupper
that next character is not tested by isalpha - if you think that is important probably not i think toupper and tolower should be smart enough then you should not do that

19826123
strcpy	strncpy
as a general rule if you use strncpy instead of strcpy you will avoid copying more than you are allowed as long as you use the parameter n correctly the space i allocated for the copy

19826136
spaces	delimiter
you can parse it as a funky dialect of csv where the delimiter is a spaces and initial whitespace is skipped

19826147
atof	strtok
use strtok and atof in a loop like this it will give you an array of 5 x 10 essentially 5 arrays each with space for up to 10 floats

19826177
for-loop	arrays
means that we ll need a for-loop to retrieve the 0 and 1 to get the values in our arrays positions

19826195
switching	screens
i tried killing safari clearing the cache switching to private mode and removing the web app from the home screens

19826650
config	ini
i am using config simple for the ini portion

19826654
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop within main in your posted code builds the deck from the two string arrays and prints it out as it s building it but after building the deck you are never actually shuffling it

19826654
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
after your initial for-loop you have to call shuffleddeck which should be called shuffledeck then loops over the arrays again printing each card

19826665
put	get
when i use onclick attributes everything works and the javascript would get the id and use that to know what to put in the textbox to be used by eval

19826688
memcpy	malloc	memcpy	realloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
the tool recommends replacing realloc with malloc memcpy and free

19826688
memcpy	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc
so my replacement function that uses malloc memcpy and free has to cater for these cases

19826688
memcpy	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc
the following is my implementation that replaces these with malloc memcpy and free

19826688
memcpy	realloc	free	memcpy	free	realloc
as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free

19826688
free	malloc
i have to use only malloc and free

19826723
hide	show
what i d like to happen is that when i press the edit link it hide the text row and show the input row

19826723
hide	show
what s happening is that it works fine if i press the first link but say i press the 10th link down it will hide the show rows of 1-10 and then only show the edit of 10

19826727

post	get
as jenna r said it is better to use post not get

19827005
typedef	struct
as zmumps_complex and the builtin py_complex struct have exactly the same structure you should be able to do the trick by creating a bridge between those two types using typedef and or cast or a function that turns a py_complex into a zmumps_complex .

19827012

19827182
stdout	stderr
it seems that service --status-all uses stderr and stdout

19827206
getter	setter
in this case even adding synchronized to both the getter and setter wouldn t be enough since operations could be injected between both method invocations

comparator	comparable
in order to cast it to a comparable it needs to implement comparable and you need to have a comparator function

19827931
post	get
in order for the data to be saved in any way it needs to be either sent to a server where the information will be stored in a file or database server side or the data can be saved into a cookie client side or it can be kept displayed on the next page using either post or get

in the applications you should be able to subscribe to keydown keyup focus and blur lost focus

19828147
keydown	keyup
i m not clear on if this is an actual button or if its touch input but whatever the case may be assume keydown is whatever event fires when the user is simulating the ctrl key being pressed and keyup is whatever event fires when the user is ceases to simulate the ctrl key being down

19828147
keydown	keyup
every time keydown or keyup fires send a message to app2

19828719
queue	fifo
let s say you have a queue in cinema for buying tickets now the tickets should be allocated to a person in the order they have come so in this case queue is preferred data structure as it maintains the fifo fifo order

19828784
hide	show
1 i think you should put your fieldset inside an asp panel and then hide show the panel from your code-behind

19828923
hex	binary	fgetc	fread
31 is hex for 1 09 is hex for tab and so on fread expects the values in the file to be in binary format at least as you wrote it above so that 12 would be stored as 0x0001 or whatever your endianess and size of int is but what can be seen is the ascii value of the value so you shouldn t use fread instead use fgetc instead

width	height
first find the display height and width and call this method

19829899
lan	localhost
u just cant simply put the files in server without developing them.and if you want to develop any website or any webapp then u need to make your system a local server where you can execute your server side languages like php.xamp is a short form for mysql apache and php for windows.and website server is not the proper word.use localhost instead because only u will have access to your server unless you are connected via lan or wan.so i can summarize the above in few points keeping in mind that you want to develop your website

equals	compareto
the only reasonable option here was to define a total order such that the compareto method would consider the two numbers equals

19830258
equals	compareto
note that inconsistency between equals and compareto is not a problem as long as it s documented

19830273

superclass	subclassing
now if your goal is for this class to be subclassing you indeed have to design it so that the subclassing don t easily break the invariants of the superclass

19830349
implements	extends
asyncthreading is an actionscript library to facilitate threading in flex and air applications.it is very simple just extends abstractasyncthread class and implements iasyncthreadresponder interface or implements a class extends the iasyncthreadresponder interface you can do what you need

directly use width and height instead

19830495
for-loop	loops
if loops like in this case does not create a list then the for-loop will be faster

19830524
accessor	properties
there is big difference - without accessor you have public field with accessor you have auto-implemented properties

19830527

what you need to do is specify a blank seed and do something special when not put the comma you get a blank seed

19830775
children	parent
qobject cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thread

19830779

and then access it via the properties accessor and not the instance variable

19831034
spock	grails
i found this post testing domain constraints using grails 2.x spock 0.7 with an interesting approach to test domain class constraints

19831038
public	protected
create a class called help and a public protected method called seticonimage string iconpath that accepts a string parameter inside your class help

19831061
express	node.js
reading documentation this is perfectly understandable node.js express example

19831084
ant	maven
probably write a java app will be much faster than learning doing that in maven ant gradle

19831090
hide	show
update1 i actually have a touchlistener to show and hide the actionbar again

19831094
getter	setter
you need to use val as a getter and val value as a setter

i m aware of the storm project influxdb opentsdb kairosdb but except strom they don t look like tools designed for this kind of processing

19831205
folder	directory
as my program stands right now i have it change the directory to a specific output folder using os.chdir so it can open my text file but what i want is it to do something like this

19831313
folder	directory
read the base folder path and stored into variable and move to sub folder and process the text file using chdir and base path change the directory and read the sub folder once again

19831336
for-loop	loops
for example a simple for-loop and a while loops

19831409
ng-init	ng-show
i just wrote a simple zippy collapsable using angular using ng-show ng-click and ng-init

19831420

19831441
post	get
now i usually don t do this but i m kind of desperate and need a answer quickly so i will post all the code from my classes because sincerely i don t get what i m doing wrong so my mistake could be anywhere in my activity or view

19831452
google-chrome	firefox
this works well in google-chrome and ie11 but not in firefox 25 should be related to window.focus self.focus not working in firefox

19831463
submit	submission
so the user see s this screen clicks submit and it will the do the original functionality of submission the data to an sql database

19831506
accessor	properties
because properties accessor methods are created automatically by the compiler if necessary

19831561
memcpy	memset
if you want to set all of the array to a specific value use memset or if you want to copy another array use memcpy

19831588

this is way yeoman create the project and the gruntjs file

19831624
min	max
of course when sampled data is under min or over max i want to paint it in red

19831679
int	double
actually the problem is i am having a bytebuffer in which different data types are placed eg- 1st a float then a double and then an int after that double like wise and some of them may be signed and some are unsigned

19831679
int	double
for int float double this is the same issue i am facing

19831679
int	double	unsigned	short
i read some where that the java wont support unsigned values but i came across the convertions of int short into unsigned values but i could not able to find about the double float

19831743
int	chars
before you print the chars you can check if the chars is a or o print it int 21h if so or skip over the int 21h

19831756
post	get
now when i try to post to the storeajax route i get a modelnotfoundexception which to me means the route could not be found so it defaults to the default customers controller show method - in the error log i can see the following entry

19831851
filesystems	ntfs
it is not the files are stored in a special location on the filesystems called an ntfs data container they are then presented to the outside world via the ntfs streaming apis as a fileshare

19831859
gentoo	linux
on gentoo linux there s no usr bin time by default and the only implementation available is gnu time that has different output

19831863
hide	show
however i want to do show hide multi line chart function using listbox in javascript

19831874
unsigned	short
yes java has only signed values except of char which might be seen as an unsigned short

19831874
unsigned	short
for unsigned short for instance one can read write a short and hold its value in a signed int

19831913
min	max
and another datatable dt2 that contains this columns id min max point_to_add

19831914
inherited	properties
then i use inherited to make different panels with different properties

19831914
width	height
the width and the height should be equal to the widht and the height from the form

19831914
width	height
to set the width and the height from panels in the form1 but i made them protected or declarate the form in the panels class and use

19831950
min	max
you will need to generate the max min timeuuids programatically from timestamps using the utils.uuids utility class

19832032
user-controls	elementhost
i have a windows forms application which has one wpf user-controls available through elementhost control

19832042
ddms	adb
go to eclipse s window- preferences- android- ddms and increase adb connection time out

19832046
qpainter	qgraphicsitem
i am trying to put a qgraphicspolygonitem on an ellipse drawn by qpainter in custom qgraphicsitem

19832093
integer	unsigned
just a matter of interpretation - just read integer vars as they are but for printing as unsigned values perform operations similar to these above

19832135
put	get
this time i can run the code and extract some data but when i try to put the image back together on the server end all i get is a black box

19832163
post	get
moreover i get 78abc not 78 as product_amt post parameter

19832179
hash-collision	key
as for your question on hash-collision i have found a c# implementation implementation which is buggy now that shows how it works on each hash-collision the key is rehashed and lookup is retried recursively until maximum iterations limit is reached

19832179
haskell	ocaml
here they are in haskell and ocaml

19832179
integer	radix
related intmap structures haskell and its port to f# are very good when the key could be an integer and they implement related patricia radix trie

19832186
google-chrome	firefox
i m having trouble figuring out what i need to set on my partial responses 206 in order for google-chrome and firefox to cache the byte data sent to the browser

19832202
typedef	struct
if you absolutely need have to have an typedef use struct to to encapsulate it

19832216
hash	md5
gcrypt and openssl can do md5 sha and other hash here s an example with libgcrypt

19832240
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
which seemingly can only be parsed in google-chrome not safari or firefox

19832266
button	checkbox
on all your interactive widgets button checkbox

19832374
put	get
this is a fundamental limitation due to the requirements that the platform has to fulfill usually condition variables are implemented in a way that the waiting threads are put into a suspended state and will not get scheduled by the system again until a notify occurs

19832393
google-chrome	firefox
this is part of the problem as firefox requires it google-chrome does not - this explains why it works there

19832482
ant	maven
we have oracle adf and soa projects that are built using custom ant scripts instead of normal maven build

19832482
inherited	properties
the same i want with properties i want to have some types of properties in central places and a project to be able to use them but also inherited the parent pom for release purposes

19832506
lodash	underscore.js
one thing i want to know is in worklight version 6.0 i observed that underscore.js lodash templating was used

19832602
coalesce	nullif
along with coalesce nullif greatest and least it makes the group of conditional expressions

19832616
width	height
the row describes an image in some site and contains data like width height url some sort of status and some more fields

19832616
width	height
in the past the only way to get the image width and height was to parse the url

19832616
width	height
today we map the width and height in the db and thus i now need to get the image size and status and i don t care anymore about the original file name

19832616
min	max
select x.document_id max x.id max_id min x.id min_id

19832633
outputstream	inputstream
write the arguments to the process s outputstream assuming the jar can read them using inputstream

19832660
mouseover	mouseout
if a jquery ui draggable element #box1 is dragged over an element #box2 that has z-index set to -1 or below mouseover and mouseout events won t fire

19832660
mouseover	mouseout
without dragging mouseover and mouseout work fine with all z-index-values

19832696
udp	tcp
so basically with raw sockets it s possible to build own stack of headers like stack ip + tcp udp + own_header

19832711
getter	setter
the attachments view control has setter and getter for the attachment and label properties

19832791
udp	tcp
i would rely on existing protocols udp for best-effort and tcp for reliable and encapsulate my own header inside them

19832791
udp	tcp
in practice this means embed your own protocol over a standard udp tcp connection

19832791
udp	tcp
if you want to do the other way around udp tcp encapsulated in your own header you have to design implement your own protocol in the linux kernel which is quite complicated

19832805
int	chars
virtual void state readchar chars int

19832807
udp	tcp
you either sit on top of tcp udp in which case the ip stack takes care of the headers and the operation of the protocol in the case of tcp how to slice up your data into segments

19832807
udp	tcp
so if you want to add stuff on top of tcp or udp that s what a normal tcp or udp socket is for

19832830
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
again issue only with ie with other browser its ok google-chrome opera firefox

19832849
put	get
try to put your key value in rel or someother attribute then get key value from that attribute using

19832926
int	boolean
can be any type of value like int boolean long and so on

post	get
i am mapping an inbound http post request to an outbound get using mule 3.4

19833030
qtoolbutton	qpainter
i use qtoolbutton and according to some conditions i want to change the opacity of my qtoolbutton or specially icon of it whether using qpainter or any other way

19833129
portrait	landscape
this worked fine for ios6 but since ios7 if i switch the device to landscape the main view remains in portrait but the the alert view and keyboard rotate to landscape

19833129
portrait	landscape
a further bizarre quirk is that when i switch back to portrait only the keyboard switches back in truncated form leaving the alert frozen in landscape mode

19833208
getter	setter
the solution to the problem was to keep getter and setter in proguard which i had to additionally define in model classes to make jackson work

19833240
post	get
i m using restful service in order to make get and post requests with php it s a ready made code here it works fine with the get process but it does t work when coming to the post i m only assigning the parameters that it will be passed to the function for example like that

19833263
post	get
i know the post is old but think to answer so that users will get benefitted as they come across this.you asked two questions -

19833280
textview	imageview
i want to show four imageview horizontally with textview this is my screen and sample screen which i want to make

19833391
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
nsurlconnection is quite old take a look at nsurlsession with it s delegates and blocks

19833394
textview	imageview
you could wrap each imageview textview pair in a linearlayout like this

19833470
range	max	range	min	min	max
it takes different amount of memory and has different min max numerical range than double and is not bit-convertible to double but in turn it can held numbers precisely without any distortions

19833503
versioning	upgrade
so i rebuilt xdebug to 2.2.3 using pecl perl and i believe that this needed due to the new versioning of os x mavericks which i just upgrade to

19833511
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

19833515
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
i know this button works correctly without stopping further incoming chat in regular browsers google-chrome firefox opera etc

19833516
filtering	grouping
which means i don t want any filtering grouping or listener from any old view page

19833610
pull	push
so before you push your changes you need to pull the changes first so that you can resolve any conflicts occurred and then you can push your changes

19833617
ubuntu	linux
i am using netbeans as development ide and i need to install it under linux ubuntu machine

19833624
ant	pom.xml
you can define multiple profiles in your parent pom.xml each containing their own ant section

19833641
datamapper	activerecord
while orm s activerecord query builders do require additional memory by the way for each http request and also just look at their classes - they are usually so large datamapper don t

19833657
width	height
i would like each section to be full width and full height in the client browser whatever his screen size

19833721
slider	caroufredsel
i am using caroufredsel to make slider but duration cannot be set

to do this it needs inputs from mouse keyboard

19833800
ssl	https
recently my test worklight server has been configured and secured via https protocol and ssl setup ca certificate is added

19833835
int	double
i create a project where we can add different valuesâ â but this values must have different types of the columns in the database eg int double varchar

19833883
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
just a note it is working fine in the most versions of firefox google-chrome opera the problem only in safari 7

19833918
mp3	ogg
i cannot convert it to mp3 ogg serverside since webhostings usually don t come with timidity and lame bundled correct me if i m wrong

19833935
sctp	icmp
if you wanted to build your own icmp or sctp implementation for example you would use raw sockets

19833948
punctuation	words
2 i provided two options of getting position of words- words.count include all punctuation marks whilst computestatistic which is probably more suitable for you will return real position of the words within real words collection

19833956
put	get
i want to put a close button in the top right corner of a webview but i can t get it done

19833992
webkit	blink
in google chrome for example they are implemented in webkit blink

19833997
free	realloc
first of all i d like to point out you are not addressing the vulnerability as the memory released by free is not being cleared as well same as realloc

19833997
memcpy	realloc
for example realloc may be allocating more memory than you actually request or allocating contiguous memory just after the end of the previous block so your code is doing more memcpy s than realloc

19833997
memcpy	malloc	free	memcpy	free	malloc
this gives you some head room so not every time memory grows is it necessary to call malloc memcpy free

19834046
put	get
what i can t get my head around is how to put the attributes of a patient object into an array

19834049
textview	imageview
i think that it would be a better idea to use a textview and an imageview

19834232
pull	push
you would then git commit changes you make git push them up to the remote and then other people can git pull your changes down

19834232
pull	push
most of the time however every dev will pull the latest changes from the remote with git pull make changes often in a separate local branch git commit them and then push those changes up using git push

19834273
rss	feed
consuming other tested rss feed and having no issue however the latest test candidate is giving me a headache

19834286
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the video loads fine in firefox and google-chrome but i get nothing but the loading .gif and a black screen in safari - i ve got both .mp4 and .ogv available and linked so i know the correct format is there

19834293
google-chrome	firefox
this is only in firefox and ie but google-chrome renders it perfectly

19834303
fancybox	colorbox
if any one can help me as i did try other javascript libraries like colorbox fancybox etc

19834349
debian	linux
2 x redis 2.6.16 debian linux

19834354
inherited	subclassing
the decision which one to inherited and which one to wrap is easy you can create a statement implementation subclassing which drops the result of the expression it has wrapped but you cannot create an expression implementation which provides a result for a statement that provides no result through its interface

19834375
int	chars
the object file stores a main int argc chars argv function

19834400
children	parent
i could let every child reference it s parent id or i could let every parent contain a list of it s children

19834411
content-length	content-type
experienced same problem when my camel route tried to process empty response from server 200 ok content-length 0 content-type application json

19834423
maven	pom.xml
it appears to not resolving the parent pom.xml used by the custom maven plugin

19834496
jobs	cron
what we can do is we can create cron jobs this way jobs will have no effect on server restart

19834505
put	get
my problem is when i type something in edittext 1 and 2 then i ll get the string from activity b and put it in edittext 3 all of the information i typed in edittext 1 and 2 are gone

19834508

this question shows some tips using opencv - the library emgucv is a wrapper for

19834751
datamapper	activerecord
i have seen some work trying to make rails nosql-friendly specially datamapper 2 seems very interesting and taking a long time but i am wondering if the current rails architecture is suitable for ddd projects anti activerecord

19834753
kivy	buildozer
i can t remember if buildozer has a switch to use kivy master 1.8 is unreleased but you can certainly make it work

19834753
kivy	buildozer
if this variable exists python-for-android including the one downloaded and used by buildozer will use that directory to build kivy

19834753
kivy	buildozer
after that just run buildozer and the python-for-android component should use your copy of kivy master

19834779
listview	gridview
i have the listview with categories and gridview with items for selected category

19834818
post	get
even if service answer on get it not allow us to believe that it answers on post

19834828
content-disposition	content-type
i does not matter whether i take content-transfer-encoding or pragma or all of them except content-type and content-disposition away

19834828
google-chrome	firefox
so for instance if i have a file called home.xml firefox will download home.xml whereas google-chrome will give me home.xml- attachment

19834836
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
this displays fine in google-chrome ofc but on firefox the image is displayed with height 100 and width 100 while in ie it s displayed with width way over 100

19834850
folder	directory
i am using qsortfilterproxymodel in qtreeview for exploring all the files and folder of a directory

19834903
hex	binary
for example if you ve started with arbitrary binary data an image in some form then typically you d want to convert to a string using base64 or hex

19834957
http	spdy
for instance use a web server responding with a different protocol http or spdy depending on which user agent is requesting browsers support spdy or browsers only support http

19834968
public	protected
the constructor httpclientbuilder is protected not public so you cannot call it from your code

19834970
portrait	landscape
my app layout doesn t have any issues when in portrait mode but when i change the orientation to landscape there are some issues

19835017
versioning	upgrade
its a versioning issue you will have to upgrade or downgrade safe_yaml versioning as mentioned in the error it will install only on safe_yaml 0.7.0

19835201
realloc	memset
i think you also need to consider the implications of memset of memory every time you do a realloc because then a performance degradation seems inevitable

19835201
free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
i find the argument about realloc leaving code in the memory is somewhat overly paranoid because the same can be said about normal malloc calloc free

19835205
getter	setter
is it possible to prevent instance variable to be auto synthesized in .m implementaion as i want to implement my own getter and setter and i m not going to use instance variable

19835239
int	boolean
the idea is that i have an application which settings can be boolean int and strings

19835245
getter	setter
if you implement both getter and setter yourself instance variables are not synthesized

19835263
box-sizing	border-box
the box-sizing property isn t ignored this is exactly how the border-box value should behave

19835263
width	height
the content width and height are calculated by subtracting the padding widths of the respective sides from the specified â widthâ and â heightâ properties

19835263
width	height
as the content width and height cannot be negative this computation is floored at 0

19835289
jlist	jtable
it involves jtable or multiple jlist as well as those tags floating left next to the word

19835290
range	min
assuming m is a positive integer the range if possible values is -min abs n m - 1 through min abs n m - 1 inclusive

19835300
median	percentile
the facts are to be aggregated and in a non-additive way this is i want quality of service measures average semi-additive median percentile

19835308
getter	setter
as others said - if you override the setter and getter - the compiler does t do anything else

19835317
firepath	firebug
i am using the firepath extension to firefox firebug which lets me view the elements i am targeting

you cannot use the enhanced for-loop to partially iterate an arrays

19841095
for-loop	arrays
you can as suggested in other answers either create a new arrays or any other collection which contains only the elements you want to iterate or use a regular for-loop

19841100
int	double
code it to accept three parameters feet an int inches a double and weight a double

19841105
sse	avx
mmx registers donâ t alias the low part of avx so thereâ s no state-transition hazard like there is between avx256 and sse

19841105
sse	avx
thereâ s really no good reason to be mixing mmx and avx or to use mmx at all given that sse is universally available and avoids several hazards associated with mmx usage and also gives you more register names

if the parent pom.xml isn t part of the reactor the current build and you deleted your local cache then maven has to find it somewhere

19841379
ssl	https
the reason you get a host is not responsive error is because the ssl handshake failed because the device did not trust the server s certificate so an https connection was never created and it interprets it as if it did not find the server because the ssl handshake occurs at a lower level than http and it cannot distinguish between both cases

19841384

put	get
it seems like it should be fairly typical to get data from an xml and put it into non- nsstring variables but i can t seem to get it to work

19841945
versioning	upgrade
when these messages change we have to do a hot cut of one client versioning to the next coordinated with the exact time when the server is upgrade

19841945
versioning	upgrade
if the protocol sent the size of the message on the wire then we could take a more measured approach to upgrading the client software as the server is upgrade -- even putting a new versioning of the client software in production either before or after the server was upgrade

19841968
dpkg	apt
either download these manually and install them using dpkg simpler option or if you ll also need lots of other packages from precise add the precise package repositories to etc apt sources.list.d and install them using apt-get

19842353
hide	show
i then decided i would have to hide show it but this is where the problem came about with the button

19842356
put	get
i would suggest either a try putting in that .gitignore file to tell it not to ignore pdf files there or b get rid of the top-level ignore rule rearrange your build process to put the produced pdf files in a separate directory output and then put a .gitignore there with the .pdf rule in it

macports	homebrew
1 - install autoconf using homebrew or macports

19842779
rsa	aes
in short before the elliptic curve crypto baked into zmq 4 is considered reliable and becomes standard the accepted solution would be to implement ssl tls over the connection manually and failing that use aes 128 or 256 with a secure key sharing mechanism key sharing is where rsa would appropriately be used

19842806
autofixture	automapper
i have found a solution that works using dtos and automapper which is reproduced below but i would still prefer an answer that lists the different approaches to the problem with examples in particular whether this is a desirable solution or whether i should stick with the navigation properties as they were get rid of autofixture and when it comes to serializing for json just utilise other work arounds attributes etc .

i would like to hide a span if the value is null or simply show an empty string

19842884
integer	unsigned
you can use unsigned integer types for your columns for holding only positive values but when you re doing calculations in sql i m pretty sure you re always going to end up with a negative number if you subtract a large number from a smaller one

19842884
integer	unsigned
even if you somehow forced mysql to use an unsigned int internally you would not end up with zero you would end up with integer underflow and get a huge positive number instead

19842927
google-chrome	safari
the problem appeared both in safari and in google-chrome

19842934
pop-up	dialog
according to the ie documentation on the onbeforeunload event the dialog should not pop-up if i am returning an empty value

19842949
keydown	keyup
this kind of thing detecting a keyup keydown event might be simpler with if you process key events you receive in your main loop instead of calling sdl_getkeystate

19842955
persistent	transient
i think there would be some differnce between save update merge persistent for the different status of an entity transient persistent detached the operations is not the same as you thought and your annotation prepersist and preupdate did not take effect

19842993
for-loop	loops
it was actually a very simple mistake i was creating a new row in the inner most for-loop when i needed to create the row in the outer loops

19843084
integer	unsigned
as you can see that is the natural progress of incrementing the binary data--without considering it to represent an integer signed or unsigned

19843084
integer	unsigned
counter intuitively the actual overflow takes place when moving from -1 11111111 to 0 00000000 in the unsigned integer s sense of wrap-around

19843123
superclass	subclassing
just means that the subclassing have to call protected methods that are defined in the superclass

19843145
superclass	subclassing
you could give the superclass protected data members and then access those directly from the subclassing

19843145
superclass	subclassing
however the professor likely wishes to teach you about how a superclass can protect its data members from direct access by a subclassing and protected methods would be a way to do that

19843181
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer types implement modulo arithmetic

19843181
integer	unsigned
for this reason unsigned integer types do indeed appear to wrap around on overflow

unsigned	short
type unsigned short int that you mention in your question will typically be promoted to type int in expressions before any computations begin assuming that the range of unsigned short fits into the range of int

19843181
unsigned	short
which means that 1 the computations with unsigned short int will be preformed in the domain of int with overflow happening when int overflows 2 overflow during such computations will lead to undefined behavior not to wrap-around behavior

19843181
unsigned	short
if no int overflow happens and the result is converted back to an unsigned short int type it is again reduced by modulo 2 n which will appear as if the value has wrapped around

dynamic is as you ve said meant to tell the compiler don t synthesize accessor for this properties i ll do it myself at runtime

19843418
accessor	properties
one place it is used is in nsmanagedobject subclasses where if you declare a modeled properties in the header you don t want to compiler to complain that there s no implementation of accessor for that properties nor do you want it to generate accessor itself

19843418
accessor	properties
nsmanagedobject generates accessor for modeled properties at runtime

ostringstream	std
std ostringstream is not necessarily stored as a sequential array of characters in memory

19845080
ostringstream	std
std string using appropriate std string reserve has no reason to act slower than std ostringstream in this situation

19845080
ostringstream	std
however std ostringstream is probably faster for appending if you absolutely have no idea about the size you have to reserve

19845080
ostringstream	std
it would be better to use one std ostringstream str to make the data sequential at once compared to multiple re-allocations that would happen otherwise

cbperipheralmanager	cbcentralmanager
it s perfectly fine to scan on a cbcentralmanager and advertise on a cbperipheralmanager at the same exact time

for example if i m on portrait and i change to landscape the elements appear like in portrait and then they are relocated to their new position so you can see the transition

19864697
pull	push
i need to wade through the ffmpeg documentation more thoroughly at some point because there are a bunch of knobs and levers to push and pull in that software but for now this takes care of the immediate issue i d love to find a tool that would use ffprobe output to create an ffmpeg command that would produce a file of similar type though

19864700
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that when i use the plugin both i.e and firefox and google-chrome also output the same strange thing

19864712

where #data is some part of the body with width 100 and height 100 and has some other layers on it please look at this image

19864978
listview	gridview
this works great for stuff like listview scrollview gridview etc

19865022
width	height
i want the user to be able to resize the jframe s width height while maintaining the same ratio between its width and height

19865022
width	height
in other words i want to force the height to change with the width keeping the same frame shape

19865055
debian	linux
i have a number of log files in a php installation on debian linux that tend to grow quite a bit and i would like to trim nightly to the last 500 lines or so

19865083
width	height
another problem imo is that you re setting width and height of component using it default component bounds which seems to be 0

19865111
portrait	landscape
i d imagine if a device returns landscape or portrait that it is likely a handheld device and therefore somewhat unlikely to support autoplay

19865129
ssl	https
the page that is hosting this is under ssl and all links on the front end need to show https or else it breaks the security of the page

19865147
mouse	keyboard

19865300
tax	shipping
you may not need to know the username cost per line item how many shipments tax amount shipping methods etc

19865344
children	parent
i expected this to find every parent class and then calculate the width based on the number of each elements respective children

19865357
width	height
i suspect that your tab bar frame is hard-coded to certain x y width height coordinates which work well on the 3.5 screen

19865416
width	height
use the new size of the changed dimension to calculate the desired size for the other dimension and set the size of the frame using .setsize int width int height

19865416
width	height
this might have problems if you change both the width and height in the same resizing if so you can always base the height off the width or vice versa

19865439
spaces	linefeed
be aware that the first byte is the char followed by 0x0a for linefeed then spaces etc

19865455
inherited	properties
this often requires the use of a setproperty method rather than a read-write properties for whatever reason if an interface inherited an interface which includes a read-only properties foo and another which implements a write-only properties foo the compiler will say any attempts at properties access are ambiguous and won t allow foo to be read or written notwithstanding the fact that read accesses can only refer to the read-only properties and write accesses to the write-only properties

19865475
listview	gridview
except in your case activelistview would be the reference to your gridview instead of a listview

19865517
getter	setter
the modeldriven bean usually used for read write via the getter setter

19865519
subtract	add
may want to add subtract from pos depending on exact placement needed

19865530
width	height
for image dimensions call myfile.properties.getimagepropertiesasync the result of this is an imageproperties object that contains width and height properties

19865603

no support for any other type than int - before c++ 11 one can t just have an enum of for example long long short or chars

19865663
post	get
the login works perfectly but when trying to post a status to twitter i get the following error

19865689

i want them to be the same width even if they have to be a different height due to the amount of text

19865690
apache	nginx
i d like to run the cms without having to modify it - ideally i d like to be able use the cms with apache and nginx and i don t want to maintain two separate versions

19865692
put	get
and you need to put a space between the first and last names otherwise you ll get sarahtestname which won t match sarah testname

19865727
post	get
edit after re-reading your post i don t think there is a way to get only 4 of the 8 groups to print in a column layout

19865821
g++	gcc
some c c++ compilers do perform tail call optimization according to tail recursion in gcc g++ gcc will optimize tail calls when -o2 is specified so this isn t entirely a moot point

19865883
put	get
put the and variables inside of span tags or anything else you can directly target with javascript and then get the values from those spans with js and use that to calculate the sum in js rather than echoing it into the source with php give the spans ids like #captcha-1 and #captcha-2 use getelementbyid to retrieve the values then do the validation entirely in javascript

19865911
folder	directory
the problem was a stray .svn folder in the source directory

19865935
valgrind	glibc

you can integrate pyqt s or pyside qwebview webkit where in you can put the auto open the url

19866017
mouse	keyboard
each d3 element your flowchart blocks can listen for mouse and keyboard events but d3 has no combobox or text elements -- you would have to code those yourself

19866110
uidatepicker	uipickerview
i have changed the uidatepicker with uipickerview wrote a separate delegate for it

19866136
sudo	chgrp	chown	sudo	chown	chgrp
0 5 sudo bin chown -r www-data var www pdf sudo bin chgrp -r www-data var www pdf

19866136
chown	chgrp
first off the chgrp is redundant you can manage the same with the chown command itself

19866136
chown	sudo
so instead of doing you can do sudo bin chown -r www-data www-data var www pdf

19866144
width	height
simply change the height and width to something else like match_parent this should be a straight forward answer for beginners like me

19866155
width	height
i dig into the dom and i see that for that element the width is 384px and the height is 10px

19866155
width	height
however using chrome i can see that the image width is 183px and the height 100px

19866168
versioning	upgrade
i am selling a puzzle up that always peaple to upgrade to a full versioning by bringing them to my app page on google play

19866170
int	boolean
this config file contains strings int boolean and an array that can contain strings int and boolean

19866170
int	boolean
as you can see i don t explicitly set the variable since the variables from the config are different types boolean int array strings

19866172
google-chrome	firefox
these accordion submenus work in google-chrome and firefox but not on an iphone

19866172
google-chrome	firefox
this mechanism works perfectly in google-chrome firefox and every browser i can get my hands on as well as on my personal android phone

19866187
hid	keyboard
it enumerates as a hid keyboard but the flaw is that there are two key codes for every button and no key repeat

19866191
min	max
furthermore the min and max values are correctly calculated and inserted in the water_level_hourly table

19866191
min	max
when looking at the table the min and max values appear as expected

19866191
min	max
somehow everytime the trigger fires it does not correctly query the values of min and max from the hourly table and always inserts -1 into the daily table

19866326
mp3	ogg
it appears from a browse of your code that you re pulling down mp3 or ogg files - you need to decode them

19866331
action-filter	onactionexecuting
the action-filter checks for null session variable onactionexecuting re-populating the session if it is null

sudo	chgrp	chown	sudo	chown	chgrp
0 5 sudo bin chown -r www-data var www pdf sudo bin chgrp -r www-data var www pdf

19866344
chown	chgrp
first off the chgrp is redundant you can manage the same with the chown command itself

19866344
chown	sudo
so instead of doing you can do sudo bin chown -r www-data www-data var www pdf

19866349

19866381
rbenv	homebrew
highly recommend rbenv and rbenv-gemset installing here with homebrew

19866424
folder	directory
the moc file have been auto-generated and the header is not in the build folder but in a folder locate in the src directory

19866496
min	max
you have to always mention the min and max width

19866543
g++	gcc
gcc 4.7.3 g++ -wall -wextra -std c++0x rpn-calc.cpp

19866548
affinity	processors
most of the presto machines we are on have 16 real cores and we use processors affinity soon to be cgroups to limit presto to 12 cores so the dfs client and other things can run easily

19866605
google-chrome	firefox
same in google-chrome and firefox

19866635
post	get
try this using a sub query the get the last post of each conversation and joining that back against the main table -

19866650
kde	gnome
actually there are several bundled schemes default for gnome default for kde created exactly for that purpose

19866650
kde	gnome
i have not checked now particular shortcuts like ctrl+alt+l but these schemes were created to avoid conflicts with gnome and kde respectively

19866665
post	get
i was looking into the groovy post build plugin but i can t seem to get the code to change the build status

19866677
pop-up	dialog
i want to create a button that pop-up the open dialog box where the user can select an image or video

19866741

when i add the action to the url and try to post to methodb using passing c in the body i get a 404 instead

19866754
opensuse	linux	opensuse	centos	centos	linux
this is on opensuse 12.3 linux kernel 3.7.10-1.16 but i see what appears to be the same problem on centos 6.4 with its stock kernel

19866786
vb6	vba
the closest you ll get in vba which is basically vb6 is the typelib information object library

19866803
button	checkbox
my issue is what method works best to extract the form data from the checkbox and radio button in python

19866816
pdostatement	bindvalue
unlike pdostatement bindvalue the variable is bound as

19866826
integer	unsigned
because i is a not a size_t unsigned integer

19866835
namedtuple	dictionary
note that this would be a lot easier if you used dictionary or namedtuple instead of lists as the values in your dictionary

19866843
stdout	stderr
it is probably also a good idea to use the inputstreams from getinputstream and geterrorstream to get the stdout and stderr messages the perl script prints as it runs

19866850
google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly on safari and google-chrome mac osx

19866864
for-loop	arrays
you are running off the end of the 2d arrays with your for-loop conditions

19866866
bluestacks	android-emulator
homever when i m trying to launch it on bluestacks android-emulator i got some problems

19866879
junit	testng
would that be junit or testng etc.

19866933
range	max
your loops will include r and c in i and j range where there max index for them is r-1 and c-1

19866949
for-loop	loops
your for-loop only loops when so it will never show any elements further than the third

19866968
qtableview	qstandarditemmodel
the qtableview uses a subclassed qstandarditemmodel as its model

19867053
daemon	cron
apart from completely wrong approach you need cron daemon to control tasks running every n minutes possibly what you re trying to do is to use mysql s date_sub

19867066
qapplication	qdebug
qdebug active window qapplication activewindow - windowtitle

19867087
min	max
after some fiddling i managed to get it working by renaming the variables min and max to something else

19867093
addition	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	addition
division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition so what this is actually doing is

19867100
post	put
for non- patch requests put and post you can still perform partial data binding by either creating and registering an event subscriber to manipulate the unsubmitted data to their original values or you can write a custom request handler to always call the method with set to false

19867100
post	get
how to use http methods beyond get and post in routes

19867158
multiplying	add
for my code i have to read two files in c interpret the contents of these two files as matrices and then add or multiplying the matrices and prints the result to the screen

19867167
int	boolean
for example delete_log is a boolean restart_pause an int and so on

19867172
junit	testng
junit has only been mentioned because i have used it successfully nunit testng or any other unit testing framework could be used

19867201
margin	height
this is the height of their margin box

19867224
floating-point	integer
on most systems integer 0 floating-point 0.0 and null pointers are all represented as all-bits-zero so a static aggregate object can probably be correctly initialized just by setting it to all-bits-zero

19867230
hide	show
i m having trouble making this show hide code work in chrome

19867243
put	get
to get the ascii-number which represents the character --as drew said-- put a question mark before the character and evaluate that expression

19867268
pop-up	dialog
typically it needs to access the internet to look up the address and the delay is going to be unpredictable and could be long enough to cause an application not responding error dialog to pop-up

19867284
versioning	upgrade
i have setup a lamp server on a local vm ubuntu for me to test it all out on then upload the upgrade versioning as is suggested

19867358
hide	show
just store them in a div hide it by default and show on click

19867363
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseleave
i also tried mouseover mouseout mouseleave hover and every other mouse-related function i can think of

19867368
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
another way to do this is to create basic uiviewcontroller for each uinavigationcontroller then have a uicontainerview that points to the same uiviewcontroller in each of the basic view controllers

19867418
put	get
to get the current element put it inside an each statement and initialize each cluetip one by one

19867462
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i m trying to call action with uicontroleventtouchdown event for simple uibutton which placed in left-bottom corner of uiviewcontroller which pushed with uinavigationcontroller

19867462
width	height
there are some touch areas in left width 13 and left-bottom width 50 height 50 which respond differently on touches

19867477
maven	pom.xml
i have a parent maven project with a packaging of type pom.xml and all it does is install the third-party jar which could be any number of jars or dependencies to my local repository

19867477
jar	war
i simply list the third-party jar as a compile-time dependency and it s resolved and added to the resulting war

19867481
fileinputstream	filechannel	bufferedreader	filechannel	bufferedreader	fileinputstream
however for files that have variable length data keep coming in there are some problems with using bufferedreader directly on fileinputstream or filechannel inputstream via an inputstreamreader

19867481
fileinputstream	filechannel
so you use br on fileinputstream filechannel via an inputstreamreader and use its readline method

19867528
dictionary	map
i ll again recommend that you not do this and just use dictionary s to map strings or whatever hashable datatype to values

19867531
google-chrome	firefox
i know how to search for style of any page element using any browser google-chrome firefox etc..

19867581
versioning	upgrade
so while developing i can add schema changes and no matter what versioning of the app someone is using when they upgrade they will get the latest schema changes

19867614
google-chrome	firefox
the easiest way to do this is to use the computed style tab in the google-chrome or firefox web inspectors as this will allow you to see not only the explicitly defined styles of the element s in question but will also show you inherited styles from the cascade

19867620
button	checkbox
so checkedbox would hold the name of the first checkbox that s currently checked kind of assuming radio button functionality here but you can tweak as needed for whatever you re trying to accomplish or an empty value if nothing is checked

19867649
fadein	hide
also note that to fadein any element requires that it s currently hidden -- either with css or hide

19867655
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome and opera it appears that first-line rules apply to the after pseudo-element as well and cannot be overridden with

19867655
firefox	safari
what i would expect and what happens in ie firefox and safari is that the after pseudo-element would have a font-size of 10px

19867677
gruntjs	yeoman
i m not looking to create templates from markdown merely a way of including text which is then rendered compiled into html using gruntjs build or in the case of yeoman also for gruntjs server

19867690
postgresql	mysql
in mysql goes okay but in postgresql it fails with

19867698
hide	show
you ll need to call setneedsstatusbarappearanceupdate specifically to get this working and then a switch bool in this case to show hide

19867701
keydown	keyup
i would like to run my javascript on keydown instead of keyup and transform the event in flight or intercept it prevent default and trigger a modified new event

19867764
hide	show
the above code will toggle the modal show it if it s hidden or hide it if it s already visible when you click the ui button

19867775
post	get
for some reason whenever i try to post some data to my api server i get the following two errors

19867851
free	malloc
if you need to make the structure array flexible because you don t know how many ip s will be connecting you ll need to learn how to use the malloc and free c functions

19867860
width	height
it applies to window objects but also to scrollable frames and elements with the overflow css property set to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less than the height or width of its contents

19867877
minimum	max	min	max
i got it working once trying to work out the max value but then replaced max with min in order to work out minimum value

19867877
min	max
the max works sometimes but the min has never worked so i m guessing something is incorrect

19867916
hash	md5
internally it s probably a md5 hash of something

19867942
client-side	server-side
i have avoided to use any server-side scripting and just serve the static files the rest is handled in client-side so if it s possible do not write your entire answer based on server-side php or node.js

19867966
post	get
i will try to post that if i able to get that designed

19867997
virtualenv	setuptools
i guess for now in python 3.3 we ll have to manually install setuptools and pip or continue to use virtualenv

19868051
unix	solaris
i am guessing you will find the answer here - even though that question is about solaris both mac os x and solaris are unix operating systems

19868082
post	get
you have to make sure your routes are defined to be unique with a single post and get per route

19868151
width	height
i want the user to resize the window while maintaining the same aspect ratio rectangle in which the width height

19868151
width	height
in other words if height is changed i want to force width to change by a larger amount and vice versa

19868151
width	height
even when i drag to resize it doesn t change both width and height

19868156
put	get
what i am trying to do is that i am using only gpgga nmea string to get the values of latitude longitude and altitude.in my below code i had put certain checks to check if incoming string is gpgga or not and then store the further string in a array which can be further parsed suing strtok function and all the 3 gps coordinates can be easily find out

19868209
awt	swing
i used a jpopupmenu over the awt popupmenu because i wanted to get the system look and feel applied to the popup menu - when i used just a plain popupmenu i could not get the system s look and feel i just kept getting swing s metal look and feel

19868285
int	double
next when casting a double float to a long int the decimal part is dropped not rounded

19868302
powerpc	i386
1 configure libtiff for i386 and powerpc

19868314
int	chars	tinyint	nvarchar	tinyint	varchar
here are the available data types i can see and presumably use int int smallint tinyint bigint bit varchar 50 nvarchar 50 text ntext image money float real decimal numeric 18 0 chars 10 nchar 10 datetime guid

19868338
jwindow	jdialog
use a unresizable jwindow jdialog without any decorations and re-implement window resizing programmatically

19868338
awt	swing
is avaiable with swing awt

19868338
awt	swing
only problem with that it is quite volatile regarding platforms jdk versions though awt swing is not changed that much in recent years

19868339
post	get
its possible that the page is using both the get and the post methods

19868343
width	height
instead of thinking up your own rules which are likely to be biased and based on your own experience just use some machine learning library to learn the probabilities based on the width and height

19868390
public	protected
i always thought public private and protected keywords were for php or java not javascript but just found out these are reserved words

19868410
post	get
and i have 1 query to get those 50 post

19868465
width	height
gridbaglayout works a lot like html tables where you have different cells which grow in height and width to try and accommodate the content most effectively

19868468
public	protected
the ecmascript 5 standard mentions the terms public private and protected exactly once each excluding annexes and copyright notices in 7.6.1.2

19868470
scikit-learn	nltk
or scikit-learn directly .for more details nltk 3.0 documentation

19868496
post	get
site.looking at it in fiddler i see that some of the post and redirects that i see when using the current method is happeing and i get 404s for many of the javascript files coming from our site

19868515
put	get
if i put i get the error typeerror there is no line property labels

19868525
post	get
with that out of the way the next thing i would suggest is using post instead of get

19868575
getter	setter
so you should use delegate for getter and write setter method by youself something like this

19868751
installation	upgrade
first of all cloudera manager makes cdh installation and upgrade so much easier

19868831
wan	lan
for example if your machine has a lan connection where your address is 10.0.0.100 and a wan connection where your address is 8.9.10.11 if you bind 10.0.0.100 you can receive packets from other lan clients like 10.0.0.201 and 10.0.0.202

19868843
implements	extends
i have an bean interface abstractbean implements bean and specificbean extends abstractbean

19869047
opera	firefox
works fine in chromium firefox and opera on android

19869063
implements	extends
if you implements a class x that both class a and class b extends that changes nothing about any subclasses or any use of either class or any subclass

19869063
inherited	subclassing
a and b share about half of their code and both have a large inherited tree below them - something that instantiates a class a subclassing could have its behavior changed by having a get some new functionality

19869084
multiplying	subtraction	multiplying	addition	subtraction	addition
...so that an n-vector can be treated as an nx1-matrix for example when it comes to multiplying with integral values or addition subtraction of equally dimensioned matrices or vectors in this regard

19869214
folder	directory
i had in the new folder build 14 directory and 2613 files

19869217
put	get
that means that if you divide the array into 3 smalls arrays of length 2 and if you put them as single pair of coordinates in a matrix where the first coordinate means the value of the i and the second one means the value of the j you would get something like an l on your matrix

19869226
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder on a given division operation

19869228
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
your issue is that you are grouping by horse id but not using any aggregate-functions on the other columns you are selecting if you group on one column every other column you select has to be a sum or max or min etc

19869253
client-side	server-side
you can t mix php a server-side technology with javascript client-side

19869271
cgpoint	cgrect
apple uses structs in many of their methods too cgpoint cgrect

it works just fine using jquery 1.x edge but when i use jquery 1.10 the slideup just stop and not continue to slidedown again

19869411
width	height
i m still not happy with having to hard-code the dimensions of width and height into the code but couldn t get the geometry stuff to work to pass me the actual images width and height but it does the job at the moment

19869413
int	boolean
it doesn t return a boolean it returns an int in one of three possible states

19869413
int	boolean
however a negative and a positive int in a boolean context both evaluate to true so the results of cmp do not convert correctly to what std map expects

19869439
google-chrome	firefox
works in firefox but not in google-chrome

19869446
put	get
i am using sftp protocol put and get methods to accomplish this task

19869467
width	margin
another solution is set the body margin to 0 usually when no width is set and the body margin is untouched the render might be off by 16 pixels which accounts for 8 pixels to each side left and right of the body tag

19869490
google-chrome	firefox
it works flawlessly in firefox and google-chrome but for the life of me i can t seem to end the session in ie10 on windows 8

19869657
typedef	struct
you should probably provide a struct or typedef then changes are a little easier to make should your needs requirements change

19869731
min	max
but if i set min and max to other value to get some zoom in and out effects the slider position will be off

19869783
uu-parsinglib	parsec	attoparsec	uu-parsinglib
what you re looking at is a non-deterministic parser combinator library and you can find other examples in parsec attoparsec uu-parsinglib .

19869783
int	chars
consider a parser which consumes a single chars to create an int

19869786
width	height
you need to set the size explicitly using the canvas properties attributes width and height

19869788
margin	height
because you set the margin of your body to 30 and the height of the header to 50px

19869795

19869841
ubuntu	linux
i m a linux beginner and have a linux ubuntu 12.04 server

19869848
cpython	pypy
compile the code whether by writing it in cpython instead of python or by running it in pypy instead of cpython

19869854
slideup	slidedown
use .slidetoggle instead of slidedown and slideup

19869863

c# - https ssl

19869903
hide	show
you can hide it using the visibility attribute on your xml layout file and show it programmatically at runtime

19869907
put	get
now you need to get and put 4000 entities and the question is how to reduce the costs of this operation

19869921
cpython	pypy
for speed you might do well to use pypy numba or cpython

19869926
width	column-count
so in your example providing column-count is causing an automatically generated width to be presented as container width

19869931
ienumerable	iqueryable
let everything in your query stay iqueryable instead of ienumerable

19869988
hide	show
first of all you need to be using hide and show

19869993
apache	nginx
another http server say apache or nginx

if i put in the server path for the service i get the following error

19870034
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my win7 test box to use ie11 the released versioning

19870051
hash	md5
i say hashing is considered encryption because you call md5 a cryptographic hash function

19870065
superclass	subclassing
a subclassing of a superclass should be a special case of the superclass

19870077
fiddler	pac
alternatively you could try setting the scriptlocation attribute to point at and use fiddler s about config to set fiddler.proxy.pacfile.usefileprotocol to false and tick the tools fiddler options connections use pac script box

19870088
std	ostream
it flushes the tie d std ostream if any

19870088
int	chars
to see if the input starts with a quote in.peek is used this function returns an int indicating either that the operation failed it returns or the next chars in the stream

19870102
width	height
so you can not predict how is the size before component b shows because at this time the value properties of width and height of a is not setted yet

19870102
width	height
you can manually get the height and width of component a before show it and set in b component

19870132
accessor	properties
if you think of your team as a container for player s your team class will have a properties that contains the player s and accessor methods to add remove clear etc

19870139
versioning	upgrade
this suddenly happened after i was forced to upgrade silverlight to versioning 5

19870146
google-chrome	firefox
the comment above should fix your code but to answer your question an object created by a constructor function like new koreanair.view has an attribute called .__proto__ in modern browsers like google-chrome and firefox whereas the constructor function itself koreanair.view has an attribute called .prototype

19870147
folder	directory
ps the relative path in an application is application-name source resource so you can refer to any directory in this folder by application-name folder-name

19870148
post	get
if you add an integer votes_count column to the post table you can get rails to automatically increment and decrement that counter by changing the belongs_to declaration in vote to

19870160
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari you can use t.contentwindow.document.width and t.contentwindow.document.height

19870160
firefox	safari
in firefox ie and safari you can use t.contentdocument.body.scrollwidth and t.contentdocument.body.scrollheight

19870177
children	parent
i would like to tell jackson how to get the instances of parent to children and instances of child to parent when deserializing registry

19870196
min	max
so the answer is that i overlooked the min and max options for the constraints on the domain here s how to get that on the gsp.

19870196
min	max
level nullable true min 1 max 5

19870259
google-chrome	firefox
whatever i am trying i can not make one solution work in firefox google-chrome and internet explorer at once correctly

19870259
google-chrome	firefox
firefox doesn t display it ie and google-chrome make it grey transparent

19870266
yacc	bison
if you really are using lex yacc or flex bison you ll have to use both in conjunction

19870273
int	chars
trapezoid int twidth int bwidth chars signa chars signb int margin

19870273
width	margin
twidth is the top width bwidth bottom width signa foreground sign signb background sign and margin the margin left and right of the bwidth

19870288
inherited	subclassing
they are so enamored with the inherited they learned in school that they are anxious to factor everything out to some common base class and subclassing it like crazy

19870336
stdout	stderr
it is good practice to redirect all error messages to stderr while directing regular output to stdout

19870338
int	chars
i m having trouble figuring out how to change the chars into int and back

19870347
integer	unsigned
returns an unsigned integer type of at least 16 bit

19870347
integer	unsigned
this warning is because of the unsigned integer where is defined the size_t

19870363
folder	directory
you need to add a x86 folder in your libs directory along the armeabi ones and copy this file on it

19870367
int	chars
i just can t figure out why it won t work for the full ten chars of an int

19870423
portrait	landscape
when i change the orientation of my ipad from landscape to portrait the map view s size doesn t change

19870427
hide	show
might help jquery .toggle to show and hide a sub sub-menu

19870435
stdout	stderr
the general practice is to redirect all error messages to stderr and all regular output to stdout

19870435
stdout	stderr
using printf will display the error message to console which will be stored in the stdout buffer but using stderr it is different

19870435
stdout	stderr
although in many cases both stdout and stderr are associated with the same output device like the console applications may differentiate between what is sent to stdout and what to stderr for the case that one of them is redirected

19870479
comparator	comparable
your token class is implementing the raw form of the comparable interface which expects a comparator object method

19870491
jar	war
you want to package in a war or ear file which may have jar files in its web-inf lib directory

19870538
width	height
i ve tried forcing the height of ul and li to 100px or placing the list inside a table with set height and width

19870552
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tested it under windows in google-chrome ie firefox and safari - it works file

19870567
post	get
post get post id . format posts#show

19870583
hide	show
implementing a simple dropdown directive that uses ng-show to show or hide a menu is trivial in angularjs

19870602
put	get
the problem is that my core data call to get a certain entity can take about 3-5 seconds and would be horrible to keep on the main thread but when i put it on the background thread on a separate managed object context just for retrieving data on the background thread that is just for retrieving data in the background i get deadlocks

19870604
hide	show
i am seeking to embed and trigger a show hide within this toggle

19870627
portrait	landscape
the best i could describe it would be that when i change the orientation of the device from portrait to landscape and vice versa it inflates a whole new listview without deflating the previous one

19870628
int	chars
i thought conversion int to chars and back would be easy

19870629
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to vs2013 and the latest versioning of typescript 0.9.1.1 and scripts were not compiled on save

19870630
serializable	deserialization
my suggestion when working when any complex data structure being passed between javascript and php would be to use json serializable deserialization and not rely on behavior at all

19870662
innodb	myisam
for the best efficiency i d perform an optimize table operation for innodb tables and myisam tables with dynamic format if there have been a significant number of dml changes especially deletes and updates that modify the length of the row... at the very least it would ensure that the index statistics are up to date

19870666
stdout	stderr
i can successfully capture some console information but not all -- i can capture and redirect stdout and stderr to files of my choosing

19870757
jboss	weblogic
i am considering you must be using some application server like jboss or weblogic

19870808
superclass	subclassing
while storing ndb.polymodel superclass as an ndb.structuredproperty i was unable to access subclassing methods

19870808
superclass	subclassing
i know that saying the structured property is of type recipient causes the superclass method to be called but then maybe i don t fully understand why they would store the subclassing in the recipient.class attribute

19870927
console.readline	console.writeline
you can use console.writeline to write out text and console.readline to read in the response from the user

19870939
try-catch	exception-handling
it goes to the try-catch and considers this an exception-handling

19870947
put	get
i need to put in a sleep for 500msec to get it send all the messages

19870953
mouse	keyboard
in this example i have some objects such as player keyboard mouse listeners and a bunch of enemies

19870957
subtract	add
to manage this i simply add subtract a fixed number to compensate the time zone difference

19870963
google-chrome	firefox
this concept has been adopted by - it looks like - google-chrome and firefox

19870963
google-chrome	firefox
here s the release documentation firefox google-chrome

19870966
width	height
when pulling from the now api the height and width given for some images does not correspond with the actual size of the image

19870966
width	height
the height is 90 and the width is 90 yet the image is actually 300px as tipped off by the jpg url

19871007
folder	directory
i would move the uploaded file to a folder on your server and then changed your web server configuration to have your other domain point to a directory where that folder is accessible

19871091
getter	setter
you can either make the member public or make it private and define a getter and setter method but you won t have the syntactic sugar of c# you ll have to call them explicitly

19871099
put	get
the weird thing is no matter how many users i put in the test 20 50 100 250 500 i get the same out of control spikes and on a 5 minute interval

19871109
hide	show
i am currently working on a form that uses jquery to hide and show form options and php the process the form and send the values to email

19871124
multiplication	exponent
the total precision of floating point number depends on exponent value as well takes values from -128 to 127 it can be computed by multiplication of fraction part quantization step and exponent value

19871149
width	height
instead of setting the textview width and height to match_parent set to wrap_content

19871153
children	parent
in xsd any two elements of the same name appearing as children of the same parent must have the same type

19871153
children	parent
readers who need full information will have to consult the spec. it is a consequence of this that in a typical document validation the type associated with an element is fully determined by the path from the root of the validation episode to the element itself and does not depend upon its position among the children of its parent

19871171
folder	directory
making sure the value i chose for java_home was the path of the directory above the bin folder - in my case c program files x86 java jdk1.6.0_16

19871187
udp	tcp
however even though the responses are relatively small now the tcp handshake and teardown still imposes a significant const this is why many trackers are moving over to udp bep15

19871263
children	parent
this will allow for things like font-size to change etc. and prevent the children from overflowing the parent

19871272
pull	push
do a git pull then try to push that s what the message is saying

19871302
getter	setter
actually if you think about it the properties or getter and setter are really just implementations of what is in the link - the setter has a parameter that sets the local variable to the value you want and the getter returns a read only version of it

19871330
post	get
i read lot of post talking about that like replace separator by or use outer to the join or group_by p.project_id before using get method don t work

19871349
children	parent
in chrome the parent page a placeholder link active4 responds but so do all the children pages active4a-c in both ie and mozilla the individual child page active4a responds but the parent page active4 doesn t

19871353
rtsp	rtmp
what no one seems to mention is the awful latency that hls brings to the table with is chunk video it can be 30 seconds if you are doing real-time streaming like video surveylance the rtmp and rtsp are the better solutions

19871362
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to get the download to work on firefox for android but not the native browser or google-chrome for android

int	chars
void debugstringtofile chars const int chars const int int int int int

19871410

i suspect these may actually be octal not hex in which case you want rather than but nothing else would change

19871416
multiplying	add
what i wanted to do is multiplying the .price with .orders_count for each product and add them all up to get a total cost for the campaign

19871444
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the problem in the code is that it tries to initialize a uitabbarcontroller as the rootviewcontroller of a uinavigationcontroller in this line

19871482
pull	push
sadly it does not appear as though html5 project types have matured to the point of the php project types with things like supporting remote pull push of changed files

19871528
build.gradle	gradlew
my build.gradle was set to use com.android.tools.build gradlew 0.5.+ which is incompatible with the latest version of android studio

19871531
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
i know i need to have separate methods so it evaluates multiplication and division first then adds the addition and subtraction afterwards

19871531
division	multiplication
when i try anything involving multiplication or division like 6 6 it will only print the first character which would be just 6 in this instance

19871552
folder	directory
i changed the structure of codemirror assets i have a single directory called assets that contain a folder js with all the javascripts including codemirror modes so i am thinking that this is no longuer valid

19871597
versioning	upgrade
also if you develop on a mac please be aware that osx mavericks upgrade the local versioning of php from 5.3 to 5.4

i have an input field in a container everything works fine in firefox but when i tested it on mobile google-chrome safari the text field overlap to the right

19871724
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but not in google-chrome and mobile

19871779
stdout	stderr
by does not work i mean that it does not fall into the if block and therefore it goes on to execute the rest of the code and runs into all sorts of errors because the remainder of code is expecting stdout to be populated which it s not if there s any value for stderr

19871783
subtract	add
based on you code you should simply re-calculate the price from scratch don t add and subtract values as it s to easy for the state to go awry

19871812
folder	directory
when running the test app it tries to find the .so in a directory relative to the project directory but since the application is being ran from the folder the executable is located in it can t find the library

19871866
width	height
same width height as your stage align to top left under modify- align with align to stage ticked

19871893
webkit	blink
notice that it s not using -webkit-translate3d and at this point browsers based on webkit blink are the only ones that don t support unprefixed css transforms

19871893
google-chrome	safari
so that rule is not setting a transform on in google-chrome or safari which is why your page works there

19871902
macports	homebrew
you are using both macports and homebrew maybe it is problem

19871915
post	get
get is get and post is post

19871915
submit	submission
if you want to display the submit result in same page you can consider using jquery s to hijack form submission and append the result to dom after success though that s another question

19871939
udp	tcp
again the tcp is a reliable protocol comparing to udp where the client never sends back acknowledgements

19872001
post	get
i am trying to get recent post only in the category of the current post while excluding the current post but i can t get it to work

19872008

19872045
move	drag
if i create a text element and add a drag handler it does not move on a touch device

19872045
move	drag
i can see that the move event gets triggered but the element does not drag

19872045
move	drag
if i create a path element and attach the same drag handlers that path element move just fine on a touch device

19872045
google-chrome	firefox
all elements move fine on both google-chrome and firefox on my laptop

19872103
versioning	upgrade
application upgrade â as you release updates to your application you must continue to sign the updates with the same certificate or set of certificates if you want users to be able to upgrade seamlessly to the new versioning

19872119
memset	calloc
if this were intended to initialize the array memset or calloc would be better to use

19872131

19872303
alarmmanager	wakelock
i know how to use alarmmanager with a repeating alarm and call requestsingleupdate so that i only need to hold a wakelock each time the the alarm goes off but because of the increased accuracy of using requestlocationupdates at least in my tests on my phone i would like to use that method instead

19872412
portrait	landscape
even in reverse portrait and reverse landscape

19872424
width	height
in your particular example because the gradient is simply a repetition of a single row pixel it varies along the horizontal dimension but stays uniform repetitious along the vertical dimension my suggestion is to store it as an image width 955 height 1 and use tiling to fill the screen

19872446
portrait	landscape
because according to your thread you can see you are getting only two angles 0 and 90 because of landscape and portrait mode

19872452
mockups	prototyping
i am prototyping a few mockups for my site and have decided to use foundation

19872511
portrait	landscape
the landscape or portrait queries will only really tell you the aspect ratio of the browser window so not reliable

postgresql	greenplum
greenplum isn t postgresql it s a separate product based on postgresql 8.2

19872536
postgresql	greenplum
you tag them greenplum as well as postgresql

19872536
postgresql	greenplum
thanks for including the code and mentioning that you were using postgresql and greenplum though

migrate	upgrade
it would be best not to do in in place upgrade but rather do a clean install and migrate applications

19872574
post	put
unfortunately it is still returning a 200 status ok when using post or put

19872619
mouseup	mousedown
the mouseup code is still customizable within the mousedown functions of the clickable elements so it this handy if you have lots of clickable things like i do

19872623
portrait	landscape
if you just want to portrait reverse portrait and landscape reverse landscape you can use

19872637
width	height
i m currently using context.createimagedata width height

19872653
width	height
the two buffers needs to match in width and height of course

19872706
post	get
this code is not posting and did not change type from get to post

19872719
min	max
an approach that wouldn t be nonvirtual if types like float would just implement something like inumeric or iaddable ... we would at least be able to write a generic min max lerp and based on that clamp maprange bezier ...

19872780
rss	feed
so i m currently getting this rss feed but the root element is unsupported so i need to add an tag to the bottom top of the xml files

19872800
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
i made a login dialog with jtextfield and jpasswordfield

19872867
i2c	spi
many times the choice between i2c or spi is made based on what the parts you want to use are providing as the interface

19872873
put	get
the variable extension01.event.ext is generated by protocol buffers and can be used get put the values of extensions

19872886

i am new in web api and i am creating a demo with default web api i see that valuescontroller has default 4 functions get post put and delete

19872925
hash	md5
to do that would require taking the bcrypt hash password and getting pack to the original plaintext password so that you could apply the md5 or sha1 to it

19872939
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf if not already enabled and then put this code in your document_root .htaccess

19873001

19873147
post	get
to get all the post no matter what category i used

19873151
int	double
you are actually using a long not a double so you cannot have significant digits because long only takes on int values

19873244
put	get
i am using the following code to get the time difference and put it in a hidden input field

19873297
punctuation	words
for a fairly simple solution just find matches for a regex like match a capitalized words followed by 15-25 words potentially with commas or semicolons following them then followed by a final words and an ending punctuation mark in some large block of text

19873297
punctuation	words
to get shorter title-like phrases you could just match any sequence of about 5 words probably without punctuation between them

19873359
width	height	uiview	subviews
sometime during xcode upgrade width or height of uiview or any subviews gets changed

19873359
width	height
look for height and width of your view in size inspector and you might be able to figure out the issue

19873378
uiview	subviews
i ve been able to add them to my uiview by adding them as subviews in static positions which is fine but they re being cut off as they re no longer using heightforrowatindexpath to determine their height

19873394
width	height
but providing height and width to the same div in css prevents the animation

19873415
postgresql	mysql
then based on what i found for connection remote mysql did similar changes to connect to my postgresql database

19873422

owners can have limits set on their disk ram and cpu usage that apply across all their virtual systems either defined on a per-owner limit or from a plan

19873432
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout control the display property while animating fade

19873432
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	show	hide	fadeout
fadein and fadeout are both designed to control the display property just like show and hide but animating only a fade in between

19873432
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	show	hide	fadeout
closer relatives of fadein and fadeout are rather show and hide

19873432
width	height	fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	show	hide	fadeout
show and hide are also meant to control the display property just like fadein and fadeout but in addition animate width and height in between

19873432
width	height
prep set to opacity 0 width 0 height 0

19873432
width	height
process gradually change to opacity 0 width 0 height 0

ubuntu	linux
i just newly upgraded my ubuntu to 13.10 and i found the menus of mule studio 64-bit linux upon the unity bar freezing up can t open any menu from there

19873545
folder	directory
this is when the trailing slash makes sense since it denotes that the current url retrieved the content of a folder not a directory

19873574
int	chars
atoi convert string to int not chars

19873574
int	chars
to store ascii value of chars into int variable do direct assignment of chars to int variable

19873580
int	chars
which is the chars itself since in c the chars is a normal int type just like every other int and a string is an array of chars s which hold the chars codes themselves

19873625
ubuntu	linux
you can just use the terminal as the console on ubuntu and linux you don t need to specifically install the git bash terminal which is what you probably were using

19873635
folder	directory
but there is no usr folder in the pythonanywhere directory the directory structure is something like this

19873764
google-chrome	firefox
the validation works fine in google-chrome firefox ie9 and ie10

19873785
implements	extends
i have a functionality to show alert to logged in user before 10 minutes prior to session expiry.a confirmation will be shown to the user before 10 minutes to the session expiry if he is idle for a specified time.f he wish to continue with the current session he can do that or he can extends the session.so i implements it like the following

19873878
post	put
it s too late to put another answer to this post but...anyway

19873883
put	get
i have built a soap api with yii is quite easy and i have use it to communicate between two websites to get and put data in the same database

19873905
qstring	qtextstream
in your case maybe qtextstream or even qstring would do

19873905
qbytearray	qiodevice	qbytearray	qtextstream	qtextstream	qiodevice	qstring	qiodevice	qstring	qbytearray	qstring	qtextstream
qtextstream can operate on a qiodevice a qbytearray or a qstring

19873905
qstring	qbytearray
as for qbytearray qstring should be preferred to it whenever possible

19873905
qstring	qbytearray
in addition to qbytearray qt also provides the qstring class to store

19873937
single-quotes	double-quotes
replace the single-quotes with double-quotes and see if that fixes it

19873964
ceil	floor
if you just want to round the result you can use ceil floor round or fix which results in a floating point variable that just happens to have no fractional part but you will get rounding errors for really big numbers

19873971
integer	fractions
this follows similar logic to how fractions and negative powers or non-integer factorials are created from their positive integer variants

19873971
division	modulo
however once it was decided ruby would return sign of modulo result matching the divisor as opposed to matching the division as a whole that set how the rest of the numbers work

19873971
division	modulo
this is entirely separate design decision from how integer division and modulo arithmetic methods work

19873973
pull	push
i have a single remote repo and a few computers that can pull and push from the remote

19874051
strcpy	strncpy	printf	strcpy	printf	strncpy
you can use the function printf or printf or strcpy or strncpy

19874051
printf	strncpy
instead of explicitly mentioning size 250 in printf and strncpy you can use the sizeof function instruction instead

19874115
free	strdup
however if you don t have an already allocated string have a look to strdup when the source string could possibly be free

19874166
for-loop	loops
i would like to also use decorators on loops for-loop for example and also to blocks of code

19874191
mouseleave	mouseenter
i would suggest use javascript to add remove a class by name hover on mouseenter and mouseleave

19874201
google-chrome	firefox
to the best of my knowledge the css transforms as shown in the jsfiddle you linked are not standardised in terms of their effect when it comes to but they all worked for me in ie10 and latest google-chrome and firefox

19874253
waitpid	fork
you can seamlessly restart your process as it dies with fork and waitpid as described in this answer

19874299
folder	directory
i placed the tessdata folder in my .exe directory also

19874323
qstring	qbytearray
you may build the qstring you want to initialize qbytearray

19874323
qstring	qbytearray
to then convert from qstring to qbytearray you can do

19874336
macports	homebrew
i also suggest you to use homebrew instead of macports

19874336
rbenv	homebrew
here are the steps to install rbenv via homebrew

19874356
qstring	qbytearray
from qbytearray to qstring do

19874406
restrict	shared
by using shared access signature if you want to give them restrict access to blob storage you would need to use sas as described by dan dinu

19874443
hash	md5
the difference between crc32 and md5 is that md5 generates a larger hash that s harder to predict

19874499
mandrill	griddler
i m trying to set up inbound emails in rails 3.2 app using mandrill and griddler

19874499

19874527
integer	unsigned
i need to read the first 4 bytes and convert them in a single unsigned integer and then in a string

19874530
width	height
if you set a layout constraint to pin the height and width then you wouldn t need to set the frame

19874534
range	minimum
indeed in the range of integers 1..m any m there is one integer which takes much longer to test than any other integer in the range and this time is the irreducible minimum that your program will take

19874559
put	get
you can get service reference with getservice and put as a contructor parameter of a new thread

19874573
mouseleave	mouseenter
the solution directed towards by a friend was to replace the single hover event and toggle parameter with unique mouseenter and mouseleave events with this being the final code solution

19874594
qbytearray	qiodevice	qbytearray	qtextstream	qtextstream	qiodevice	qstring	qiodevice	qstring	qbytearray	qstring	qtextstream
qtextstream can operate on a qiodevice a qbytearray or a qstring

19874723
charat	indexof
your example would already work but since indexof would return a number if you give it an argument that makes sense and a number doesn t have a charat method

19874747
squash	merge
you are squash all newer upstream commits into a single one that will then be merge into your repository

19874789
min	max
for each subsequent values clip the previous value inserted in the new array between the min and the max from the sliding window

19874789
min	max
we find for min and max

19874789
min	max
and for the next value i clip 3 the last value inserted between 4 and 5 the min and max found at index 1

19874798
hex	binary
so far i have been compiling all my code in head and using hex editors to produce binary files that can be used as starting program memory

19875158
mdpi	hdpi
so i need the values in pixel for ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi and xxhdpi

19875167
strcpy	strncpy
if you want to copy a string into buffer starting from the first character of buffer you should use standard c function either strcpy or strncpy

19875180
inline	inlining
function objects like these can generally be inline by the compiler and the compilers tend to be good at inlining them as well since this technique is used frequently with the standard c++ algorithms

mdpi	hdpi	screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi
there is no full list of screens resolutions there are no fixed values in pixels for ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi and xxhdpi

19875373
width	margin
the zeros define the width of the margin and if i understand your question correctly you want to suppress those margins

19875380
width	height
example which resizes the background image to fit the width of the screen where image height is calculated automatically while maintaining proportions

19875409
stdout	fflush
in the first case asdasd is appended to the buffer of the stdout stream but since there is no new line there the buffer is not fflush and nothing is actually sent to the terminal

stdout	fflush
as already shown by john zwinck fflush stdout

19875504
typedef	struct

i was using tortoisesvn with ignore-on-commit but that pop-up a user dialog box that you can t suppress from the command line and when i run my build script and go and make a cup of tea i hate it when i come back to discover it s waiting for user input 10 of the way through

19875533
oncreate	ondestroy
this is also the life time of the service so the lock is aquired in oncreate and it is released in ondestroy

19875565
translation	transliteration
an algorithm must analyze each character only once and translation it into the approriate transliteration

19875669
jboss	glassfish
this solution has been used extensively with many enterprise grade systems deployed in glassfish application server and jboss

19875691
maven	pom.xml
in maven the best practice and of course supported by maven itself which means a requirement is that the parent upsilon-node in your case should not contain any code maven forces you to define packging pom.xml

19875696
projectile	angle
say you know the angle that the projectile was launched at then you can use trigonometry to find the component breakdown

19875697
int	chars
standard c++ types such as int or chars have ctors so you can have expressions like

19875710
put	get
when i put my keyboard apostrophe in the php file i get a 500 internal server error when requesting the php file

19875779
readonly	temporary
a reference to a const type supposed to just observe the value as readonly then passing a temporary value such as 52 is legal

19875791
folder	directory
read-only files don t create an issue - but renaming a folder with open files inside it or renaming the current working directory will create problems

19875794
folder	directory
cleared db temp files as well folder temp directory

19875794
installation	upgrade
i ve upgrade the installation from 4.5 to 6.1.3 which probably caused the loss of the image-links

19875814
width	height
it s not really due to having a width or height rather than they are in a rule that is more specific and thus has priority

19875835

chunked	transfer-encoding
chunked transfer-encoding allows to send data without knowing the size of the content

19876082
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
instead of uinavigationcontroller you can use uitabbarcontroller and set it view controller as the one one in which you are supposed to browse the photos

19876110
udp	tcp
because the only relevant difference between tcp and udp is that tcp has correction for packet loss and similar and udp does not

19876113
udp	tcp
it works with tcp too but not that good as with udp

19876133
margin	height
the right approach is to find out navigation bar height and add bottom margin -navigationbarheight

postgresql	mysql
such as mysql db2 sql server sybase and postgresql

19876218
keydown	keyup
the function waits for one of the following events input focus keydown keyup it may look a bit unnecessary to use this many events but i tested a lot to find this combination which works crossbrowser and always fires no matter if only single letters are entered the key is continually pressed or text is pasted into the textarea

19876218
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop iterates over this arrays and checks for every line respectively element of the arrays if it exceeds the before set maxlength

for development purposes i suggest ignoring the pixelated font on google-chrome and looking on firefox or ie or on a mac device

19876225
google-chrome	safari
edit as i am now a mac user i can t check it but i think this is a webkit issue so when i say google-chrome i also mean safari

19876246
versioning	upgrade
it was working fine in earlier versioning maybe because it s contextpath was same to the package cashless which i changed to gccount during upgrade

19876265
gif	png
save the image in png or gif format because jpeg doesn t support transparent backgrounds

19876288

and when it is in portrait the one and two textviews fill the width of the screen which is what i want but when i rotate it to landscape mode the textviews do not take up the full width of the screen

19876716
portrait	landscape
if you notice text box one for example goes all the way to the edge in portrait view but not in landscape view

19876737
ienumerable	ilist
nor it implements ienumerable and ilist so it won t cast to either of them too

19876832
factors	mean
this does not mean that it cannot go any faster -- just that beyond a certain problem size whatever is faster can t keep on increasing the speed difference by more than a probably small linear factors

19876846

19876925
zlib	libpng
edit i set library directories to include the path where libpng and zlib libraries are

19876937
inline-functions	inlining
compilers are getting better with inlining the use of function pointers where the function is actually known but contemporary compilers certainly don t always inline-functions calls through function pointers even if all the context would be there

put	get
i am able to get value stored in node id but when i put an alert on the message variable i don t obtain any result

19876951
stateless	stateful
there are a couple of ways you can do this depending on whether you are using a stateless or stateful session

19876990
post	get
you should post your code to get the perfect answer but i guess there is a problem of positioning of the div in which these two images are and also set height of image according to the div positioning

19877017
min	max
you can use numpy.clip to perform the clipping operation in a vectorized way but computing the min and max over a moving window is going to entail some python loops and a deque or stack structure like you ve already implemented

19877046
width	height
in details height is getting larger than expected and event more than width

19877055
solaris	aix
i m particularly interest in linux glibc solaris and aix

19877059
range	max	range	min	min	max
main problem why i cant adopt those solution is that every of my random values has different range and i need the values to be uniformly distributed withing the range no frequency occurances at min max for example which happens if i cut off the values which are less greater than min max

19877059
range	max	range	min	min	max
i also thought of an soultion taking a random number in that example value 1 2 or 3 generate the value within the range either between min max or min and the rest of the sum depending on which is smaller substracting that number of my given sum and keep that going until everything is distributed

19877116
sum	coalesce
i have tried to do coalesce sum km 0 and i have also tried to use the ifnull function around the sum

19877124
width	height
after some experimentation with setting the width and height of a kinetic layer i noticed that they appear to have no acertainable effect

19877127
int	double
i am trying to calculate some int and i know that the answer of the calculation will contain decimals so i have to use double

19877170
textview	imageview
i am trying to have textview overlay over imageview

19877268
scheme	racket
i find that simple things like function calls and loops and even just loops incrementing a counter take far more time in python and ruby than in chicken scheme racket or sbcl

19877268
scheme	racket
racket and sbcl are jitted but chicken scheme is either statically compiled or uses a non-optimizing interpreter both of which should be badly suited to dynamic languages and slow

19877328
textview	imageview
wrap a textview and imageview into framelayout put the textview in framelayout after imageview

19877360
postgresql	mysql
database software i know like mysql postgresql etc

19877400
put	get

19877549
width	height
scale a given bitmap to best-fit inside a window need to know the width and height of in pixels

19877562
getter	setter
if that is the case classes should not invoke their own getter or setter methods for local variables just accessing the variable directly should suffice

19877608
int	boolean
my public boolean setdate int d int m int y function works fine though

19877635
min	max
ok first the windowing an min max calculations can be done much faster

19877662
width	height	portrait	landscape
as long as landscape means wider than taller and portrait viceversa it means to read the image into memory and check width and height

19877702

i think what you are referring to is when you run as administrator the current directory changes and you can t reference folder files unless you use the full path

19877723
folder	directory
to set the curent directory to the directory of the batch file add this line near the beginning of your bat file before your reference any folder files

19877732
width	height
kinetic.layers always fill the stage regardless of the layers width height setting

19877732
width	height	inherited	properties
the layers width height properties exist because they are inherited from kinetic.container but setting a layers width height has no effect

19877758
google-chrome	firefox
if you created an app for google-chrome or firefox it would work but as a stand alone site it will not work

19879554
google-chrome	firefox
a selenium test suite that works perfectly with google-chrome fails with firefox and there is no good explanation for it

19879651
getter	setter
private instance members can be accessed publicly by ben._data.set or you could re implement rules and or getter setter so someone could still abuse it

19879651
getter	setter
it can still clean up you re object s publicly accessible members and making it easier to use the getter and setter

19879653
width	margin
there are 16 elements in the grid if you calculate the total width in percentage of 7 .box elements per row each with 14 of width the outcome is 98 so the 2 remaining width of the total width is what you call right margin which is in fact part of the element content

19879653
width	margin
you can even remove the property margin 0 auto unless you specify a width because as the width of the wrap is 100 it will never have margins

19879671

here is the problem because the user packets are defined in another assembly i can not possibly know the type of the getter or setter at compile time

19882676
getter	setter
the most derived class i can use for getter and setter is delegate

temporary	tablespace
temporary tablespace is used for things like sorting and hashing if there s not enough space in memory

19883084
temporary	tablespace
if a system runs small oltp queries and has enough memory then temporary tablespace isn t needed

19883084
temporary	tablespace
again dbca wouldn t let you under-size the temporary tablespace even if you wanted to

19883096
qevent	qobject
again depending on what happens inside your application your error may be either signal from qobject or you can send post custom qevent

19883115
hash	salt
hashing the password with its hash as the salt returns the same hash

19883115
crypt	hash
i can totally understand that crypt in php generates a one-way hash of the given string

19883150
opera	google-chrome	webkit	blink
opera 30 same as google-chrome since it uses webkit blink as rendering engine from version 15

19883183
mp3	flac
i have two files in local one is flac another is mp3 and they can print the metadata

19883202
hide	show
if you use checkboxes to show hide groups you can do it this way assuming the checkbox has the id nflcheckbox and the name of the group is nflgroup here

19883206
post	get
you can t use php clientside it is parsed on the server only when visitor requests the page by get or post so using i i + 1 will not work clientside

19883207
pull	push
i tried using the pull push offset and float methods but nothing gave me the correct results

19883212
sorting	filtering
if you don t implemented server side paging sorting and filtering of data you can return all data to jqgrid but use loadonce true option of jqgrid

19883245
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
the gallery works fine in google-chrome firefox and safari but doesnt seem to want to work in ie

19883246
hide	show
my application mvvm light resizes it s main window hide and show it with an animation

19883266
crypt	salt
your crypt function when second argument consists of letters and digits uses only two first characters of salt for encrypting and those two characters are placed at the beginning of the result

19883267
implements	extends
in your case you can create a custom adapter class and extends baseadapter and implements all its methods

19883281
punctuation	words
i want to keep the _ between words but i want to stick each punctuation back to the last words of a sentence without any space between last words and punctuation

19883281
punctuation	words
how to delete all _ between the last words and the punctuation

19883290
post	get
i have went through numerous post about this and still can t get an answer

19883301
scheme	racket
i am trying to create a record for a node in scheme racket so far my code looks as follows

19883317
crypt	salt
although you provided different salt to the crypt function it uses the same salt internally i

19883317
hash	salt
standard des-based hash with a two character salt from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z

19883317
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
and as crypt â s output contains the used salt prepended to the calculated hash using a crypt hash as salt results in exactly the same output

19883329
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie are automatically fixing the error but firefox isn t

19883367
width	height
basically using a sole view controller as initial vc will place the view directly under the main window which just as the screen of the device never actually change orientation width height of the screen is always the same physical sizes no matter orientation

19883377
int	chars
chars 0 to 9 return int 0 to 9

19883394
lxml	beautifulsoup
just as beautifulsoup it uses lxml for fast xml html-parsing and you can access the html-elements jquery-like selectors

19883400
caliburn	prism
you can also look into caliburn micro and prism microsoft

19883416
children	parent
i want to select children when parent selected

19883425
int	chars
if your chars are packed 4 bytes into one int then the below example might help

19883434
equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode for the car class

19883434
equals	gethashcode
note that all fields and properties of these value types will have to conform to the 1st or 3rd option given here either have equals and gethashcode overridden or be a value type also

19883442
folder	directory
in other words for sas to be able to read and write data from a dataset it must know the directory or folder that contains the particular dataset

19883442
folder	directory
sas calls what we humans call directory or folder as libraries

19883453
equals	gethashcode
note that the objects in the sequences still must implement equals and gethashcode correctly

19883463
disk	ram
my ibdata file is now 40 gb big and there are just 8 gb disk space left no i can t add disk space atm and i can t use a ram disk since the server only has 8 gb ram

19883477
for-loop	arrays
basically what i am trying to do is return double.nan for an empty arrays then for any other arrays subtract the data at position i from the average first line under for-loop

19883514
post	get
update - i get the errors when i follow the blog tutorial and navigate to www.mywebsite.com post index

19883517
try-catch	exception-handling
of course you could handle it here as well by adding the try-catch here but as it currently is your method forces the caller to handle the possibly thrown exception-handling

19883556
google-chrome	safari
it looks real nice in safari and google-chrome

19883571
sorting	filtering
problem is i have 3 other features such sorting dropdown that filtering gridview and a button search which also filtering the girdview

19883608
post	get
i am trying to get values from a form in a jsp using javascript and do a post request to a servlet

ssl	https
when using python 2.7s urllib2 i do not seem to be able to retrieve a resource from a https server while using a ssl secured proxy server to following

19883707
getter	setter
turn your controller into a singleton then have a setter getter and the other controller and then access the values

19883726
ssms	sqlcmd
go is only supported by osql sqlcmd and ssms as i understand it and is not supported by .net sql client library

19883743
put	get
it works however if instead of i put lname bdate i will get an error

19883757
superclass	subclassing
if you can use iterable s rather than lists this is very easy to do by chaining the subclassing list with the superclass list

19883791
prepare	execute
yes if one sql statement is execute repeatedly using prepare statements is much better

19883814
sudo	passwd
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli and then type your passwd

19883815
subtract	add
i want each of the buttons to add or subtract a different amount from the value parsed to int in the textview

19883825
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
keep in mind that getelementsbytagname notice the plural s returns a nodelist instead of an element like getelementbyid does

19883835
ng-switch	ng-include
i have moved the itemctrl definition outside the ng-switch and ng-include

19883839
for-loop	loops
then i want to calculate the frequency of each sign with a loops preferably for-loop

19883852
sudo	passwd
i first tried through the curl method as listed in their docs but that requires it to be run as a local user then you re prompted for a sudo passwd which i obv can t do with chef

19883854
folder	directory
now when i try to browse my app it just lists files directory of my app s public directory 404.html 422.html 500.html assets folder etc.

19883865
skphysicsworld	skscene
i see that skscene s skphysicsworld has gravity property and also controls how objects collide with each other

19883867
submit	submission
you could put the submission part inside the validation script for instance and only submit the form if your validation was successful

19883900
for-loop	loops
as to why your inserts are not working you are disposing the command every instance of the for-loop you are also trying to re-add the parameters every time reformat that loops to the following

19883905
richtextbox	textblock
textblock or richtextbox seems doesn t show links in a proper way

19883948
imagemagick	im4java
so whatever command option imagemagick has im4java should have a method for it

19883961
post	get
you can take a look into this blog post on how to using mtpsplit or mp3cut to get the first 30 seconds of your awesome music

19883965
16-bit	64bit
this basically means the property can return win16 when the user is running a browser compiled for 16-bit even though the user is on a 32-bit or 64bit windows machine

19883965
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in this case all the major browsers ie safari firefox and google-chrome agree that my 64-bit windows machine is a win32 platform

19883965
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
as far as ios goes safari google-chrome and mercury agree but opera messes things up

19883965
ia-32	x86
freebsd i386 x86 ia-32 processor

19883972
implements	extends
the main differences between extends thread and implements your target runnable is that when extends thread you are associating the thread with the object you are creating

19884010
textview	imageview
i want to set textview on imageview

19884022
webclient	httpwebrequest
since i have my legacy code base to deal with i figured i d check webclient vs httpwebrequest

19884022
webclient	httpwebrequest
so it seems strange that the higher level abstraction allows uses of socks where as the lower level api doesn t and that there seems to be no webclient - httpwebrequest conversion

19884030
post	get
the_request involves the words get or post etc

19884074
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
right now i m using md5 for password hashing without salt just the pure hash and i m using this only for store the password on the database

19884074
salt	md5
after reading a bit i realized that people doesn t recommend using md5 anymore and use sha256 or above instead i m thinking of migrate to a better hashing algorithm and create my own salt

19884074
hash	salt
as far as i know a salt is just a random piece of text you add to the hash but i don t think it s the best option so i was thinking on something

19884074
hash	salt
i don t know how safe could it be and how difficult is for the hacker to determinate the technique i use the thing is that the result has the same length as the hash and is harder to determinate a salt so if for any reason in the history hacker uses a rainbow table and catches a probable result it will be the wrong

19884075
background-image	background-position	background-image	background-color
the background line is a shorthand for setting background-image background-color background-position etc

19884075
background-image	background-color
if you change it to background-image instead it won t overwrite the background-color style

19884083
put	get
thus you have to get the security object modify it at client side and put it back

19884133
width	height
but the only true way you can check an image width height is by copying it to your server first and using getimagesize to get height and width

19884182
move	drag
i am not trying to drag an object around just move the whole picture

19884202
hash	salt
think hash password + salt instead of just hash password

19884224
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
unchecked-exception also throw only specific exceptions descended from class runtimeexception itself a descendent of exception

19884224
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
while you can use try catch blocks to catch runtimeexception you can t shift these kinds of exceptions into being handled by anything other than their specific runtimeexception a null pointer reference at runtime can only be handled by a nullpointerexception object or one of its superclass objects and nothing else

19884276
fast-forward	merge
it will do a fast-forward merge on master

19884287
superclass	subclassing
due to that you can connect every producer that produces instances of subclassing of a certain type to consumers that accept instances of a superclass of that same type

19884360
super	extends
you can only restrict generic types using super or extends meaning they have to be super- or sub-types of some given type

19884368
put	get	post	get	post	put
in the case of http this interface consists of standard http ops get put post delete

19884472
superclass	subclassing
don t create a subclassing that cannot be used in every case that its superclass can be used lsp

19884559
int	double
there are four versions of setdata double int float long

19884571
google-chrome	firefox
you can use the getcomputedstyle function which is supported by most major browsers - ie9 ie10 google-chrome firefox

19884639
rsa	aes
a 256 bit aes key is probably of compareable strengh as a 2048 bit rsa key

19884640
cpu	irq
an arm cpu typically has two pins fiq and irq that are asserted by devices when they want to generate an interrupt

19884689
width	margin
if youâ re looking to increase the width you can apply a left margin to consecutive s easily

19884691
folder	directory
i am trying to use a batch file to zip all the files and folder in a particular directory into one zipped folder without using winrar winzip or 7zip

19884703
for-loop	loops
using an enhanced for-loop see above loops through the arraylist and print the username and usertype of each user in the arraylist

19884717
inherited	properties
generally but especially when working with inherited scope values i would also highly recommend using an object with a properties set instead of a simple string-variable as this might lead to a detachment throughout the scopes due to how prototypical inherited works

19884744
multiplying	add
then you have to multiplying it by 100 to get 33.333 and using the round function will get rid of the unneeded decimal places and you will get 33 add the sign and you will get a well formatted percentage

19884816
bufferedreader	printwriter
i ve read a documentation about this and it told me to use a socket then a printwriter and bufferedreader for input and output

19884827
width	height
the important part is that the div height should be as the browser window height without scrolling and without hiding overflow and the width percentages should adjust to keep the aspect ratio correct

19884827
width	height
edit 2 just using jquery to handle set width of div based on height

19884830
folder	directory
i still don t fully know how to use it for example i need to give the new directory a path but i don t know how to point to where i am in the folder hierarchy

19884839
portrait	landscape
by random i mean its maybe portrait shaped or maybe landscape shaped

19884849
hash	salt
also it means that both the client and the server have to agree on the hashing algorithm so you can t include a salt which means you re still stored easily-crackable unsalted hash in the server database

19884877
readonly	temporary
heroku is a readonly file system and does not allow writing except for small temporary files

19884926
google-chrome	firefox
on this page the svg elements do not show up in firefox but they are displayed in google-chrome correctly

19884926
google-chrome	firefox
i am using firefox 24.0 and google-chrome version 29.0.1547.65

19884956
google-chrome	safari
remember phantomjs is roughly equivalent to google-chrome 13 or safari 5.1

19884958
integer	fractions
note that you will be performing integer division on your fractions so if you write it as

19884960
onchange	keyup
i m now noticing that if this does actually solve the issue then you ve gotten away from the onchange issue completely because the real trigger now is the keyup event

19885003
sum	coalesce
try using the function coalesce cast sum expr1 as varchar none

19885052
folder	directory
1 make sure the folder_destination is the directory inside the folder assigned to the ftp user you create

19885059
hex	binary
you could print hex which is quite easy to relate to its binary representation with 02x

19885066
iframe	prettyphoto
as it was mentioned the link can be spoofed but since that page should be opened inside an iframe prettyphoto iframe mode then at least you can check if it was opened inside an iframe

19885099
inherited	properties
also note that unlike yours this doesn t test for inherited enumerable properties on the searchobject although you probably don t want to search for inherited properties

19885108
superclass	subclassing
because you have no default constructor which in java means a constructor with no arguments in your superclass your subclassing cannot use the default constructor that would be provided by default when you don t specify a constructor

19885115
ienumerable	iqueryable
here is link to a stackoverflow example about the differences between ienumerable and iqueryable

19885135
free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
as a general rule of thumb for every malloc or calloc or â with caveats â realloc in a program there should be a corresponding free

19885135
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
if you did call free on you would thus free the space associated with the initial realloc be sure you mean realloc and not malloc but you still are leaking due to the malloc for slist_ptr

19885173
google-chrome	safari
to find out if user-agent pertains to safari one must look for the presence of safari but not the presence of google-chrome

19885173
google-chrome	safari
this does not work because search will stop after finding the first instance of one of google-chrome or safari probably obvious to the regex-gurus..

19885173
google-chrome	safari
khtml like gecko google-chrome 32.0.1667.0 safari 537.36

19885226
getter	setter
i think since both getter setter and constructor objectives are to initialize private member variable in a class

19885239
put	get
but i got stuck with some server side issues namely the get and put functions

19885265
getter	setter
wikipedia answers your question about getter and setter quite nicely

19885265
getter	setter
often a setter is accompanied by a getter also known as an accessor

19885305
getter	setter
getter setter can be called at any point in the lifespan of the object

19885305
getter	setter
constructors are used to initialize an object while setter are used to maintain object state for its more dynamic members and getter would be used to access that state

19885346
put	get
i have been scratching my head for hours trying to get it using join but i couldn t get how logically to solve it then put it in mysql code

19885359
debian	linux
i ve got it working on my own personal jenkins server debian gnu linux 7.2 wheezy 64bit

19885362
min	max
i want to add this as three numeric columns min mean max to my data frame

19885387
serializable	deserialization	getter	setter
as a main purpose of getter and setter in this case is serializable and deserialization maybe you should concentrate on dynamically generating serializable methods which would remove overhead of accessing those fields one by one with use of dynamic methods

19885411
get	http-method
right now i need this just to get the http-method so any other or more correct way to do it it s appreciated

19885466
solaris	aix
this works on linux mac os x solaris hp-ux aix

19885496
getter	setter
if they are fully synthesized compiler will honestly synthesize an atomic getter and setter for you

19885496
getter	setter
in some cases the compiler forces you to declare that the properties are nonatomic when you pair a custom setter with synthesized getter or vice-versa

19885499
width	height
i tried using the same code for drawing squares except changing the height parameter to be equal to the width parameter because squares have equal length sides

19885499
width	height
i don t know what the problem is with making both width and height equal

19885536
google-chrome	firefox
i have been able to resolve this issue on google-chrome and firefox using something similar to this approach jquery .one load and error events not working

19885575
jobs	cron
will start running all cron jobs but it didn t

19885575
jobs	cron
i also substituted exec by shell_exec but it sill didn t start the cron jobs

19885619
int	chars
text 5 int chars max

19885647
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop to iterate in an arrays

19885647
for-loop	arrays
the body of the for-loop in this case is simple print the element of the arrays in the given position i

19885683
ssl	https
i had an ssl certificate installed and a redirect to force the user over https but when i first configured hybridauth i didn t took this into account

19885685
post	get
to issue fully authenticated requests for publishing new post for example you ll have to get your oauth2 library with the client id and client secret and have it issue the requests for you

19885715
children	parent
one of the ways to customize your handler s is to make the basic class as generic and to inherit the children with providing some concrete class which logic is related exactly to the inheritor but mostly used only in parent class

19885742
google-chrome	firefox
read local files doesn t load with ajax in google-chrome but work on firefox

19885756
post	put
this will take all the post variables and put them in their own individual variables

19885757
uiview	subviews
i have a uiscopebar as a subviews of a uiview as a peer of a uitableview

19885824
octal	hex
not hex number or octal number

19885837
int	boolean
given all of this you now have to author a loop that leverages the boolean invalidchain and the int getatposition

19885870
width	height
50 width and height of an image centered horizontally and vertically within an image

19885875
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
to make the program faster in your for-loop for iterating your arrays when you find an element that falls out of your chain range you increment the counter and break out of loops

19885918
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
an inline style tag controlling the width margin and height perimeters are getting added to my img element

19885926
children	parent
make sure that every parent node has exactly two children

19885978
width	height
and have a different design height width for both design and runtime

19885997
switching	screens
i switching between the 3.5 and 4 retina schemes to view the app on different screens sizes

19886013
bower	npm
using bower and npm i managed to get everything loaded except i have this one error only on windows

19886021
google-chrome	safari
site loads fine on google-chrome and safari for ios and on my nexus s stock browser

19886052
int	chars
here d will match int within string and replace it with x chars

19886054
children	parent
as you can see the children update are going out of the parent element feeds

19886085
stdio	fflush
if they were written using stdio which again buffers the data unlikely but who knows then they would have to call fflush on that stream to force the system call to write the buffers to disk

19886085
stdio	fflush
so the fsync call is a lower level equivalent of stdio s fflush call

19886085
stdio	fflush
so it s possible you can be doing everything right stdio fflush fsync driver write to block devices and still have the data in ram waiting to fail sitting on some 50 hard drive that said aok boss

19886085
disk	ram
when the db wants to go and get another copy of the 500th row it will see it already has a copy in ram and not need to go to the disk

19886100
portrait	landscape
with ios7 even though the app has the device orientation under general set to landscape and portrait

19886162
google-chrome	firefox
after i tried to open that file on my desktop by google-chrome and firefox but when i double-clicked on .mhtml google-chrome firefox downloaded that file instead of rendering the .mhtml file

19886162
google-chrome	firefox
why google-chrome firefox not support mhtml by default but ie does

19886230
lodash	underscore.js
a new alternative to underscore.js has just been released called lodash its sole purpose is to completely replace underscore.js all together

19886230
lodash	underscore.js
simply drop in lodash remove underscore.js and it works seamlessly

19886230
lodash	underscore.js
when lodash is tested with backbone.js all the unit tests pass which means that it is a perfect underscore.js replacement

19886263
libstdc++	libc++
it s possible to make std not1 work in c++03 by adding a specialization of std unary_negate for predicates with reference argument_type s but neither libc++ nor libstdc++ has done so

19886263
clang	llvm
caveat hopefully off-topic the clang compiler on my macbook apple llvm version 4.2 clang-425.0.28 based on llvm 3.2svn silently collapses references even in mode so that

19886277
typedef	struct
i know what a struct is and how to make one and why you should typedef one.

19886385
rational-numbers	fractions
in python 2.7 i want to create a class of rational-numbers which mimics the behavior of the fractions class in module fractions but overrides the __repr__ method to match the result of __str__

19886385
inherited	subclassing
the problem is i d like to inherited the functionality of all numerical operators methods __add__ __sub__ etc. as well but have the results be instances of my subclassing rather than of fraction

19886396
mp4	h.264
likely the best candidate format would be h.264 encoded video in a mp4 container

19886513
ilist	iqueryable
the gridcontrol can be bound to a data source which implements ilist ibindinglist or iqueryable simply by setting the gridcontrol.datasource property

19886576
int	double
all data types are double except temptimetaken is int - initial values vary - they are input in a different activity and carried to this one via sharedpref with a default of 0

19886590
division	multiplication
there are specific instructions for signed division and multiplication so make sure the functions use those or just use them directly

19886593
keydown	keyup
similar bug reported here issue 118639 in chromium keydown and keyup events do not have proper keycode

19886684
int	boolean
i m trying to make a class that optimizes an array of boolean by storing an ordered array of int whose bits individual bits can be accessed to see if they re on or off

19886684
int	boolean	unsigned	short
for instance an unsigned short int is 16 bits so i can pack 100 boolean into an array of of 7 unsigned short int where the last element acts as padding

19886684
int	boolean	unsigned	short
in main you can see that i made a bitpack object of 32 boolean which will be stored in an array of 2 unsigned short int and i ve verified that this is so

19886702
width	height
the content iframe does not have any height or width set and so is sizing as per the size of content inside

19886713
division	modulo
you take the modulo from the division to conclude it is the 4th char

19886720

it will not give you the change in width and height as you expected

19887021
children	parent
in your initial code the children and the parent can potentially terminate before the sequence of events you hope to take place can ever occurs

19887021
children	parent
the children can die before the parent ever sends a signal

19887021
children	parent
the parent can send its signals before the children ever set up their handler and sigusr1 kill the process because that is its default in the absence of a handler

19888350
free	malloc
you cannot partially free the malloc ed memory

19888350
free	malloc
for each malloc there must be exactly one free to free the memory and it is then free completely

19888350
free	malloc
indeed giving free an argument other than the same pointer returned by malloc or one of the other allocating functions is undefined behaviour

19888350
free	malloc
also malloc and free don t have any knowledge of how you use the memory so they don t know that you ve decided to put an array of struct coin in it

19888350
free	malloc
that is use a separate malloc call to allocate every element in the list or array â note that you must also free them all individually and each exactly once

19888350
realloc	malloc
edit you changed the question to show realloc instead of malloc

19888350
free	realloc
you can only free the pointer returned by realloc not a part thereof nor does free or realloc know that you are using the memory for an array of structs

19888350
free	calloc	free	realloc	realloc	calloc
since you are now calloc ing each data individually you can and indeed must free that part individually but you cannot free part of the realloc ed array â you need to clean it up manually after free ing the data element

19888362
free	malloc
you can only free pointers returned from malloc

19888362
free	malloc
if you try to free pointers not returned by malloc bad things will happen like memory corruption and undefined behaviour

19888363
free	malloc
what you malloc ed you need to free

19888369
multicastdelegate	delegation

19888657
width	height
so changing the width and height won t bring alabama back onto the page

19888657
width	height
in summary viewbox x y width height describes the bounds of the content of the page

19888657
width	height
width and height tell the renderer how big to scale the area described by the viewbox

19888657
width	height
so in this case all the content in that 1000x500 viewbox will be scaled so that it fits in the box defined by the width and height 500x500

19888671

integer	unsigned
make operand 1 unsigned and operand 2 integer or better natural if negative values would be a mistake and the implementation will be much smoother cleaner simpler easier to understand

19888870
integer	unsigned
so if you decide operand1 is unsigned and operand2 is natural a subtype of integer you can look at the numeric_std package and see if there is a declaration of sra accepting those parameter types and returning the type you want

19888910
avr	microcontroller
one such situation that i ve just come across programming an avr atmega16 microcontroller is comparing variables to defined constants which apparently doesn t work

for-loop	loops
using an enhanced for-loop see above loops through the arraylist and print the username and usertype of each user in the arraylist

19889120
oncreate	getwritabledatabase
it likely calls getwritabledatabase which calls getdatabase and it will throw this exception since oncreate is already called in the context of getdatabase

19889120
oncreate	getwritabledatabase
just use db.insert directly where db is the sqlitedatabase object passed to your oncreate without calling getwritabledatabase

19889129

depending on if these are your powerpoints that you want opened i personally would put vba script in them to trigger on_open and on_close that will get you a clean customizable popup error message

19889599
put	get
why not put those options in a html file and get it like i mention

19889669
inherited	properties
the reason because you do not get the properties correctly it s probably because is inherited and the console you re using node browser displays only the own properties of an object like object.keys without crawl the whole prototype s chain

19890247
floating-point	fractions
to keep the algorithms largely the same and to retain use of the same floating-point hardware operations at least at first i would ideally like to keep converting this fractions representation into floating-point representation performing the operation s then converting back into fractions representation for storage

19890247
floating-point	fractions
i m concerned that any potential gain in exactness of representation we re wasting much of the floating-point format currently by using this specific range will be completely out-weighed by the requirement to round twice going from fractions representation to floating-point and back again

19890258
setinterval	settimeout
i tried with both settimeout and setinterval with no luck

19890303
implements	extends
well this is what you wanted have anotherclass implements example with some default implementation as well as extends another class or i understood you wrong

int	chars
just specify the value as an int rather than a chars literal

19891493
int	chars
the problem here is that the chars sequence 2.5 clearly starts with a valid int with 2

19891493
int	chars
one way to you could deal with the situation is to read an int and if this is successful inspect the chars which caused the read operation to stop if this chars is a suitable separator a space the end of the file etc. you consider the input to be successful

19891493
int	chars
in general reading an int and stopping when a chars is encountered which doesn t suit an int is the desired definition of success

19891930
super	self
such as self super init

19891938
typedef	struct
this second one is the problematic one you need to scan through all your source code and identify all the names of class struct union s and typedef s so that when you reach an expression of the form simplified for this example you know whether or not __w names a type

19891938
typedef	struct
this means you need to know whether is a type or not which means scanning every struct class union for typedef s and resolving public inheritance for base class typedef s and private inheritance + using statements

ideally hide the form and show the message

19892562
integer	unsigned
i think the vc behaviour you observe is a bug unsigned arithmetic is well-defined and you re right that the overflow should wrap around to an integer less than 17

19892568
implements	extends
you could extends any number of existing handlermethodargumentresolver base classes or you could implements the interface directly yourself but most likely you would use something like this

19892572
multiplying	division
there is several ways how to do it but efficient and fast for that big input 10 mil might be by summing - not dividing not multiplying not even using remainder after the division

19892629

19893124
int	chars
for built in types as int chars etc

19893145
setinterval	settimeout
you could either use setinterval or set a new settimeout when the first one fires or you could set 5 timeouts each with a different time interval

19893162
int	chars
passing built-in types like int chars by pointer does not result in better performance results

19893204
setinterval	settimeout
it seems that you are really looking for setinterval rather than settimeout

19893210
hide	show
and i can t hide show some unrequired divs with toggle function

19893815
int	double
you have no classrooms constructor that takes a string int double double so therefore this classrooms roomnum seats len wid is an error

19893826
for-loop	loops
when you do not use brackets after your for-loop only the first statement is used as a loops

19893840
multiplying	add
to do this my approach is to add a field to the document with the boosting value and then multiplying this value by the document _score

19893856
put	get
no matter what i put in there i cannot get any of my json data to be displayed on the screen

19893919

width	height
as you can see within the definition i ve added tags for the width and height properties of the canvas

19894237
width	height
iâ m using bootstrap which as you know is based on a 12 grids horizontally but what if you want fit these boxes in height alongside of width fit the boxes in length automatically for instance with some percentage for each div length like width

19894244
int	double
when you replace the int s with double pointers you need to change the comparisons - to compare the pointed to values not the pointers themselves

19894345
width	height
i suggest that you check out different horizontal oriented grids and how they use min-width and different row and comlumn-classes.you should be able to use min-height and max-height instead of min-width and max-width and height instead of width

19894348
width	height
only if i add a pixel-based width and height the image is shown properly but i want only percentage based values in my fluid grid

19894348
width	height
can i show a background-image without having a pixel based width and height of the containing div

19894379
int	chars
08 is a flag specifying the printed decimal int should be eight chars in width with leading zeroes as necessary

19894476
int	double
works great just changed some int to double

19894477
width	height
you just make 4 boxes which all have position absolute you give them width and height 50

19894481
entities	entitymanager
i have thought to use the callback annotation and check with a query that in the other entities there is no entity with that dni but for that i have to use the entitymanager inside of an entity and this is a bad practise

19894519
width	height	children	parent
to be sure your background container has any width you should care of that by your own setting its height to 100 of its parent or any other fixed height or any auto height dependeintly on children inside

19894530
int	chars
e or e chars and a decimal int or some of the other sequences

19894539

i had the impressino that the default setup for stdout is _iolbf for stderr it is _ionbf and for other streams it is _iofbf

19894731
std	ostream
there are a few setups for std ostream though

19894731
std	ostream
the normal setup for an std ostream to flush the buffer when the buffer is full or when explicitly requested where unfortunately std endl makes an explicit request to flush the buffer causing performance problems in many cases because it tends to be used as a surrogate for n which it is not

19894731
std	ostream
an interesting one is the ability to in.tie an output buffer to an input stream if in.tie contains a pointer to an std ostream this output stream will be flushed prior to an attempt to read from in assuming correctly implemented input operators of course

19894731
cout	cin
by default std cout is tie d to std cin

19894731
cout	cin
nearly forgot an important one if std ios_base sync_with_stdio wasn t called with false the standard c++ streams std cin std cout std cerr and std clog and their wchar_t counterparts are probably entirely unbuffered

19894751
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to show a joptionpane input dialog and then have the view come up after but i am not sure why it is not appearing the view pop-up but not the input dialog i try commenting out the view part and nothing happens

19894824
rvm	bundler
i am using rvm ruby 2.0.0 and bundler

19894841
typedef	typename
the second is that you use typedef for that structure too but have something after the typename stackdatatype

19894843
typedef	struct
in old days you had to explicitly typedef structures to avoid using struct everywhere

19894843
typedef	struct
in face struct foo together was a type and foo was not unless you explicitly made it a type by typedef

19894860
put	get
to get it in spss go in then put your variable in the list called variable s

19894875
typedef	struct
i think you do not need to typedef a struct again in c++ it again defines a struct which is unnecessary

19894914

i think it has something to do with the pow function in math.h but i m unsure

19895777
free	malloc
it s an object wrapper around a multiple dimensional array of c99 bool s which is malloc ed in init and free d within dealloc which i gather is one of the few legitimate uses of dealloc within arc code

19895806
integer	unsigned
it cannot be converted to an integer type even long long unsigned int - it s way too big

19895858
width	height
the source images have a maximum size of 500 pixels height or width

first let s convert the jks to a pkcs12 keystore with this command

19895920
scheme	racket
you can read this blog post it s an old blog post so it refers to the obsolete drscheme plt scheme for the full reason why racket wasn t designed with that kind of evaluation model

19895925
stateless	stateful
so the api is totally stateless but the web application with gui should be stateful

19895929
width	height
ok so i ve moved on from trying to force a certain resolution and gone more towards drawing things based on width and height variables

19895932
google-chrome	firefox
you can see that gray block fades smoothly in google-chrome but it jumps in firefox

19895936

19896162
int	double
declaring a pointer is like declaring any int double etc. variable

19896166
comparator	comparable
note that this approach also requires kitten to implement comparable alternatively you could pass a comparator to your treeset constructor

19896166

a custom image field that creates two db columns one for image path the other is for image s crop information it will be dynamic top left width height informations that user can set via a js component

19896816
int	chars
you should use int temp since fgetc returns an int not a chars

19896823
hex	binary
since md5 checksums are hex representations of binary data just make sure you take the md5 of the decoded binary concatenation not of the ascii or utf-8 encoded concatenation

19896834
min	max
i use first max min and last to make the ohlc data

19896894
put	get
when i run the code and put in my inputs i get seemingly random numbers

19896923
put	get
since the first variables put into the localvariable list are the params it is a simple matter of extracting the first 1 numparams variables to get the params

19896966
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
so you can set the padding to whatever you want but if you have box-sizing set to border-box and a hard-coded width the width will never change unless you have overflow of course

19896990
textarea	textbox
form for creating new entry must have combo box for selecting category like pictures movies etc textbox for title and textarea for content and nothing more

19897006
profiling	benchmarking
profiling benchmarking and locate bottle neck

19897029
for-loop	loops
edit2 i have also solved it by putting a while loops to check if it has reached the end of the stream within the for-loop

19897045
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
i m running linux mint 15 which is based on ubuntu 13.10

19897070
disk	ram
reading the comments i also suppose your systems are quite big so you have enough ram and disk

19897116
subtract	add
on even loops you add num and on odd loops you subtract num

19897187
centroid	convex
clearly the centroid is wrong as the polygon is rather small and convex but yet the centroid falls outside its perimeter

19897195
hide	show
and then bind a click on respective tabs to show their qmdiarea and hide the others but needless to say i haven t tested it

19897200
int	boolean
i have a class mp3track with members track number int track name string artist string in faourites boolean etc

19897231

i solved the issue by instead of drawing directly to a uiscrollview subclass drawing to a uiview subclass added as a subviews of uiscrollview

19897233
daemons	systemd
upstart is an event-based replacement for the sbin init daemons which handles starting of tasks and services during boot stopping them during shutdown and supervising them while the systemd is running

19897325
width	height
i want to create an effect that when i click on an image element it will rotate the content inside it but not the element s width and height my img is 400x300

19897325
width	height
compressing the height or the width of the image based on the position is fine with me as long as it does not rotate the element itself

19897351
put	get
i would say get a zip of 2.8.2 from here and put the unzippied version in your dropins folder of eclipse

19897389
getter	setter
observe the above y ou also can t use jquery as a getter and a setter but rather need to pass your value to the function as an argument so it can be evaluated

19897414
width	height	unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
map1 is a two channel signed short integer matrix and map2 is an unsigned short integer matrix both are of dimension height max 4096 width 1

19897473
onresume	onpause
the preferred way to handle broadcasts is to register in onresume and unregister in onpause

19897526
spaces	delimiter
if you re only using delimiter the next char is whitespace and you can t use hasnextint on white spaces

19897531
spaces	delimiter
since spaces is not delimiter anymore and is definitely not digit this data can t be accepted in hasnextint test

19897588
post	get
using this code i can easily get the total number of post

19897613
folder	directory

the main element is only supported in google-chrome v 26+ and firefox v 21+ so far

19897681
versioning	upgrade
unless and until they upgrade to a modern versioning of ftp just continue to use nlst

19897703
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i created my own jquery plugin after becoming frustrated that the existing shims would hide the placeholder on focus which creates an inferior user experience and also does not match how firefox google-chrome and safari handle it

19897708
width	height	google-chrome	firefox
also because you are setting a width of 400 and a height of 300 on the images while google-chrome does not seem effected by this but some other browsers like firefox will be

19897708
width	height
for example as the image rotates the size rotates with it this is because you don t have an equal size on both width and height of your image so it won t look as tho its rotating naturally in all browsers

19897708
width	height
if you give both width and height the same size you won t have this problem

19897722
min	max
as far as i know the min and max functions are defined in

19897752
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this works in google-chrome and safari but not in firefox 25.0

19897752
google-chrome	firefox
test these in google-chrome and firefox

19897754
express	node.js
i m new to node.js express ejs

19897758
post	get

19897763
libstdc++	libc++
any mixing of libstdc++ and libc++ in builds will cause trouble

19897784
min	max
most likely something inside of iostream has directly or indirectly included some other header that defines std min and std max

19897784
min	max
include algorithm if you want std min and std max

19897796
min	max
while i would not have expected this of min and max it s not too surprising

19897824
multiplying	addition
i m trying to write code for homework that uses recursion and addition to multiplying two integers together

19897833
int	double
if you specify a return type to your gettotalamt int duration as int strprogrametype as string method that would be look like this function gettotalamt int duration as int strprogrametype as string as double

19897872
folder	directory
furthermore there are 4 folder in the directory that i must not delete or modify

19897888
union	distinct
just select one with tags and select one with full text searching and join them with a union distinct

19897901
portrait	landscape
i m newbie at web programming so for setting width there s no problem but when uploading a portrait image it looks annoying i want all the images to be landscape

19897904
width	height
i see parameters on cfdocument like height width and unit but no dpi

19897924
for-loop	loops
then loops over it with a for-loop filling each index with a string.valueof i

19898073
post	get
i m designing a simple rest api and i got get methods working ok however i can t get the post methods working properly

19898076
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie 10 and below i get the message

19898084
comparator	comparable
the api is fully genericized for elements implementing comparable or implementing your own comparator

19898128
hide	show
i have also tried binding the selected value instead and this half works the array controller s selection does change but the options in the popupmenu don t change to show the one that was deselected and hide the newly selected one

19898163
int	chars
working on a program that will read input from a file using the declaration of independence as a test and write the number of int chars strings etc

19898191
children	parent
and apparently you re using 0-based array index so node 0 is supposed to have 1 and 2 as children but this equation gives 1 as the parent of 2

19898191
min	max
this will bubbles the min node to the top not the max node

19898195
quicksort	mergesort
the default collections.sort implementation in java 7 is a mergesort algorithm adapted from timsort. the default arrays.sort implementation in java 7 is a dual pivot quicksort

19898202
portrait	landscape
i have previously done a listview and the list is being displayed whether in landscape or portrait orientation

19898202
portrait	landscape
however in my new app when i decide to change orientation whether landscape to portrait or vice versa it does not load again

19898202
portrait	landscape
i ran the app on portrait mode list present when switched to landscape does not display anything

19898265
openssl	polarssl
i can also confirm the 4 test cases in the question generate valid results on implementations in my t-sql python with openssl and polarssl libraries and in a .net library by jimmith

19898265
openssl	polarssl
tested against openssl 1.0.1e on 64-bit debian and 1.0.1f on 64-bit windows with a 32-bit openssl library called from c mitsuhiko s python pbkdf2 implementation with warner s patch my own sql server 2012 implementation polarssl 1.2.9 and 1.3.4 jimmith s .net and tonplomp s labview implementation

19898271
min	max
then errorbar min data 0.1 max data m sd x should give you error bars

19898279
processors	hyperthreading
there are other algorithms such as psrs that scale to higher numbers of processors but as you are on a core2duo which will probably max you out at 2 true cores + two hyperthreading cores the extra memory needed for psrs would probably be a waste

19898347
width	height
you can also try setting width and height to 1px setting to 0 rarely works for many clients and then set visibility to hidden and just in case set opacity to .0 or 0 just to cover your bases

19898355
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

19898355
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant

19898355
int	chars
numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an int

19898355
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars

19898355
int	chars
the final bit-pattern is given type int and is therefore signed regardless of whether single chars are signed or not a slight change from versions 3.1 and earlier of gcc

19898355
int	chars
if there are more chars in the constant than would fit in the target int the compiler issues a warning and the excess leading chars are ignored

19898355
int	chars
for example ab for a target with an 8-bit chars would be interpreted as â int unsigned chars a 256 + unsigned chars b â and 234a as â int unsigned chars 234 256 + unsigned chars a â

19898360
postgresql	mysql
ilike is quasi-standard it is supported by mysql and postgresql

google-chrome	firefox
in my jsfiddle demo it works fine between google-chrome and firefox ie but on the site firefox ie have a huge bar blank space below the menu

19898494
maven	pom.xml
i have the exact same problem and exact exception but i solved the problem just by specify package type of pom.xml to war like war and right click the project and select maven update project configuration then re-deploy that web module to tomcat server that s it

19898523
google-chrome	firefox
my browsers are google-chrome firefox are latest versions so no issues with them

19898529
move	drag
i wanted to develop a widget container still on python 2.7 and gtk2 which would be placed in a scrolled window and could be freely move and resized in the window such that click drag within the widget would move it inside the window

19898529
move	drag
when you thus drag the corner outside of the window - the scrollbars automatically indicate the new size position of the inner widget note the window got also move a bit in this screenshot below that was manual and unintended

19898535
int	chars
ptr is of type chars while arrayi 1 is of type chars which in c is the same as an int hence the compiler message

19898537
minimum	max	min	max
ford and fulkerson proved the max flow min cut theorem which basically states that the max flow of a graph is equal to the minimum cut

19898540
uicollectionview	nscache
i am using nscache to cache some images for my uicollectionview

19898575
int	chars
ptr is a pointer arrayi is also a pointer but is a chars aka int

19898576
listview	gridview
i m binding data to gridview nested in listview via itemdatabound and when i m paging listview it s loosing datakey value

19898576
listview	gridview
here is full markup of listview with nested gridview

19898611
int	double
you should change the data type for menuoption and selection from double to int

19898684
uilabel	uibutton
for your case where you need to create more than 50 buttons and labels i would suggest you to create a custom uiview with uibutton and uilabel in it

19898684
uilabel	uibutton
and when a uibutton is tapped it will be easy for you to fetch the associated uilabel though the custom uiview object

19898707
children	parent
more ludicrous ideas are subtracting the innertext of the children from the parent but that s an insane amount of work for something that i m sure is trivial

19898721
post	get
i would look up some jquery tutorials on using the get and post methods

19898725
width	height
for setting width there s no problem but when uploading a portrait image it looks annoying i want all the images have same width height but keeping the image looks good not stretced oppressed

19898780
charindex	substr
the basic idea is to use charindex to find the locations of each comma then substr to split out each type from the beginning

19898821
jar	war
here s an excellent article about packaging ejbs in war modules and the differences with packaging in ejb jar modules

19898855
put	get
and when i put hello the char gets the first letter h but the string gets hello and i need just the h to put it on the condition of an if what could i put so the string just get one letter

19898861
put	get
is it maybe because the gravity data is not put into an array- it s just values that get looped through

19898864
rolify	cancan
i will typically use it in conjunction with cancan and rolify

19898900
width	height
using the above constraint-based code the soloview s left and top move correctly to full view and back but when going to full view the soloview s width and height don t animate and seem to just stay at the destination size

19898900
width	height
using the above frame-based code the soloview animates properly to and from full view with the correct width and height

19898917
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
better than using the nsurlconnection convenience methods above you might want to use a nsoperation -based network request

19898917
afnetworking	sdwebimage
the easiest solution for this is to use a uiimageview category such as provided by afnetworking or sdwebimage

19898917
afnetworking	sdwebimage
i d use afnetworking s if you re using afnetworking already for other purposes but i think that sdwebimage s uiimageview category is a little stronger. these not only seamlessly load the images asynchronously but offer a host of other advantages such as cacheing more efficient memory usage etc

19899085
width	height
this is forcing the image to be the width and height of the containing div but that s not what you want

19899116
stdout	stderr
update after adding to config deploy.rb the permissions for log appear to be accurate as i am now getting unicorn stdout and stderr in log unicorn.log

19899128
fgetcsv	splfileobject
it have specific methods to parse lines like that like splfileobject fgetcsv and splfileobject fscanf

19899140

19910395

i am trying to undestand the c functions malloc and free

19913847
free	malloc
however i ve someone could explain to me in which case it makes sense to use malloc and free instead of the regular declaration of a variable that d be great

19913911
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
understanding a little about how when the stack and heap are used would be good when you use malloc or calloc it uses memory from the heap where automatic static variables are given memory on the stack and are free when you leave the scope of that variable i.e the function or block it was declared in

19913911
calloc	malloc
using malloc and calloc become very useful when the size of the data you need is not known until run-time

19913911
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
if you do not know what size is necessary until run-time use malloc or calloc with a corresponding call to free for each use to create memory

19913913
omxplayer	mplayer
mplayer vlc omxplayer ... via commands from different local terminals

19913923
free	malloc
storage that you obtain from malloc is valid until you call free on it

19913925
free	malloc
why to use free after malloc can be understood in the way that it is a good style to free memory as soon as you don t need it

19913925
free	malloc
malloc uses the heap and the complete heap of a process is free when the process exits

19913927
free	malloc
for more detail read heap management with malloc and free

as i mentioned in my comments the reason it is ok for matlab to use double s for indexing has to do with the largest value of an int that can be specified without losing precision in matlab

19918182
int	double
double precision 64-bit floating point numbers can exactly represent int up to 2 53 9 007 199 254 740 992 without losing any accuracy

metal which has a type where min â 350 â max

19918398
post	get
without knowing the nature of your game it is difficult to say exactly but firstly you should use the post method instead of get this way url params will not be readable this is still not completely secure though as anyone can still hit that script with post parameters

19918409
int	double
casting from double to int will always truncate so might not be exactly what you re after

19918409
int	double
you don t need to cast to double either as int + int double will return a double

19918409
int	double
be aware that double round to longs and floats round to int though

19918409
int	double
edit if you do want the higher precision afforded by double then math.round will give you a long which you ll need to cast to an int

19918412
put	get
finally we will get return value rest then we just simply put result and rest together

19918419
phpstorm	aptana
for what it s worth in my opinion phpstorm is worth every penny compared to either a using no ide a text editor b using the free aptana ide eclipse based which are the alternatives i tried before phpstorm

19918787
implements	extends
melt is a lisp-y domain specific language implements as a gcc meta- plugin to extends gcc

19918787
g++	gcc
so you could code your extension in melt for gcc and g++ which would process prog.c while gcc is compiling it and dump appropriate glue code some prog_generated.x file for onc rpc... at least for those functions whose signature involve serializable types

19918852
post	get
if we were to use instead of we would get the same r 111 error as in your original post

chances are you have suphp installed and that is not letting the pages be served from phpmyadmin because they are in the usr shared directory which is restrict by suphp from executing the pages here is a link to a workaroud

19918948
int	boolean
in the overall context of the code it seems to be treating cnt as more of a boolean than an int though

19918974
getter	setter
maybe something like getter and setter getcars in the person object

19918974
getter	setter
also there doesn t seem to be a good way to return objects in the getter and setter that aren t literal nor convert to json without adapters

19918992
min	max
i ve gotten to a stage where i need to set it up to accept argument n which specifies the max and min lengths of the string that will eventually be printed

19918992
min	max
i m fine with picking out arguments on their own but i m not sure how to pluck out those max and min values too

19919066
hide	fadeout
not 100 sure why but debugging the fadeout hide the object but it actually wasn t removed

19919093
super	implements
i found a approach to solve this problem is by subclassing nsview and implements mousedown and use super subviews to get and index and the array itself

19919105
keydown	keyup
keyup keydown is limited to modifier keys in webdriver shift ctrl etc

19919131
config	ini
you have you change those config from the ini otherwise they do not stay that way after the page has been executed so therefore as the user continues using the website they hit the php.ini s session max lifetime session.gc_maxlifetime

19919176
mouseout	mouseup
mouseup and mouseout

19919202
multiplying	multiplication
the 3 places where something would multiplying to zero in the matrix multiplication are now multiplied by the transform variables thus computing a different angle

19919202
cpu	processors
transforms between say rotatex valuex1 rotatey valuey1 to rotatex valuex2 rotatey valuey2 will actually interpolate each directly and use that result inside the css engine all these transforms will be hardware accelerated by the video processors if available instead of the cpu and will be faster than computing the matrix transform

19919206
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
or using any other major web server like apache nginx lighttpd

19919215
equals	gethashcode
when the compiler generates an anonymous type it also generates equals and gethashcode methods to compare it by value

19919216
equals	gethashcode
because the equals and gethashcode methods on anonymous types are defined in terms of the equals and gethashcode methods of the properties two instances of the same anonymous type are equals only if all their properties are equals

19919216
equals	gethashcode
the anonymous type will be created and has an equals and gethashcode implementation based on the properties

put	get
however i noticed that if i put a sleep between the moment i add the element to the dom and the moment i get the outer width it always succeeds

19919420
int	chars
i also cannot use a big int as sql server has a limitation on bitwise operations and will truncate to 10 chars

19919433
put	get
the only way i can seem to get any error out of cucumber is to put an outright syntax error in the step file

19919477
many-to-many	one-to-many
if a s is equal to b s - you have a match which you should store in a new list and then advance both a and b assuming the relation is one-to-one - if it s one-to-many you only advance the many iterator and if it s many-to-many you need a bit more complex solution

19919491

19919634
mouse	keyboard
2 you bind click event to every checkbox in your dom even to checkboxes that are not meant for filtering also it would be more appropriate to use change event instead of click event you can also change checkbox state via keyboard not only by mouse click

19919700
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

width	height
my goal is to create a webview with small bounds and have it animate smoothly to a predetermined width and whatever height is necessary to contain its contents to give the impression of it expanding to its full size

19924203
width	height
the issue is that when i extend the viewport beyond the width of my webview its content height is extended proportionally

19924203
width	height
the result will be an empty webview with a width of 450 css pixels and a content height of 257 device pixels

19924203
width	height
after experimentation it seems that after loading a webview with a viewport that extends beyond its width the content height will always be the maximum of the height required to layout the content and the webview s height multiplied by the viewport s width divided by the webview s width

19924203
width	height
firstly after the layout has occurred i cannot find the appropriate final height of my webview because content height now represents the height viewport_width width instead of the height the content lays out to

ssl and https helps prevent man in the middle attacks to ensure the request from the client browser to your server is encrypted

19942077
ssl	https
secondly if you want to use https and ssl which i highly recommend you ll need to obtain a certificate from one of the providers out there and install it with your webserver which i presume is apache

19942083

starttls	smtps
historically port 465 was initially planned for the smtps encryption and authentication â œwrapperâ over smtps but it was quickly deprecated within months and over 15 years ago in favor of starttls over smtps rfc 3207

19942206
starttls	smtps
the hopelessly confusing and imprecise term ssl has often been used to indicate the smtps wrapper and tls to indicate the starttls protocol extension

19942236
post	put
i m working on an application where we need to have the user click on a share on facebook link button and launch the facebook app with the post option which we can do with fb composer and then have the ability to automatically put text in it so for example we need something like this

portrait	landscape
once the app enters appdelegate.m i would like to detect the orientation of the device and depending on whether the device is in portrait landscape mode display the appropriate view controller

19942299
int	chars
there is an important caveat to that though in that while aggregating statistics for reporting sum of how many numbers or calls chars strings are much slower to count than int

19942299
int	chars
to account for this its important to add an int as an identity column that you can use for counting instead of the varchar or chars field datatype

19942326
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade between similar versioning before by overwriting the bin files and deleting the stuff like umbraco.config examine indexes that get rebuilt when they are deleted

19942326
versioning	upgrade
the official site has a versioning specific upgrade path that seems logical enough

19942341
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
i test this by just putting a console.log at the beginning of that function and there is never anything logged in ie10 but every other browser works fine google-chrome firefox opera safari

when the browser is resized i have a div that may change in height depending on its width

19942418
inline	inlining
that s how most compilers inline recursive functions they use depth-limited inlining to unwrap recursion just like they unwrap cycles

19942455
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning - 3.8.0 and report back if you still have issues

19942534
fflush	gets
but then when your script finishes the writer goes out of scope the file object no longer has any references so it gets fflush and closed

19942539

19942578
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and firefox but for some reason when i use google-chrome the site triggers an email when it loads just about every page within the site

19942691
macports	homebrew
in fact if you want to use homebrew for anything and you do see below uninstall macports unless you really need it for something

19942706
namenode	hdfs
as these files are in hdfs you will not be able to find them on the local filesystem - they are distributed across your cluster nodes as blocks for real files and metadata entries for files and directories in the namenode

19942738
ssl	https
if you simply send the vendor id from your app be sure to use https and verify the ssl certificate on the server to ensure that you are connecting to your own server

19942784
cpu	processors
an application running on a broken os can use the processors id to detect when they re running on a different cpu from last time

19942784
cpu	processors
the processors id returned by this instruction is just a value in an msr and the os has to set this value on each cpu to something different - otherwise rdtscp will say that the processors id is zero on all cpus

19942800
put	get
when you put the file in the project directory it means you have error in your code but file is in correct location - if you don t get filenotfoundexception

19942893
affinity	processors
os x supports something called processors affinity

19942893
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity	affinity	processors
every process has a set of processors on which it is allowed to execute - the so-called cpu affinity set of that process

19942893
cpu	affinity
by configuring disjoint affinity sets to various processes those could be made to execute concurrently without stealing cpu time from each other

19942893
cpu	affinity	freebsd	linux
explicit cpu affinity is supported on linux freebsd with the ule scheduler windows nt this also includes all desktop versions since windows xp and possibly other oses but not os x

19942893
cpu	affinity
what this all has to do with openmp is that most openmp runtimes for the listed oses support under one form or another ways to specify the desired cpu affinity for each openmp thread

19942893
cpu	affinity
this is a simple switch - when set to true it instructs the openmp runtime to bind each thread to give it an affinity set that includes a single cpu only

19942906

19942955
viewmodel	caliburn
i have a little feeling that this approach is not completely ok with single responsibility principle - the viewmodel in caliburn micro handles behaviour of the view like reacting to user actions etc. so adding data holding operating responsibility to it does not look good in my opinion

19942961
for-loop	arrays
put the strings into an arrays and use a for-loop

19942963
loops	if-statement
i d recommend researching while loops and if-statement

19943350
button	checkbox
this doesnt compile due at the line t.backgroundimage its is a property of some controls button checkbox etc

19943374
post	get
for example if you have an id in the url and you set an id property in your view model to a different value this is a good sign that the id names need to be more specific but bear with me the value you set will make it during a get request but during a post the value in modelstate will be used which will have come from the route

19943390
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfectly in firefox however not in google-chrome

19943430

19944204
hide	show
trying to forcefully do it using works for the hide but during the show everything goes crazy the table results view flickers the original tableview doesn t scroll back down etc

19944777
google-chrome	firefox
so for some reason i have a per tile border around my tiles in firefox but not in google-chrome

19944788
getter	setter
getter and setter aren t really idiomatic in c++ it s more common to just make the members public

19944788
getter	setter
the purpose of getter and setter is to allow a decoupling of a value from its affect on an object allowing more complex code if needed to maintain consistent state for example

19944788
getter	setter
for some interesting commentary on the utility of getter and setter in c++ see getting abstractions

19944788
getter	setter
dr getter and setter are only a touch better than public variables try to use a higher level of abstraction instead

lseek	fseek
yes it is proper to use lseek 2 and fseek 3 on files on proc pseudo-file system

versioning	upgrade
in a production environment you d be running a recent native install of linux and the initial install of docker would be easy and a one-time event in a cloud environment you d probably not upgrade a working machine but instead spin up a new one with the latest pre-tested docker versioning and the equally upgrade tested new containers

put	get
info from the network panel calling the http function above triggers two simultaneous requests one put and one get

19951866
put	get
the put returns a 301 code and the get returns a 500 server error which i think is to be expected as this endpoint is not set up to respond to get only to put and delete

19952003
post	get
check get parameters - they don t seem to use post when redirecting back to merchant site

19952179

width	height
the way i would really like to display these would be in a horizontal accordion but given the fact that the content is mostly dynamic in the sense that the height may adjust of the radgrid given the number of records it holds or the width may adjust of the chart depending on how many columns it is to show a fixed width version is really not going to work.

19952347
int	chars
it seems that the code formats the number 12 into binary 1100 and then each chars is turned into an int and added to p

multiplying	add
imagine what happens when you add your code that defines the add and multiplying methods that work on numbers and then include a library that deals with vectors which also defines the add and multiplying methods but which work on vectors

19952848
put	get
evidence for this is that if i check the network panel for all the other successful http functions they also have two actions visible the original put get delete etc + a get

19952857
onresume	onpause
if that is the case you would register the foreground dispatch in the write activity s onresume method and disable it again in the corresponding onpause method

the simplest way is to store values of checkbox and radio button into an array and then save it to localstorage

19953111
button	checkbox
here is how you can collect values of all checkbox and radio button store them and then read them on next page

19953150

19953263
versioning	upgrade
i tried to upgrade from an older versioning but i get

19953269
width	height
i ve run into a problem where i would like to scale multiple svgs to a given width and height

19953269
width	height
each svg elements needs to be scaled to a width and height

19953269
width	height
also the width and height of the svg are set to 100 so calculating the scale factor would be the way to go but simple formulas like

19953269
width	height
to get the width and height of the svg i use the getboundingclientrect method

19953269
width	height
the reason the formula above doesn t work is that two svgs that are similar in the sense that they are the same symbol but with different width and height needs to be scaled to the same desiredwidth and desiredheight

19953269
width	height
the formula above doesn t scale both to the same width and height even though they are supposed to look identical same desiredwidth desiredheight and symbol

19953288
width	height
when an element receives display none retrieving it s size in javascript will result in zero width and height

19953288
width	height
there s probably some code in kogrid that is reading the width and height and doing something with it programmatically

19953288
width	height
their width and height should remain stable

19953303
width	height
note that it names a resulting png s with â œ_ width x height â suffix

19953307
popover	tooltip
checking source code we can see that popover is loaded first and before than tooltip file

19953342
min	max
html 5 is not supported by the browsers that i have to support - so i can t use the build in min max check

19953342
min	max
append two hiddenfields to this input field with the values and check with global inputvalidation function if the input value by an specific input field id matches the min max clause

19953342
min	max
dont use a database but define min and max in inputvalidation function like

19953368
spaces	linefeed
the right-most element has a white spaces character cr linefeed before the closing tag and this generated content is placed after the white-space which shows up in some browsers

19953393
put	get
i ve put it in the code behind file and by adding it to the textchanged event on the textbox it get it to run every time the text changes

19953454
post	get
so this almost makes me think that mvc parses datetimes different on being a get and post

19953458
mdpi	hdpi
i am creating an app which will run on ldpi mdpi hdpi xhdpi xxhdpi

19953486
mouseleave	mouseenter
the mouseenter part works perfectly with the image and text both scrolling to the left at the same time but on mouseleave however in chrome and what appears to be only chrome the text will move first then the image will follow later the image animation is firing much later than the text

19953569
post	get
being a get and post

19953569
post	get
in get the dates are always expected to be in the form yyyy-mm-dd whereas for post the current culture is taken into account

19953585
jquery	tooltipster
try using tooltipster or you can create your own jquery function for this

19953587
width	height
this means in landscape the keyboards width is actually its height and visa versa

19953587
width	height
if it is landscape it will swap the width and height values of the keyboardsize variable to ensure that the correct values are being used in each orientation

19953592
submit	submission
i need to submit form to databse my form and its php code for submission into database working correctlyn in localserver but when i upload it in main server after submission an empty php file is shown no error messages data also not entered into database

19953596
implements	extends
i was thinking of extends the zend db resultset with a application specific version with a differently implements of setarrayobjectprototype method

19953602
stdout	stderr
--results should save in outdir 1 val1 2 val2 stdout and outdir 1 val1 2 val2 stderr

19953627
post	get
id is the most efficient way to identify your post but before you can get to the individual post you may need to identify the post in question to get the id

19953661
children	parent
one parent polymer-element named example-script because we can only use one script declaration in a polymer templates file and children that extend from this parent

19953661
getter	setter
but for that i also need to declare them as static and to make setter an getter in my subclasses otherwise my polymer elements can not share the observable variables

19953686
width	height
when i change the corner radius of linear layout background image child imageview remains unchanged with same width and height

19953702
width	height
this means in landscape the keyboards width is actually its height and visa versa

19953702
width	height
if it is landscape it will swap the width and height values of the keyboardsize variable to ensure that the correct values are being used in each orientation

19953705
width	height
when you create a div and not set it s width and height it resizes automatically to fit it s children

19953727
getter	setter
if you want to use the second solution you can provide getter and setter for the properties of the namevo in the samplevo1

19953734
width	height
i need to get the height and width of a dynamically generated div inside a loop

19953734
width	height
this div is in a loop thus its width height and position change at an interval n

19953734
width	height
i have found that in order to keep the div in the body it s height and width must be retrieved and calculated with the parent to get the difference in size

19953734
width	height
to recap all i need to do is to get the height and width of div

19953793
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i successfully create css of it working fine on google-chrome safari firefox ie9

19953819
children	parent
the good thing about your problem is that your input is always formatted properly so your actual problem is narrowed down to finding children for each node if they exist or finding parent for each node if it has one

19953843
portrait	landscape
i can still use media queries to rearrange rows depending on portrait or landscape orientation for example

19954069
width	height
the problem here is that the div has no content and so on no width and height at the moment you calculate it

19954069
width	height
a solution would be to use visibility hidden property to hide div but always be able to got his width and height

19954224
for-loop	arrays
in other words i am trying to store the information on a file into an arrays as double and displaying the arrays with the enhanced for-loop

wordpress	joomla
i m working on porting an application between different php-based cmss wordpress joomla etc.

19954303
for-loop	arrays
the enhanced for-loop is only useful for looking at the values in an arrays collection already

19954320
for-loop	arrays
it is more about to show you that you first want to fill your arrays with data and then use the new for-loop to iterate over an existing arrays

19954343
squash	merge
i want to know how to squash some commits that are upstream of a merge

19954398

dictionary	map
if it was about mapping you d map more or less any sqldatareader instance to a dictionary in an extreme regardless of which data a sqldatareader instance accesses

19954471
dictionary	map
if you are using python 2 then either map or dictionary is bound to none

19954487
post	get
its better if you can use a hidden field in the form and update its value with the id of the selected radio button and when the form will be posted you can get its value and more over this after once you changed the value of the hidden field you can access it with javascript also with id attibute and can get it in the post by name attribute

19954496
folder	directory
sadly it seems that despite all the wonderful functionality of visual studio the easiest way to omit .svn directory from searches is to use windows explorer to navigate to the .svn directory right click the folder go to properties and click the hidden checkbox under properties

19954545

this method will work on client-side also ie10+ firefox google-chrome opera safari

19954742
getter	setter
also seeing as you have a setter function for your position member you should probably make it private and declare define a getter as well

19954756
int	double
for variable argument functions like printf and scanf the arguments are promoted for example any smaller int types are promoted to int float is promoted to double

19960316
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
as web inspector is standard component of safari and google-chrome and firebug is one of most popular extensions for firefox most users are only a few clicks away from revealing source of your script

19960336
getter	setter
i think i have to override the comparison method somehow and use a getter and setter to increment a count variable

19960392
virtualenv	conda
i am using conda i thought using conda should be better than setting up via virtualenv but looks like this is really a pain

19960393
children	parent
when a parent is shown all of it s existing children are closed so just change the order your code to show the parent view before showing children inside of it

19960452
postgresql	mysql
write a postgresql backend for levelup one exists for mysql

19960452
postgresql	mysql
the answer is probably not - the mysqldown implementation of leveldown uses a single mysql table with three fields id key and value source and i imagine any general-purpose postgresql adapter would be similar nothing says you can t do a special-purpose adapter just for your app though

19960715
children	parent
given the current example the parent element body has dimensions defined based on its containing children

19960715
children	parent
in order for top 100 to work the parent element s height has to be directly defined as opposed to being expanded based on the children elements

19960727
listview	gridview
in your xml change any listview that s causing problems into a gridview with android numcolumns 1

19960727
listview	gridview
gridview doesn t have the same divider attributes that listview do so you may manually need to add a divider to your list item s view

19960731
multicastdelegate	delegation
for a normal c# -like delegation you would probably use the methoddelegate not the multicastdelegate

19960752
projectile	angle
now to measure your angle you need to figure out where the projectile hits the ground

19960760

19960971
inherited	subclassing
it allows the hiding of a inherited hierarchy behind an abstract class that has class side creation methods that return subclassing

19961246
hide	show
your handler could show error messages hide the form or do what ever else you d want it to

19961290
stdout	stderr
means the stdout -handle from the process is directly inherited from the parent in easier words it basically means it gets printed to the console same applies for stderr

19961290
stdout	stderr
then you have the option this redirects stderr to the stdout which means the output of stdout and stderr are forwarded to the same file handle

19961290
stdout	stderr
but mostly you want to use p.communicate which allows you to send data to the process once if you need to and returns the complete stderr and stdout if the process is completed

19961290
stdout	stderr
one more interesting fact you can pass any file-object to stdin stderr stdout also a file opened with open the object has to provide a fileno method

19961308

19961523
set	bag
use set in the mapping file instead of bag

19961561
folder	directory
it seems that hadoop 2.2.0 was shipped to work out of the box on 32bit machines only due to a folder structure change from 1.2.0 in which now the hadoop_install lib directory has only one set of libraries those which work on 32 bit systems only

19961931
post	get
typically after a post you would redirect prg - post redirect get to another action method but it doesn t look like you would be able to do that here easily

implements	extends
another way to go is to not extends fos userbundle model user but implements fos userbundle model userinterface

19962237
int	chars
you re switching on an int but you use chars in your cases

19962242
int	chars
remove the quotes so you re comparing int rather than chars literals

discusses how to execute multiple prepare statements in a batch

19962420
int	chars
the first is that you re trying to compare int values with chars values meaning none of your cases will execute

19962420
int	chars
so if hypothetically you were using int instead of chars as follows

19962436
subtraction	addition
don t forget that addition of a negative number is the same as subtraction m + -n is equivalent to m - n

19962438

i usually prefer to use comparator with collections.sort list comparator instead of implementing comparable

19962460
rss	feed
i am looking at building an rss feed into an play application

19962514
serializable	deserialization
i understand using of medatypeformatters to control serializable and deserialization

19962548
switching	screens
when i select an item in datagrid go to another screens by switching viewmodels without shuting them and switching back the datagrid selection visually speaking is lost even though the databound selectedobject property is still what it should be tested with breakpoint and i manually raise the propertychanged event in the viewmodel

19962696
implements	extends
public abstract class absbaseaactivity extends sherlockfragmentactivity implements noticedialoglistener loginlistener

19962699
post	get
it seems that when sending cross-domain requests that are not post or get angular will send a pre-flight options method at the server to make sure the cross-domain request is accepted before it sends the actual request

19962737
min	max
don t use aggregation unless you have an aggregation function min max avg etc.

19962818
post	get
i would like to provide support for post formats in my first public theme i usually do custom builds for clients and would like to know hopefully definitively how to get the various different bits of content out particularly for the index and not with regards to the template hierarchy but rather extracting the specific data ie a video or audio url a gallery a quote and author etc from the_content

19962839
strcpy	strtok
because the program skipped the second line it could read only 8 names and the last line read was a blank line which caused strtok to return a null and the next strcpy tried to read from address 0 which is of course a segmentation fault

19962914
jar	war
if we put jar into ear lib folder then the classes in it can be accessed but they can t access the classes out of lib in this case there is no need to add something to manifest file of war

19962914
jar	war
if we put jar in root of ear or in any other folder ear bum than the classes of these jar can access war classes

19963064
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox
the cross-browser workaround tested in ie6 - 10 firefox google-chrome safari and opera is to apply the following css

19963097
hide	show
for less than 500 px width when mobile-button is clicked it show the menu but hide while resizing

19963124
cpu	processors
my little program is checking what type of script website use and it use over 80 cpu i7 processors

19963126
entities	entitymanager
you cannot insert foreign keys directly in the join table using normal session or entitymanager operations like save update etc by using just the id s because of maintaining the relationship via foreign keys is the responsibility of hibernate and hibernate gets this information from your mapped entities and your mapped entities maintain the relationship through references to objects and not their id s

19963156
fadein	fadeout
i m not sure what you are trying to achieve but here is some code which will fadein fadeout the divs and you have a chance to stop the process

19963159
width	margin
then you can specify width or margin on the label as you could with the span but this is a little more semantic and meaningful

19963226
min	max
for example the validation i am looking for is when a min value is larger then a max value there needs to be an error but this error can be corrected from either textbox and the error for the textbox needs to be removed when this happens

19963226
min	max
this is easily accomplished by having both the min and max properties call each others property change events but i can not do this as it would break other functionality

19963242
awt	swing
there is already an awt class by that name so you will probably cause swing to stop working

19963242
width	height
also the painting of your rectangles should be done at an x y location of 0 0 so that the entire painting will fit in the width height of your component

19963289
children	parent
are the children divs of the parent div #100011000110001

19963294
folder	directory
you have to have a libs folder in your project directory with the jar inside it

19963308
hide	show
it s working fine but the arrow hovering animation is working unless i show and hide the content

19963308
mouseleave	mouseenter
i assume it s because the clicking event is unbinding the mouseenter and mouseleave and there is no other event what can bind it again

19963312
hide	show
the onmouseover event handled by the parent div hide the 1st child div and hence its text string then show the 2nd previously-hidden div by setting its style block

19963312
hide	show
as tested when the mousemove happens over the parent div the parent div s onmousemove hide the 1st div and show the other div -- all that works fine

19963312
onclick	onmousedown
you ll notice i tried calling the mouse click handler both for onmousedown and onclick one at a time then both together in the hover div html code -- no change the mouse click event handler is not being called regardless

19963312
mousemove	mouseout
there is a subtle timing issue involving the showing hiding of the hover div because when it appears on top of its parent div the parent div loses focus triggering a mouseout on the parent div which re-hides the hover div immediately see the mouseout handler on the parent div then the child hover div re-appears when the parent div re-gets focus and the mousemove event ad infinitum as long as the mouse is hovering above

19963321
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable and ienumerable are what s called interfaces

19963321
ienumerable	iqueryable
that said iqueryable is actually an extension of ienumerable so for the purposes of what you re talking about here they re practically the same thing

19963321
ienumerable	iqueryable
in other words it s not about whether the returned object set from the database is cast to an iqueryable or an ienumerable

19963357
children	parent
it seems that when a parent is set to display table-cell and position relative its children do not respect the parent width when positioned absolutely and given 100 width

19963357
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it functions as expected in google-chrome safari but not on firefox

19963358

19963469
int	chars
you can avoid your malloc completely by simply declaring a chars large enough to print the largest int into

19963478
width	height
to loop through a row major image walk the pixels the outer loop is usually from 0 to height and the inner from 0 to width

19963488
folder	dir
for meteor there s also a problem of public dir being precached by the engine so every change to that folder would result in server being restarted you can see that on your local machine as well

19963502
ssl	https
ssl use https instead of http

i have an idea - please correct me if i am wrong to package and install application a into local maven repository via mvn install command and this library set as new dependency for app b and c in their pom.xml files

19963887
google-chrome	firefox
it s happening in all of my browsers ie firefox and google-chrome

19963897
put	get
i put breakpoints in the two register actions and they never get hit

19963916
post	get
one of your issues is that you are making a post to search but you only have a route that matches get on search

19963916
post	get
i would start by switching your route to match on post instead of get

19963935
ant	maven
the library doesn t have ant maven or even gradle support

19963951
implements	extends
public class addressservice extends genericservice implements iaddressservice

19963957
folder	directory
in your project folder you will have .bundle directory that holds configuration for bundler

19963980
int	chars
this will convert the chars to int of the correct value

19964007
ostream	istream
so now we have a reasonable amount of code to look at so let s just show a reasonable implementation of an ostream and istream overload

19964011
typedef	struct
also typedef for your struct would make the code easier to read

19964014
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome but don t work in mozilla firefox

19964039
int	double
i need to get absolute value of double and value of one int from array of int all declared inside function

19964054
int	chars
then cast the chars to string to make the int conversion literal text rather than ascii code

19964168
children	parent
i have a parent div with 3 children divs

19964178
libs	buildpath	folder	directory
copy and paste osmdroid jar into libs folder then remove it from buildpath othervise two identical jar will be added to the bin directory this will cause another problem

19964257
int	double
one for double and one for int and im pretty sure thats not how you do it because then i see lossy conversion from double to int

19964314
range	max	range	min	min	max
i then need to determine the max and min values of these range

19964340
firepath	firebug
i use firebug and firepath to generate and test xpath code for use in importxml function in google docs spreadsheet

19964346
int	double
i assume you re telling us that the error you receive is lossy conversion from double to int

19964346
int	double
you are not able to convert a double value to an int value

19964346
int	double
a q a on why you can t convert double to int why can int byte short long be converted to float double without typecasting but vice-versa not possible

19964361
hide	show
i m implementing an actionbarsherlock i want to hide and show my actionbar due to some events but when i show the actionbar it glitches and it s jumpy i ve tried setting actionbaroverlay to true in my actionbar style and

i tried localhost upgrade administrator localhost index.php localhost administrator index.php and even localhost installation index.php and nothing works

19964456
installation	upgrade
i went into the installation dir and made and saved the configuration.php and .htaccess in upgrade to no avail and as a last resort i even did a chmod -r 777 yeah i know restarted apache but nothing changes

19964471
ansible	puppet
if i have any suggestions for doing regression tests on any cloud provider do use continuous integration jenkins possibly your python script and configuration management chef saltstack ansible or puppet

19964474
width	height
as you can see you can use bbox to take screenshot that is at co-ordinates 100 200 and has a width of 300 and a height of 400

19964568
post	get
i m using ajax to parse an xml dynamicly generated by php by posting a number for example if you post n 3 you get

19964573
put	get
however i don t get how to put in there the file i want.

19964701
int	double
you need to add the type s for string or i for int or d double b blob into the first argument to bind_param

19964738
subtraction	addition
for example if i wanted to switch from addition to subtraction it would only work after the number was inputed

19964748
hide	show
but i look a bit messed the slide thing but is there hide and show

19964770
post	put
when i try to put the post request url and the data block directly in the browser it works

19964824
treelist	panels
trying to make this short - i have a left right panels app where the left panels is a treelist and a click on the treelist generates some html from a db that is loaded into a literal control

19964855
getter	setter
it would be neat maybe if i could have getter and setter in a document type that refer to other document types natively in memory but as a scalar key when being de serialized to reference the redis location of the property

19964872
int	chars
and then if it is a chars it could just save the next word england for the second half of new england s name in the same name field and if its an int it will move on to the wins field

19964883
implements	extends
you can do this by extends the backgroundprocess class implements the beforeinvocation and afterinvocation methods and extends executeandwaitinterceptor implements the getnewbackgroundprocess method

19964902
gruntjs	yeoman
since gruntjs is already included in yeoman i m using it to fire up a gruntjs server everytime i m working on my project

19964902

i just started my very first ember.js project using yeoman when i realized that chrome s ember inspector extension isn t able to detect my application as an ember.js app when i m running my gruntjs server at localhost

19964912
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of the android maven plugin 3.8.0 and upgrade your maven to 3.1.1 and all will work

19965046
getter	setter
you really should make classa a property of classb using in the interface this will generate a setter and getter for you

19965050
super	self
you don t need to add self to super declaration

19965075
ansible	puppet
as far as software stack is concerned though you want to use some configuration management software chef saltstack ansible puppet or even just fabric scripts to help you deploy software in automation

19965103
filtering	grouping
the statement you ve added has no aggregates so it has no method of filtering down or grouping by into one record

19965117
division	modulo
hint the modulo will give you the x value and a simple integer division will get you y more or less

19965127
hash	md5
with this you can give the output to your hash function and be ensured that there will be no collisions as far as the hash function itself ensures note md5 was broken years ago so it may not be an appropriate choice

19965168
children	parent
note that you supply false to not attach the view immediately to the parent because this is in a adapter that attaches children when needed

19965169
range	max	range	min	min	max
obviously it doesn t take into account the min max elevations for the particular bot weapon you re using or the min-max range of it

19965229
base	fractions
this means that they re stored as fractions to the base 2 unlike decimal were you can display a float as fractions to the base 10

19965233
switching	screens
if you are switching screens that contain treeviews you shouldn t create a new observablecollection every time you view the treeview because it will reset the current one

19965253
post	get
my servet work fine for get requests but when i call post using jquery ajax .post i get error 405 method not allowed

19965279
put	get
you can use ajax to get the text file data from the server then put it into the text field

19965314
jar	war
then you can build the common resources as a jar and that jar can even contain the servlet resource dispatcher if you like and the war files can contain the jar file in the web-inf lib folder

19965354
post	get
and now i have php pages like bellow for get request post or get and process

19965354
post	get
suppose if someone post on from via ajax post it should get restrict

19965380
vbscript	vba
i started getting this error either from vbscript or excel vba performing the same command that has worked for months

19965404
portrait	landscape
when the keyboard pops up in portrait mode if it occupies more than half the screen it triggers landscape mode instead of simply overlapping the portrait screen like it should

19965411
selecteditem	selectedindex
the template contains that displays selecteditem string on the cbox button or nothing if selectedindex is -1 nothing selected cbox default value

19965411
hide	show
then add trigger that will hide the standard presenter and show the default text presenter if selectedindex is -1

19965478
udp	tcp
pcap-filter will allow you to set protocols source and destination ip addresses and tcp or udp ports or portranges ethernet mac addresses packet lengths and a myriad other things

19965554

i try to load 3 images products in one cell in landscape mode and 2 in portrait mode

19965610
width	height
calculating image width and height and position

19965685
rss	feed
you can use the rss feed option in the calendar tools section to help find the correct url

19965685
rss	feed
each item in the rss feed will have an event.ics generated by the owssvr.dll which you can then convert to the format described by kravitz88 to get an ics for the whole calendar

19965693
width	height
i have my range sliders the width i need and the height

19965699
prng	random
especially if the seed is added to the state of the random number generator instead of the seed being used as a starting point of the prng

19965710
androidviewclient	adb
you can use androidviewclient culebra which uses a special adb client and is able to locate and interact with views

19965732
tablelayoutpanel	picturebox
using visual studio c# i am trying to dynamically add some picturebox to a tablelayoutpanel called mapgrid

19965752
int	chars
you need to read in the chars between the int too

19965755
pop-up	dialog
on the same page i have a jquery dialog box which pop-up to allow a user to add a new client

19965758
titlebar	window
when i use printwindow to get the screenshot i can see a flicker on the window titlebar chrome tab area

19965772
int	chars
the value in a dom element is stored as a string or chars array if you will thus you need to parse it to an int like so parseint document.getelementbyid weightbox .value

19965848
for-loop	arrays
the thing is in your draw function you are running over the arrays of sizes with the first for-loop and assigning the value of that size to the balls

19965891
int	chars
i do not know which key will correspond to chars and which one to int

19965907
put	get
to get around this you can create an iframe and put the integration code in there

19965921
super	extends
the lesson to learn here is that you must be careful when extends a class that you don t accidentally override the super class methods

19965981
puma	unicorn
this leaves rails developers unable to leverage the additional concurrency capabilities offered by the cedar stack unless they move to a concurrent web server like puma or unicorn

19965991
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tested with firefox 24.0 google-chrome 30.0.1599.101 and safari 6.0.5 8536.30.1 and modernizr adds no-overflowscrolling for each

19965995
stdout	fflush
the --line-buffered option overrides this behavior forcing it to fflush stdout after every line

19965996
express	node.js
i m trying to build an app with node.js socket.io and express

19966027
awt	swing
painting in awt and swing

19966044
iboutlet	ibaction
i m trying to connect a ui element in a window to my app s controller delegate using the assistant editor but there is no option to create a new iboutlet ibaction when dragging from the ui element to the interface file

19966044
nswindow	nsmenu	nswindow	nsstatusitem	nsmenu	nsstatusitem
the file s owner of the window is nswindow and its not my main menu which is a nsmenu on a nsstatusitem if that helps

19966049
filtering	grouping
if a filtering value is the only value counted grouping by filtering then put a 0 in the hidden field else 1 which results in something like

19966060
width	height
if you leave the width to a percentage what will happen is that the div will not have anything inside of it and thus will not show the banner so you need to figure out what the actual width and height of the banner is and put it in this css declaration so that it shows the banner

19966106
put	get
to get my head around the new style of wrapping providers in ef6 i have put a quick sample together but i am struggling when it comes to the spatial data reader

19966112
width	height
i m not sure what exactly has caused this but either after upgrading to the latest wp version or using wp.smushit plugin all my featured thumbnail images are displaying with 1px width and 1px height

19966134
sorting	filtering
i have a kendo grid using the asp.net mvc wrappers with sorting filtering and column menu enabled

19966154
int	boolean	int	chars
now if you re working with primitive types like int boolean or chars assigning a variable like

19966226
typedef	struct
in c++ for reference the first book is sufficient and it is not necessary to use struct elsewhere and therefore the typedef is not useful.

19966238
outputstream	inputstream
the classic java inputstream outputstream example requires 2 threads

19966243
width	height
you can use javascript and check which of the layers is on top also the width and height of that div then just grab its background-color property

19966253
free	malloc
you re doing a malloc and free for every single particle in your system each frame

19966253
free	malloc
i reckon retired ninja has the right idea - use sdl_renderdrawpoints instead and just do the malloc and free once each frame

19966253
free	malloc
you re not doing any malloc s or free s

19966320
subtraction	addition
all you need to do to get those totals down the bottom you just need to perform addition subtraction on the variables you ve already created

19966362
width	height
attribute in my manifest file if i remove it it works as expected the new width height are set instantly

19966445
thin	unicorn
you also need to care about your web app supporting concurrency which only some rails configs do - try unicorn or carefully-written code for i o that doesn t block the eventmachine with thin

19966502
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it work in safari but breaks in vertical alignment in google-chrome and firefox

19966572
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i m meaning to deploy it via amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk to a website i ve only just begun to set up

19966642
google-chrome	firefox
works great in google-chrome but in firefox i see some white flickering where the images are redrawing

19966675
jax-ws	jax-rs
i m implementing an application-scoped service to be further injected into jax-rs jax-ws service or a servlet does not matter which would spawn some processing via managedexecutorservice or managedthreadfactory

19966677
client-side	server-side
do not know what is your particular context but i think that in the long run it may be somehow difficult to keep those worlds client-side and server-side together anyway

19966678
submit	submission
i have a video website user submit videos therefore the url link is the submission number + the video title separated by - so whenever a user submit a new video the newest video is shown on the home page

19966694
division	modulo
is the modulo which returns the remainder after division

19966705
width	height
the trick to getting this to work is setting 2 different transitions for the opacity height and width properties of the square one for hover on and one for hover off as well as adding a delay attribute to the transition

19966705
width	height
the reason for transitioning height and width is that it will prevent you from being able to hover over the square without first hovering over the circle

19966705
width	height
here are the default settings of the square opacity 0 height 0 and width 0

19966705
width	height
for the hover on transition you want opacity to fade-in over 1 second but to be able to see that the height and width values need to be 40px prior to the fade-in transition

19966705
width	height
to make that happen you need to set a delay of 0 seconds on the height and width transitions

19966705
width	height
what you want to have happen is for the opacity to ease-out over 1 second while at the same time keeping the values of height and width at 40px

19966705
width	height
otherwise height and width would instantly revert back 0 and you would not be able to see the fade-out transition

19966705
width	height
to make that happen you need to set a delay of 1 second on the height and width transitions

19966705
width	height
in doing that the opacity eases out over 1 second and because of the 1 second delay on height and width at that point height and width will revert back 0

19966706
division	modulo
you can use the modulo to find the remainder from a division operation

19966746
move	drag
so you can move the gray box but the yellow button remains in the same location within the box but you cant drag the button around within the box

19966749
width	height
another problem is this image is not 670 wide so distortion is coming from the width stretching as well as the height

19966759
put	get
i ve been trying to get the api client working in ruby to do a job insert to take data from cloud storage and put it into a table in bigquery and haven t been too successful

19966798
gif	png
if you call .save you will get gigantic jpeg files and no 8-bit png or animated gif support

19966835
sudo	passwd
additionally though not germane to this question - ideally root should not have a passwd - you should use be using sudo

19966844
width	height
for example if the spritegroup s width is 100 and it s height is 100 you d want it s position to be -50 -50

19966851
width	height
the program reads in an image file with a magic number at the top p11 p12 p13 p14 below the magic number are three numbers that specify the width height and max value

19966851
width	height
the rest of the file contains the width height amount of numbers and all of those numbers have to be within 0 and the max value

19966851
unsigned	short
if the magic number is p11 and the max value is greater than 256 but less than 65536 than the datatype for our image would be an unsigned short

19966851
unsigned	short
so for our image above we would have a datatype of unsigned short

19966859
fadein	fadeout
i have an h4 that has text that says read more then when it s clicked it has a paragraph with a fadein effect and the h4 has a fadeout effect

19966947
minimum	max
first name only accpets alphabet minimum of 4 and max of 10 but don t accept space at first and must have space after for the second name or middle initial

19966947
minimum	max
second name optional but only accpets alphabet minimum of 4 and max of 10 and must have space after for middle initial

19966947
minimum	max
last name only accpets alphabet minimum of 4 and max of 10 but don t accept space after

19966974
folder	directory
says look for the folder r.framework in the set of frameworks directory

19966987
width	height
width height the width and height of the graphics region in inches

19967042
put	get
also to just test the boolean required here bs i put in this code snippet and get an error when saving that a string is required here

19967044
gif	png
so looks like gif and png are better choices although jpg still gets you under the 300 bytes mark

19967047
portrait	landscape
this represents a change in the currently available size so will change when the user switches between landscape and portrait

19967062
width	height
what i usually do is that i create a double image with both states acting like kind of a two-frame film which i then use with as background for the original element so that the element has width height set in pixels resulting in showing only one half of the image

19967231
explode	implode
assuming that your title and year will never have commas an easy way to fix this would be to implode the array with commas before putting it into the html then explode the posted data back into the original array

19967232
mouseup	mousedown
a solution that comes to mind is to have a mousedown listener and a mouseup listener on the whole drag-able box

19967232
mouseup	mousedown
this way with the quarter of a second timer you know that if the user simply wants to click a button then they will click leaving less that a quarter of a second between the mousedown and mouseup events so that the dragging never starts and the button is only clicked

19967242
memcpy	malloc	memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	free	memcpy	free	malloc	free	strcpy	free	strncpy	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strncpy	strncpy	malloc
replace witch remove all malloc s and free s corresponding to those char null terminate all your after strcpy strncpy or memcpy whatever your choice is depending on how confident you are that your data in list is correct data to them

19967248
getter	setter
i think your question is too general for the format of stack overflow but what you want in this case is to either create a public member or create a private member with setter and getter

19967250
fadein	fadeout
this will fadeout all tabs and fadein the clicked tab if your tab html is like

19967277
put	get
when i run rake assets precompile or just put up a rails server i get this error undefined mixin formfieldstate

19967283
hide	show
how can i hide and show all the standard excel ribbon tabs using vba not xml

19967307
folder	directory
could you share a folder that contains the image on server b and setup a virtual directory in iis on server a that points to the share on server b

19967339
put	get
i get the error message request method put not supported

19967347
min	max
now for case 3 min and max will be reset to 1

19967347
minimum	max	min	max
for case 1 max will be and min will be minimum of and 1

19967347
min	max
for case 2 max will be maximum of and 1 but the min value will be

19967360
post	get
the basic difference between post and get is when you submit a form with get the parameters show in the address bar and when you submit a form with post they don t

19967373
gson	jackson
at the moment i don t really care how will it work as long as it will work i do understand whoever that i should probably get this working with either jackson or gson

19967378
getter	setter
try to override the getter and setter for name in the subclass and annotate them with jsonignore and or xmltransient

19967382
viewdidload	viewwillappear
when the application loads viewdidload gets called once and viewwillappear gets called once

19967445
entity-relationship	diagram
a simple entity-relationship diagram below since i can t post images from mysql workbench diagram

19967519
put	get
you need to change your code to first get the current contents and unserialize it then merge your current array with the previous data then serialize it and put it back

19967526
post	get
here you query 5 page from your liked pages but my goal is to get only the latest post from each of the 5 page ordered by created time desc

19967559
trie	tree
basically i m trying to put letters of a string into some kind of trie actually a radix tree using a multi-dimensional array

19967597
post	get
this needs to be called on every bit of data that comes from outside your php code that you use in a mysql command for instance from post or get to prevent hacking by sql injection

19967622
min	max
there is no point in setting min and max scaling attributes to the same value

19967626
range	max
expected the max range generated depends on the previous input

19967629
versioning	upgrade
to solve this error you need to request your hosting provider to upgrade the websitepanel versioning to 2.0

19967664
hide	show
of course you can show hide either a row group or tablix

19967664
hide	show
or you can show hide the tablix with tablix properties visibility

128bit	64bit
i am not sure if taking most significant 64bit from the 128bit hash is good idea

19972172
perl	tcl	brainfuck	lolcode
unfortunately having a totally comprehensive ide with these features is going to be a huge project in part because postgresql can use stored procedures in so many different languages so syntax highlighting inside the stored procedure requires a vast amount of knowledge in theory to be considered complete not only sql and plpgsql but also c c++ java python perl tcl r ruby lisp various shells php lolcode and brainfuck -- there are probably more but those are the ones that come to my mind

free	malloc
when you call a malloc it will eventually reaches this memory management subsystem and looks for the next available free page from the pool and allocates for the requesting process

19972242
free	malloc
the user space process itself maintains a free pool and when a malloc requests memory before breaking in to kernel it will look in its own free pool if memory is available

19972242
free	malloc
similarly when you free up the memory the free up chunk of memory will not immediately go back to kernel s free pool instead it will stay with the process s free pool so that next malloc can use this

another example lets say you are starting a program from a command prompt window and you are in the directory c some folder

int	chars
when you deal with chars or short what c actually does and this is defined by the standard not the implementation is promote those types to int before doing any operations

19977662
int	chars
since both signed chars and unsigned chars will fit happily within the range of a signed int the compiler uses that for both and the comparison becomes a pure signed comparison

19977662
int	chars
when you compared the mismatching pointers line 16 and passed the mismatching pointer line 18 the int promotion is not in play because you never actually dereference the pointers and so no int are ever compared chars is an int type also of course

as for keeping the splash in portrait but the app in both portrait and landscape this is not the right approach in my opinion

serializable	deserialization
if i on the other hand use datacontractserializer to serializable the same object serializable and deserialization works like a charm

19979116

let s start with floor and ceiling which i m going to call ceil from here on

19979626
ceil	floor
more plainly the floor of x is the largest integer that is no bigger than x and the ceil is the smallest integer that is no smaller than x

19979626
ceil	floor
each of floor and ceil is a rounding rule

19979626
ceil	floor
if the result is floor x and the result is ceil x otherwise

19979626
ceil	floor
otherwise look at floor x and ceil x

19979626
ceil	floor
instead we simply replace ceil x and floor x in the rounding rule with the values of x rounded down and up to the desired number of digits

19979631
post	get
this post is very informative and suggests several different solutions you could pursue to get an acceptable solution

19979666
prng	random
if your program is completely deterministic there are no subroutine calls that depend on the value of some pseudo- random numbers or the initial prng seed is always the same then sans the return addresses all other content of the stack is going to be the same between many executions of your program one in the evening and one in the morning

19979670

19979729
inline	inlining
inline by nature and inlining may open up additional

instead the parent and children of each node can be found by arithmetic on array indices

19979730
children	parent
heap only can tell that this particular element is less than it s parent and bigger than it s children

19979750
hide	show
i noticed early on that if i use a fixed header then try to hide it rather than the canvas sliding up as it would with a non-fixed header the top inch of the screen where the header used to be show an exact mirror duplicate of the top inch of the canvas

19980669
folder	directory
that one complained in the first place alway that the folder tktreectrl doesn t exist which was wrong since the folder comes with the download and i was running setup.py within the same directory where tktreectrl was located

19980669

width	height
i know i can use iw and ih as input width and input height for the first scale filter but when i try to put anything else as dimension for the color background it just throw me a error

19980855
integer	unsigned
even if the values did not all fit in a byte the wrap-around behavior is guaranteed by the c standard for unsigned integer types so that you would be justified in using this wrap-around behavior on purpose

19980855
int	chars
unless on your compilation platform int cannot contain all values that an unsigned chars can take in which case it would be of type unsigned int and you probably wouldn t see the warning

put	get
generally when you get the object not set to an instance of an object error you should put a break point on the line reported in the error message and then hover over the objects to see which one is null and then put the if condition to make sure you do not access objects that might be null

19981170

19981263
children	parent
this might seem a little weird and clumsy for a parent relationship as in your case but i m sure you can see this is useful behavior when going in the other direction where the nested attributes represent one or more of potentially many children

19981263
post	get
if all you are looking to do is link the new post to the existing group then you just need to include group_id in post_attributes and you can get rid of group_attributes

19981693
hide	show
i had a discussion with my supervisor and he told me that i should create two classes with display block none and assign them to elements using jquery rather than using jquery s own functions show hide

19981693
hide	show
i had the impression that show hide are widely used functions that work without any issues and they were made to make our lives easier by not forcing us to assign classes

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

19981789
hide	show
they are the same - show and hide just switches between display block or inline inline-block etc and display none or similar

19981789
hide	show
the main difference is that show and hide support jquery animations out of the box

19981789
hide	show
also classes do not add inline css whereas show and hide do inline html to override whatever the initial display value is

19981789
hide	show
show and hide also cache the initial display value so if you hide an element and then show it it will remember what the original display value was which means it s more flexible since you don t need unique visible classes for elements with different types of display values

19981791
profiling	debugging
then a debugging profiling is set up for the server launcher and is different with each branch

19981794
children	parent
i have a single table that allows a parent row to have multiple children

19981807
width	height
i believe fl w and fl h will give you width and height of the working area

19981819
hide	show
you can use such css classes to initially hide element on the page to show it later with jquery.show

19981819
hide	show
by the way the code with show hide is also more readable

19981845
width	margin
wrap your elements within a div that has a set width and the following styles margin 0 auto

19981848
hide	show
jquery s show hide methods work perfectly well

19981941
multiplying	multiplication
so we either multiplying alpha with a 1 or a 0 which is decision rather multiplication

19981943
migrate	staging
the advantages of doing it this way are that it lets you easily apply the same changes to different environments development test production staging or across your development team and keep them in sync and it encourages you to keep things reversible whenever possible so you maintain some degree of freedom to migrate back and forth if you need to

19981953
many-to-many	one-to-many
the only reason i can see to have the table 1 primary key in tables 2 and 3 would be to express a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship

19982056
width	height
this down here will work but there is no animation because the i created has no height or width and is already positioned at the top of the body

19982078

instead of using a while loops you can use the for-loop

19982124
stdio	putchar
putchar comes from stdio

19982192
libstdc++	libc++
if you don t define one mavericks will use 10.9 and it appears to link with libc++ by default while if you use -mmacosx-version-min 10.8 or lower it will link with libstdc++ by default

19982733
int	chars	unsigned	short
as for unsigned chars and short - they are also converted to 32 bit int so the values fit in it

19982735
getter	setter
every field a class needed to be public was a property and every private field was an instance variable without getter or setter

19982735
getter	setter
as long i do not need some logic in the getter or setter i would go on still using instance variables for everything not public

19982814
post	get
now i need to get that data inside x to inject it to the webview to post it to server

19982891

they are a combination of getter and setter methods backed by an instance variable

19982910
qstring	qbytearray
then for qstring and qbytearray has been founded a solution trough

19982914
accessor	properties
as you said using properties will allow you to easily use accessor methods that do some additional coding besides just accessing the variable

19982914
getter	setter
making a public readonly property readwrite only for the implementation to have a setter synthesized in addition to the getter as pointed out by brad

19982919
getter	setter
one of the most common mistakes when programming in objective-c is to access the ivar directly instead of using a setter getter

19982921

button	checkbox
when back button is used the dropdown value is retained the checkbox is checked but it is disabled

19983194
freeglut	glew
although it was a minefield trying to get it to work i finally got the graphics libraries glew and freeglut into my project by adding them to the project s include path list and then adding them as existing items to the project

19983197
qgridlayout	qmessagebox
qmessagebox uses a qgridlayout

19983208
stdout	fflush
the exit syscall equivalent to _exit in c doesn t fflush the stdout buffer

19983208
stdout	fflush
outputting a newline causes a fflush on line-buffered streams which stdout will be if it is pointed to a terminal

19983230
getter	setter
just remove getter and setter from storestruct

19983267
getter	setter
in order to do what you want you can use a backing variable for the getter setter

19983273
createjs	easeljs
here is an example spritesheet taken from the example at which you can find in the github repository github.com createjs easeljs

19983346

19983348
express	node.js
i have an api using swagger integrated with express on node.js and a resource defined as below

19983375
button	checkbox
the issue turns out to be that parsley has different handling for radio button and checkbox

19983375
button	checkbox
validation for everything but radio button and checkbox decides who gets the css class like this whitespace added

19983375
button	checkbox
...but for radio button and checkbox there s a different branch which looks like this

19983375
button	checkbox
they can set the error classes to your liking on checkbox or radio button if you want but more you could also introduce some unrelated method of accessibly identifying whether field elements have been validated and whether they passed or failed -- elem .data parsleyvalid parsleyfield.isvalid for example

19983422
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to get a dialog to pop-up when i press a jcheckbox if its not true

the chars is not special in any way to flex so this pattern matches the 5-character sequence int

19983668
width	height
i m calculating storing all the needed data for a rectangle basically width height top left and border css properties inside the compositeview

19983669
dictionary	map
the only other thing i can think of is creating a separate crud service to handle my repository calls but i imagine for that i would need a dictionary or hash table to map my concrete repos to my domain model objects and that seems like it would be a maintenance nightmare

19983751
qtableview	qstandarditemmodel
i thought i should also mention that i used qstandarditemmodel to set the model in the qtableview

19983751
qstandarditem	qimage	qicon	qimage	qicon	qstandarditemmodel	qicon	qstandarditem	qtableview	qstandarditemmodel	qtableview	qstandarditem
first i set the rows and colums of the model and then input each qimage type item i convert the qimage to qicon in a qstandarditem and then put that qstandarditem in the qstandarditemmodel once the qstandarditemmodel is setup or filled up i put in the qtableview

19983757
firefox	safari
however i have tested it on safari and firefox and i get the php undefined offset 0 error only on the foreach for this query

19983757

19983782
integer	fractions
any fractions number is dropped when doing integer math

19983814
inherited	properties
but the horrible problem is that we have inherited structures and heavy polymorphism in these states we donâ t have thatâ s string we should given to include because we donâ t know which derived class of class is selected to understand which properties should include

19983832
submit	submission
handle on submit event during form submission and return false in handler method

19983885
implements	extends
i m able to get access to array and length via custom foreach binding that extends the bindingcontext i know there are caveats to this re destroy but it works for me but i can t figure out how to implements the other methods that require access to the current item without a custom inner binding that is executed for each array iteration

19983956
min	max
in the open column currently w text hourly trends is where i would put an additional highchart module with no series data but with the same min max tickinterval

19983970
writetofile	nsdata
as you re putting the nsdata into an nsarray and using that to writetofile then you need to get it back as an nsarray first then get the nsdata object from that array

19984068
explode	implode
you can explode the data modify it then re- implode it

19984109

subtract	add
i am able to get these values and add and subtract by a number to create a square around the users current location with this code

19984237
width	height
from looking up the error i think it could be coming from a conflicting height or width setting but i m not sure where.the main error is line 79 which is highlighted in the code below

19984239
verilog	vhdl
from your mention of std_logic_vector i assume you are actually working in vhdl not verilog

19984280
post	put
i have typed a post code in and ticked a couple of properties already which should put them in the shortlist

19984305
implements	extends
i have a family of domain models each of which has a subclass that extends it and implements a specific interface like this cloneable is not the interface in question it s for example purposes only

19984335
oncreate	setcontentview
use setcontentview in your oncreate method after super.oncreate that should resolve the issue

19984344
post	get
for convenience a dictionary-like object that searches post first then get

19984344
post	get
for example if get name john and post age 34 request name would be john and request age would be 34

19984344
post	get
itâ s strongly suggested that you use get and post instead of request because the former are more explicit

19984347
post	get
searches post first then get

19984347
post	get
for example if get name john and post age 34

19984347

but i want to display the captions outside of the slide div with fixed height and width

19984484
portrait	landscape
this image is oriented either landscape or portrait

19984484
width	height
when rotating it 90 degrees i would expect the below function to rotate the image set the width 1027 and height 770

19984484
width	height
but what i m seeing is that both width and height are being set to 770

19984501
post	get
so i get a response from the server but the post fields are ignored

19984535
strcpy	strncpy
let s say i want to replace all calls to strcpy with calls to strncpy

19984535
strcpy	strncpy
a technique for replacing all calls to strcpy dest src would involve calling strncpy with the parameters dest src length of dest - 1 and then terminating dest with 0

19984535
strcpy	strncpy
i could replace all calls to strcpy with calls to strncpy which will guarantee that my program is immune to buffer overflow attacks at least from improper use of strcpy

19984548
for-loop	loops
you can use the built-in string datatype with the associated built-in functions and while loops with â lenâ function or a for-loop with â inâ operator to traverse the string

19984554
google-chrome	safari
left safari right google-chrome

19984566
width	height
you seem to have switched your width and height

19984568
ng-view	ng-include
index.html - content.html partial rendered by ng-view - wizard.html sub-view nested inside content and rendered by using ng-include

19984585
width	height
the real advantage of this is that you don t have to set the width and height to what it already is which is basically what you re doing so this is enough

19984637
mouse	keyboard
now there is a way to get direct controls from mouse and keyboard which uses ongui instead of update to get events of the keyboard or mouse clicks on the spot

19984672
int	chars
the group in the the is a chars nchar not an int

19984684
width	height
firstly i found that by editing grid_3 width the picture height and width increased

19984752
strlen	strcpy
this is not a fault of strcpy in the slightest it is up to the programmers to ensure that the string is going to fit into their buffer for example by calling strlen before copying or ensuring that the string that comes in cannot possibly be longer than their buffer

19984752
strcpy	strncpy
let s say i want to replace all calls to strcpy with calls to strncpy

19984763
coalesce	nvl
you do this with coalesce or nvl and a case clause

19984777
strcpy	strncpy
i do not think it is a good idea to replace all occurences of strcpy to strncpy

19984800
put	get
so every time you change the drop down the selected name gets put in the hidden field and that will get passed back to the controller along with the selected id from the dropdown

19984830
client-side	server-side
what i should do to run client-side and server-side on the same server

19984851

here s my simple implementation of malloc and free

19984863
udp	tcp
incoming rules allow port tcp 135 udp 500 and 4500

19984863
udp	tcp
forwards tcp udp ports 1-1193 and 1195-48999 to local

19984863
udp	tcp
forwards tcp udp ports 1-1193 and 1195-48999 to local router

19984910
range	max
bullet has max range - than it is removed

19984914
implements	extends
your extends function would have to look something like this - now this is much simpler than how you should really implements it but it should work

19984938
for-loop	loops
the for-loop loops through a list of all x y combinations in nodes

19984949
google-chrome	safari
this image works perfectly on safari but refuses to work on google-chrome

19984949
google-chrome	safari
edit for some reason the code has changed to an image here as well in safari and not in google-chrome

19984962
int	chars
just cast through unsigned chars this works in c# too using chars or byte to int to get the chars code

19984993
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to display a d3 contour graph on our drupal 7 website using the geom.contour d3 library and it works fine on ie and google-chrome but not in firefox the javascript error says isoline is not defined here is where isoline is defined

19985007
width	height	width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
box-sizing border-box sets the height width of an element and takes into consideration the padding as well as the border width

19985007

though normally all alternatives to the angular way work form submission is intercepted and cancelled by angular to allow you to manipulate the data and submit it manually

19986623
post	get
though notice that there is a problem with any type of ajax http post get in a jsfiddle so you will have to run it locally

hash	salt
if you salt your sha512 passwords by simply appending or prepending the salt to the plaintext anyone who gets their hands on a set of your hash passwords and applies a modern cracking tool will be able to see the concatenated password+salt values and will probably through trivial pattern matching be able to separate the password portion from the salt portion for most if not all of the accounts in question

19986956
hash	salt
i haven t thought this through all the way and i am by no means a security expert but it seems to me that if you were to encrypt using for example aes256 the password using the salt as the key and then hash that with sha512 you d be safe from the vulnerability i described above

19986981
ng-show	ng-hide
angular ng-show and ng-hide sets a specific class on the object that forces display none

i m making a page where i have three category lists where i want to use jquery to show the children items of a single list when a user clicks on the parent list item

19990119
min	max
if you fix that by using your next problem is that you ignore the min and max arguments you receive and instead set them to 0 and len list -1 each time

19990121
min	max
my aabbs are composed of a min and max point that are always automatically sorted so that min always has the lowest x-y values and max always has the highest x-y values

19990121

your problem here is that you re redeclaring min and max in each loop so although it should be recursive passing in a new min or max each time this isn t in fact happening

19990269
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs filesystems being designed for windows expects to be used in windows-y ways

19990269
filesystems	ntfs	cifs	smb
even if both your computer and the file server are non-windows and the filesystems is not ntfs if you re using smb cifs for file sharing smb was also designed for windows and you will again get similar behavior

19990279
backtracking	greedy
as you can read in my comment i think that if attributes diseapear it s because you use the dot with a greedy quantifier that catches all characters it can until the first newline and then backtracking to find a character followed by a double quote

19990306
implements	extends
the base action class that all of my actions extends was a class that extended com.opensymphony.xwork2.actionsupport and implements the com.opensymphony.xwork2.interceptor.parameternameaware interface which means it had an acceptableparametername method which looked like this

it s redundant if you have a some sort of break continue return or throw statement or even a goto inside the first if -block that always causes execution to branch outside the current block

19990506
versioning	upgrade
i find out if you upgrade the phantomjs to the newest versioning it will solve the problem

19990513

19990645
stdout	stderr
you are right stderr is typically an unbuffered stream while stdout typically is buffered

19990645
stdout	fflush
if you want to make stdout behave similarly you would have to fflush it after every write

19990648
hide	show
in the mentioned table each row and each column has a check-box to show or to hide

19990648
hide	show
the show hide functions were written in javascript

19990648
hide	show
i have a separate php to download whole table and it s almost totally independent on what users choose to show or hide

19990648
hide	show
i think i can go into the show hide functions and record what s been show hidden and write a table for download

19990688
stdout	stderr
while stdout and stderr may behave differently regarding buffering that is generally not the deciding factor between them and shouldn t be relied on

19990735

for example malloc new memory of sufficient length after reading each line and strcpy the line from temp to that location which you must then free once you are done with it

19990889
strdup	malloc	strcpy	strdup	strcpy	malloc
a quick way is to use strdup which does essentially the same as the malloc and strcpy combined but is a non-standard function so for practice if nothing else implement your own strdup

19990901
int	double
d is always going to be 0 because you are perform an int division and then implicitly converting it to double afterwards

19990910
int	chars
i have an issue with converting int to chars to print out

19990910
int	chars
they hold values and names the names are letters based on the chars value of the int

19991594
wav	aiff
wav and aiff files from pro tools have even more extension chunks that are undocumented as well as data after the audio

google-chrome	firefox
but in firefox this is working what is stopping this from working correctly on ie and google-chrome

19992616
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
but browser support for the collator object is sparse ie 11 google-chrome no firefox no safari so unless you were using this in a browser add-on so the code was specific to only one browser you d have to branch on whether it was supported or not and have two implementations

i can tell google-chrome or ie to always allow geo-locate for that one page but firefox always forgets once i close the browser

20009295
width	height
the outer div would have static height and width and overflow hidden

gridview	detailsview
i ve created a detailsview that displays data based on a selected item from a gridview

20010091
equals	compareto
the essential thing to note is that if you need a stable sort one in which the relative sequence of equals items after sorting is guaranteed to match the sequence before sorting you will either need to use a sorting method which guarantees such behavior or else add an additional field to your items which could be preloaded with their initial position in the array and make your compareto function check that field when items are otherwise equals

20010096
int	chars
ie don t rely on the int interpretations of chars values to pass your key code

20010682
put	get
i get the in firebug so i tried put this code into the specific page with and works fine but i don t like this approach

20010702
client-side	server-side
malicious users can inject their own client-side code which will permit non-valid inputs to be sent to the server so server-side checking is still strongly required

20010702
client-side	server-side
i would recommend that you do client-side checks but i would also recommend that you take the care to ensure that your client-side checks are synchronized with your server-side checks such that your client doesn t start filtering inputs in a different manner than your server would

20010709
range	max
it all runs and i m able to get to the mode but whenever i press enter it simply goes to the max range range is from 1-100

20010716
g++	gcc
what i don t quite get and what i haven t see asked precisely here is why gnu c c++ compilers gcc g++ are okay with using dynamic allocation based on an integer value as far as i can tell so long as that value is a constant within the scope of the array allocation but visual studio s does not support this and will refuse to compile the code spitting out errors

20010746
client-side	server-side
note that the cost of client-side validation is that you need to make sure to maintain it to match the actual server-side rules if they change

20010746
client-side	server-side
personally i try my best to have server-side validation report useful information and i don t do any initial client-side validation

it doesn t happen in google-chrome or firefox

20010968
google-chrome	firefox
when i on that page in ie and google-chrome i can tab through all of the components on the page whether or not i add in any information in them for the textboxes but in firefox it stops when i tab into the zipcode textbox and only that one

20010968
google-chrome	firefox
if so i m not entirely sure how to do that and it still wouldn t explain why it works in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

20011019
dictionary	map
updating the dictionary map that comes off a vertex property circumvents the database level since you are directly modifying the value on the heap

20011101
put	get
it says the standardopenoption is optional but everytime i leave it blank and even when i do put something in there i get a compiler error

20011103

put	preflight	put	get	post	get	post	put
i have three ajax calls post get and put all preceded by a preflight request options

put	get
any bytes you put on to the wire just get concatenated in to a big queue and get read in on the other side as it becomes available

20011708

my instinct would be to put your data and the query results too into a set object and then call removesall to get the items not in the database reverse this for items in the database but not in your set

20011797
getter	setter
here is the transaction class constructors i have the appropriate setter and getter too

20011797

a gridview is basically just a view mode for a listview control

20012812
put	get
you don t normally need to know a priori whether or not a node exists as calling node pathname or the static will automatically create it and its ancestors if required and i would have thought this would be the more usual mode of operation for clients of the preferences api - get your node creating it if necessary and the store and or load values in the node using the various get and put methods

20012812
put	get
any get calls on that node will simply ignore the values in the backing store and give you the default values you provided and any put calls will fail to persist unless the backing store becomes available again before the node is flushed

so i can fix this with sudo chown -r vagrant vagrant usr lib node_modules

20013212

you should be passing the name of the property in the forkeypath parameter of addobserver not the getter or setter

since you can t pass the name of the getter or the setter method to addobserver the answer is to just pass the name of the property directly using a string literal editable

20013567
integer	unsigned
if it does how do i convert it to an integer to display because i guess m_int m_reg will give me only unsigned

20013568

min	max
is equivalent to min a b where each operator is computed only once as in a call to an inline function while is equivalent to max a b

20014648
min	max
code using these operators should be modified to use std min and std max instead

20014687
width	height
it tends to ignore your width and height parametres

20014687
width	height
with that at least you can have a total control of width and height

20014690
jlist	jtable
these classes implement panels with jtable the first panel and jlist the second panel

20014690
jlist	jtable

put	get
what you get with that is a three dimensional array as you are putting the column pairs into an array which you in turn put in the final array

20014730

button	checkbox
but i need that when you click on the button of each tag the state of the checkbox must be unchecked

20014868
google-chrome	safari

20015173
post	get
i ended up writing a blog post with these changes as well as a few others you need to get the full build working

20015191
button	checkbox
you would have to just use checkbox instead of radio button for allowing multiple options to be selected else you are doing something which is inherently wrong in a ui be it mobile web

20015231
children	parent
this says first order by the parent such that all children for the parent will appear together and then order by each child s per said parent percent descending

20015238

when we profiling an application using vtune i understand that the application should be compiled in release mode so that it has only relevant code and no additional code for debugging or something else

20015260
postgresql	mysql
i m coming from a mysql background where group by worked very differently than in postgresql

20015260

in postgresql - and apparently any standards-based sql database - you have to group by all selected columns while in mysql you can handpick which ones to group by

20015264
oncreate	onstart
so you could do anything that requires the activity in oncreate oncreateview or onstart as well as onresume

20015275
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox event.offsetx is undefined but in google-chrome and other browsers it gives position

20015284
profiling	debugging
there s more to debugging information than that information about locations and types of variables but it s mostly irrelevant for most profiling and doesn t lead to inaccuracy in measuring the code either

20015302
width	height
define a spinner in your activity with 0 height and 0 width in your xml then the onitemselected will work

20015316
single-quotes	double-quotes
i also took the liberty of converting single-quotes to escaped double-quotes

20015324

google-chrome safari shows a white box with a small image in the middle the case that the image cannot be displayed

20015492

20015588
int	double
so in fact the double value 0.0 is being passed to printf where it expects int

20015588

equals	gethashcode
their gethashcode and equals overloads operate on each member

20015754

mouseup	mousedown
i would like to know if there is a better way than creating seperate mouseup and mousedown events

20015798
getter	setter
i have a theoretical question about the use of getter and setter

20015798
getter	setter
my thinking is that for this one special case since the private method can t be accessed from outside of the class that not using getter and setter and instead just reaching in directly would not be a violation of encapsulation

20015803
google-chrome	firefox
this problem only occurs in ie8 otherwise works fine in google-chrome firefox etc

20015837
button	checkbox
now i also need to dynamically add calendar controls there should be a button in front of the textbox and checkbox in each row

20015865
prepare	execute
instead you have to call execute and use prepare statements

20015882
getter	setter
the purpose of using getter and setter is to provide a public interface for people who want to use your class so that you re free to manipulate your internal implementation without changing the interface

20015882
getter	setter
you may want to use a getter or setter if accessing or changing a value is supposed to cause side effects so you don t have to remember to constantly update any auxiliary values but it would be overkill in the general case

20015923
getter	setter
getter and setter and instead just reaching in directly would not

20015931
rss	feed
i have a php file and i m trying to iterate a rss feed i want to assign id s to div tags using the foreach statment for each item in the feed ie content0 content1 .

20016657
pull	push
generally there are three ways to stimulate this subscriber broadcaster or pull push relationship

20016676
int	double
after doing some research i understand that built-in classes such as int and double cannot be overridden

20016722
sum	coalesce
also i used the coalesce operator because sum will return null when the enumeration is empty

20016731
awt	swing
3 dispatch thread like in awt swing

20016736
ssl	https
the https env var is set from the mod_ssl for ssl clients

20016765
int	double
with int double you won t be able to use other elements beside resistors

20016800
post	get
jquery has a handler for json-ajax-request and on the serverside you will get plain post get-data

20016807
single-quotes	double-quotes
use single-quotes instead of double-quotes

20016828
hide	show
taken me a while to get to this point only to find that the markers don t show hide the divs as well

20016828
hide	show
and this is the show hide part of the script

20016902
int	double
for your second question again you don t have to do that but it makes + operate similarly for vector as it does for int or double

20016982
width	height
i want to scale the svg as width - 150 and height - 150

20016993
post	get
i know this have been asked so often and i checked all the post but still i dont get it

20016998
getter	setter
however it seems like overkill to include getter and setter for an inner class like monster

20017009
min	max
the primary problem was how to calculate the min max of the date and value for the scales

20017010
width	height
if you want to change the height or width later with another button you can use a resize function

20017012
width	height
you need to set the css width and height as well

20017081
junit	jmockit
if i run the test case with junit on the classpath before jmockit using netbeans btw jmockit complains and tells me clearly it must be on the classpath before junit

20017137
post	get
you could add added another table to store which users had commented on which post - and therefore which tables to look in but now the solution starts to get complicated

20017185
width	height
as described in the documentation height and width may be scaled to get the best fit in a width by height rectangle while preserving the original aspect ratio

20017209
children	parent
there might be a way by passing the function of parent thread to a function being executed in children thread and attaching it to the delegate in children thread

20017209
children	parent
if not you can still create a loop in parent thread and periodicaly check status of all the children threads

20017215
client-side	server-side
from version 0.6 that is coming soon you can use client-side derby app without server-side that means you can use it in phonegap for example

20017267
scatter	graphing
the original graphing is the scatter plot of p and mag

20017267
scatter	graphing
i am hoping to try to create a new scatter in which i can take all these y values and average them for each individual x value therefore creating a tighter graphing which has two dips

20017283
public	protected
from protected to public in package org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3

20017300
hide	show
my css is set to hide these by default but when the user clicks on focus s on the input field then the next label will show and on blur it will be hidden

20017325
g++	gcc
use g++ instead of gcc so that it wont show error

20017469

20017620
width	height
that s the width of the left sizing border and the height of the top sizing border + title bar

20017637
post	get
the problem is that as the number of li is dynamic some times an extra row may come and break my style.if number of li grows there will be extra rows present and that will make this arrow align wrong.to get more in to this i will post the screen here

20017704
width	height
if you want to set the width and height attributes as well you will have to call setattribute for those two separately

20017734
filtering	grouping	sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping
see kendogridbinderex on nuget or github which supports sorting filtering paging grouping and aggregates

20017780
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i get only the text labels in the svg rendered in google-chrome firefox and safari

20017812
awt	swing
the line disappears because swing or awt will call paint graphics or paintcomponent graphics g in order to pain the component

20017819
put	get
currently what i m trying to do is using ctas or insert into select to get the rows that i want to update and put on another table while using as column_name so the values are already updated on the new temporary table which looks something like this

20017859
google-chrome	safari
but you can test both approaches and measure reflow times with the browser s development tools ex safari timeline or some plugin ex google-chrome speed tracer

20017907
put	get
i created a product using php that i want to put on a website but before i can do that i have to get it to update automatically

20017981
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
is it a bug in google-chrome or in firefox ie opera

20018021
aesthetics	ggmap
you can give data to individual plotting functions you need to make sure the global aesthetics those mentioned in ggplot ggmap etc match up though

20018025
httpconnection	downloading
while i test the downloading module i found this strange thing when i let the httpconnection to try to connect to a host which does not exist it just blocks there despite i have set the timeout parameter

20018031
postgresql	mysql
the same code is used with npgsql postgresql is working fine but when used with mysql it returns null

20018040
width	height
similarly if the image is really long and thin the image should fill the width of the parent and maintain ratio ideally collapsing the height of the parent to accommodate or at the very least staying central to the div

20018040
margin	height
make the .child absolute and the .parent relative such that the child can be tricked into a central position using margin auto while maintaining the correct height

20018040
width	height
the image only honours the height 100 css so when the browser viewport is smaller in width you get the following

20018060
width	height	background-image	background-size
with use of border-radius you can make a circle effect with then a background-image property to shape it then adjust the width height to size you desire you could even use background-size cover to keep the circle responsive to whatever the image size

20018080
websocket	pusher
it uses pusher which is websocket but is the same principle

20018099
width	height
you are confusing what setting width height and setting the viewbox property mean on an svg element

20018099
width	height
the height and width control the dimension of the svg element inside the layout of the dom while the viewbox sets the coordinate system inside the svg element

20018099
width	height
here the size of the svg element is 300px 500px but the coordinate system internally starts from -100 -100 and has a width and height of 200 and 200 each

20018156
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
anyway add the circle to your uiwindow on top of your uinavigationcontroller

20018164
int	double
it should be applicable to float int long and double

20018237
post	put
my wordpress post video link i put

20018362
folder	directory
edit thanks to the comment i thought about another suggestion you might have to move your acm directory to the src folder as well as indeed that is where eclipse will look for your source files

20018369
getter	setter
entity would be simple popo just a bag of setter and getter

20018385

according to capistrano api i can use this method to upload files i also found it in source code of sshkit lib

20018438
hide	show
i am trying to hide show the status bar in ios 7 and 6 programmatically not viewcontroller based but method based

20018457
int	boolean	serializable	deserialization
all those having serializable objects based on the original version of the class who have stored objects containing a field called age of type int containing the age of a person and field named ismale of type boolean containing information about the gender are likely to fail during the deserialization of these objects because the new class definition uses new fields and new data types

20018497
folder	directory
i would advice to use appdomain.currentdomain.basedirectory this code will return the directory where the current application is located lets say you want to get all the directory in the folder where the application is located then you will get something like this

20018509
google-chrome	firefox
i get valid outputs for both google-chrome and firefox on android but the android stock browser shows undefined for alert 4 whereas google-chrome shows the output as function window native code firefox shows the output as object window

20018551
union	distinct
union query distinct

20018551
union	distinct
note there is duplicated content in category id 2 union distinct default is not excluding this because it compares rows from both columns so

20018597
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome just will not do while firefox is known that the cookie saves me but does not show me the text

20018599
bellman-ford	dijkstra
if you want to have all all shortest paths from all nodes to all other nodes you can just run dijkstra from each node or you can try bellman-ford which is bit faster but a little bit harder to grasp

20018602
rdf	owl
i m using topbraid composer against my owl file in rdf xml

20018620
pull	push
you can set up pull notifications simple polling push notifications must set up a contract on both ends streaming notifications kind of the best of both worlds or set up a periodic sync of the inbox

20018643
put	get
i want to get the values of each array by using a loop or something so i could then put the values into variables such that aff 1001 desc frank and camp getfrankemail and so on.

20018684
httpresponse	request
instead after making the connection the client waits a few seconds for all request to complete and then receives all of the httpresponse at once before closing

20018700
versioning	upgrade
to resolve this problem you should upgrade commons-dbcp library to latest versioning 1.4

20018734
put	get
i put some printf at various stages of the program to see at which point i get an error inserted

20018746
versioning	upgrade
to resolve this problem you should upgrade commons-dbcp library to latest versioning 1.4

20018762
subshell	ifs
it is also very good to use find s -print0 option but then you would need to change the ifs variable within the while subshell

20018790
getter	setter
attr_accessor defines getter and setter

20018792
textview	imageview
i think you are using an imageview and a textview for custom list row

20018799
mouseleave	mouseenter
the problem is when you mouseenter and mouseleave immediately fast enough your animate function in the mouseenter event is not finished yet

20018803
apache	nginx
however my production setup wpengine uses an nginx proxy in front of apache and flush no longer works nor do any of the other output buffering commands

20018819

in your case based on the width and height of those images can be

20018897
width	height
this if elements inside got no margins same width and height etc

20018960
post	get
i get a cannot cast int to buildingtype exception after some search i followed the blog post written here

20018978
min	max
i received this line from my teacher to randomize a number between the min and max values and it works perfectly but i have tried to understand how exactly and i just couldn t

20019003
tolower	toupper
the standard library provides the c functions std toupper and std tolower which return the upper lower case of the specified ascii character

20019009
width	height
the reason your bodies may be numerically unstable is because the ratio of the width to height is greater than the normal sizes of objects

20019009
width	height
try changing the dimensions of your objects so the width is 8 and the height is 0.1

20019011
tolower	toupper
assume there is no spaces at the beginning you can use std toupper and std tolower

20019019
geocoding	geocode
you can geocode the addresses with google geocoding api

20019054
fontfamily	font-size
i need to extract some css values from elements like font-size or fontfamily to modify them later and i m using jsoup because it seems very simple but trying to obtain values i encountered problems this code for example

20019057
range	minimum
adding the minimum of the required range dice_min to it shifts the range to 1 6

20019149
for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop to iterate over the arrays and check for the smallest

20019183
post	get
n.b the actual form will use post rather than get i ve just changed it so i could link to the results

20019193
vtk	itk
and avoid the use the install target with for vtk itk gdcm or any cmake based library that names its release libraries the same as its debug libraries

20019193
folder	directory
then when you need to configure your application to use cmake i point vtk_dir to the root directory of the folder where i built vtk and cmake will then correctly use the debug libraries in my debug application release libraries in my release application

20019291
put	get	post	get	post	put

20019305
for-loop	arrays
i tried to convert it to an arrays and then use for-loop

20019337
opera	google-chrome
edit for some reason even without the problematic lines google-chrome keeps downloading the files while ie and opera display the pages.

20019390
width	height
you could probably write your own attached property for center that you animate and have it set the top left based on the current height width

20019400
int	boolean
i want to create a method that scans an int for a bitpattern like 110 and return the result as a boolean

20019507
skemitternode	skshapenode
i have an skshapenode with a child skemitternode

20019663
emitmapper	automapper
i think that for the best performance you should compile mapper using reflection.emit or use one of already existing emitmapper vs valueinjecter or automapper performance

20019819
gson	jackson
i am using gson instead of jackson since gson has been in my app for a while and i have existing tweaks converters and annotations peppered throughout my app

20019834

the awt event thread should only be used to oberserve events for purposes such as profiling testing and debugging

20019930
invokelater	invokeandwait
the methods invokelater and its friend invokeandwait are used to synchronize java s so-called initial threads one of which executes the main method and is therefore called the main thread with the event dispatch thread

post	get
i know this this has been asked in numerous post but honestly i don t get them

20019966
punctuation	words
so will match not only but also and - in several of these places where you are defining punctuation marks i think you more likely mean to use literal not words

20019969
post	get
you re trying to sent post data when doing a get request

20020014
minimum	max
also in case you are accepting negative values as input you should initialize max to minimum integer value

20020035
button	checkbox
you missed a checkbox which says generate web.xml just before hitting finish button while creating dynamic web project in eclipse

20020062
min	max
your issue is that you re initializing min and max to before numbers is populated so they re both getting set to zero

20020062
min	max
this is wrong both for min in case all your numbers are positive and for max in case all your numbers are negative

20020062
min	max
then min and max will both be initialized to the first input number which is fine

20020091
for-loop	arrays
also to fill all your arrays the for-loop should be

20020177
umask	mount
i now mount the filesystem inside my program by executing mount -t vfat -o umask 000 dev loop0 mnt foo

20020331
children	parent
there are a few parent which have children and one that has grandchildren

20020373
toolchain	binutils
it might be requiring an interpreter not present on the target system that s mostly due to a toolchain misconfiguration either the mkspecs were wrong but most likely gcc ld and the other binutils have been configured with wrong paths

20020387
cos	sin
your camangle variable is in radian cause you use it with cos and sin

20020390

i am wondering what needs to be put in for the source_address and source_port field in the ip tcp header so that i get a valid response

20020518
getter	setter
to access the properties you want you can use _firstname to use the ivar or self.firstname to use the property s setter and getter methods

20020518
accessor	ivar
because you are using the ivar directly instead of calling the accessor method the copy is not being made -- you have to call copy yourself

20020535
folder	directory
in that directory i have a symlink called webservices that points directly to my tomcat_home webapps folder

20020738
int	chars	ord	chr
you can convert between chars and int values with ord and chr

20020738
ord	chr
the unicode value for a is 97 so ord a is 97 and chr 97 is a

20020744
gruntjs	grunt-contrib-watch
i think you have to use grunt-contrib-watch as a separate task -- that makes gruntjs keep running which makes the server keep running

20020745
int	chars
chars encodes unicode code points as individual int which is somewhat inefficient

20020799
int	double
my issue is that to make an equilateral triangle i need the square root 3 2 and the drawpolygon method i can only use int int int the compiler will not let me double because it differ in lengh

20020816

20020877
post	put
you can rewrite the http verb to put post but the body of the request would still be a merge request you can find examples about rewriting here

20020928
g++	gcc
for c++ you will want to replace gcc with g++ or add -lstdc++ if you want to use the std c++ library to your gcc command line

20020937

opera	google-chrome
google-chrome opera and ie10+ use the standard

20021000
width	height
if you prefer to have values for length width and height here they are 6 x 2 x 2

20021000
width	height
length is on the x axis width on y and height on z

20021056
int	chars
you could replace java s public int func int a chars b with def func a b and for ruby scala and python you d need to do almost nothing in this case

subtract	add
i think the way to solve this would be to start a counter when the app is put into the background and add subtract that from the stopwatch timer when the app starts up again

20021157
width	height
to change height and width use minheight and minwidth properties and then adjust font using fontsize property

20021289
union	distinct
union will attempt to do a distinct sort on the result set

20021296
ssl	https

postgresql	mysql
here s the answer for postgresql or mysql but it should work on other dbms as well

20021710

one reason it s not included by default is that malicious packages of any kind like tgz can contains programs named the same as systemd commands that will remove things start viruses or small daemons for future ddos attacks

20021775
width	height
because your body element will have the total height width containing all blocks your overlay will be correct and taking full available space

i had a similar problem of rspec capybara not detecting ajax changes when things seemed to work fine through a browser

20021829
super	self
now you may be wondering what super card_deck self .append value was actually doing in your original example

for the multiplication and division it is definitely not sufficient to do memberwise operations

20023512
put	get
if you put this code in a method inside class a and then call this method in your main program in the correct order before calling getdata it will still be very confusing code but you should get your desired result

20023929
ssl	https
i do not know of any major sites that encrypt client side because the accepted norm is to use https since it allows all of your outgoing data to be encrypted by being sent on top of ssl tcp protocol

20023948
rss	feed
i m trying to use dotdotdot to truncate metadata pulled from a tumblr rss feed

20023977

for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop to iterate through as you feed them into the arrays

20024051
inline	inlining
update ipython has removed support for the command line inlining of pylab so the fix for that with this trick is to just eliminate --pylab inline if you have a newer ipython version or just don t want pylab obviously

the button hide correctly however it doesn t show

20024094

imho adobe could just extends rtsp it s extensible and just define their specific payload to allow all existing rtsp players to implements it w o much hassle but they didn t...

20024110
dlsym	dlopen
on systems using dlopen and dlsym if the variables are external you might be able to look them up with dlsym on an appropriate handle but this is a sledgehammer to crack a nut â and a nut that doesn t need cracking in the first place

20024130
post	get
i send username and password with post method to php file and get this json encoded output

20024154

20024196
glut	qglwidget
this bug happens both under glut and inside a qt qglwidget subclass

20024209
yacc	bison
furthermore the only meaningful way to return token types which will be understood correctly by your bison yacc parser is to declare the various var_int var_double etc.

20024209
yacc	bison
as token s in your bison yacc file and import the generated header file but i presume you are already doing that

20024215
button	checkbox
this worked for me when i had a checkbox with appearance button and flatstyle flat and wanted it flashing when checked

20024239
getter	setter
also note that i think what you are practicing here is very bad style and should be done via getter and setter methods or generally in a totally different way

20024245
getter	setter
in the world of classes with automatic references and properties with getter setter methods they tend to be very counter-intuitive

20024261
put	preflight	put	get	post	get	post	put
any cross-origin put request will result in a preflight options as will a delete or any other method other than post get or head

20024261
post	get
a post get head will also result in a preflight if it includes non-simple headers such as a post with a content-type of application json

20024263
disk	ram
sure it is possible as long as you have enough ram memory and swap space on the disk

20024269
google-chrome	safari
the svg mask i use for google-chrome and safari with their webkit-mask-box-image work great by resizing the mask to fit the element i m using which in this case is an image

20024313
put	get
don t get me wrong you might still want to query your database to put data on the ui etc but you could just use a simple tool like linq to sql dapper etc and whack the data straight out of the db into the ui skipping all the orm eager lazy loading nonsense

20024336
ati	nvidia
indeed cuda technology is exclusive to nvidia devices so ati video cards doesn t support it

20024336
versioning	upgrade
there has been a considerable amount of changes to the ocl module since it was first released so i suggest you upgrade to a more recent versioning

20024343
pop-up	dialog
on its own slidernav works great and dialog works fine with slidernav but not vice versa but i am using this for a directory application and each name is generated inside a loop which had a modal pop-up for each person with their details so i need to use them together

20024397
strncpy	strtok
in case it helps before i encountered this problem i had to suppress errors raised by argvfunctions.cpp that were due to the fact that the functions therein use the versions of strtok and strncpy that microsoft deprecated due to security issues i m making sure that nothing passed to the functions could trip them up as nearly as i can tell so those issues wouldn t be a problem either way

20024417
awt	swing
see this answer on swing extras over awt for many good reasons to abandon using awt components

20024418
xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
generate the types with and external tool xsd.exe in this case -- taking a cue from the wsdl type provider which uses svcutil.exe

i m trying to vertically and horizontally center an image of variable height and width in a container that also has a variable height

20024446
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it s working beautifully in google-chrome and safari but firefox is not displaying the images

20024497
mp4	webm	wmv	flv
with avi wmv mp4 flv webm files this code works ok but with mkv it returns only black image tested with x264 video stream and xvid video stream

20024518
stdout	stderr
strace prints to stderr while popen only looks at stdout

20024532
unsigned	short
the mv object is now a memory view interpreting every 2 bytes as an unsigned short

20024570
versioning	upgrade
this white paper ftp public.dhe.ibm.com software data ims pdf tcg2013015li.pdf suggests they re pushing that as an option and no doubt the later versioning of ims have a bunch of features that might not be available in the versioning you re running assuming you ve not upgrade to the latest

20024570
put	get
but sometimes if you put that same hierarchical structure in oracle and only allow the same sort of access patterns that were possible in ims you d get all the performance you want

20024599
google-chrome	safari
linux x86_64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 31.0.1650.57 safari 537.36 module default version wp1

20024614
for-loop	arrays
you can convert the word to an arrays of char and use a for-loop to alternate upper and lower case

20024621
pop-up	dialog
a dialog box will pop-up asking where you would like to save the file

20024643
width	height
their width counterparts however return the respective height value multiplied by the view aspect ratio

20024643
width	height
now that s all out of the way something tells me that i m computing the height and width of the near and far clip planes improperly

20024643
width	height
where i think this is causing problems is in my frustum culling function which uses the width height of the near and far planes to obtain points for the top right left and bottom planes as well

20024666
wifstream	wofstream
turns out project was using unicode and had to use wifstream and wofstream to be able to properly read the strings rather than attempt to convert them from ansi to unicode

20024704
getter	setter
and any bright ideas for a better strategy considering struts params and declaring the common fields and its description at one place but using the same with different values and getter and setter in each class

20024721
int	chars
so that code that processes an input stream a chars at a time can easily detect the end of file condition the function getchar is defined to return an int not chars and to return the signal value eof when the end of the input is detected

20024733
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome v31 and firefox v25.0.1 refuse to set the div s innerhtml to the value

20024793
google-chrome	firefox
it is working well in google-chrome but not in my ie and firefox

20024806
getter	setter
if you want to reuse fields getter and setter your best bet is to use composition and not inheritance

20024817
g++	gcc
i installed both correctly but it doesn t matter if i set up the path to compiler correctly or not because it can t find gcc and g++

20024819
getter	setter
getter and setter for oddzial and adres_zamieszkania

20024823
google-chrome	safari
this only seems to work in safari - not google-chrome

20024884
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it s working fine but in firefox and ie there is a horizontal scrolling bar

20024891
folder	directory
in order to build the project right-click on the project and select clean build - it ll create a dist directory containing the build output files along with all dependencies within a lib folder

20024926
for-loop	loops
i ve got this project to submit in college but it seems that i can t get the for-loop to be divided among the several thread since i m trying to print to thread number in the entire loops it just keeps printing zeros indicating that only the master thread is handling the for-loop so here s the code

20024960
draggable	droppable
i have a page with a large number of jquery ui draggable and a large number of droppable s

20024960
draggable	droppable
i wanted some custom logic to determine if a droppable would accept a certain draggable so i coded up some logic in the accept event of the droppable

20024978
children	parent
i ve done this quite a few times in my life with full-width headers and background images and i ve found the cleanest solution is to section off parent elements according to what they are in the doc header content etc. keep them full width and wrap their content-containing children in a container

20024993
google-chrome	firefox
does appear on jsfiddle.net at least in google-chrome and firefox do not appear when copy pasting to local standalone file .

20024997
width	height
the reason the above works is because when giving padding-top bottom a percentage value it is relative to the width of the parent not the height

20025106
int	chars
if you want the int portion in a six chars wide column with the . and the fractions portion after these 6 chars its 9.2f

20025112
int	chars
first fold the input case so you are testing for a single case of chars then use string.find to convert from letter to int at once

20025112
int	chars
which will either make loc1 be an int from 1 to 8 or nil if that chars is not in the range a to h

20025131
inherited	subclassing
private set function and friend class would be an option but unfortunately i have a lot of subclassing of foowriter and since friendship can not be inherited i would not like to list them all as friends

20025165
g++	gcc
download this chose the desired compilers gcc and g++

20025171
google-chrome	firefox
the image looks fine when viewed in google-chrome and ie10 but i get really rough looking pixelation when viewed in firefox

20025176
ioexception	filewriter
the filewriter constructor which you are using is declared as throwing an ioexception

20025179
uilabel	uibutton
i think you are setting tag value for uibutton not uilabel that is its child

20025181
rss	feed
this application is extracting information from an rss feed and i need to sort the articles by date

20025216
division	multiplication
with the cplex lp format for example there is no better way you cannot use division for the coefficient or even multiplication for that matter and there is no function to include another file or introduce a symbolic names for a parameter

20025262
outputstream	inputstream
you must flush the stream before closing also i switched the order because if you closed the inputstream attached to the socket it will close the socket and then will not move on to closing the outputstream or flushing it

20025322
hide	show
on each fragment they have a toggle button that show hide a answer

20025335
width	height
if you want it to scale it but maintaining its width height ratio then use

20025337
getter	setter
strange is when i wrap the id getter and setter of the article object inside the bean in

20025338
hash	md5
i keep track of a md5 hash of large files as opposed to the files themselves

20025377
typedef	struct
typedef struct set

20025378
public	protected
if they re protected or public they ll be accessible in the derived classes

20025403
uicontrol	uiresponder
uitextfield inherits from uicontrol which inherits from uiview which inherits from uiresponder which inherits from nsobject

20025416
width	height
this will make the inside element define the height and width of its parent

20025425
hide	show
because javascript is event based the hide in each element runs at more or less the same time and the show is most likely to execute last resulting in the div remaining visible

20025426
ssl	https
the ssl cert is from godaddy and we re actually hosting the https site over port 8081 and fwding that to 443

20025487
punctuation	words
i will define a words as anything that doesn t have a space or punctuation and a character is any letter a-z or 0-9

20025512
implode	substr
however when i implode the checkboxes it returns multiple commas i was thinking of using substr and if else to remove the amount of comma based on the question selection

20025543
put	get
what i did next was to create a jquery code that will get all the values of and put each of them in an array

20025670
width	height
you can store images in width x height x frames array and apply filter across 3rd dimention

20025707
devise	cancan
so cancan does depend on devise s current_user in authorization it checks if the current_user is authorize

20025741
ftp	telnet
in general its a good idea to leave the ports alone since people learn the well-known port numbers and expect them you wouldn t expect the default port telnet or ftp to move

20025794
post	get
when i go to the post route it is sending a get request to the server and the node server is sending back the right data but it doesn t seem to be persisting in ember

20025809
draggable	droppable
all elements are draggable and droppable using jquery ui

20025875
punctuation	words
for learning features beyond just the words and punctuation and sentence patterns the number of retweets might be useful questions don t get retweeted as much as news for instance

20025881
post	get
i have placed a couple of post on here and so far i haven t been able to get the code to work

20025906
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari	versioning	upgrade
experience has shown that relying on client software upgrade to deliver a business solution is fruitless the very existence of this project has to do with a fragmented panorama of user agent distribution with clients connecting with latest versioning of the most modern user agents google-chrome firefox and safari but others with versioning as low as ie 5.5

20025913
addclass	removeclass
also i prefer to use removeclass and addclass rather than toggleclass just because i am able to keep track of what s happening in my head better that way

20025914
put	get
i get these lines one by one by getline function and assume i put each line in a myline variable

20025916
folder	directory
currently the parent directory is set to 0 755 and the created folder are supposed to be given 0777

20025930
post	get
however the users to post relationship does not seem to work when trying to add a user i get the error

20025954
maven	cargo
when i used a maven cargo plugin to generate the tables it put all the person columns in the player table so there is a duplication of information which i wasn t expecting but that is ok

20025957
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome i have the json viewer and it formats correctly but in firefox it doesn t show as json

the non-standard intel 80-bit precision implemented as long double by some x86 x64 compilers provides 64 significant bits and can represent 64bit int long int on lp64 systems unix or long long int on llp64 systems windows

20029642
int	double
the fact that double fits an extended range of int even surpassing the range of 32-bit int is used in javascript which doesen t have special int numerical type and instead uses double precision floating-point to represent int

20029642
floating-point	integer
one quirk of floating-point numbers is that they have separate sign bit and therefore things like positive and negative zeros exist which is not possible in the two s complement signed integer representation

set the width height of the svg element to the window.innerwidth and window.innerheight or to the maximum dimension you want it to grow to

20029986
width	height
one could however use getbbox to get the dimensions of the g box where it rendered and try to set the viewbox such that it just fits the svg or set the height width on the svg to match the dimension for the g 1 1 but that could lead to a broken layout

20030007

20031136
getter	setter
fix it accordingly by using integer instead of int in the setter or in this particular case better by using int instead of integer in the getter

20031136
getter	setter
that it worked when you exploded the model in the controller bad practice by the way is because the getter and setter matched each other

20031225

now if you give a top margin of -25dip half of circle s height to your textview you ll get a perfect semicircle in the bottom but i ve added just another 10dip 10dip padding to keep the text in place just to get a closer look to what you re looking for

20036675
textview	imageview
if you further want to change background of the top imageview you don t want the rest of the circle to mess with the looks you could just add the imageview after you add the textview so it would have a higher z-index then use a separate textview to display text above the image

otherwise you could use the javascript onmouseover or the jquery hover mouseenter events to show the text in the play div

usually the add and subtract instructions are type-agnostic the same way the compare instruction is but the multiplying and divide instructions are not except for some forms of multiplying that return partial results

20038473
subtract	add
the add and subtract instructions can be type-agnostic because the wrapping that occurs in the arithmetic works for both twoâ s complement and unsigned

20038473
division	multiplication
however that wrapping does not work for multiplication and division

int	double
i have tried with double and int but it still shows 0.0

20038585
for-loop	arrays
if you just need to scan through the arrays and add up the numbers until the sum is reached then just add a for-loop to copy the previous values from the arrays to the new arrays when the sum is found

however if a persistence unit of the same name is defined by an ejb-jar war or application jar file within the ear the persistence unit of that name defined at ear level will not be visible to the components defined by that ejb-jar war or application jar file unless the persistence unit reference uses the persistence unit name # syntax to specify a path name to disambiguate the reference

20038690
crypt	hash
i currently have the program do some minor custom encryption first then use jbcrypt to crypt hash and then use php to check the database for matching hash

20038690
hash	salt
however the problem is that when using gensalt n you get a random salt everytime and therefore the computed hash never matches the stored hash

20038716
minimum	max
the software package or information if you plan to download software from a source like amazon.com will give you the minimum system requirements and then it will give you the recommended system requirements if i was going to build a system for graphic design i would look at the differences between the minimum and recommended requirements and anything they say you need more of i would max out exp

20038716
minimum	max
they say the minimum ram required is 4gb but the recommended is 8gb so i would max the ram out if my motherboard can take 16gb ram that s what i m going to use.

20038818
google-chrome	firefox
i ve had a similar problem where my ajax would work fine in google-chrome but would only post once in firefox because of some add-ons extensions and then i disabled them and they worked

20038825
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i tried hardcoding in my sample arrays thus removing the for-loop and my code worked as expected which leads me to believe that there is some problem with my loops that i m not seeing

20038881
put	get
i m compiling on msvc in visual studio 2012 on x86 in release mode with all optimizations enabled optimize for speed whole program optimization etc.whether i put all the code of case 1 in the header or use this with combination with forceinline it doesn t matter it doesn t get inlined.here is the generated asm

20038883
for-loop	loops
first of all when you execute if hashmap1.containskey key the java loops to check each key to check existence of key automatically so that you don t need to write the for-loop code by yourself

20038936
post	get
i am able to get this to work on the archive for this post type so there should be some way to do it

20038943
udp	tcp
the reason why i cannot use tcp is because sometimes the client is behind a nat router and it is simpler to do udp hole punching than tcp

20038975

quad	uniform
you don t need this if your quad are uniform in size it will just be 1

20039357
int	chars
if you used s as your format string then you would take the input as a c-style chars array and have to convert those chars if you wanted to get the int value out of that

20039375
google-chrome	firefox
firefox implemented prefixed version of mozcapturestreamuntilended however their rtcpeerconnection implementation is unable to add understand stream coming from generated by mozcapturestreamuntilended because afaik currently only one media source apm is permitted both on google-chrome and firefox

fread	calloc	memset	calloc
in c you can t expect a 0 character after the last byte you read via fread -- you ve got to put it there first either with a memset or calloc

20039457
for-loop	loops
i know that i could use a for-loop to evaluate derivfun for every row of evalpoints but i d like to avoid using such a loops if possible

20039481
int	chars
read data from the string using sscanf read the int and one more chars after a space

20039481
int	chars
if it does then you either have strings in the beginning it returns 0 since it couldn t read an int or you have extra whitespace chars at the end that is it also matched the c format specifier

20039960
width	height
make that image no larger than the max width and height of the recipecell

20039969
post	get
in your jquery ajax code use contenttype application json and that should get it doing the kind of post request you want

20039981
ksort	asort
i ve tried array_merge_recursive but it didn t seem to do anything i ve tried ksort and asort but it didn t sort it correctly even with flags

i ve stripped out a whole bunch of code to get down to this little bit but haven t figured out why no post values are being sent

20040151
mouseover	mouseout
i have written test code for the button but the mouseover and mouseout are impacting the click

20040151
mouseover	mouseout
so with the mouseover and mouseout handlers when i click the button it fades away and comes right back

20040156
width	height
the parent div is set to occupy the entire screen of unknown size so width 100 and height 100

20040156
width	height
the width and height of the child div are unknown

20040156
width	height
the width and height of the child div must be constrained to the size of the parent so max-width 100 and max-height 100

20040161
width	height
use this and set height and width as per your requirement

20040330
equals	gethashcode
if the objects that you are referring to are your own custom classes then you will need to override the equals and gethashcode methods

maven	pom.xml
i thought maybe i could configure it somehow with the pom.xml but i m very new to maven and not too familiar with the pom.xml

20040628
elasticsearch	kibana
going redundant with data is a easier approach if you want to view both graphite and kibana data over graphite since the webapp would not query elasticsearch directly

20040650
google-chrome	firefox
however when i render the second texture nothing happens on google-chrome but it works on firefox

20040684
int	chars
but what can we do if instead of chars buffer i want to convert data to int buffer basically i want to do following

20040712
put	get
i would imagine based on what you put although i m not sure you re considering all possible cases a way to get the specific answer you re looking for while taking a few things for granted and not directly relying on n would be.

20040766
google-chrome	firefox
and for firefox google-chrome and ie i am using watir-webdriver

20040772
width	height
you have to set the height and width for the image in wvga version and then the layout will scale to 160

20040818
post	get
i am completely new to jqgrid and simply having a hard time get started as every post seem to be very advanced

20040822
put	get
and use this _filerepository to put and get files in dbcontext methods

20040916
post	get
i think you should use post instead of get see the code below

20040982
width	height
i ve also tried the sum of e -i 2 pi x u width + y v height 1 width height which gets the same result as expected although it s still not the desiered output

20041006
post	get
it s basically a request that you create yourself to the server - either get or post

20041012
nonetype	iterable
typeerror nonetype object is not iterable errno 2

20041022
range	max	range	min	min	max
you can perform operations such as std min std max std all_of std any_of std none_of in the adapted range

20041034
hash	salt
for their sake you should always hash every password with salt

20041037
flip	slide
but if the user flip backwards from the first slide or forward from the last slide .main doesn t have a target to be transferred to

20041037
hide	show
counter-intuitively to me at least this just makes the first and last slides no longer show hide and no longer receive the .main class so we get stuck with the second and second-to-last slides up

20041063
accelerometer	gyroscope
as the title stated i want to make dead reckoning with accelerometer and gyroscope

20041064
post	put

20041322
width	height
specify width and height for window.open this will open up a new pop-up window

20041411
post	get
once fraga has been added to the main layout i call the public method fraga.addfragb to get it to add an instance of fragmentclassb to itself but this causes the test app to crash indicating activity has been destroyed see logcat at the end of the post

20041417
serializable	deserialization
if you will use json that is a good choice you need to understand javscript object structure serializable in client side and deserialization in server side

20041440
post	get
i ve been trying to work with php post data for the past two days and after being absolutely positive my code was logical i gave up attempting to get it working myself

20041487
int	double
like other variables in java an array must have a specific type like byte int string or double

20041522
128bit	64bit
but also note that in the same answer we get a warning it is a 128bit datatype as opposed to 64bit which is the size of a double

20041529
hide	show
but i m going to guess that you re doing an ajax call and then trying to dynamically load some content and after that content is loaded you want to hide show some things

20041590
getter	setter
don t use getter and setter don t use function calls

20041708
button	checkbox
those are styled button over top of hidden checkbox

20041708
button	checkbox
user presses the styled button checks the checkbox underneath changes the class of the styled button to reflect

20041720
width	height
what you can do is to just add the width and height to all the classes as those will be icons just by adding a comma

20041720
width	height
this will minify your efforts to all the time adding width and height

20041720
width	height
after declaring the classes for icons with width and height you just need to redeclare them by just changing the .png names for them all

20041720
width	height
an alternate solution would be to create an image sprite and declare the image with width and height dimensions for all and just changing background-position for all the same redeclared classes above

20041736
folder	directory
i would also like for it to go into multiple folder that may be created in the future folder would be in the same directory as the code

20041743
post	get
now set http method post or get

20041743
post	get
above method is used to receive the data which we get using post

20041787
superclass	subclassing
you can not cast the object of subclassing to superclass.as superclass has generalized characteristics while subclassing has special characteristics

20041873
ceil	floor
decide if you want floor or ceil of the result follow example given below

20041922
width	height
should yield an object with properties height and width

20041922
width	height
in case you wanted to calculate the delta of either of these values you could reference ui.originalsize and either the height or width properties there as well

20041937
put	get
i can get this manually like getting yesterday date 17 and put the rest of the value myself but i need this programmatically the full form

20041945
cpu	affinity
you can artificially constrain the amount of cpu resources that presto uses at the operating system level using cgroups cpu affinity etc

20041945
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity	affinity	processors
for example on a machine with 16 processors you could use cgroups or cpu affinity to dedicate 2 cores to the coordinator process and restrict the worker process to 14 cores

20041961
children	parent
i want to have all the children cats to be hidden and on each select event of any parent category the relative children to become visible using their values which is identical to their parent s value

20042025

20042095
button	checkbox
i want to try something like if the checkbox is checked and submit button pressed the javascript alert should say true

20042108
int	double
you can either use an explicit cast like double totalroomsoccupied or just make 100 as 100.0 which is a floating point number thus making the division too a floating point one and not an int division

20042123
onresume	onpause
i have implemented it by keeping flags in each activities onresume and onpause

20042149
inherited	base-class
if you use polymorphism you can store different kinds of objects that inherited from the same base-class inside a container when using pointers

20042301
filtering	grouping
having filtering grouping by and aggregate functions while where filtering rows

20042336
lodash	underscore.js
use underscore.js 1 or lodash and their methods for arrays

20042336
lodash	underscore.js
i feel that as underscore.js and lodash are popular its additional benefit as people would be able to understand your intentions

20042342
hide	show
i think what you need is a progress function and show a waiting image before ajax starts and hide after ajax ends

libjpeg	freetype	zlib	libjpeg
i have installed cmake and downloaded the other libraries mentioned like freetype zlib libjpeg

20042490
width	height
a rectangle should usually only have a width and height if any sides have different lengths then it s not a true rectangle

20042490
width	height
3 you might want to determine your positions on screen by multiplying by width and height of the rectangle that you re trying to draw and adding that value to the origin 0 0

20042537
int	chars
you ll be able to have much more flexibility you can now make averages and all sorts of calculations with int that you can t with strings and you can leave the issue to your page rendering script rather than wrestle with db chars encodings

20042566
google-chrome	firefox
you can try this demo tested in google-chrome and firefox

20042671
free	malloc
gc copies alive objects and throws all dead one since gc does not need to do anything for the dead one only for the live ones gc in theory is faster then the normal malloc free loop for objects

20042671
free	malloc
however one thing is forgotten by most java advocates and that is that nothing says that you will have to malloc free every object instance when coding c

20042671
free	malloc
you can reuse memory you can malloc up memory blocks and free memory blocks containing thousands of temporarily objects on one go

20042681
nsstring	nsdata
there is a way to convert to nsdata and change format but i would prefer to do via nsstring

20042705

is there any way to get the image size width and height without converting it into nsdata

20042807
width	height
based on the screen size you can set the button height and width

20042834

so while the ajax request itself is finished the code which is injecting new content into the dom is still running and thus the hide and show calls run before the new content is injected

20058547

put something to check whether there is new content yet or wrap the hide and show methods in a settimeout

20058585
int	chars
the result could be anything void int chars id etc

20058588
for-loop	loops
it would be as simple as throwing all your points in a for-loop and adding the circles to the map in loops

20058614
express	node.js
i am toying around with all the fancy node.js mongodb express platforms and stumbled across a problem

20058623
put	get
this gets a lot easier though if you put each group of these in some kind of container say a div because then you can use parentnode possibly repeatedly until you get to the div then either getelementsbytagname or on modern browsers queryselector to find the relevant elements within the div in a more robust way

20058636

20058816
post	get
yesod indeed expands what it sees in the the routes file or what you type in the parseroutes function in a quasiquotes section and gives the server the appropriately named get or post function by prefixing get or post to the resource name

20058816
post	get
all that you need to do is create the get post function and the framework will use the routes to call the function for you

20059066
for-loop	arrays
i have tried a for-loop on my arrays of rows of presidents but it simply keeps iterating over the first row ie

20059100
stdout	fflush
for completeness you could also do hflush stdout to explicitly fflush the partial line to file

20059116
submit	submission
your problem is that the actual form you are submission has only one element in it - the submit button

20059136
devise	cancan
it will work reading the commonly used current_user helper method so that cancan works fine with devise and other similar gems

20059175
submit	submission
what you saying the last paragraph is correct you are submission the form1 which contains only the submit button so mark doesn t exist in the php script that handles the post

i ve tried skinning the cat with a few different packages rodbc rjdbc dbi rpostgres etc but i seem to keep getting driver errors

20059384
integer	unsigned
without an int cast on vi.size the output is garbage because size returns an unsigned integer

20059422
int	double
this includes conversions between real and int like abs x when x is double

20059455
hide	show
the prob is the timeline plays async so the hide function returns before the animation plays and the new form is show with no animation

20059483
division	modulo
mind that is the modulo which returns the integer remainder of the integer division

20059486
tex	mathjax
check andrew ng s lecture notes from lecture 3 on svms notation changed to make it easier to type without mathjax tex on this site

20059536

google-chrome	firefox
if i remove html encoding google-chrome firefox display but ie does not render the label as it get s hung up on interpretting the as the start of an html encoded character

20059649
put	get
if you put uiviewcontroller to window.root and your navigation controller is just a property of the root controller than your navigation won t get appropriate callbacks from uiapplication so u must add navigation as child view controller to your root controller

20059681
post	get
post your result of the command above if you still cannot get it going

20059745
implements	extends
this class extends abstractaction which means that it also implements the actionlistener interface and can be used anywhere that actionlisteners are used

20059751
clang	llvm
my usual approach with these things is see what clang generates - both the llvm ir and the c++ api calls c++ backend

20059751
clang	llvm
you re free to tweak the input c code replacing vars with constants etc and seeing what clang llvm emit

20059770
for-loop	loops
if running the 100 tasks is completed faster with a simple for-loop than with a parallel foreach loops then running these 100 tasks in a regular for-loop 4000 times will be faster than running the 100 tasks in a parallelized foreach loops 4000 times

20059783
width	height
at the moment i am not sure if it is by height or width but maybe it helps you figure it out

20060126
button	checkbox
the issue you are running into is you need to take into account the height of the header button and checkbox

20060126
button	checkbox
i can only see this working if you are able to use height calc 100 - footer height - header height - vertical margins on the form and height calc 100 - button height - checkbox height - vertical margins on the textarea

20060126
box-sizing	border-box
i also added box-sizing border-box

from my print statements not included i can see it is calculating the max correctly but it not the min because it prints the zeros that i initialized the variables to instead of the true minimum values

20060398
multiplying	add
then you will need to multiplying the price by the stock quantity and add the results to totalvalue with each iteration

this should work in google-chrome firefox on select elements

20060585
for-loop	loops
a c-style for-loop has more flexibility but ultimately you can write an equivalent loops with python s while or c s while for that matter which touches not only on the â œone obvious wayâ principle but also â œsimple is better than complexâ amongst others

20060606
for-loop	loops
not having the c-style for-loop makes some already-very-complicated for loops slightly more complicated by forcing them to be while loops

original c had chars short int long and that was progressive as it tried without being too specific to accommodate the various int sizes available across a wide variety of processors and environments

20078787

the bottom one is the one that works for ie 10 just keeps all the dimensions to what you set a selector element to be in the width and or height

20079900
post	get
from what i read you could change the value post in your form to get - that way you only need to accept get - not sure if i understood it the right way

20079969
public	protected
i changed a public property of a class to protected

20079989
for-loop	loops
if i change from dynamic creation of each command in the for-loop to explicit ones by adding this after loops then it works as expected each column sorts itself

20080049
int	double
however when i changed to int line int vdata new int 10 or double it does not work and have this error

20080051
serializable	deserialization
you can use serializable deserialization to do that

20080132
stdout	stderr
readlines will read the entire file at once and stdout and stderr will block until your script exits

20080174

20080317
width	height
the css box-sizing rule determines how an element s dimensions are computed with width and height taking on different meanings depending on the value

20080317
width	height
content-box is default and means don t include padding or border in the values of width and height

20080317
width	margin
will mean that 40px 20px + 20px of that 200px width will be consumed for the margin padding and only 160px will be left for content width

20080317
box-sizing	border-box
the likely reason behind the shotgun approach you found setting box-sizing border-box

20080317
box-sizing	border-box
on is because some people have found that box-sizing border-box

20080317
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
is more intuitive than the default content-box value as you know you will always have an element of the specified dimension width height for layout purposes no matter what padding or border sizes you have margin will still affect layout

since signed int can hold all the values that can be represented by an unsigned chars the value unsigned chars 10 is promoted to the signed int value 10

20080412
int	double
negating that gives you the signed int value -10 which is then converted to double

free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
as always you must call free precisely on a pointer obtained from malloc calloc realloc

pull	push
but if you want to be able to use both git pull and git push on your branch without specifying the remote be sure you have push.default set to current and add a push url to your origin remote

20080723
pull	push
now git pull should fetch and merge changes from v1_x on origin and git push should push changes to my_awesome_bug_fix on upstream

herein lay the problem you wont want both the height and the width of the image to be 90 as that would distort the image

20080825
width	height
all described before would need a bit of javascript again because there is no easy way to center something that is fixed without using negative margins of half its width height

20080827
width	height
create a nxn matrix such that n n is a power of 2 and n is larger than the width and height of the original image

20080828
integer	unsigned
the idea is that the normal class would probably be implemented for singed integer types and the variation for unsigned integer types

20080838
haskell	scheme
in my opinion easy solution - generate typescript interfaces from haskell data declarations or another api scheme descriptions and use typescript for front-end part

say you design for a normal screens 4 inch of hdpi density but then when you see it on a large screens 7 inch of hdpi density the icons are too small

20081015
getter	setter
the getter and setter of a dependency property are not guaranteed to be run and in particular the wpf binding engine xaml processor is documented to bypass these

20081015
getter	setter
have a look on msdn - the getter setter should just be a wrapper around getvalue setvalue on the dependencyproperty itself

20081019
sorting	filtering
i d like to use a request object because of sorting and filtering options

20081212
margin	height
i want the inner div to occupy the full vertical height of the page except for an 8px margin from top and bottom

20081212
width	margin
which is fine for forcing it to leave an 8px margin but centering it horizontally now becomes impossible without using a calc since its width is variable and there are no elements for it to be relative to

20081253
hex	binary
for binary files there are hex editors available but they require manual handling and can t be scripted

20081253
hex	binary
just convert the binary file to ascii hex with hexdump patch it with sed and the convert it back to binary with xxd

20081287
inherited	properties
they will inherited the background properties the way you want it to

20081295
width	height
compute the height and width of the bounding box of the segment the bounding box is a rectangle with sides parallel to the x y frame

20081295
width	height
for the time performance of the algorithm it seems to me the algorithm is o n for finding the width and height of the bounding box and then you have some floating point operations in order to compute the diagonal and the noise measure

20081316
hex	binary
i m trying to edit this binary file on my mac using a hex editor and all i do is change the path to the libraries it depends on to another path that also contains those libraries

20081410
folder	directory
how to remove all .git directory under a folder in linux

20081410
folder	directory
this find command will list all .git directory under the current folder

20081410
folder	directory
there should only be like 3 or 4 .git directory because git only has one .git folder for every project

20081462
portrait	landscape
this works fine in both landscape and portrait

20081503
width	height
it says the body to be 100 height and width and calculate the padding within it s width therefor the box-sizing property

20081503
width	margin
then you can specify the width on the div and center it by using margin 0 auto

20081513
super	implements
i have this map that implements super pin clustering

20081520
put	get	for-loop	arrays
obviously i can just use a for-loop and get 5 numbers and put them into the arrays

20081530
post	get
try sending a get request instead of a post

20081590
for-loop	arrays
i was wondering if i might be able to do this via methods of using an arrays and for-loop which creates this function for every menu

20081606
for-loop	arrays
assuming you won t have a sorted arrays you can simply use a for-loop to check each value of the arrays and compare with the entered value to search

20081606
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop or whatever construct you want to populate the arrays then use another to loops through the arrays and for each value do a compare and determine if the user entered a number that s in the arrays

20081657
subtract	add
i may also use an add and subtract function which i wrote myself and have tested extensively

20081679
stdout	stderr
every process initially has three file descriptors - 0 for stdin 1 for stdout and 2 for stderr

20081729
google-chrome	safari
note if you are using google-chrome or safari the page is not going to display anything

20081749
inherited	subclassing
your mydate subclassing doesn t override the subtraction function __sub__ so inherited the function from the base class which returns an instance of the base class

20081754
width	height
when using layout_weight you should zero out the corresponding width height

20081757
int	chars

now about your problem error message says invalid conversion from const chars to int

20081876
pop-up	dialog
i know that there is a way of doing it with dialog and others my main concern however is to discover why the pop-up frame doesn t load the components and freezes up before the wait condition

20081881
disk	ram
you have the possibility now to choose your ipc mechanism file or named pipe on ram or disk

20081890
width	height
you re fighting issues with borders margins padding modifying the height width

20081890
width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
try border-box on everything then readjust your height width values

20081909

in this second approach i tried to get the assets folder with the first loop and i got it and the report folder with the second loop that i m not able to get it because the directory named reports does not exists

20081949
hide	show
but this code also didn t executed on show or hide keyboard

20081997
intersect	contains
you can call methods such as contains and intersect which are part of the rectangle api to achieve what you want

20082015
int	boolean
i ve noticed the speediness of using boolean and can reasonably assume small int can be queried on more quickly than strings based off this

20082020
stdout	stderr
i would like expect to ignore those lines when performing matching but still output them on either stdout or stderr

20082020
stdout	stderr
apperently there is so way to treat stderr and stdout independently

20082026
joptionpane	jdialog
you want instead to use a modal dialog such as a joptionpane which can hold complex gui s or a modal jdialog which also can hold a complex gui

20082049
ubuntu	linux
solutions using basic linux command line functions available to ubuntu would be preferable or perl python script

20082057
put	get
i know my object list will get pretty huge and i rather not put 5 million includes at the top of every class script

20082099
google-chrome	firefox
now the question is that in firefox google-chrome etc the website works like i want it given that in case you zoom in the middle sections moves - this needs to be fixed

20082105
gcj	javac
there is no java without javac unless you use some kind of special compiler like gcj which i suspect is not what your teacher wants

20082114
post	get
and also take a look around the web for instructions on how to get ie to accept your local scripts like this post here

20082131
min	max
your technique for finding the greatest common divisor with ggt max and min seems to be broken

20082147
folder	directory
i had to explicitly add a virtual directory configuration for the parent folder that had the allowsubdirconfig attribute set to true

20082154
screens	tablet
use the smallest width availabe bucket layout-swxdp where x is the number of dp you like and create unique layouts when the screens has enough space inside and your tablet users will love you

20082169
hide	show
that being said i have a site that show hide divs using a button that triggers several toggle instances as follows

20082169
hide	show
when i try this in ie8 clicking button #1 hide the .body and .legend but .sidebar div is not toggled to show

20082171
children	parent
nested classes can access non-public members of their parent but parent cannot access children s non-public members

20082176
width	height
finally draw in the 10px gap at right with new graphics you would probably want to cache the width and height but frankly in the modern javascript engines this does not matter so much anymore as it did in the past

20082182
post	put
or to put it conversely post that have any tags from the list are not selected

20082203
kerberos	ldap
mongodb 2.4 supports external authentication mechanisms such as kerberos and ldap authentication if that is something you are looking for

post	get
i am studying the whole post get process in fiddler and as far as i can see the headers in the get call for the paginated page are correct

20082455
int	chars
these int are equivalent to a chars in ascii table

20082518
opera	firefox
it is important to note that firefox firefox â 35 and above supports unprefix css filters ie and opera has no support for css3 filters so there is no need to use -moz- -ms- or -o- prefixes

20082566
matlab	freemat
use verstring in the context of a try catch the output in matlab will be an error while in freemat it ll be something like freemat 4.0 for example

20082613
put	get
i ve put that in the datepicker but users can still manually type in say 2013-11-20 and get away with it until they are caught by php in the next page of course.

20082709
for-loop	arrays
your second for-loop should be so that you do not print out which is actually the garbage value at the end of your arrays

20082718
jtable	jdatechooser
in my java panel i have a jtable in which two of the columns use the jdatechooser object from the package com.toedter.calendar via a custom cell editor

post	put
actually i have implemented a rest solution to post put and delete data from the navgrid on jqgrid

20082871
width	height
you might ask so what if i gave them a height and width that were equal

20082882
pull	push
i don t think it is a good idea to automate this explicitly push pull only what is required on both sides no more no less

20082883
width	height
width and height is always automatic for inline tags

20082887
google-chrome	firefox
this issue is not present in firefox or ie just google-chrome and not before today

20083000
.htaccess	httpd.conf
use either a section in your httpd.conf file or a .htaccess and override directoryindex for that location

20083011
width	margin
it is important for me that no dimensions are defined explicitly except for parent width which would be 100 and any padding margin on the elements

20083056
installation	upgrade
when i tried to upgrade python the nltk installation disappeared

20083065
hide	show
you may also obfuscation to the key hide it into a large block of random data for instance so it does not show up easily but be aware that this only adds very limited protection

20083067
post	get
so well i started my mysql server via xampp control panel then connected my smartphone to adt and launched my app in this post the code for mainactivity is missing but that shouldnâ t be necessary but then i get the following error in logcat

20083071
post	get
i would also prefer to use the post as opposed to the get so the user can not alter the url and yes the user actually stays on the same page and the remainder of data for that page will be filled in when the page refreshes

20083080
folder	directory
but you want to recurse into the directory tree and only inspect the docname folder

pandas	pytables
with large numbers of medium-sized trace event datasets pandas + pytables the hdf5 interface does a tremendous job of allowing me to process heterogenous data using all the python tools i know and love

20083098
pandas	pytables
the initial conversion of my binary trace file into the pandas pytables format takes a decent chunk of time but largely because the binary format is deliberately out-of-order in order to reduce the performance impact of the trace generator itself

20083098
pandas	pytables
my tests were initially run with pandas 0.12 numpy 1.7.1 pytables 2.4.0 and numexpr 0.20.1

20083098
pandas	pytables
i begin to suspect that some known ext3 limitations may interact badly with either pandas or pytables

20083098
pandas	pytables
so it would seem that either this process continues to be cpu-bound my system has relatively old amd opteron istanbul cpus running 2.8ghz though it does also have 8 sockets with 6 core cpus in each all but one of which of course sit idle during the write or that there is some conflict between the way pytables or pandas attempts to manipulate read analyze the file when already partially or fully on the filesystem that causes pathologically bad i o behavior when the indexing is occurring

20083098
versioning	upgrade
at this point with upgrade versioning of the relevant python modules the performance for my original dataset is down to the following figures

20083127
for-loop	loops
however i haven t seen any that are able to do this with a foreach loops only a for-loop with an index

20083161
udp	tcp
on some platforms there are things like raw sockets and pcap libraries that allow applications to gain low-level access to tcp udp headers

20083166
post	get
i ll post my full code below but i can t seem to get the textbox to show any results at all

20083236
int	double
in your case we have int division and the compiler will treat this as int as it fast and simple operation while simple precision or double precision operation are double float decimal in .net quite complex and cpu ant time consuming as stated in wikipedia take a look here to understand more what means

20083281
width	height
for example i would remember initial frame and touch in uipangesturerecognizer handler attached to this resizable view on statebegan and on statechanged i would calculate the touch point x y difference from initial touch and add those values to initial frame width and height

20083294

phonebookentry.java 1 error phonebookentry is not abstract and does not override abstract method comparator object in comparable

20083382
put	get
i can get it to work if i put a lowercase character inside the input but it won t enter if i put a uppercase character since your for-loop is comparing it to lowercase characters only

20083405
comparator	comparable
you are implementing the raw version of comparable whose comparator method takes an object

20083421
ftp	smb
i can think of a few ways to do this ftp smb but i have no idea which method would be the best

20083439
comparator	comparable

decimal	ieee
databases especially are prone to having both base-10 fixed-precision decimal as well as ieee floating point which are completely different systems neither of which can accurately represent a mathematical quantity as simple to humans as one third

20083476
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome this can be inspected using the developer console in firefox it s firebug

20083478
spaces	delimiter
otherwise they are delimiter by spaces

20083536
getter	setter
you would likely have a string variable called name and a getter and setter under agent like so

20083542
width	height
what i want to do is set the height and width of safedisplayarea to be the same as other elements in the page

20083555
subtraction	multiplication
so just to give another example will effectively mean once you ve done the subtraction and multiplication and assuming ncol is 2 which is perfectly normal c

20083560
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
in the case of addition subtraction and or multiplication this is a fairly straightforward modification of the result s precision and scale

20083635
for-loop	arrays
if you re simply searching whether a single item is in your arrays i d probably use list utils or list moreutils or use a for-loop to search each value of my arrays

20083646
put	get
the other problem is that i put a system.out.print into the setvalueat and when i called it from inside the model called get valueat from outside and that called setvalueat it worked perfectly it set the value it even fired when i call the method from outside though it doesn t work

20083651

the get responses work just fine but when i try a post this strange error is seen from jetty

20083669
integer	unsigned
size unsigned 64-bit integer

20083688
width	height
basically what this means is even if you use repaint or repaint x y width height the background is begin completely updated

20083688
width	height
when calling repaint the clip will be the size of the component when using repaint x y width height the clip shape will be the same as those values you passed it

20083688
awt	swing
you may want to take a look at painting in awt and swing for more details

20083712
google-chrome	firefox
it s pretty basic and works fine in ie11 and in google-chrome but firefox quietly throws away my float settings

20083746
min	max
to be precise let ends_with_zeroes i j min max be a procedure that returns the number of zeroes that the block from i-j+1

20083746
min	max
j ends with with a shortcut to return max if the result will be more than max and min if the result will be less than min

20083746
min	max
similarly for starts_with_zeroes i j min max

20083784
spaces	delimiter
there is the general assumption that white spaces only serves as a token delimiter and need not be preserved

20083817
put	get
now when i put it remotely i get logged out as soon as i change page aka i am being redirected to my login view no matter what link i press

put	get
you can use get to get the file from host1 and then put to push it to host2

20083948
libstdc++	libc++
it seems libstdc++ isn t updated to accept a std string as argument libc++ is updated

20083953
profiling	debugging
i suggest you use an ide and you can just write you program and click run debugging profiling reformat and many other more productive things

20083985
screens	tablet
i think the problem is the html for your login link when screens is small enough to trigger the responsive phone tablet mode

20083990
scheme	racket
from speaking with a few of them i get the impression that even people who are expert at scheme and racket macros work things out step by step

20083994

when a user selects a sorting or filtering action i have scripting that currently replaces the text in the appropriate span with the name of the action and adds an appropriate class to the span to designate selection so that if you selected filteraction in the category1 menu the span would look like this

20110759
sorting	filtering
there can only be one sorting action at any one time but there is no limit to the number of filtering at a time

20110771

width	height
you need to set the actual pixel resolution of your canvas that is set the number of rows and columns of pixels by using the width and height attributes on the canvas tag

20111100
width	height
otherwise you re just going to get a canvas with its default resolution scaled by the width and height as determined by your css

20111100
width	height
when you place a canvas in the dom you are essentially declaring something like a manipulate-able image with a specific width and height in pixels

20111100
width	height
so if you want the width and height of a pixel on the canvas to represent the with of a pixel as rendered on the screen you want to set the width and height to the actual number of pixels involved instead of using css

20126894
qstring	qbytearray
for example if you wanted to encode the string using utf8 encoding which i would recommend you d use qstring s toutf8 method to get the qbytearray representing the utf8 encoding and the receiver would use qstring s fromutf8 method to turn the received bytes back into a qstring

free	malloc
think of the simplest implementation of new delete and using c s malloc free for the backend and direct calls to the constructors destructors

20127203
width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
this resets the box model so that the width and height determine the border-box of the element padding and border included in the width height values

20127203
width	height
any padding or border specified on the element is laid out and drawn inside this specified width and height

20127203
width	height
the content width and height are calculated by subtracting the border and padding widths of the respective sides from the specified width and height properties

20127212
width	height
the way to get it to render at 200 is to subtract the border and the padding from the width or height

20127212
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
setting box-sizing border-box takes any padding and border off of the set width of the element instead of adding to it

20127212
box-sizing	border-box
if you want to know more i would suggest you check out chris coyier s take on this subject or just do a general search on box-sizing border-box and you will find your answers

20127221
box-sizing	border-box
this bit of code sets box-sizing border-box for all elements and as you ve discovered it is pretty important for bootstrap s grid system

20127221
width	border-box
setting border-box tells the browser that the element s width setting should include the border

20127221
width	border-box
this means that if you have for example two elements each being set to width 50 and with a 1px border with border-box in use they would indeed take up a total of 100 of the width

20127221
width	border-box
however without border-box they take up 100 width plus 4px 1px for each of the 4 left right borders between the two elements and thus breaks out of the layout

when linking it there was a mismatch between wchar_t and unsigned short

20128122

the right side ofter the is an int expression which gets converted to double only after it s calculated

20131022
int	double
so it calculates 10 4 as an int 2 and then converts that number to double

20131022
int	double
only numbers that cannot be read as int will be treated as double

20131034
typedef	struct
typedef struct dispatch_queue_s dispatch_queue_t

20131038
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up when i click a textview runs

we know the total width is 6 we know the width of each block is 3 and the height of each block is 2

20131056
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this issue is only with firefox it does not happen in ie safari or google-chrome

20131064
subtract	add
instead you could simply add or subtract the amount from polyrot and allow the api to deal with it surprisingly it s capable for dealing with angles 0 and 359 for example.

20131087
width	height
you are not handling the case where you image equal in width and height and you are not handling cases where the images are less than 500 pixels not sure if this is intentional but could lead to problems with html layout if you specify specific height widths for your img elements

20131087
width	height	portrait	landscape
i am assuming you want to always scale your image to be either 500px in height if image is portrait or 500px in width if image is landscape

20131135
width	height
but i want them centered in their positions regardless the width and height of the shapes

20131157
jcarousel	flexslider
the home page uses nice menus flexslider and jcarousel v.0.2.8

free	malloc
also i strongly recommend you to allocate the host memory using cudamallochost instead of malloc and free them at the end of the program by cudafreehost

20131314
textview	imageview
the layout needs to contain an image on the far right textview in the middle and an imageview on the far left

20131337
stdout	stderr
because output only returns data from the stdout while the psql error is printing that data on the stderr stream

20131388
postgresql	mysql
i m open to using mysql or postgresql

20131447
width	height
giving the #container-inner a 100 width and height could do the trick

roboguice	robolectric
here is how you setup roboguice with robolectric and force injection on test class members

20131473
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari this animation will start having a jittering effect left and right on odd zoom levels zoom in out using ctrl+ - or cmd+ - on mac

20131482
next	except
if not the next test makes sure that no more input except backspaces will be accepted if the number is already at the maximum number of digits

20131487
hide	show
running test.php in a browser exposes queries which i don t want and loading the index that is including test.php hide queries but show options which i prefer not to have

20131488
width	height
i recalculate the width and height of the image everytime i zoom so it stays perfectly on the map

20131489
hide	show
on the element that is changing or it will just show hide

20131495
affinity	processors
if you want to abuse your processors - spawn several threads set processors affinity for each of them let them do their work in parallel

20131518
memcpy	malloc
i know my code isn t effective - i can do the same with with a single malloc + 1 memcpy

20131523
hash	md5
that ll spit out all the md5 hash that have duplicates

i write a c++ application on linux opensuse

20131613
many-to-many	one-to-many
ive read about and watch some videos about database relationships and to be they seem easy but when drawing this database model im getting confused since i suddently end up with a many-to-many and a one-to-many relationship in one table which seems weird

20131625
post	get
and as peter-alfvin noted it s a get not a post

20131655
int	chars
any value other than 0 would equate to true and the chars y when treated as an int is equal to it s corresponding ascii code 121 in this case

20131676
hide	show
now you can show hide these columns according to the width of your browser

20131703
google-chrome	firefox
i am not 100 sure i got your question but i tried your fiddle in firefox and google-chrome to see the difference

20131703
google-chrome	firefox
i see the image is not aligned the same way in firefox as it is in google-chrome

20131719
keydown	keyup
however one problem i ran into is that unlike mouseover events i could not tie keydown and keyup events to an individual div or svg

20131768
median	percentile
estimating the precision of sample statistics median variances percentile by using subsets of available data jackknifing or drawing randomly with replacement from a set of data points bootstrapping

20131785
hide	show
previous answers covering this topic didn t do the trick for me because i needed to allow an indefinite number of togglers within the same page and an indefinite number of open close text variations show hide open close view dismiss icons or text etc based on context

20131819
google-chrome	firefox
only tested on google-chrome 31 and firefox 25 on a windows 8 64 bit machine

20131819
client-side	server-side
as i said before we need to check for an adblock client-side not server-side

20131819
put	get
everything put together we get this in a nice document ready function

20131859
min	max
i m assuming here that the relations are inclusive in the sense that they continue to the end of the line - a 0 max a 1 a 2 ... and a 1 min a 2 a 3 .. and so on

20131915
maven	pom.xml
i have configured gradle to publish project artifact using new maven publisher plugin unfortunately this plugin has problem with dependency in generated pom.xml - dependencies has scope runtime instead of compile

for example the navigation bar is 44 points in portrait and 32 points in landscape

20131923
expression-blend	silverlight
i ran into this error because i had downloaded the expression-blend sdk for silverlight instead of what i should have downloaded expression-blend software development kit sdk for .net 4

20131923
expression-blend	silverlight
as soon as i downloaded the expression-blend sdk for .net removed all of the blend sdk for silverlight references and added those same references as blend for .net i was up and running

20131953
free	malloc
you can get much of the benefit of an object manager by simply calling malloc and free a lot

20131953
free	malloc
so your program will likely be more robust if you use malloc and free as long as each function only writes into data it allocated for itself

20131953
free	malloc
but malloc and free can introduce bugs of their own memory leaks double-free errors continuing to use a pointer after the data to which it points has been freed.

20131953
free	malloc
if you use malloc and free be sure to use a tool such as valgrind to check your code.

20132004
rss	feed
however when i follow this the rss feed does not load anymore in the tableview so there are no results

20132004
rss	feed
also the only way to see rss in the tableview is to search for any generic string but once you press cancel in the search bar the rss feed disappears and shows an empty tableview

20132028

rule-of-three	noncopyable
usually in the destructor of your class which i don t see but then take care of rule-of-three or make the class noncopyable or use a smart pointer which will take care of deletion for you

20132310
int	chars
remember that an int is made of multiple chars

20132337

width	height
as a follow-up on adding a background image to a levelplot i m exporting the levelplot to a png file and i d like to know how i can access the width and height of that trellis object to pass it as parameters to png

20132376
width	height
for the resulting png file the width and height are 480px since this is the default

20132386
ubuntu	debian
update 2 the patch to fix this in debian has been merged but since they went the route of a separate git-subtree package i don t think this will make it to ubuntu 12.04

20132407
width	height
so it seems that the li considers the original size but doesn t allow for the increase in width when the logo is zoomed to adapt for the height 100

20132416
for-loop	arrays
write another for-loop that calls the function convertweight to convert each weight in pounds given in the arrays pounds to the equivalent weight in kilograms and grams

it even converts wav to flac and sends it to the google speech api just delete the stt_google_wav function if you dont need it

20132465
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
i m puzzled by finding out that newer version of google-chrome opera and safari don t allow control characters in text inside input elements

20132465
google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
the code above only outputs 5 characters on google-chrome opera and safari

20132489
integer	unsigned
confident doing n n-1 2 compares would be needed if a wider integer width is not available for subtracting n unsigned

20132503
put	get
put another way there s multiple ways to get yourself registered with visual studio but not all of them actually puts an entry into the extension manager

20132525
aggregate-functions	sum
you are missing nothing when you are using an aggregate-functions in this case sum you have to group by every other non-aggregate column

20132550
super	self	super	implements
since i assume none of your objects implements -performselector withobject that call reaches all the way down to the nsobject implementation which is the same as if you did on super or self

20132562
rss	feed
i created a listfragment to show the elements of the rss feed that uses an async task to get the content

20132639
folder	directory
what i want to do there is a directory on our server which has about 15 folder

20132662
folder	directory
some minor changes in line like adding in searchoption like the native .net one has and error trapping on initial directory get in case the root folder is access denied

20132664
min	max
for numeric columns that repeat min max or avg would be appropriate

20132664
min	max
for string columns min or max would work

20132665
ssms	sqlcmd
you can use sqlcmd you should have it if you have ssms on your machine

20132691
min	max
i had the same problem and could not bind correctly the window dimensions min max normal to my viewmodel through xaml

20132699
width	height
the issue may be with your image width height having exact dimensions

20132726
for-loop	arrays
values in any sized arrays using a for-loop instead of the sum function

20132751

folder	directory
your toplevelfolder is the directory which contains the 15 folder you want to crawl

20132860
folder	directory	gruntjs	browserify
the directory which i am running gruntjs on has node_module folder which contains all the modules including bootstrap browserify and others

20132860
bower	npm
it stops at bower and says cannot find module bootstrap before this scenario it said there wasn t jquery which i installed with npm install jquery after restarting gruntjs a few other missing modules were also reported subsequently which i installed.however with bootstrap even after installing and making sure it exist in node_modules directory i still have this error

20132865
children	parent
i have a parent class that has few children

20132879
onclick	onchange
you can do it the same way but instead of the onclick event you utilize the onchange event

20132911
width	height
fyi grabbing height width isn t the only thing i intend to do

20132911
width	height
so getting height width was just an example code

20132912
google-chrome	firefox
renders like this in google-chrome and firefox

20132938
jhat	jvisualvm
they should be viewable with the newer jvisualvm tool but for some reason that tool seems to fail when loading these files. this tool is not as old as jmap jhat started shipping with jdk s around version 1.6 but since we now have a heap file rather than a raw core dump we can use the jhat that is distributed with a newer jdk

20132946
popover	tooltip
here s a hybrid popover tooltip that could give you the functionality that you are looking for both options toggles on click and hover

i am sure that u cannot achieve this performance on any disk-based storage like hbase cassandra or hypertable and add any rdbmss like mysql postgresql and.

20133015
switching	screens
but this has the problem that it closes when you switching to another app or lock the screens so i wanted to create a page in the app to play the video instead so i can keep the state

20133018
folder	directory
out of necessity i rsync d the src folder in my svn working directory at home with the one at work

20133018
folder	directory
now when i edit files in the working directory svn status doesn t think anything has been modified -- but only when i run it in the root folder

20133024
inherited	properties
i am working on a library that provides class like code capabilities to javascript currently it supports constructors inherited methods overload by number of params and by types of params mixins statics properties and singleton

20133074
inherited	subclassing
it prevents a subclassing from using inherited and polymorphism to mutate change the data in your class

20133090
floating-point	fractions
floating-point may seem convenient for things like fractions division but correct code will have to deal with the effects of rounding things to whole numbers no matter what it does

20133113
google-chrome	firefox	box-sizing	border-box
when you declare google-chrome and firefox will change input from box-sizing border-box to box-sizing content-box

20133133
put	get
i just wanted to put this here in case anyone else comes across this as i tried every single hack under the sun i could figure out and it wasn t until i just started tinkering with the position attributes that i was able to get it to work

20133174
public	protected
the pcl class has a protected constructor so i override it in the library class to make it public

20133177
int	chars
everything is an int except found_status which is a chars

20133205
submit	submission
but in the end i found a better solution to my whole issue after some research into the submission process of a form and found that instead of using the on click event of a submit input

20133266
subtraction	multiplication
they ll undergo some processing subtraction of certain columns multiplication of some values etc and the end result per file is one column

20133334
accessor	properties
in the first case properties the compiler will synthesize accessor method implementations for you

20133334
accessor	properties
using properties is essentially just a convenient less verbose way to declare accessor methods for a properties and to tell the compiler that you want them implemented for you

20133334
accessor	properties
these days there s almost never a reason to declare accessor methods manually instead of using a declared properties

20133334
accessor	properties
properties can be made private by putting them in the implementation but it s still possible to call the accessor methods at runtime if one is determined to do so

20133334
accessor	ivar
that said in my opinion it s usually better to use accessor methods instead of ever doing direct ivar access

20133351
put	get
you put the eggs on to boil and set an alarm for when they re cooked to get them out peel them cut them up and add them to your sandwich

20133363
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
if you instead want to jump around while reading i would suggest using a bufferedreader instead of a scanner and use a fileinputstream

20133384
subtract	add
operations like clone add subtract split diff combine etc

20133385
content-disposition	content-type
i m reqesting a image from yahoo and it isn t using the content-disposition header but i am extracting the date and content-type headers to construct a filename

20133414
junit	mockito
intellij doesn t resolve any classes that i added as dependencies in gradle androidsdk junit mockito those from the core project

20133454
folder	directory
open a terminal and change directory to the folder with your dump and .exe file if folder is c users yourname dumpfolder then type cd c users yourname dumpfolder

20133462
put	get
i did put everything in same folder so i don t get it why it fails.

20133495
public	protected
make the internal methods public or protected internal instead obviously less than ideal

20133530
folder	directory
to get the current directory of the file which is just crowd in your www.example.php folder crowd example use

20133557
post	get
check out method 2 in joe miller s blog post that should help get you started

20133563
post	get
the trick is that you need to wrap your post test inside a get and parse the necessary csrf token from the cookie

20133602
hex	binary
i d like an after insert trigger to convert a hex text string into its binary blob equivalent

20133611
width	height
to get constant results of width and height properties between platforms you have to add

20133738
folder	directory
the directory do exist in the k file_sync_diff folder

20133739
tunnel	vpn
i have a cron job to do a ping every couple minutes to keep a vpn tunnel up but it shouldn t be doing this

20133778
markermanager	markerclusterer
markerclusterer or markermanager instead of trying to reinvent the wheel

20133785
client-side	server-side
as john h pointed out in the question comments client-side validation is no substitute for server-side validation

20133806
division	logarithm
if you have different types of questions say division exponentials logarithm etc. you should write classes for those

20133857
integer	fractions
the integer part represents the date and the fractions represents the time

20133861
folder	directory
i suggest exporting them all individually to pdf into a temp directory stitching them together using adobe s com automation library assuming you have pro then deleting the temp folder

20133863
post	get
if you post some example code i d be able to help a lot more - it really depends on what kind of access you have to the data before you get to the loop

20133877
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop will help you get through all the objects in your arrays

20133898
width	height
targetcontroller.view.superview.frame cgrectmake 0 44 navigation bar s height height width

20133898
width	height
use full screen height and width here

20133976
folder	directory
i have done tried this both within the root and inside a virtual directory pointing to the views folder

20133999
versioning	upgrade
after i upgrade my versioning from 4.4 to 4.9 i found that ormlite has deprecate some of the method on

20134015
gruntjs	yeoman
bower and gruntjs were configured using yeoman and the generator-webapp after which i included bootstrap3 and updated jquery and modernizr

20134053
pci	iommu
this is not good for 3rd party pci pci-express cards or remote machines attempting to access the raw physical offset of an nvidia gpu as this may result in not actually accessing the intended regions of memory or inhibiting restricting such accesses on a per-card basis by the iommu unit

20134063
folder	directory
so i have a directory of files where two of the files are immediately inside the folder

20134095
stdout	stderr
i use ioutil.readall to read the data from stderr and stdout

20134118
for-loop	loops
this would again go through the for-loop and call shapes n-i or shapes n in an infinite loops

20134129
getter	setter
you don t want to get part of an object but rather get the object itself and query it for its state via getter methods as well as set its state via setter methods

20134168
subtract	add
now i m having this all happen in each operation button s code subtract add etc and want it to happen in the equals button s code

20134207
width	height
i think the following should work to give you the real height and width whether or not aero is enabled

20134214
int	chars
adding these together doesn t give you the concatenation of the two chars it gives you the addition of the int code of the chars so 35 for # and the ascii code for whatever happens to be

20134235
rpm	yum
finally using rpm instead of yum i installed the zend-server and mod-php packages directly using the --replacefiles option as follows

20134276
google-chrome	safari
if you open this link on google-chrome and safari

20134276
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is the correct view but on safari it is not showing correctly

20134276
google-chrome	firefox
ie google-chrome and firefox are perfectly ok

20134281
width	height
i think the following code in a form will give the correct height and width of such a window

20134312
post	put
if someone could post a simple example i should be able to figure it out and put it in my game

20134318
children	parent
since the whitespace is determined by the font s size you can set the parent s font-size to 0 and then set the children s font-size accordingly

20134328
uiview	subviews
situation a uibutton in as a subviews of another uiview

20134336
prng	random
you have walked in the trap set up by some person that thought a pseudo random number generator prng is the same thing as a key derivation function kdf

20134336
pbkdf2	salt
the solution use a true random aes key or use the build-in pbkdf2 functionality to derive a key from a password and salt

20134349
put	get
i tried the following query but i don t seem to get the out put as expected

20134363
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is that firefox and google-chrome both pick up the .gt-ie9 class

20134369
put	get	post	get	post	put
i am not sure how to set this url on my own for either local storage or database storage i obviously need to set it to where i can get the data or put post delete data

20134403
put	get
my original iam policy was quite conservative and only included get put and delete for objects

20134456
post	get
this post shows what you need to download install to get things working on your system but i m sure you can find more updated post around the web

20134476
width	height
i need both images to scale correctly on width and height change

20134476
width	height
the gradient img height is 96px and width 1 px

20134609
int	chars
basically there is a version of overloaded for most of the basic types int string chars and so on

20134612
versioning	upgrade
i enabled the logs but unfortunately i upgrade to the newest versioning of woocommerce available since today and it erased my log file

20134616
put	get
i exchanged implementations with my own and put a breakpoint in each but they never get called

20134650
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
so just as an example does not always achieve exactly the same performance as a similar resizable array written using malloc and free because that code could and naturally would use realloc to resize the storage when necessary

20134667
for-loop	loops
for example a hand-crafted for-loop would be n copies of loops body

20134691
uiview	subviews
basically each uiview has an array of subviews and each subviews references its parent view superview

20134762
post	get
i have a file called functions.php in my google app engine root folder i use jquery to post values to this file but i get a 500 code error

20134765

20146932
subscript	superscript
also i ll need to make that text subscript superscript and etc

20146932

min	max
if the min max dates are close together then this will not be as effective

20146989
matplotlib	colormap
the reason to use the second or third options is that they will work for any type of matplotlib plot that uses a colormap imshow scatter etc

20146989
contourf	imshow
as an example of the second option i ll use imshow here because it makes more sense than contourf for random data but contourf would have identical usage other than the interpolation option.

20146990

20147063
prepare	execute
-the resulting string will be valid sql and you will be able to execute that via prepare statements

20147083
getter	setter
accessing _myinstancevariable directly means that you will bypass any setter getter which is sometimes desired internally in classes especially when the getter creates an object

20147083
getter	setter
however often when i have internal simple ivars which don t require any setter getter i use the ivars directly in the class extension

20147083
getter	setter
except that you are sure that no setter getter is automatically created by the compiler

20147113
range	minimum
here is an index structure that can efficiently find the minimum character in a given index range from a fixed string

20147113
range	minimum
you should note it relies on number of allowed letters to be fixed and would not work as an answer to finding a minimum value in a range of where the individual entries were integers or floats

20147143
x86	64bit
according to documentation the 64bit extensions to the x86 architecture were invented and first implemented by amd

20147143
x86	64bit
intel laggards to the 64bit architecture because they were hoping to transition away from x86 architecture and move towards ia64

20147143
x86	64bit
amd on other hand effectively forced intel s by introducing the sledgehammer which was effectively a 64bit chip based on the x86 architecture

ciimage	uiimage
just convert cmsamplebuffer to ciimage or uiimage

20147462
nav	affix
both use the affix plugin to attach the nav after scroll

20147480

bellman-ford	dijkstra
well both bellman-ford and dijkstra algorithm are overkill in here since the edges all have a weight of 1

20147601
ember.js	javascriptmvc
think for example about a javascriptmvc framework like ember.js or angular.js

20147640
google-chrome	firefox
maybe google-chrome and firefox presume by default

20147655
width	height
setting the stackpanel width and height to auto will just size it to its contents

20147984
ada	pascal
language ada or pascal support range syntax

20148030
integer	fractions
however any error in the conversion from integer to float would not mean that you get a fractions part where there was none but that you get the wrong integer altogether

20148030
int	double
for instance the int 2 53 +1 is converted to the double that represents 2 53

20148030
int	double
the rounding error in the conversion from int to float can be larger than one the int 5555555555555555555 when converted to double is rounded to 5555555555555555328 which happens to be have a simpler representation in binary than the former

20148034
int	double
any int up to 2 53 has an exact representation as a double-precision floating-point number if double follows ieee-754 as your tag suggests

20148034
int	double
so assuming int is 32-bit yes you can convert an unsigned to double without loss of precision

20148043
post	get
if it is perform a get or post you do have this option in mechanize and could simulate the click that way

20148048

20148296
devise	cancan
i had the same issue with devise cancan

20148371
dictionary	map

20148950
min	max
it will always be 66 of its parent element--unless you have min max defined

20148951
post	get
you can get post from a facebook page via facebook#getfeed page_id

20148981

20149003
portrait	landscape
as for your specific question on more agnostic as to what version of landscape vs portrait uikit s function reference contains a number of pertinent macros specifically uiinterfaceorientationisportrait and uiinterfaceorientationislandscape

20149051
pop-up	dialog
you need to delay opening dialog pop-up once any page event occur to make sure that the page is fully loaded

20149064
width	height

mouseup	mousedown
instead to distinguish between the mouse buttons we have to use the mousedown and mouseup events as most browsers do fire mousedown and mouseup events for any mouse button

20155501
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome event.which should contain a number indicating what mouse button was pressed 1 is left 2 is middle 3 is right

20155501
mouseup	mousedown
in other words you can t use the onclick event so to simulate it you can use both mousedown and mouseup

20155501
mouseup	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown
you can add a timer to limit the time allowed between the mousedown and mouseup event or even throw in a mousemove handler to limit the movement between a mousedown and mouseup event and make the event handler not fire if the mouse pointer moved more than ten pixels etc

when you invoke subprocess.popen you can tell it to redirect stdout and or stderr

20156266
stdout	stderr
quick side-note edit if you want to discard all output from the child and its grandchildren open os.devnull either as you did or with os.open to get a raw integer file descriptor and connect stdout and stderr to the underlying file descriptor

20156266
daemons	systemd
alternatively some unix-like systemd allow you to pass file descriptors through af_unix sockets to otherwise-unrelated parent child-wise processes so you could have a daemons that does this reachable via an af_unix socket

20156266
stdout	stderr
if you wish the child process to send its stderr output to the same pipe so that you can read both its stdout and its stderr simply add to the popen call
