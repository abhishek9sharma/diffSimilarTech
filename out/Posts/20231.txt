i was also exploring the use of public boolean onpreparepanel int featureid view view menu menu which might not be the right thing to do but it happens that this function is not being triggered either

24964242
integer	unsigned
in java se 8 and later you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2 32-1

24964242
integer	unsigned
use the integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer

24964257
width	height
note that the + 8 is for vertical scrollbar width horizontal scrollbar height in google chrome

24964257
width	height
create a function that gets scrollbar height width values of iframe if possible i don t believe this is possible

24964292
maven	pom.xml
we just need to provide the dependency to pom.xml and maven does all the downloading stuff for us

24964292
maven	pom.xml
solution use profiles in pom.xml to enable maven to download the jars

24964331
min	max	range	min	range	max
so the real code is i first get the difference between the hours - the rownumber to group my records into contiguous range and then i get the min and max to get the beginning and end and then just diff the hours to get the longest range based on hours here is the output

24964333
gruntjs	package.json
in order to get gruntjs docular-server to work i had to go back to version 0.6.6 of docular in my package.json and run npm install

24964335
integer	unsigned
you can still perform unsigned arithmetic using the new methods of the integer class just don t use invalid literals

24964335
integer	unsigned
you can store the unsigned int using the primitive type int but using the value as an unsigned type requires you to use the utility methods of integer as can be seen above

24964350
integer	unsigned
the only thing that s changed is that the integer class now contains some methods that will treat a 32-bit integer s as an unsigned 32-bit integer

24964350
integer	unsigned
but basically if you store the bit pattern for example 10001000_11110000_10010110_11000010 in an int there s nothing in the int that says this is an unsigned integer or this is a signed integer

24964387
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
i have tried off hover and unbind mouseover mouseleave mouseenter mousein mouseout hover

24964397
stdout	stderr
my child processes were not redirecting stdout and stderr to dev null so therefore even though the parent process finished the fact that the child process still had active file descriptors was causing php-fpm to consider that connection in its pool as still active and therefore it would never be re-assigned to new connections on the basis that the child process would run continually

24964397
stdout	stderr
redirecting stderr and stdout to dev null caused php-fpm to correctly reassign connections while simultaneously allowing the child process the socket server to run forever

24964413
subtract	add
it now becomes easy to find the row on interest add or subtract as desired and write it out in the same format

24964439
post	get
there s also a blog post on how to get grafana and influxdb working together here s a link

24964461
jqxhr	deferred
or using the deferred api for the jqxhr object returned from fetch

24964470
background-position	background-size
the background-position coordinates and background-size are multiplied by 0.75 to create smaller icons 680px 0.75 510px

24964500
udp	tcp
specifically i have a windows server windows 7 but the netstat -an command only shows whether ports are tcp or udp

24964500
udp	tcp
i make requests to my information technology office about ports that i need on this server and they need to know whether these ports will be tcp udp etc

24964531
uiview	subviews
let s say i apply a cgaffinetransformmakescale 1 -1 to flip a uiview that is a subviews of some superview

24964533
post	get
i get no route matches post users 8 trips new

24964535
width	height
see sathran s answer here height equal to dynamic width css fluid layout

24964578
folder	directory
a caveat to the way i wrote the above is that the files poly.py and mult.py have to be in the same directory folder as the program importing them

24964590
width	height
what is going on when i use zoom-in table is growing right but only to 656px width then width is staying on 656px and height is still growing

24964606
post	get
here is the function that ajax is calling to get the previous post

24964638
integer	unsigned
you ve always been able to store unsigned integer literals by using hex

24964647
width	margin
it does this by calculating the width of the element then getting the width of the page and setting the left margin of the element to be the page width - the element width 2

24964668
gsap	greensock
yep i think you ll find that gsap greensock animation platform works much better

24964672
put	get
the nslog return the right id but the user don t get deleted if i put a ibaction with the same code it works

24964676
post	get
sorry for such a long post but hoping to get some guidance on how to get the expected data back as a return after posting to the web service

24964684
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and explorer but not in google-chrome

24964773
width	margin
specify the width for the parent div and child div then use margin property to make it align the child div in the center of the parent div

24964779
min	max
assuming the min values will always be in column 2 and the max values in columns 3 sort on column two and the min will be in the first row

24964791
integer	unsigned
the code above is treating each number as a little-endian unsigned 32-bit c integer which is a pretty common format to use for cramming numbers into binary data but certainly not the only one

24964791
hex	binary
if you want to write the literal values in hex base 16 or binary base 2 instead of decimal of course you can

24964832
x86	mips
it appears i need to build for x86 arm hard float arm soft float and mips devices

24964841
button	checkbox
i used jquery to build a component that disabled the submit button until the consent checkbox was checked

24964912
implements	extends
if the class you want to run from the jar extends implements something you know about in your code already you can use reflection to load the class but work with it as whatever it is you know it as ie javafx.stage.stage vs testjar

24964930
google-chrome	safari
tested on google-chrome and safari on a desktop

24964935
coalesce	isnull
if this is a problem for you be sure to use the coalesce or isnull functions to translate nulls to empty strings

24965023
portrait	landscape
youtubestandaloneplayer i want it to enter full screen and be able to change to both portrait and landscape mode as the orientation changes

24965066
for-loop	loops
edit i use for-loop to loops over the picture to find the pixel values

24965090
daemons	systemd
severe the web application myapplication appears to have started a thread named as400 read daemons systemd mysystem 093048 quser qzdasoinit but has failed to stop it

24965097
hide	show	fadein	hide
for the derived page at the time of the hide fadein call it will not have loaded jquery yet so the browser logs show a javascript error

24965111
jmeter	soapui
actually it is much better than soapui because with jmeter you can easily read the data from csv and parameterize it

24965157
hide	show
below it is achieved by using jquery to hide show the options that fit

24965207
subtract	add
since the step value is negative and you re iterating downwards you need to add it not subtract it

24965252
onresume	onpause
but when you put the phone to sleep and then wake up only onpause and onresume are called for the current activity

24965253
folder	directory
what solved it for me is putting the jquery.js file in the content folder with the rest of html pages and referencing it relative to root directory for both jsp and html pages

24965293
hide	show
i have simplified and probably made a typo or two below but i am trying to show and hide the visibility of pnl2 this code however doesn t work

24965300
operands	decrement
the value of the single operands is computed and the operands incremented or decrement

24965307
pull	push
after that i want to push pull to a given repo by using that token

24965350
stdout	stderr
programs which use stderr rather than stdout for their progress bars might be more resistant disabling the bar only when stderr is a non-tty display

24965406
folder	dir
i had trouble with the bat script in the sdk folder so i even tried reinstalling in the base dir with no spaces c libreoffice in windows

24965463
osx	yosemite
you won t be able to install xcode 5 on osx yosemite via the app store because the version of os x is too new

24965467
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i m currently working on an assignment where i have to add subtract and multiplying numbers up to 20 digits in length

24965491
folder	directory
the com.novus.salat package is linked from a source code folder path com novus salat outside of my eclipse project directory

24965561
post	put
to use simple upload make a post or put request to the method s upload uri and add the query parameter uploadtype media

24965578
std	ostream
because std ofstream inherits from std ostream you can pass the file stream to either method

24965596
put	get
rest put your entire structure of table to get more help because these query are on assumptions

24965631
decoder	encoder
1 the encoder decoder are created without error

24965645
awt	swing
awt is 15+ years out of date and was replaced with swing

24965651
equals	compareto
i would suggest that it is more important to have equals indicate semantic equivalence than to have it be consistent with compareto

24965809
swift	objective-c
try the same thing in an array in an isolated class private no inheritance from nsobject or exposure to objective-c and use an unbridgeable element type a struct you define in swift

24965834
filtering	grouping
in the jsfiddle example you can see that there are 5 filtering grouping with checkboxes

24965834
filtering	grouping
the goal is when somebody ticks multiple checkboxes it should narrow the results list down no matter if the checked checkboxes are in one filtering grouping or in different grouping

24965834
filtering	grouping
for example if you check two boxes in the filtering 1 grouping check1 and check2 it should only display those results which are in check1 and check2 which in this case is result1 only

24965834
filtering	grouping
the narrowing works if you check checkboxes in different filtering grouping and it should remain this way.

24965834
filtering	grouping
another goal is that there are 5 filtering grouping but only the first 3 grouping are coded in yet

24965857
put	get
if i now put for example the graphics object under the input object i will get a access violation

24965879
pop-up	dialog
if you run this using wx you get the pop-up file already exists... dialog with ok cancel buttons...running using qt on the backend produces no pop-up and notimplemented errors in the ipython window if i type in a new non-existing filename the save_file works correctly

24965892
post	get
i m not sure how to get a fully formed http request out in order to post it here

24965913
nsentitydescription	nsmanagedobjectid
nsmanagedobjectid s whose persistent store coordinator is no longer in memory lose their nsentitydescription entity and do not equate isequal returns no to nsmanagedobjectid s from a different persistent store coordinator even though their urirepresentation is the same

24965913
nsentitydescription	nsmanagedobjectid
this seems to be happening educated guess here... because the psc from which these objectids came from is now no longer in memory and the nsmanagedobjectid must keep a week reference to the nsentitydescription entity which must be held by the psc

24965918
hide	show
you have not actually used the class commonattribute on the items you want to show hide

24965965
hive	oozie
i also see this error whenever i interact with hive via an oozie workflow

24965982
margin	height
the columns must grow to match each other in height however the columns each contain a box with special backgrounds and borders hence why the i can t just do the margin -5000px

24965998
superclass	subclassing
while i don t in general recommend this as it makes a subclassing much more fragile when a superclass evolves and it doesn t track any changes to the superclass it s easy to set up with a little scripting

24966015
width	height
it seems that the class fill doesn t have the height nor the width

24966015
width	height
you can resolve this by defining the width and height like this

24966031
hide	show
i think you ve got the main functionality down you just need an html element and to modify the style to show or hide

24966032
m2e	pom.xml
mouse down on plugin in pom.xml and discover new m2e connectors

24966047
postgresql	mysql
i ve moved to postgresql from mysql but got strange problem

24966055
super	implements
or just implements the methods from uiviewcontrolleranimatedtransitioning on your subclass and don t call super both should work

24966060
screens	tablet
adding that to your wordpress theme s style.css will get rid of the horizontal scroll bar you re seeing on mobile and tablet screens sizes

24966092
filtering	grouping
you can do all grouping and use a simpler process to do it by using filtering and creating a simpler set of data arrays for comparisons

24966115
width	height
my first thought is to use gradients and color stops to split the container background and this works however my goal is to have the line that is created by the gradient go from corner to corner with a dynamic container width and fixed height

24966150
versioning	upgrade
i have some sqlite databases marked as config files to save them from upgrade in which i want to modify in a specific versioning add some columns

24966177
maven	pom.xml
i only put this code in my pom.xml and i executed the command maven install

24966203
action-filter	onactionexecuting
i have a base project that contains an action-filter attribute that overrides onactionexecuting

24966235
int	boolean
my if statement in the recursive method says incompatible types int cannot be converted to boolean

24966256
stringstream	fstream
better solution open the first file for both reading and writing fstream and replace the content with a stringstream buffer without even creating a temporary file also faster

24966257
int	boolean
the reason it s saying boolean conversion is that the assignment statement returns the new value of age which is an int

24966264
tidekit	tidesdk
tidekit is the new technology and the future path for tidesdk users

24966264
tidekit	tidesdk
here is the blog post about the comparison how tidekit would be better than tidesdk

24966270
submit	submission
the input tag that you specified is a submit button type submit which has as it s builtin action submission of the form

24966270
submit	submission
however you are not firing an event upon submission of the form so it simply submit

24966280
children	parent
inheritable thread locals are automatically copied in children threads from their parent s

24966297
spaces	delimiter
in this case our delimiter is either the beginning of string or a spaces character

24966340
flot	highcharts
i ve found a lot of so questions about people having headaches with highcharts and flot exporting their html js css charts to pdf with wicked pdf the rails gem but nothing about great successes

24966365
google-chrome	safari
appears to work 100 of the time on desktop but once inside the kik app or even just in safari and or google-chrome mobile web the videos will some time not load

24966451
cvs	rcs
if you re using both rcs and cvs the above should find only v files maintained by rcs ignoring those maintained by cvs

24966500
jobs	cron
also output from cron jobs doesn t output to the screen

24966530
jpa	javax.persistence
i believe you should not be mixing jdo javax.jdo and jpa javax.persistence

24966536
int	chars
you are using an int format string d and you are sending a chars argument which is the first chars of your string

24966536
int	chars
so the printed value is the string s first chars int value

24966663
typedef	struct
so if you move the struct definitions typedef before the function prototypes the compiler should stop complaining about implicit conflicting definitions

24966667
hikaricp	c3p0
you should look for a connection pool like bonecp or c3p0 or hikaricp

24966674
google-chrome	firefox
this works on ie but not on firefox or google-chrome

24966693
memcpy	strcpy
so i feel that on x86 memcpy is faster than strcpy

24966699
int	double
you should use double numbers not int in your case

24966719
google-chrome	safari
i perfer using bettertouchtool to switch between tabs include google-chrome safari finder xcode sublimetext

24966720
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
my app has a uitabbarcontroller as the root view and each tab has a uinavigationcontroller

24966759
google-chrome	firefox
i defined a function that can check if it s from console or from the page but it works only in google-chrome it doesn t work in firefox i didn t test other browsers

24966759
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the definition of the top function if its being called from console contains this string function expression objectgroup in firefox there is no function

24966769
inherited	properties
if this and the force no-cache reload ctrl + f5 fail to produce your result you need to inspect the css and see what properties are being inherited and from where

24966783
integer	unsigned
i would like to know how given a signed or unsigned integer type and given a value for an instance of that type i can get the location of that leading 1 in the pattern starting to count from 0 the result i expect is 3 for the first row 4 for the second one

24966794
fread	read.table
fread ... is extremely fast 10 - 100 times faster than read.table ... or read.csv ... for large datasets

24966808
children	parent
i have an akka parent actor with several children

24966808
children	parent
when the parent actor is restarted i need it to simply stop its children rather than stopping and re-creating or restarting them

24966859
ssl	https
for that you likely need something that implements pkcs#11 or a microsoft equivalent and has a client certificate + private key installed on it compatible with https ssl client authentication

24966865
memcpy	strcpy
on almost any platform memcpy is going to be faster than strcpy when copying the same number of bytes

24966865
memcpy	strcpy
the only time strcpy or any of its safe equivalents would outperform memcpy would be when the maximum allowable size of a string would be much greater than its actual size

24966865
memcpy	strcpy
the strcpy function or its equivalents however would be able to early-exit and would probably take less time to copy two characters than memcpy would require to copy a million

24966892
width	font-size
in order to set the width with em it is better to set the body font-size with px

24966911
put	get
i am not sure what to put in the batch to actually run the xml file or what to put to get the data back from it

24966916
hide	show
keep in mind that mvc only concerns itself with the current page but mvcsitemapprovider must check security for all of the pages in order to determine what nodes to show and hide

24966942
children	parent
the parent document of the relation should use the embeds_many macro to indicate it has n number of embedded children where the document that is embedded uses embedded_in

24966947
for-loop	arrays
in the last step we sum all the contents in the arrays using a for-loop and output the result

24966947
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop does that for us beginning with zero and ending with 1 number lower then the length of the arrays is

24966989
put	get
you can put and get values very easily since it is just a key value store

24966994
getter	setter
that s causing the issue probably overwriting the getter and setter generated by rails

24967108
min	max
percent in css means percent of current page size so in this case combining min and max width always get 5 of your page width for logo image

24967121
min	max
you can adjust the min and max dates in your delivery-date.liquid snippet

24967129
width	font-size
as a side note the whole point of setting widths in terms of em s is that an object with width 5em has a varying width in pixels but a constant width in proportion to the font-size of the element

24967129
width	font-size
if you want it to vary with the font-size a column width you may well want to use em s

24967206
chunked	transfer-encoding
ignore the content-length header and send transfer-encoding chunked

24967209
hash	md5
i want to calculate the md5 hash of a file that ends with a certain extension in java

24967242
int	chars
since an int is 32 bits wide four times bigger than a chars when the pointer is being decremented it is printing out every fourth chars in the reverse of the string

24967257
comparator	comparable
but it seems that this int comparator comparableint i is not a implemention for virtual int comparator comparable c so i have to do a dynamic cast

24967260
ubuntu	linux
currently running linux ubuntu x64 using xterm roxterm to be exact

24967261
libstdc++	libc++
looks like your boost locale was compiled with clang and libc++ which is the default compiler and standard library on mac os x while your program was compiled with g++ and libstdc++ which is g++ s standard library

24967261
libstdc++	libc++
you need to either compile everything with clang and libc++ or get a version of boost that s compiled with g++ and libstdc++

24967291
put	get
when i put the following code in viewdidload it seemingly doesn t get added to the uitableview

24967341
int	chars	int	double
these say that types chars and short int are automatically promoted to int and type float is automatically promoted to double

24967341
int	chars
therefore varargs functions must never receive arguments of type chars short int or float

24967367
sorting	filtering
i am trying to implement sorting + filtering into my array controller

24967376
ado	unidac
component used are ado components and unidac components by devart and all have the same behavior

24967391
innodb	myisam
you know that you can t use fulltext indexes in an innodb table in mysql 5.0 but you could copy the searchable text data to a myisam table and use fulltext indexes there

24967450
firefox	safari
i wondered how easily then it would be to convert this project to use platform.js alone and get it working on at first firefox stable and later safari ie mobiles etc

24967462
listview	gridview
there is some problem with the checkboxes and radiobuttons in gridview and listview do it like this in your adapter declare an arraylist to hold the checked positions of your radiobuttons

24967550
express	node.js
i have a web application written in node.js with express framework and twitter boostrap 3 in front end and i m using this module node-webshot in order to save a state of a page in png format when a users logout from my site later show to the user a little thumbnail of his last state of the page

24967550
centos	linux
when i put my application on my digital ocean vps gnu linux - centos 6.5

24967585
width	height
i tried some jquery to set height of the child to the parent but because the absolute child div doesnt have width or height from the beginning the code didnt affect

24967610
width	height
width and height had to be removed as options to set the plot s width and height from the glyph functions like circle etc because some glyphs also have width and height attributes of their own and there was a conflict

24967648
versioning	upgrade
i presume you wanted to upgrade the openssl on you box because some package you were trying to install required a newer versioning

24967685
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it on a blank page and it works great in google-chrome but still now showing up in firefox

24967692
apache	nginx
otherwise there s also another option but nothing has to do with php you can configure your server application to handle the cache control headers for you if you re using php i m assuming apache or nginx so you don t need to rewrite everything or pass it to a php file either

24967702
uicollectionview	uitableview
if you feel comfortable with a uitableview then picking up a uicollectionview is not at all difficult

24967714
put	get
try this u have to use put extra s to intent and send data to other activity and get it on the oncreate in the next activity

24967720
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
i prefer using mouseleave and mouseenter then mouseover and mouseout

24967726
public	protected
all the public and protected members can be inherited from any class while the default or package members can also be inherited from the class within the same package as that of the superclass

24967760
filtering	grouping
uses get_all_security_groups with a filtering to find the security grouping

24967785
for-loop	arrays
a linqish way to do this rather than just a linqish way to write the for-loop is to pass the arrays on to each method and have it take what it needs and return the rest

24967887
portrait	landscape
so the problem that i am facing is the navigation drawer only shows the content for a short moment when i rotate the device either from portrait to landscape or the other way around

24967895
google-chrome	firefox
especially don t mixup types in an array as the javascript engines like v8 google-chrome and spidermonkey firefox optimize your code at runtime and mixed-types in array among other things won t let that happen

24967921
versioning	upgrade
we are now absolutely clue less and planning to upgrade the svn to a higher versioning but we don t know which versioning will fix the issue

24967980
memcpy	strcpy
if you know the size of the data to be copied then memcpy should be as fast or faster than strcpy

24967980
strlen	strcpy	memcpy	strcpy
otherwise memcpy can t be used alone and strcpy should be as fast or faster than strlen followed by memcpy

24967980
strlen	strcpy	memcpy	strcpy
a lot of implementations of memcpy and or strcpy and or strlen are designed to efficiently handle large amounts of data

24967980
memcpy	strcpy
for example for small amounts of data an memcpy optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a strcpy that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data

24967980
memcpy	strcpy
also note that the main problem here is that generic code memcpy and strcpy can t be optimised for a specific case

24967990
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i have three functions say add subtract and multiplying and i have two pages using the same function in script and i want it to put it somewhere common so that it is not repeated

24968016
hex	binary
consider the data i read is in hex format and then i need to unpack them to binary number

sorting	grouping
i have a problem with grouping and sorting

24968017
sorting	grouping
sorting and grouping needs to go in the following order

24968027
children	parent
as you can see parent will stop and unwatch its children

24968043
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
create a seperate js file with add subtract and multiplying function and link this js file to two pages

24968053
post	get
normally for get requests the browser should automatically retry the request without the proxy but when using post this is not possible

24968075
slideup	slidedown	fadein	fadeout
i d like to use slideup slidedown or fadein fadeout for that but not essential

24968085
google-chrome	firefox
the below code work on internet explore perfectly but not on mozilla firefox or google-chrome

24968086
post	get
normally for get requests the browser would be able to reload the url automatically without using the proxy but this is not possible with post

24968117
popover	tooltip
popover and tooltip in bootstrap just work fine for the first time and after that they appears and disappears quickly

24968122
google-chrome	firefox
as you should be getting a similar error in your console as google-chrome and firefox

24968145
google-chrome	safari
after crawling around on the development forums i found out that apparently safari has no such events unlike google-chrome or if there are any they are undocumented and therefore not meant to be used

24968148
uiview	subviews
don t know if this will work for you but i do this will a subclass of uiview which contains two subviews -- a uiimageview for the image and a uilabel for the label

24968154
hide	show
in faq.html you would need to read the querystring parameter and depending on the value call the javascript function that actually handles the show hide of questions

24968194
post	get
i assume the get is just part of the testchunks behavior but i m still unclear on why i m not seeing a post from the browser

24968196
copying	overwrite
so what s happening is that you end up copying this over top of the pending input which overwrite the which starts the second string

24968218
getter	setter
you might also choose to add getter and setter functions for name and mealtype

24968259
width	height
i was trying responsive layout with css media queries and relative width height values in

24968259
width	height
when i zoom in only the font sizes increase while the div containers height width remains same

24968314
post	put
hope your code look like as you update a status so you can use put instead of post

24968382
min	max
equivalent to the expression min expr and expr max

24968394
put	get
to get factorname if the code for the template can be modified you could put a data-factorname attribute in the option itself like

24968446
superclass	subclassing
the beauty of this pattern is you can call unrelated code on different subclassing of a superclass without having to do weird casts everywhere or putting tons of unrelated methods into the superclass

24968472
hide	show
...i have also a suggestion for your showhidelabels function do not refer to each element separately to show hide them it s a method prone to error

24968528
bash	zsh
the cleanest and shorted way possible is to enclose your arguments around quotes to prevent word splitting and possible pathname expansion now named filename expansion in 4.3 however there s a workaround if you only plan to run your scripts on zsh or bash

24968555
jlist	jtextpane
i ve tried displaying them as entries in a jlist or as a complete document in a jtextpane

24968610
vsto	add-in
make sure that if you re debugging a vsto add-in or similar app that you do not manually load assemblies yourself - this screws up the modules for the vs.net debugger and renders satellite assemblies non-debuggable

24968743
post	get
you could provide your editors textarea s id to get the content of the tinymce also you should get the contents of the saved post meta and set it as the text of your editor element to display the value saved before

24968780
imperative	declarative
there is no magic the runtime decides when to run the compiler when the resource has been changed since last run and then invokes the compiler to create an imperative code out of the declarative code an .aspx is compiled into .cs

24968832
maven	pom.xml
in the maven webapp project i created the servlet diaservlet in the root directory of the project the directory where pom.xml is

24968836
post	put
i can t believe it.in word press post editor when i put bank s it shows a huge data base error but when i just use bank .no error

24968856
firefox	safari
firefox and safari will use the favicon that comes last

24968856
firefox	safari
exactly the opposite of firefox and safari

24968864
children	parent
first parent parent and second child of first .child and .child could have 1 or more children .children

24968899
for-loop	arrays
was trying my hands at angularjs with ejs to run a for-loop on an integer arrays received on the ejs template from an angularjs controller

24968972
textview	imageview
you need to define a layout file for your row of listview it should include an imageview and a textview

24969002
width	height
width 640 height 480

24969189
apache	nginx
i m breaking my head on nginx rewrite rules while migrating from apache to nginx

24969237
google-chrome	safari
i have style my select box and its working fine on google-chrome and safari

24969277
hide	show
the show hide logic is wrong.

24969277
ng-show	ng-hide	hide	show
ng-hide needs variable when to hide ng-show needs it when to show so the condition ng-show message ng-hide

24969335
client-side	server-side
in the mean time you have to use a base class on the server-side or a hierarchy of interfaces on the client-side possibly with extratypes pointing to the specific interfaces if they re not used directly otherwise

24969395
put	get
note that i have tried to put it in the dino class and the spacemonster class on separate occasions but i either hear nothing when the overlap occurs or i get the same problem as above where the sound is warped because it s playing many times a second depending on what method i slot the code into

24969409
completionhandler	nserror
completionhandler fbsession session fbsessionstate state nserror error

24969443
rss	feed
i have a rss feed url and i am using following php function to extract values from it

24969443
rss	feed
and i am using count function to count the length of array thats extracted from rss feed

24969443
rss	feed
so is there a way to echo a message if there are no results in rss feed url

24969554
folder	directory
first check whether folder directory exists or not

24969556
getter	setter
kvo works with setter and getter and in incnumber you are directly accessing ivar so instead of that use self.number

24969579
width	height
it gives an error illegal argument exception width and height must be 0

24969651
telerik	radcombobox
i had exactly this scenario for telerik radcombobox and i solve it like bellow

24969666
folder	directory
instead of relying on if the uploads folder is writable or not and since you are storing your files temporarily it is a better option that you create a folder in the uploads directory for which you can specify the permissions yourself

24969731
pull	push
so what i do is i pull frequently from master and push changes to my branch

24969743
folder	directory
i can read from it but when i want to find it in my project directory it s not there..i tried to search for it in all my computer folder but it s not there

24969759
post	get
and when i change method type from post to get i get another error

24969821
profiling	instrumentation
you need to profiling your app in instrumentation to get more detail - there s a button right there in your screenshot

24969826
width	height
you should use usercomputed size height and width property

24969854
portrait	landscape
what i need to achieve is adding a layout to the existing page on changing the screen from portrait to landscape

24969854
width	height
i have managed to detect orientation change using void onsizeallocated double width double height

24969885
fink	macports
warning you have macports or fink installed

24969886
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to execute 2 ajax calls in a way that whatever receives from 1st ajax call will the data for second ajax call working fine on google-chrome but firefox giving cross domain issues but both files are on same domain

24969893
width	height
if i set the height of the .content div to 400px it does what i want but it is not a percentage so on resize it doesn t change - when the width of the container is 200px the content div s height should be 120px

24969946
uilabel	uitextview
i fix it by replacing uitextview with uilabel and uiscrollview

24969978
int	double
math.random returns double value between 0 including to 1 excluding and you are casting that to int that becomes it zero before multiplication

24970002
alarmmanager	fileobserver
you should use alarmmanager to periodically scan the directory for changes using fileobserver with a polling period so they can control battery and cpu consumption by your app

24970016
hide	show
but and this is the weird part if alt+f10 is used to show and hide the selection pane when powerpoint first runs the two lines of code work

24970045
mouse	keyboard
without admin rights you can t change the built in policy and a batch file cannot monitor mouse movement and keyboard movements in other program windows

24970061
postfix	dovecot
i am using postfix and dovecot on unix

folder	directory
make sure your sample is under gooddata-js examples folder let s assume is named mysample and it has index.html file in that directory

24970188
post	get
anyway the problem i get here is that i cannot get the game event that is returned in the create post to be anything other than null

24970197
fflush	gets
the file gets deleted after closing so use fflush instead of fclose run the fclose after the embedded exe has finished

24970236
jar	war
create a new maven project or module put your web resources jsf views scripts images etc. in src main resources meta-inf resources create a src main resources meta-inf faces-config.xml and use jar not war packaging

24970274
post	get
you will get a result of all the post that contain that string

24970316
int	chars
to an experienced c++ programmer the problem should be quite obvious i implicitly convert from chars to int in getint

24970316
int	chars
so the compiler will create a temporary int and return a reference to it instead of just returning the chars and re-interpret it as an int

24970329
queue	fifo
i don t have any experience with i2c but if its queue is a fifo then the code should work

24970351
draggable	droppable
i have used jquery ui draggable and droppable

24970405
google-chrome	firefox
4.4.3 the cut copy and paste functions by means of the buttons and context menu are disabled actively blocked in firefox 30 and google-chrome 35

24970405
google-chrome	firefox
it would preferably have to be one that is javascript-based because i think it is a poor show if we have to ask the users to configure their firefox google-chrome to use the editor in a normal way

24970407
try-catch	exception-handling
whereas in try catch try block will see if there is any exception-handling that that can be caught which is then caught and the further code can run.the caller of the method will have to plan for exception-handling handling with their own try-catch

24970430
margin	height
additionally you have 55px of top margin set on your body which further reduces the viewable height on a device in landscape orientation

24970474
hide	show
the above code to to show hide drop down when the share anchor tag is clicked

24970495
try-catch	exception-handling
you should probably check this link to understand when should you handle the exception-handling try-catch and when you should declare them with throws clause

24970495
try-catch	exception-handling
when you declare them in throws clause the callers of the method knows that these exception-handling may be thrown from it and plan to write their own try-catch for exception-handling handling on their end

24970495
try-catch	exception-handling
the caller of the method will have to plan for exception-handling handling with their own try-catch

24970507
post	put
file content can t be put inside a url parameter using a form.so use post

24970612

24970864
hash	md5
i try to generate a md5 hash for a string using the digest package in r

24970911

24970915
mouse	keyboard
i want to read keyboard and mouse inputs under linux lubuntu x64

24970942

24970968
mouse	keyboard
please understand that the x11 server is running in the desktop or laptop connected to your physical lcd screen and physical keyboard and mouse

24970968
mouse	keyboard
you could grab the mouse and or keyboard and use the root window - the entire screen so get events for it

24970983
post	get
post or get

24970983
post	get
so your stats.php could deal with a post request by reading in the parameters and creating updating a new user with the values provided in the post parameters while dealing with get requests by returning the user s stats as they are now

24971027
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource

24971047
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and firefox

24971076
onresume	onpause
note that with this set up the code will keep on running even after the textview isn t accessible for example the user has moved to another activity so make sure you do a check for this and create a stop condition perhaps by using a boolean variable isvisible that you set true false in the onresume onpause of your activity or fragment

24971107
post	get
instead of receiving param1 and param2 that are in the url of a get call and then use to read them and use them in my controller i would like to receive a json object which of course stays in a post request and have that object available in my controller

24971160

flask	django
there are many python web frameworks such as flask django

24971222

24971223
freetype	libpng
android ndk cross-compile setup libpng and freetype

24971244
put	get
so my question is is it possible to put get set willget and willset methods in a separate place so that my property declarations can look like this.

24971252
width	height
it doesn t happen reliably but typically only the first time a button is tapped sometimes when you go back the button is back to normal other times it is wider other times it looks larger meaning width height and font are larger other times all the buttons look smaller

24971301
avr	microcontroller
i have usbasp programmer for avr microcontroller

24971326

that bit works fine but i m struggling to get my head round how to show a replacement div when i hide the div

24971335

before i get into details please take a look at the live example where this problem occurs - script code at the bottom of this post

24971354
uiview	subviews
the detail view controller has a view inherited of uiview called topview and the view has many subviews

24971354

button	checkbox
i am attempting to write an automation script in vba that will log into a web site and hit some button and checkbox on that site which will then trigger a download

24971425

the problem is that the table cell has relativ height and width

24971425
width	height
so when i use relative height and width on the div s they do not show up

24971451
put	get
i m trying to put a line in our subdirectory www.example.com us htaccess file not the root htaccess to get www.example.com us and www.example.com us to redirect to www.example.com but nothing else -- so www.example.com us file.txt or www.example.com dir file.txt would not redirect

24971458
width	height
what you need to accomplish what you want is to model a world where the circles are object with width and height dimensions and their current position and where the bounds are well defined

24971458
width	height
once you have the width and height of each circle and their position you can calculate where they are in respect to the bounds you set and see if you need to change direction or keep going

24971458
width	height
collisions stem from the same principle but are somewhat harder to model if you want them to be realistic in the bounds problem you are only interested in the width and height of the circles because the bounding area is box shaped and the circle will always collide in the furthest point from its center while when two circles collide you should take into account the radius of each circle instead of the bounding box around them

24971459
youtube	vimeo
i am making an application in which i want to play online videos from sites like youtube daily motion vimeo etc

24971468
width	height
you then have height and width properties for the dimensions and propertyidlist and propertyitems to get other information that may be available

24971468
width	height
btw as far as i know height and width are available for every image format

24971489
swift	objective-c
i want to convert to swift from objective-c code like following

integer	fractions
a floating literal consists of an integer part a decimal point a fractions part an e or e an optionally signed integer exponent and an optional type suffix

24971503
base	fractions	integer	fractions
the integer and fractions parts both consist of a sequence of decimal base ten digits

24971503
integer	fractions
either the integer part or the fractions part not both can be omitted

its working perfectly in firefox safari and ie

24971641
submit	submission
i am working on making a basic submission form in php that submit data to a mysql database

24971655
free	malloc
note when allocating memory dynamically with malloc you need to free the memory once you are done with it

24971697
rtp	rtsp
the client request ask for a application x-rtsp-tunnelled answer this is not a simple mjpeg stream over http multipart x-mixed-replace with image jpeg boundaries this is an rtsp rtp stream tunneled inside an http stream

24971697
rtp	rtsp
live555 provide an rtsp rtp over http server see live555 media server

24971706
bower	npm
some of them don t even make sense in a browser child_process for example others may be available as standalone modules for npm or bower but i have no experience with that

24971715
children	parent
example snip public child parent parent gets a null for parent but i would like to have the real parent there that json.net created prior to constructing the children

24971718
subtract	add
so i was thinking i would need to get the actual frame number and then add subtract it by 1 every tick until it reaches the frame 0

24971788
gruntjs	browserify
the javascript app is built using browserify and gruntjs

24971788

mouseover	mouseout
i have a slider which starts sliding when i mouseover but i wanted to stop the slide on mouseout

24972177
width	margin
normally should not worry about the width but you may have some specific reason for knowing it in order to cancel its effect by setting a negative margin with the same value

24972208
put	get
for example if you constrain a uiimageview to the borders of its parent uiscrollview and then put an image twice the size of the uiscrollview inside the uiimageview your image won t get shrunk its the uiimageview that will take the size of its image and become scrollable inside the uiscrollview

24972435
centos	linux
i m a newbie to the centos linux environment any help would be greatly appreciated

24972490
stdout	stderr
in addition to the log of stdout and stderr of the node.exe process consider using debugging and etw traces to further diagnose the problem

24972490

24972530
config	ini
src main resources is meant for project resource files log4j.properties ini config files that need to be in the application class path

24972539
textview	imageview
you need to specify params for the imageview as well since you ve declared it initially in the xml to be relative to the textview

24972620
folder	directory
inside the workbench directory i have the vendor and package folder

24972640

i generated getter setter and updated my db with the following commands

24972672
apache	nginx
i do not know how to configure nginx at all as i was using apache until switching to homestead today

24972679
realloc	malloc
likewise the big array of pointers pproducts could itself be dynamically heap-allocated and you would use realloc 3 or malloc for that pointer array

24972717

i ve installed postgresql 9.3 pgadmin3 and psycopg2 successfully in ubuntu linux and tested postgresql manually by creating a database called mysite and a few tables and it s working fine

24972815
getter	setter
but you should probably stick to generating new class definitions and using the runtime-synthesised getter and setter that flow from there as it ll allow the compiler better to verify what you re typing and will lead to more efficient code at runtime

24972835
swift	objective-c
i m using an objective-c class in my swift project via a bridging header

24972867
daemons	launchd
the only solution i can think of is to launchd a php daemons script but that is really making things complicated

on tablet small screens devices though the resolutions width is more than 980px but obviously things look much smaller the pages don t yet occupy full width so there is some scope for pages to look a bit bigger

24972961
screens	tablet
i want the webpages to scale up zoom to occupy full available screens width in mobile devices tablet

24972962

this is great because then it simplifies your grouping and sorting to just this

24972977
post	get
either one query to get the users and post all at once or 2 queries one to get the users and one to get the post

24973012
swift	objective-c

children	parent
most likely the nodes in each tree will have two pointers to the children and a pointer to the parent node

24973074
swift	objective-c
when converting from objective-c to swift you must take that into account

24973083
octal	hex	octal	binary	hex	binary
now i decided i just want to show a table of each number from 1 to 256 with their corresponding binary hex and octal values

arraylist	treeset
this cannot be done with an arraylist this could be done with a treeset and a custom comparator implementation which is able to accurately compare the objects

24973617
for-loop	arrays
now to your problem i think your print method uses a for-loop in the arrays case which then uses num as a boundary and in the arrays list case you use to string

24973751
16-bit	64bit
with 128 total bits even with a full 48 bits reserved for network prefix and 16-bit for site subnet we are still left with 64bit to use for the interface identifier which is analogous to the host id under ipv4

24973806
prepare	execute

24973930
octree	quadtree
what you are looking for is a quadtree in 3 dimensions an octree

24973974
for-loop	loops
it s of course ok to write foo x 1 2 in the for-loop but you can also wrap the function before going into loops

24974017
mojolicious	catalyst
explaining fully how to write a web application in perl is more than i can reasonably do here but you may want to take a look at existing perl web development frameworks like catalyst dancer and mojolicious

google-chrome	firefox
if i run this code in google-chrome 36.0.1985.125 things function as they should but when run in firefox v31.0 on mac osx 10.9.4 the if-statement evaluates the condition incorrectly and always evaluates as if the condition was true

24975388
google-chrome	firefox
i ve verified that this is not happening in google-chrome and that it is indeed isolated to firefox

i m wondering if perhaps there is an encoding issue that firefox isn t handling well and google-chrome is because this code except for the trailing

24975408
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
2 box-sizing border-box - this changes the way the browser renders the width of the div to include padding and borders

24975408
width	border-box
if you specify width 50 and padding 20px without border-box you end up with a div that is 50 wide + 20px of padding which of course is larger than 50

24975408
width	border-box
border-box enforces that the total width of the box is 50

1 create your own class which will have the channelname and channeldescription attributes use getter and setter

24975499
textblob	nltk
i m using python and nltk + textblob for some text analysis

24975499
textblob	nltk

24975503
gruntjs	yeoman
i know neither yeoman nor gruntjs but like david jacquel already said in his answer making global headers and footers is dead simple with jekyll

width	height
in your .messages div you re using position absolute which means you are going to have to make the width and height explicit as you ve done for height already in the .messageswrap div

24975853
integer	unsigned
you haven t declare data_in or data_out to be a signed or unsigned value which implies any conversion to integer is likely unsigned

24975853
integer	unsigned
the integer to unsigned conversion routine to_unsigned can produce a warning if the input integer value is greater than can be expressed in the number of bits specified 6 so the result is clamped to 6 bits with the mod operator

24975868
post	get
unfortunately when i call my site through a post method my dispatcher tells me through that my request is a get request and all my post data is lost

24975868
post	get
i think the problem comes from the fact that my htaccess isn t properly rewriting the url since calling my base url will properly call a get and post but if i add additional url data such as domain.com where module and action are data i pass to the server for calling the right module and function it will return a 404 response status still with the correct data

24976399
int	double
neither is a float double then int division is used where the result will also be an int

24976399
floating-point	integer
there are thus no floating-point types in the question and the result is 3 an integer which is assignable directly to an integer variable

24976420
comparator	comparable
it is firstly calling this the current calling object then calling getfirstkey on it and then calling standard comparable interface s comparator method

24976420
comparator	comparable
so now clearly parameters passed to outer and inner comparator methods differ.inner comparator is the standard comparator as defined in comparable interface and that s why the author has implemented comparable interface

24976436
int	chars
by the way there are a lot of possible errors in your code enter a chars instead of int for variable pin that must be handled by try-catch

24976494

the problem is that the width you had specified for the cells was much more than required set to to a lower value and also try to use some css to specify the height and width of the table itself

24977373
int	chars
that code declares a constant int named size then declares two chars arrays of size size

24977396

i want each test to take one input file and a set of command line arguments run the program and compare the output which is the output file stdout output and stderr output to the expected output

24984478

since i need to support both c++ and python the test framework needs to be language agnostic - it should be able to run an executable collect stdout and stderr and compare them as well as another file to the prerecorded outputs

24984489
operands	scalar
note however that it is not changing the order of the operands but rather converts numeric value into a scalar class

you would be able to very cleanly use solr grouping to grouping the items as one and then grouping sorting to only return the item that you want

24985096
qobject	qwidget
qt needs every qobject descendant like qwidget to be assigned to a thread see qobject thread

24985096

24985116
maven	pom.xml
if you have a maven pom.xml just update it with

integer	unsigned
if you are concerned with execution speed use integer types with fastn_t suffix uint_fast16_t for a fast 16-bit unsigned integer

24985280
setinterval	settimeout
you are calling async function settimeout setinterval and referring to the original i of the for-loop inside of the settimeout callback

24985282

i m using fakeiteasy instead of moq and i d hoped it would be just as simple however fakeiteasy complains that it can t create a fake of my dbset using the following

24985420
setinterval	clearinterval
moreover setinterval means that it will be called as long as clearinterval is called to the variable it is assigned with

24985420
setinterval	clearinterval
at that point you just call clearinterval to the value which has handle to setinterval and the job is finished

24985443
int	double
note however that a double may not be the best choice monetary values are generally expressed not in floating point but in fixed point with a few digits p after the decimal point and in this case converting the value to an int with a scaling by 10 p and storing this int as others suggested is better

24985528
google-chrome	firefox
it happens mainly when using google-chrome but once the issue appears on google-chrome it is as if it stays in memory and happens in firefox too

24985587

24985730
draggable	droppable
check out the draggable and droppable widgets

24985746

24985765
minimum	max
the color scale is symmetrical so if the max velocity is x the minimum will be -x

24985787
int	double
i m not familiar with java but i think it could be something to do with this line - basically it is letting you know that casting a double to an int will result in the loss of data

24985844
int	double
the errors are because u is a double and the indices in any array are numbers in int from 0 1 2 etc.

24985844
int	double
the reason for the loss of precision error is because an int occupies 32 bits of memory a double occupies 64 bits so if you try and squeeze a double into an int you may lose some data

24985865
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
you are using getelementsbytagname instead of getelementbyid which will not work given that you never provided any name attributes for the inputs

junit	testng
i used it with junit but i am almost sure it works in the same way with testng

24986111
n-gram	words

i saw that the parent class is what i want to work with since it is the class from which all node classes that bear children are derived

24986776
children	parent
it s grabbing all the nodes from the root parent node but not from the nodes with children in them

24986795
post	put
you should put up a please wait dialog or a progress bar on the main thread while loading is being performed on your worker thread and have the worker thread post updates to the ui thread on what percentage of its loading is complete which can then be reflected in the progress display on the ui thread including at the end removing that display when loading is complete

24986835

you can simply use a float and the then take the min of the float and 1.0 to ensure it is in the range

24986910
width	height
i have a button in my form and a picturebox with width 290 and height 145 that is hidden at first

24986986
mouseover	mouseout
i noticed you set mouseover mouseout on your links to toggle the image

24986991
submit	submission	google-chrome	firefox
if you keep submission in a form on the second or third time depending on the browser software it gives you the option to select prevent this page from creating additional dialogs√¢ which in google-chrome it still does not submit the form but in other programs such as firefox it stops the alert dialog but also allows it to submit causing problems

24987058
folder	directory
activator has running files in user s home directory .activator 1.2.2 and a folder to each version

24987071

it s better to compare node.js with ruby or python and compare rails and django with node.js based full stack frameworks like geddy sails.js or total.js

24987081
google-chrome	safari
i am not having this issue in google-chrome or safari on mac only in safari mobile

i imagine you don t really need to call exec_ as you aren t using any events in your current code most events are to do with window mouse keyboard though you might conceivably use some in the future like those generated by qtimer

24987215
getter	setter
with a manual getter and setter as opposed to synthesizing them you need to explicitly declare one

24987350
pull	push
and if you plan on supporting devices especially international based devices that doesn t have google play services install because of licensing issues pubnub is the ultimate quick and fast real time push pull mechanism

24987368
fasta	biopython
also you might want to look into the biopython third party library - it has existing tools for reading and parsing fasta files

24987374
width	margin
i have a simple scenario where i would like two boxes to display next to each other and to take the full width of the page with 0.75em margin between them

24987412

the rest of the code is nothing of help it s just some getter setter

24987486
cpython	pypy	jython	pypy

24987584
post	get
there are a few ways of using javascript to get a page to post back

24987616

24987617
spaces	delimiter
your string is spaces delimiter not comma

24987623
hide	show
hide nav when scroll down show nav when scroll up

24987623
width	height
also when the screen width 768px the nav becomes a toggle menu the mouse hover effect has to take into account of menu s full height

24987623
hide	show
js for mouse hovering show hide

24987649

side note this code is javascript that is being used to scale an image using the browser s native scaling via the width and height attributes on the image element

24987764
firefox	safari
it works well in firefox safari my desktop environment is mac os mavericks

24987795
ng-view	ngcloak
and then you apply the ngcloak directive to items that are affected or to a high-level parent like your ng-view div

24987804
width	height
this is important because when you scale the image the image is reduced by a percentage not by an absolute amount in both width and height

24987804
width	height
in this example the absolute difference in width is larger but the percentage difference in height is higher

24987804
width	height
the old code scaled based on width incorrectly and the new code scales on height

24987824
matlab	simulink
i want to generate an arbitrary linear signal from matlab function block in simulink

24987838
viewdidload	viewwillappear

you can post data to the ashx handler then the ajax success method on the javascript side will get back the json object your method returned

24987933
min	max
the problem for me is that since there was no entries on 2014-06-17 i need to somehow create one with min 0 and max 0

24987933
min	max
given you are calculating a daily min max one approach would be to take advantage of the new and update operators in mongodb 2.6 and upsert values into a daily collection

24987933
min	max
daily documents that don t exist will be inserted with default min max values of 0

24987933
min	max
daily documents that do exist will be updated with the max of their existing min and max field values existing values will be preserved

24987933
min	max
you could use the same update query to maintain your daily min max as new data is inserted by providing the current values for min max instead of 0 or calculate the daily min max from the original samples using a sort order

24987937
put	get	post	get	post	put
i m using the post and i get a 405 method not allowed with put how every even though post doesn t error the text file does not get updated

not sure why so many submit button but the same logic applies if you want to use any other input method eg radio button checkbox

24988087
width	height
the bitmapdata height and width don t match the height and width of the actual tile

24988132
maven	pom.xml
it looks for its dependency in maven central and then tells me the pom.xml doesn t exist there

24988161
oncreate	setcontentview
in your oncreate method of the actionbaractivity you then initialized it after the setcontentview r.layout.your_layout_for_the_checkbox

24988261
post	get
im trying to post to php and get the response

24988293
preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
i find that it helps to think of postorder preorder and inorder as recursive algorithms

24988293
preorder	inorder
the preorder traversal would be a b d e c f and the inorder traversal would be d b e a c f

24988300
put	get
when i put that code in it will not compile and i get this error

24988336
double-pointer	pointers
this is more akin to what you need since you re changing a pointers to something so you need a double-pointer to it

24988361
folder	directory
instead of accessing unknown path what i did is get the directory list of parent folder and check whether matching one contain or not

24988383
hide	show
thanks to help from a online help website i m able to show hide my table successfully

24988402
coalesce	nvl
coalesce is similar to nvl and is standard across different dbms while nvl is oracle specific

24988424
put	get
how can i get the tax from the user once and put it in the getfinalprice method and then use the taxvalue variable to take the user input for taxes and get it in the gettaxamount method

24988466
getter	setter
often in java the method to change the value of the field is implemented using the getter setter pattern in which case the method to change the value is called in your case settaxes

24988471

24988550
put	get
so they re what get put into ii v

24988562
persistent	transient
in short the entire object graph of a given http session that is liable to be persistent via serialization must either be marked as serializable or transient

24988595
hide	show
with that being said ng-hide show if in your template is probably the better way to go simply set a scope variable instead of doing element.show hide

24988667
post	get
jsonobjectrequest uses third argument in constructor to get post parameters

24988683
hide	show
i tried placing the values from the list in the rows and hide them the problem is that it doesnt show the drop down

24988755
post	get
when i use the function hr.open post or get url boolean with a .json file it works

24988766
google-chrome	firefox
works with google-chrome and internetexplorer firefox does not report the document.documentelement.clientwidth but window.innerwidth and the result should be the same

24988776
postgresql	mysql
sqlite mysql postgresql is ok

24988867
prepare	execute
i understand how the prepare and execute functions of the pdo class are useful to prevent sql injection

24988899
unsigned	short
so for example i have a variable called a which is an unsigned short .

24988899
int	chars	int	double
its ok if this is limited to a few types eg chars short int long long long float double

24988932
express	node.js
i have developed a very simple appp in node.js its working fine locally using express and socket.io

24988957
autocomplete	typeahead
this is closer to user2576666 s technique since it uses typeahead s custom events to force an update in the knockout model when there is a selection or an autocomplete

24988961
post	get
then i have a special url that accepts post requests on get i just redirect them

24988961
post	get
i can get the path and with more work probably the original view from where the post came from but that doesn t get me the template

24989139
submit	submission
you could run a seperate greylisting policy server for incoming emails at port 25 and reject invalid emails plus greylisting and run the cluebringer policy server for incoming emails at submission port 587 assuming your users use port 587 to submit emails and not via port 25

24989154

uilabel	uibutton
i ve been localizing the text for uilabel and uibutton objects in my storyboard by updating the main.strings files for the storyboard

24989228
hide	show
if two of them equal then use .show to display the extra elements else use hide to not show them

24989244
children	parent
while adding removing child components from a parent which is already visible invoke parent#revalidate and parent#repaint in that order after the code which removes adds the children

24989248

but in place of sometimes i have int vectors also so how can i use auto or something else so that with the same argument it read int as well as double

24989392
post	put
put events shares and post in cache load them dynamically when needed

24989410
uiview	subviews
i have a scrollview with some uiview as subviews that i drag around

24989432
ubuntu	linux
i am rather new to linux using ubuntu 14.04 lts 64bit coming from windows and am attempting to port over an existing cuda project of mine

24989446
abstract-class	superclass
superclass being an abstract-class creates an overhead for all its sub classes to compulsorily define its abstract methods

24989446
abstract-class	superclass
i understand that it s very basic but i need to know why do programmers usually make superclass as an abstract-class though we can do similar things using a superclass as a non abstract-class

24989494
google-chrome	firefox
the above solution is working fine in google-chrome and firefox

24989590
width	height
width and height need to be set it can t be 0

24989659
width	height
works good but a button can be dragged outside of screen width height

24989669
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have one uitabbarcontroller it contains four uiviewcontroller homeviewcontroller historyviewcontroller settingsviewcontroller infoviewcontroller which the second one is uinavigationcontroller homeviewcontroller - chattingviewcontroller

24989709
for-loop	arrays
and so on you could even add a nested for-loop to iterate through each inner arrays as below.

24989716
hide	show
also what if i start my application with tab based and hide the tab bar for the pages that don t need to show

24989791
getter	setter
the application use session setter getter

24989822
hide	show
either i just show hide actionbar buttons and other controls as needed as the user navigates the app or i create a completely new actionbar for each screen where they navigate to and replace the existing actionbar

24989843
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
arithmetic operators + - unary multiplication and division + - addition and subtraction

24989893
put	get
by the way since you get the numbers from user i suggest you to put numbers in sorted

24989924
google-chrome	firefox
if you are using google-chrome go with ctrl+shift+c to open the console or f12 for firebug in firefox or console in ie

24989927
dictionary	map
dictionary mode - in which object are stored as key - value maps as a hash map

24989954
post	get
in wp8+portable get doesn t work the call doesn t return but post works fine

24989954
post	get
i m doing get s to www.google.com and the post to my own server

24989988
width	height
but here its resizing using a fixed size i need to resize with height 260 pixels and maintaining its aspect ratio not setting the image width

24990015
google-chrome	firefox
i am running 12 test cases in parallel 4 on ie 4 on firefox 4 on google-chrome through selenium grid

24990017
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it is prompting print dialoge in firefox ie and safari perfectly but didn t promt the dialog in google-chrome browser

24990054
integer	unsigned
note that this converts the guid to an integer array with unsigned byte values not strictly a byte array and that the string representation does not insert dashes that you ll have to add if you need it

24990064
iboutlet	ibaction
make ibaction iboutlet manually in your class and connect from code to button in storyboard by dragging from circles left to declarations

24990097
width	height
i m calculating the image value of height and width and checking with if condition whether the imagsize is available or not

24990126
getter	setter
you are trying to declare a property named m_topstring with setter settopstring and getter topstring and that is plainly stupid

24990126
getter	setter
just call the property topstring don t pick your own names for the setter and getter don t pick your own names for the instance variable and everything works just fine

24990179
postgresql	mysql
however if you need things like data-integrity mysql ansi compliant paging and ctes arrays associative arrays json etc. i d move over to postgresql instead

24990229
put	get
to get it to move independent of button presses we should put it in its own method which can invoke itself after a set duration

24990240
getter	setter
if you could not access other s private members in you d be forced to make public getter and setter and the whole point of having x and y private would be arguably lost

24990268
memcpy	strcpy
if size is known normally a non-naive implementation of memcpy is faster than strcpy since it takes profit of the cpu s data bus size

24990343
dictionary	map
your service does not return an array of objects though rather a dictionary of dictionary which restkit cannot correctly interpret as a collection of objects it can map individually

24990362
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
in the sample app we have one uiviewcontroller embedded in a uitabbarcontroller as the first tab

24990362
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
that uiviewcontroller is then embedded in a uinavigationcontroller

24990395
setlocale	strftime
to format dates in other languages you should use the setlocale and strftime functions instead of date

24990410
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the console always calls intermediate javascript functions in firefox the call comes directly from native code

24990410
google-chrome	firefox
as a consequence you can inspect arguments.callee.caller in google-chrome but in firefox it will always be null

24990410
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari behaves the same as firefox here so inspecting the caller is really a trick that only works in google-chrome

24990410
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the following function works in firefox google-chrome and even safari

24990411
oncreate	recreate
then when the activity is recreate oncreate will be called with this bundle passed as a parameter so you can read your data from it

24990503
memcpy	strcpy
as a ground rule you should use strcpy for strings and memcpy for data

24990523
folder	directory
else if you want to copy a directory i.e folder you can use dfs -copytolocal

24990529
jobs	cron
sometimes if cron jobs are not working it s because one of these points

24990634
folder	directory
for now the folder directory was in the path env variable but unfortunately i had to remove it from there

24990650
int	chars
the stuff will remove the first 6 chars the +0 will cast the rest of the col as int which can also be done with cast or convert

24990694
put	get	post	get	post	put
i am consuming api from another level having method put post get delete

you can however use the wmq java client non jms and have the mq queuemanager act as the xa transaction manager non jta

25004696

exact syntax for those two commands will depend on what your ssh sftp client is but if you re using something well-known like putty then i m sure there s plenty of documentation out there and you can post questions on so if you get stuck on something. so really the sticking point is the process of building your jar and that s very easy if you move to a better build technology than eclipse

the solution for me was to add a protocol to the url used for ajax requests get or post

25006052

this type of thing has been asked before but you could pull this off with a uibutton category that adds getter setter like methods that store this value for you

25006421
spaces	delimiter
i ve got an orders table which contains order details delimiter by spaces - the order details may contain multiple items yes i know this breaks database convention but it s one of our third party databases

post	get
i get the share dialog showing the image preview and press post then i get the progress bar but it doesn t progress and then i get switched back to my app

25006541

the alternative of course is to use setinterval which always uses the same reference when it runs and thus clearinterval to would work and you don t have to worry about keeping to set to the right reference

25006541
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval here not settimeout

25006588
hide	show
as goose said in the comments instead of using an ajax call you could hide the select boxes and show them based on the value of the show select option as show below

25006590

25006594
min	max
formats the month with m as case-word with nn with a width of min three and max three with 3-3

pull	push
what i need to know is how to add the corresonding push pull classes automatically to get the result as

25006675
superclass	subclassing
but my issue is that the subclassing would also have some set s but if the user of the api calls first a set from the superclass the type changes and i can t call the subclassing method

25006721

finally i have fixed the problem by removing the this.touchcapable and bind both touch and mouse events touchmove touchstart touchend mousedown mousemove and mouseup

rcurl	libcurl
i m not sure if this is a problem with libcurl rcurl devtools or my older linux distro

25006769

25006939
post	put
you will need to post put the data back to the server

25006966
nsurl	nsstring
a lot of the time it doesn t seem to be an issue of space storing an nsstring would be more efficient if the nsurl wouldn t contain any other specific data but not to the point of making a difference in most applications

25006966
nsurl	nsstring
in the end the most applicable specific choice is generally best√¢ nsurl represents a url that can potentially contain the location of a resource on a remote server the path of a local file on disk or even an arbitrary piece of encoded data source while an nsstring simply represents a string of text√¢ if a url is what you re going for use nsurl

25006966
nsurl	nsstring
one clear upside to nsstring s is that they re more portable√¢ but nsurl can be serialized and moved about if needed too

25007000
inherited	subclassing
now we would need much more decorations to this simple model in order to get the full ruby hierarchy of classes and functionality imposing the existence of some fixed members on the image of the map f a partial order on the image of the map f in order to define subclassing to get afterwards inherited etc and in particular to get the nice picture that was interestingly upvoted but i suppose that everybody can figure this out from the primitive model i gave i have written some pages explaining this for myself after having read several ruby manuals

25007009
getter	setter
but if this is done inside an other assembly and then the setter getter are changed the behaviour would not be forwarded to the calling assembly

25007050

free	malloc
it ends saying that 0x8 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d and the line where it happens the segfault is the line 78 of the paste where el is acessed for the first time inside de loop so it appears that i should be hitting the end of the queue but it s not the case due to line 74

for 32-bit ie on 64bit windows window.navigator.platform will be win32 and window.navigator.cpuclass will be x86

25007569
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
for example imagine you have a device with api level 12 and you install an app with then later you receive a system update that upgrade your android versioning to api level 13...google play will uninstall your app

25007616
getter	setter
instead of using that approach i ll create a boolean member in the application object with getter setter

25007631
win64	windows
for 64-bit windows with 64-bit ie window.navigator.platform will be win64 and window.navigator.cpuclass will be x64

25007631
x86	64bit
for 64bit windows with 32-bit ie window.navigator.platform will be win32 and window.navigator.cpuclass will be x86

25007640
int	boolean
for example in the above code featureselector might be an instance of sklearn.feature_selection.selectkbest or sklearn.feature_selection.selectpercentile since these classes implement the get_support method which returns a boolean mask or int indices of the selected features

25007645
apache	nginx
php with nginx is very different than php with apache since there is no mod_php equiv for nginx afaik

25007645
apache	nginx
php is handled by totally separate daemon php-fpm or by passing the request to an apache server etc. as a result you can bypass php completely simply by letting nginx handle the request without passing it off to php-fpm or apache

25007655
swift	objective-c
headerdoc tags work in objective-c and swift although in swift the format is a little different

25007949
google-chrome	firefox
again this code only fires once in google-chrome and not at all in ie an firefox

25007953
int	chars
so number chars embedded within it cannot be processed as a primitive int

25007962
iboutlet	ibaction
i think you will find that is true because they are pointers to the same button because it sounds like you ctrl+dragged to create an iboutlet uibutton then you dragged and dropped to create a ibaction buttonclicked which passes sender

25007980
google-chrome	firefox
as you have mentioned that you intent to repeat the patterns images but not for the larger images i suggest you to use the following approach which i have tested in both firefox and ie and google-chrome

awt	swing
quoting from painting in awt and swing

25008067
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
for addition and subtraction your results would be off by 48 but this would make multiplication and division really exciting

th way it is done usually is you open a filestream read data in from tcpclient and write the number of bytes read from networkstream to filestream

25008081
post	get
most of the languages have specific methods to extract data from the post or get

25008081

post	get
suppose a page gets data using post but some user goes to the page directly and feeds some get data in the url

25008090
int	double
to store a 12-digit int you need to use either a long long up to 18 digits or perhaps a double up to 15-16 digits though a double is less desirable

25008170
mdpi	hdpi
i used the following to download and an image from server and tried to set to an imageview for mdpi device the image size is fine for ldpi it is larger and for hdpi and xhdpi it is smaller

width	height
since the bodies position is in the center of it but the position of the sprite is at the bottom left corner you need to apply an offset of width 2 and height 2 to the sprite

alternatively if you do not want to use ide you can also use the developer tool panel in google-chrome or firebug plugin in firefox to get the xpath

it can be a bother to remember to put in variable commands in every procedure that needs them and it s easy to get obscure bugs when you forget but on the whole it s a sound design choice i think

apache	nginx
so the web server like apache or nginx sends environment information and the page request itself to a fastcgi process over a socket and responses are returned by fastcgi to the web server over the same connection and the web server subsequently delivers that response to the end-user

25009461
gmail	hotmail	gmail	outlook.com	hotmail	outlook.com
mail providers like gmail and outlook.com formerly known as hotmail will most likely use sender policy framework spf and domainkeys identified mail dkim to determine if a message is spam by ensuring that the sender is the legitimate owner of the domain name used to send from

25009461
gmail	outlook.com
exactly how gmail and outlook.com filters spam is not well known but setting up either spf or dkim or both should help to avoid getting your mail flagged

25009461

to ensure that your mail is not flagged as spam you will have to configure your dns records to provide correct spf and dkim information

post	get
note i asked this a while ago and it didn t get any answers but it did make me create an interesting fiddle which is at the end of the post

25009508
google-chrome	firefox
earlier today i was reading up on what new es6 stuff i can use in firefox and google-chrome

25009508
ceil	floor
in fact if you look at the fiddle i made and uncomment certain test functions you can emulate both ceil and trunc through floor if you don t care about -0

25009508
ceil	floor
i ran a silly jsperf that showed that emulating ceil through floor was just as fast and emulating trunc through floor actually was 10 times faster than trunc itself

25009508
ceil	floor
then i fixed it to check for all types of input and it now seems on firefox that i get exactly what should be expected emulating trunc and ceil through floor gives the same performance as calling them directly

25009508
ceil	floor
if you don t care about those and especially if you know all your numbers are floating point you can get many times the performance of ceil out of floor by simply doing math.floor n+1

25009508
google-chrome	firefox
firefox absolutely destroys google-chrome on these kinds of operations dat asm.js optimization but the results are unclear to me

width	height
if your image s width is larger than its height then mark s solution will leave space at the top and bottom of the screen

25009636
width	height
the below fixes this by first comparing the width and height if the image width height then it will scale the height to match the screen height and then scale the width to preserve the aspect ratio

25009636
width	height
similarly if the image height width then it will scale the width to match the screen width and then scale the height to preserve the aspect ratio

25009636
width	height
both dimensions width and height of the image will be equal to or

25009636
portrait	landscape
this solution automatically works in either portrait or landscape mode

25009640
hide	show
i implemented the functionality like - show the product list on hover in and hide it when hover out - which is working fine

25009711
ssl	https
you should have separate server blocks for the normal http connections on port 80 and the https ssl connections on port 443

25009711
ssl	https
if you want all files on your site to use https connections ssl port 443 except those files inside the unsafe directory this is what your server blocks should look like

25009712

free	malloc
i thought one would only need to call free once because only one malloc occurs

25010881
free	strdup	free	malloc	strdup	malloc
you ll then use gc_malloc and or gc_malloc_atomic instead of malloc and gc_strdup instead of strdup and you won t bother about free you might sometimes use gc_free if wanted

25010881
strdup	malloc
you ll see that √¢ strdup is calling malloc ..

25010881
free	malloc
fyi on linux malloc is implemented using mmap 2 -and sometimes the old sbrk 2 - syscalls -to get large memory regions of several kilobytes or even megabytes and free may sometimes call munmap 2 -for these large regions- but most often it justs mark a free block as reusable so that block could be reused in some future calls to malloc

25010881
free	malloc
hence a program doing malloc and free might not release all it previously used memory to the kernel

ant	maven
ant was bad enough but maven combines all the worst features of ant and ivy

25012089
maven	m2e
with maven you either force developers to use a tool not suited to anybody but build engineers the magnitudes longer it takes to build even using m2e is sufficient for that case to be made or you live with the possibility that the server build doesn t work quite like the workstation build which is still true if you go through all the hassle of integrating the two using the plethora of m2e plugins

25012089
maven	m2e
on every maven based project i ve worked on i ve seen transient hudson jenkins errors that don t show up in eclipse unless you have absolutely every possible m2e plugin installed and correctly configured and most developers never do

25012089
ant	maven
if we got rid of maven very difficult now due to the amount of code but possible and used the bndtools eclipse plugin we could simply export the eclipse build as an ant or gradle headless build note the osgi developers who write bnd and bndtools don t support maven and for good reason the maven plugin is written by the felix developers who themselves use netbeans and maven and no live environment other than at the end of the deploy cycle where both tools set up the same environment as eclipse without the gui objects that are only meant for developers anyway

25012089
maven	m2e
this would easily save 2-3 hours per day per developer currently spent watching slow maven or m2e builds and free up the config build engineer to do more testing of the app on the deployment hosts

so the app goes to landscape but the view from the scanner is still portrait thus making the view look sideways

25023678
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari the logo properly lays on top of the carousel

25023695
swift	objective-c
assuming that your objective-c code works the relevant swift code would look something like

25023730
google-chrome	safari
my guess is that your google-chrome safari issues are unrelated to tweenlite tweenmax but i didn t have time to do a full analysis of your link

25023833
subtract	add
the trick is that vector iterators are randomaccessiterator so you can add and subtract indices to them

25023896
post	get
then the real trick was to check if the route fired from app.js was a post or a get

25023922
post	put
i started to mess with tilemill and saw a post saying it is possible to put the numbers inside of the markers scroll to text labels section it is exactly what i am trying to do

25023989
int	double
1 365 is 0 it s almost 0 but then becomes 0 because you are dealing with int inputs therefore you only get the int result then casted to a double it s still 0 and anything 0 1

25023998
inherited	properties
i also have tried inherited but without much success the child controller doesn t recognise the properties loading view of the parent view controller

25024009
folder	directory
it says the plugin is installing and when i go to look in my workspace on my computer there is a folder titled plugins and inside a directory called

25024016
spock	grails
i use the remotecontrol in a spock test and i already executed grails refreshdependencies but i still get the error

25024098
for-loop	loops
that being said your comprehension option is almost certainly going to be faster than the for-loop option because implicit loops are generally faster than explicit ones

25024132
post	put
obviously post and also put is missing

25024172
gif	png	tiff	png

25024197
google-chrome	firefox
ie and google-chrome were configured properly and firefox was not

25024284
hide	show
if you are using a normal uiviewcontroller it s even easier than that just hide the tableview and show another uiview

25024289
int	chars
where i m running into an issue is translating from the original data sent as a string currently i m manipulating a chars array into int for multiplication

25024316
put	get
the project also runs put life that will make a requisition only get 404 as the answer

25024370

the form still fails to submit its contained values during an auto-postback submit and correctly submission all values during a regular submit

25024404
google-chrome	firefox
this identical but static css is applied to the span with class works which works in google-chrome but not firefox

25024450
min	max	minimum	max
1 let s assume that the tree is rooted and there are two fixed values min and max - minimum and maximum allowed size of one component

25024450
min	max
2 then one can use dynamic programming to check if there is a partition such that each component size is between min and max

25024450
children	parent
what this pseudo code does is combining all possible states of node s children to compute all reachable states for this node the first bunch of for loops and then produces the rest of reachable states by cutting the edge between this node and its parent the second bunch of for loops the state means node cuts_count current_count tuple

25024450
min	max
7 the space complexity of this algorithm for fixed min and max is n is the number of nodes time complexity is

25024450
min	max
8 one can simply try all possible min and max values and choose the best but it can be done faster

25024450
min	max
the key observation is that if there is a solution for min and max there is always a solution for min and max + 1

25024450
min	max
thus one can iterate over all possible values of min n k different values and apply binary search to find the smallest max which gives a valid solution log n iterations

25024450
min	max
however if you want to maximize min not to minimize the difference between max and min you can simply use this algorithm and ignore max value everywhere by setting its value to n

25024450
min	max
then no binary search over max would be required but one would be able to binary search over min instead and obtain an solution

25024498
pop-up	dialog
i can even get a modal dialog to pop-up and sort of function

25024502
children	parent
setting .paused true on children nodes in sprite kit produces some odd behavior in my experience at least in ios 7 because when a parent node has its .paused set to false it sets all of its child nodes .paused to false etc

25024513
hash	salt
still that leaves the wide field of information-disclosure vulnerability if you encrypted passwords instead of hashing them with a strong hash algorithm + salt birthday dates credit card fraud email addresses - spammers lov em

25024535
floating-point	integer
floating-point division is typically faster than integer division on the cpu

25024584
min	max
this function creates a max heap but i have no idea how to make it a min

25024631
ampl	opl
for simplicity i will use excel s solver add-in to solve the problem but any configuration of a modeling language such as aimms ampl lingo opl mosel and numerous others with a solver cplex gurobi glpk cbc and numerous others can be used

25024682
repo	egit
the more likely scenario is that you cloned your repo locally and used egit to create a new branch which is a great habit kudos for doing that if you are new to git

25024698
google-chrome	firefox
for that side of things probably the easiest way is to use google-chrome firefox debugger tools

25024698
google-chrome	firefox
idea will automatically install a google-chrome or firefox plug-in to facilitate

25024709
draggable	droppable
try to drag the draggable box into droppable 2 area

25024713

instead of extends thread implements runnable instead

25024878
width	height
you need a link that calls a js function that sets your width and height

25024909
superclass	subclassing
what you should be doing is letting the superclass execute the method with the same editing state as the subclassing and pull the logic for what state to set to the button press event

25024910
submit	submission
complication arises when we have linked use cases lets say due to business logic when customer submit forma we need to redirect them to formb upon submission of formb we need to take them back to forma

25024911
mouseleave	mouseenter
i also had to add a bind to the mouseenter and mouseleave events to toggle the class when those events occure and also keep the code small compact and clean

25024936
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox ie10 and google-chrome

25024965

children	parent
in my case i have the children ids and i need to do the inverse create the tree from the children to their parent

25025038
many-to-many	many-to-one
to be 100 clear regarding foochild the relationship is many-to-many but because of the metadata it contains many-to-one relationship definitions

25025038
postgresql	mysql
in case of post insert id generation such as mysql auto-increment or postgresql serial this means you have to call entitymanager#flush between both persist operations

25025043
floating-point	integer
even though 10.4 is a floating-point literal because swift already implicitly typed foo as an integer it treats the 10.4 literal as an integer as well and happily adds them together

25025154
int	chars	spaces	delimiter
given your input examples if your int are positive values and less than three digits long between 0 and 99 then you could perhaps save some spaces by reducing your int to a chars stream split by delimiter

25025159
respond.js	modernizr
i simply want a source it can either be a book videos or w e that will start from scratch and if possible will use html5 modernizr and respond.js to make it cross-browser supported and actually give me a start point base folder just like h5bp which i can then later on start building my own websites

25025167
prepare	execute
i know or think i know that using things like prepare statements can help future executions of the same query execute faster

25025193

just make sure your border radius is at least half of your width height

25025212
udp	tcp
also udp or tcp hole punching is an entirely different thing and uses guess what a central server

25025425
int	chars
if all your int are small it might make sense to store all 5 values in a more appropriate type a chars which will use less space than an int

25025444
prepare	execute
this will spawn a subshell change the working directory to the cordova project execute the cordova prepare command then close

25025444
prepare	execute
the prepare file which eventually gets execute is based on the platform arguments and is downloaded off of your node_modules folder

for example from netlogo i would like to rapidly retrieve the distance between the polygons a and polygons 3 412 in the file .txt

25025497
mouseover	mouseout
if you apply your transition to hover the transition will only happen on mouseover and not on mouseout

25025497
mouseover	mouseout
applying the transition to the element rather than its hover will make the transition happen on both mouseover and mouseout

25025505
implements	extends
i guess all your needs in it if there is something you need is not implements feel free to and extends and write your own

25025513
plot	heatmap
unlike typical heatmap i want to plot that in a graph that looks like that

25025550

for-loop	arrays
i believe using a for-loop to do this is necessary but can t figure out how to access each post arrays value

25025644
mouseover	mouseout
it only changes to the correct list item on mouseout instead of mouseover

25025652

25025898
super	implements	super	extends	implements	extends
that being said if you create a custom itemreader that extends abstractpagingitemreader the paging logic itself should be taken care of for you you implements the doreadpage method that handles getting a page of data the super class handles keeping track of what page you re on etc

25025914
aggregate-functions	sum
btw sum is a poor choice for a parameter name given that it s a commonly used built-in aggregate-functions

25025920
mouse	keyboard
shows how to detect when a cd or dvd is inserted or not even if i found out the wm_devicechange for the mouse keyboard and monitor.

if the selection size is a power of 2 like selection height and width are suppose 128 it does the fft on it

25025927
width	height
this is my code it checks the size of image width height and then gets the pixels

25026026
chown	chmod
there are at least two solutions to this problem both involve using chmod and chown

25026026
chown	chmod
after your original command runs run chmod and chown to change the permissions as you want

25026026
chown	chmod
instead of using a shell script you could append a semicolon to the command your cronjob runs and then add chmod and chown

25026036
put	get	post	get	post	put
in general you should use the get post put patch and delete methods to constrain a route to a particular verb

25026036
post	get
routing both get and post requests to a single action has security implications

25026124
typedef	struct

post	get
the post and get are on completely different requests

25026151
google-chrome	firefox
the answer i came up with was to use firefox instead of google-chrome changing the security policy as detailed in

25026151
google-chrome	firefox
what gman stated is true using the google-chrome flag and changing firefox s security policy does create a big security risk

25026163

you can store the selected element on onpause and then select it in onresume or you can use the much simpler solution don t allow android to destroy your activity when the device rotates

25027139
portrait	landscape
so if you have a different layout for portrait mode and landscape mode you will have to change it yourself but i would suggest just not to use this method even if it is easier for apps with only one layout type

25027162
rpyc	pyro
even an architecture based on pyro rpyc will help

25027294
post	get
you can launch a get request before you do the post and retrieve the sessions csrf token

build.gradle	gradlew
you could try using gradlew simply add this line to your dependencies in build.gradle compile org.lucasr.twowayview twowayview 0.1.1

25027354
int	chars
in c a chars constant like a does not have type chars but rather type int

25027354
int	chars
this creates the possibility that even on a system where chars is only 8 bits wide and so int is wider than chars chars constant notations can exist which provide int values wider than chars

25027354
int	chars
why your compiler allows only two chars is likely because the type int is only 16 bits wide

25027354
int	chars
int is 32 bits wide and this program prints 41424344 which by golly is hexadecimal for the ascii chars abcd

25027382
folder	directory
for me the use standard system header directory searching was already set to yes however i ticked it to no then back to yes and did both a clean and a clean build folder product - clean and alt product - clean build folder which seemed to have solved the issue for me

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the animation works perfectly well in google-chrome and firefox however in safari the svg elements don t display whatsoever

25027445
ppp	dhcp
each router conversation goes over a physical transport of some kind isdn ethernet ppp - in tcp ip the task of creating packets and transmitting the appropriate bit stream is regarded as a single subnetwork layer but this is ultimately split into two when differentiation is required between the osi physical layer layer 1 and the data link layer layer 2 for protocols like dhcp

25027445
udp	tcp
when tcp and udp were designed the designers imagined that each server would listen on a specific port

25027445
udp	tcp
however the server side works the fact remains that there has to be some way for the network layer to decide which tcp connection or udp listener to deliver a specific packet to

25027445
udp	tcp
similarly for the transport layer i ll just consider tcp here since it s connection-oriented - udp is similar but doesn t mind losing packets

25027445
udp	tcp
the transport protocol is included to ensure that tcp and udp traffic don t get mixed up

25027445
udp	tcp
the tcp udp constraints on uniqueness of ephemeral ports guarantee that any server can only receive one connection from a specific combination of ip address port number and it s that that allows connections from the same machine to be demultiplexed into separate streams corresponding to the different origins

25027451
google-chrome	safari
7. cleared browser cache and tried in google-chrome and safari

cos	sin
by using unscaled sin and cos you re implicitly assuming that the length of the vector is 1 and decomposing it into its vertical and horizontal components

25039768
getter	setter
secondly you need to have getter and setter in both sourceclass and destinationclass because dozer relies on them regardless if the variables are public or private

25039773
getter	setter
because you are explicitly annotating the private member with xmlelement you are actually getting output from both the private member and the public getter setter methods

25039781

use indexing-with-brackets syntax for maps and lists instead of get or put

25039807

tcp guarantees a reliable transmission while udp is just fire-and-forget

25039930

therefore any attempt to simulate udp with tcp must fail when you are trying send while no one is listening

25039930
udp	tcp
obviously it s not very difficult to write a program that listens on udp and resends any data it receives to a peer over tcp

25039930
udp	tcp
or likewise a program that listens on tcp and resends what it gets by udp

25039935
onresume	onpause

25039953
background-image	background-color
gecko has a weird bug where setting the background-color for the html selector will cover up the background-image of the body element even though the body element in effect has a greater z-index and you should be able to see the body s background-image along with the html background-color based purely on simple logic

25040005
put	get	post	get	post	put
execute request get put del post etc.

25040005
hash	salt
long story short i keep a salt and hash version of the user tokens which are unique to the user and the server tokens which is the same for every user on the server and the de-salting and de-hashing is done on the back end

25040031
versioning	upgrade	vmware	virtualbox
after searching for this error on the web i already upgrade to the latest versioning of vmware 6.0.3 on windows 8.1 and virtualbox 4.3.14 on ubuntu 14.04.1 inside vmware and i reduced the number of cpus in the vagrant virtualbox machine to 1 but the error still occurs sometimes after an hour or so and only when running the vagrant virtualbox inside the vmware

25041479
for-loop	loops
as pointed out by others you can also combine a for-each loops with an additional index variable but to me it doesn√¢ t look convincing as the index variable has the wrong scope you have to declare it outside loops and it√¢ s not really simpler than the traditional for-loop

hyperthreading is enabled by the fact that all modern jvms use native threads thus this is a os cpu config setting

25041673
cpu	hyperthreading
the os believes that because the os has been told to schedule threads as though it was an 8 core cpu this made adding support of hyperthreading to oses much simpler

25041673
cpu	hyperthreading
the os carries on managing threads as before oblivious to much of the inner workings of hyperthreading and lets the cpu manage the low level scheduling of the assembly as and when parts of the cpu become available

25047474
width	height
then to perform a good responsive procedure width and height should be both resizable according to the current screen size

free	calloc
it takes extra time because new or calloc are much more complex than the allocation on the stack in typical machines allocating space on the stack takes 1-2 instructions above and beyond the same function with no variables at all where a call to new or can be half a dozen just for the call and the same again for delete or free and several dozen to a few thousand instructions inside those library functions - how long the code is depends largely on how it is implemented and whether the runtime has some memory available or a call into the os is required to get some more memory as well

width	height
when you override the height to fit everything on the screen this may not be a great idea to begin with the width is still matching the parent and doesn t get adjusted

25054510
children	parent
not quite sure what you are looking for but if parent-child hierachies are sufficient if you do not need the hierachy between the children you could record your relations as transactions with the parent identifier as transaction id and the children as products

25054510
children	parent
the behaviour content drilldown report would allow you to quickly examine any parent for the children you re looking for

of course that would force you to create getter and setter for every property you want to watch and forget about events on deleting and adding new properties

25055709

within an entitymanager breeze caches all entities by their keys so you will never have duplicates of the same entity

25055938
children	parent
breeze also fixes up any references for children or parent that are queried independently this depends on having correct metadata about the foreign key property of the dependent objects so regardless of how you queried the phones there will only ever be one instance of each phone and that instance will be automatically hooked up to its parent personnel entity

25055954
nexus	artifactory
downside is what if your deployment depends upon fetching the new artifact from artifactory nexus somewhere in deploy script s logic then you can t have that working until you copy artifacts from one job to another child job

25055954
maven	pom.xml
apart from that maven deploy goal requires valid settings in either settings.xml or pom.xml where the you specify for each of the above sections which are defined under section must match with the value of section defined in setting.xml pom.xml

25055954

however i ve also encountered a permutation during local debugging for visual studio in which the error had to be resolved by setting permissions on a folder somewhere under the c users username directory

25061791
int	chars
i think it cannot unroll the for-loop because of the cast from chars to unsigned int

25061791
for-loop	loops
if you first declare an additional local pointer to cast your data pointer before loops so that there isn t any cast in loops the compiler should be able to optimize the for-loop

25062322
octal	decimal
if the integer constant is given in octal or decimal way it s only a syntactical fact

25062322
octal	decimal
so in any case the information about the radix in the source program octal decimal hexadecimal is not stored anywhere hence it s not possible to know anything about it in the execution environment

25062355
getter	setter
i m assuming and your edit confirms it you mean private fields with no public access without getter since in general all properties should always be private and only accessed by setter and getter

25062414
getter	setter
if you are writing the class yourself the users can still get and set the fields using getter and setter methods you might add

25062414
getter	setter
make sure the fields are secure if you add getter and setter methods though

25062414
getter	setter
if you are not writing getter and setter methods it can be difficult for users to identify why objects are not equal based on the values of all the public fields

25062514

when i put application in foreground and i get this wllocationservicesconfiguration as nil

25063260

you have smartly set your height variable to be based on your width and aspect ratio but to take advantage of this you ll need to use these values when setting the dimensions of your svg as well as the viewbox

25063263

when looking at counters for processors i m not able to make connection to cpu utilization that can be observed in task manager

25066130
for-loop	loops
for an example of a basic for-loop just do as so will loops 10 times x 0-9

25066209
getter	setter
the example you state above is confusing to you because by creating getter and setter on the same private variable you are in essence exposing your class which is a no-no for good oo programming

25066231
ng-show	ng-hide
ng-show ng-hide will simply use css display none to remove to

25066231

if you simply need to show hide or remove dom nodes then angular has already done this for you - use their out of the box solution

25066236
nsstring	nsobject
i start w a subclass of nsobject fplairport with nsstring property airportid

25066253

25066347
for-loop	loops
i was also told that there is a way to do this without the use of loops as i originally had a for-loop

25066375
getter	setter
normally these methods are referred as getter and setter

25066375
getter	setter
therefore any class that wants to access the variables should access them through these getter and setter

25066393
put	get
i get a count of 1 all three variables you put into are cast as a single array to args

25066437
width	height
as you can see the width and height are correct but the origin needs to be shifted

pdfbox	docx4j
i am attempting to print word documents generated using docx4j that i convert to pdf and print using pdfbox

25066518

25066857
post	get
i need to get the response of the http post request i make

25066891
getter	setter
then your getter and setter return and set values into and out of the hashmap and when it is time to convert it to a map voila

25066891
getter	setter
with a little bit of aop wizardry you could even maintain the inflexibility inherent in a bean by allowing you to still use getter and setter specific to each values name without having to actually write the individual getter and setter

25066941
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in the latest versions of google-chrome firefox and safari

nsubstitute	moq
using dependency injection e.g autofac this is much easier to assemble than before and with mocking tools nsubstitute moq this is much easier to do than you think

25067295
children	parent
if i never use transactions is there still overhead for concurrent writes to different children of the same parent

25067298
children	parent
i have three domain objects one parent object with two children

25067298
children	parent
the parent object has a many to one relationship with both children and therefore both children have a collection of parent objects while the parent has references to both children objects

25067298
children	parent
i am using hibernate with jpa annotations to persist this setup to the database but when the collection of parent in any of the children is a list i get a stack overflow error when trying to fetch the parent the children in the parent are both marked as fetchtype.eager

25067298
children	parent
when i change the fetching to fetchtype.lazy fetching the parent works fine but fetching any of the children alone still causes a stack overflow error because seeing from the sql hibernate still tries to get the parent even though the parent s collection in the children is marked as lazy fetch

25067298
children	parent
in the ordinary usage of this parent it always needs to have its children fetched so their mappings are marked as in the parent object

25067298
children	parent
i have tried disabling eager fetch for each of the children in turns but that only removes the error when fetching the parent but fetching any of the children still causes the so error

25067298
children	parent
the only solution i have so far is to change the type of the parent collection in both children from list to set

25067298
children	parent
how can i have a list of parent objects in the children and still eager fetch the children from the parent object

25067346
for-loop	arrays
im parsing a json object and storing the values i want in an arrays i then push each arrays into a second arrays inside the for-loop to create an arrays where each element in a2 is a1

25067346

25067664
verilog	hdl
again verilog is an hdl not a programming language so don t just run into a tutorial as a way to learn the syntax

25067664
rtl	hdl
you need to approach it in a completely new way starting from basic logic and rtl design on paper then translating that design into hdl code

25067664
rtl	hdl
the code above and your use of a flow chart indicate that you have a strong programming background but in hdl you need to be able to think in terms of an rtl or circuit diagram instead

25067694

i believe line 3 is correct seeing as your php script is in the root folder however if you move it to another directory you will have to update the line 3 of the code above

25068208
width	height
turns out the problem was that the .employee class had height and width of 0

25068208
width	height
as soon as i adjusted the class to the appropriate width and height the float and inline-block functions worked as expected

25068341
google-chrome	firefox
i tested downloading it using google-chrome and firefox same result see screenshot

25068386
post	put
the other way would be to keep a separate table which has post 1 post 2 and distance between post but that would make any new put or update a very long task because you d need to compute distance for everything other point and then write them..

25068411
nexus	artifactory
you also as khmarbaise said shouldn t be using a file path for the repository but instead a web path to a repository manager such as nexus or artifactory if you do want to deploy don t use the local filesystem for this

listview	gridview	listview	flipview
you get all the list controls that use a scrollviewer and pan and virtualize nicely like a listview gridview or flipview

25068523
mouse	keyboard
lots of powerful controls in the platform and 3rd party libraries that might not necessarily work great with touch but are very powerful for mouse and keyboard

25068594

post	put
one more clue for everyone if i change the http.post to http.get and just put access_token in params and include no other parameters in params or in data the call succeeds and i see past post i have made on this page through the graph explorer only the ones with published true though so the access token and endpoint do work just something is faulty about post-ing instead of get-ing and the specific parameters i m using

width	height
what i m interested in is to have a fixed height and width for the columns

25069952
cpython	pypy
you could probably micro-optimize that down to 250ms or so√¢ but it s hard to imagine a case where you d need that but wouldn t benefit from running it in pypy instead of cpython or writing it in cpython or c or numpy-izing it or getting a faster computer or parallelizing it

25069977
width	height
i can do this with width height etc but i am not sure how to do this when simply dealing with a string

25070022

adding a uipangesturerecognizer and a uiswipegesturerecognizer to same view causes conflicts after setting requiregesturetofail

25086477
width	height
and to make things even more entertaining the width and height are writable

25086477
width	height
so to move a rectangle you need to offset and change width and height when you could just change the tlrb values accordingly

25086478

int literal 9.9 has type double while other operands have type float

25087104
post	get
ideally you should split the get and post into separate files

25087111
interpolation	splines
the function can be interpolation using a cubic splines with scipy.interpolate.rectbivariatespline

25087115
min	max
that means in all likelihood your windows build is probably using the #define macro and not s min max as you think it is

25087115
min	max
if you use std min or std max explicitly this will avoid the macro expansion as would and

25087119
implements	extends
the name of an interface to implements or a class to extends

google-chrome	firefox
however when viewed in firefox ie8 or google-chrome the √£∆í√• part of the text actually displays as a u with 2 dots above it

25087197
width	height
width and height are also writeable

25087197
width	height
if you stick to top y left x + width + height you can alter an existing rectangle system.drawing rectangle i guess without any problems

25087238
folder	directory
first create folder named third_party in the root directory of the project

25087238
build.gradle	gradlew

25087257
junit	testng
i m in the process of migrating a test framework from junit to testng

25087257
junit	testng
unfortunately testng does not appear to handle the failing twice approach that we were using in junit

25087270
folder	directory
for that to work you need to have init .py under project_dir dira and dirb and then you need to set as a source folder the directory which is the parent of the project_dir and not the project_dir itself -- and no other directory should be set as source folder

25087270
folder	directory
i.e. the source folder is the directory added to the pythonpath so for importing project_dir its parent must be in the pythonpath

25087287

25087357
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have a put and post method in controller that when they work they would normally redirect to the get method

25087357
put	get	post	get	post	put
since my put post and get all return ihttpactonresult i don t see why i should use the redirect if the call is within my one controller and the security rights are the same

25087408
stdout	stderr
this class can be used for anything not just boost to capture stdout stderr on a line-by-line basis and calling a user function could be a lambda to process it

25087408
stdout	stderr
warning if you redirect stderr and stdout and are using boost then redirect stderr first then stdout

25087408
stdout	stderr
otherwise boost will write loopback the stderr message back to stdout and you ll get a boost log entry inside another boost log entry

25087414
auto-generate	edmx
i did one test project with a similar vemp entitye and an appuser entity using the auto-generate edmx and that seemed to work after i manually made the association

mouseover	mouseout
making a window with a div and using mouseover - mouseout has the known issue if there is a child div inside it will fire mouseout

25087450
mouseleave	mouseenter
this were recently solved by mouseenter and mouseleave because doesn t fire unless the mouse point go out the root div the real window

25087450
mouseover	mouseout
i think it might be possible to use event bubbling handling with mouseover and mouseout to produce the desired effect

25087459
put	get
note that to get it compatible back to gingerbread you ll need to put some sdk version checks around the animations and transparency calls in his code.

25087537
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome firefox and ie it flashes the first time you go back in ie

25087569
touchesmoved	touchesended
another possible solution is to implement touchesmoved or touchesended etc. in the view controller that holds your map view like so

25087571
email	dkim
from the limited amount of information you ve provided my guess would be that your email is undeliverable because your domain lacks sender policy framework records or one of the other major authentication standards like dkim senderid and domain keys or because the ip domain you re testing delivery from was formerly occupied by a spammer and has been blacklisted which happens

25087591
post	get
instead after successfully processing the post request you should return a redirect to the order page which my browser will fetch with a get

25087592
rsa	aes
to encrypt more data you could use a larger rsa key but rsa really shouldn t be used for encrypting large amounts of data so is usually used as part of a hybrid cryptosystem where rsa is instead used to encrypt a randomly generated key for a symmetric algorithm like aes and then the symmetric algorithm is used to encrypt the actual data so avoiding the length limits associated with rsa

25087612
super	self
you should not pass self to super ... .__init__ as super ... .__init__ returns the bound method

the height is calculated by taking the width in inches multiplying by the ratio 70 then doubling that number before adding the size of the rim 17

25087713
next	except
so you have an object holding lockfree double-linked list of snapshots the topmost snapshot being your current state each holding references to the next and the the previous state except for those at the head and the tail of the list

25087749
mouseover	mouseout
add an invisible div as child with display none when the mouseover is triggered display the the invisible div trigger mouseout with the invisible div

25087772
nsdata	nsoutputstream
thus for example you could do an extension of nsoutputstream that writes the contents of a nsdata

25087785
jar	war
just copy your library and drop it inside tomcat_install lib folder where tomcat_install is the folder where your tomcat is installed so the library will be available for every project war jar etc that runs in your tomcat installation

25087834
sorting	filtering
this directive preserves the user experience - any footable sorting filtering or pagination stays remains in place - while loading data seamlessly whenever it is updated

rpm	yum
don t know if i should build central rpm repo and then run chef to download rpm repo locally and then run yum update that is io intensive and very slow or

25087848
wildfly	jboss
instead use jboss wildfly or tomee which are built on top of tomcat

25087870

uilabel	uibutton
so i have a main view that is a uiscrollview and i add all of my elements uibutton uitextfields uilabel etc

25088055
postgresql	mysql
the naive solution would be to use mysql or postgresql and create a table like this

25088075
qtabwidget	qscrollarea
it s the background of the qscrollarea which is probably uses the same as the qtabwidget on my linux installation so that i didn t see it

25088084
google-chrome	firefox
for some reason i don t get the error in google-chrome and firefox

25088133
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
i could set each div to width 20 box-sizing border-box and padding 0 20px but then there would be a 20px gap between the edge of the lines and the edge of the first and last div

25088133
box-sizing	border-box
i could set up each div to box-sizing border-box

25088133
box-sizing	border-box
i could set the first four div s of each row to box-sizing border-box

25088139
move	drag
you can achieve a similar effect by having an absolute div with same image with less opacity and less z-index and it would move around with your image as you move it using start stop and drag functions

25088166
post	get
this is an old question but i wanted to post what i have done to get it working

25088191
width	margin
make the whole width 100 and put your table inside with margin 0 auto

25088225
xlsx	xlsm
i have some code in vb that saves all xlsm files as xlsx

25088255
width	height
width and height don t have real values until after size is called

25088255
put	get
just because you ve put the variables after the function does not mean they get assigned after setup runs all global variables are assigned before any functions are run

25088255
width	height
so in this case you end up with a width and height of 0 which will draw absolutely nothing because there are no pixels to color

25088255
width	height
that said we don t even need rows and cols here we can just use width and height directly and we don t need two loops we just need one since we re not using not-yet-set neighbouring pixels when we draw the rectangles

25088257
children	parent
the veiw that i am trying to add this info to is the parent category which has no products in it except for the children category products

25088338

it s in swift but since its basically c you can use the same thing in objective-c as well

25088668
superclass	subclassing
and is it possible to not have to instantiate the superclass version as i just want it for subclassing

25088706
hide	show
from my research i have found that in order to implement this i will need to change each of the forms i have created i foolishly made a form for each of them to a usercontrol object and then show or hide the controls appropriately off of the main form

25088706
hide	show
my issues come when i try to develop the logic to show hide the the usercontrols off of the main introductory page

25088706
hide	show
i have also found results that say i should simply be able to show hide the forms using the logic on my buttons on the main page

25088741
stdout	stderr
i gave an solution using c++ to redirect stdout and stderr to a function called for each line

25088759

content-length	content-type
path content-length 560 connection close content-type text xml

25088787
superclass	subclassing	inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
stored properties can not be override or better to say redeclare in subclass.they can be inherited.there is no meaning to re-declare a properties in subclassing because it is already present in your superclass through inherited

25088787
getter	setter
however you can override the getter and setter of a propeties in subclasses to provide extra validations or functinalities.refer swift guide to override getter setter

25088787
superclass	subclassing
as also there is no meaning if you are connecting your property in one of subclassing superclass may have other and you are not providing this implementation to other subclassing of your superclass

25088787
superclass	subclassing
edit you can also set label outlet to two different viewcontrollers of your superclass from story board if you give subclassing names in storyboard to different view controllers

25088795
width	height
basically you want to nest bar inside another relativelayout positioned above foo with height and width equal to match parent

25088801
realloc	malloc
in c and also in c++ i ve got malloc and realloc that are doing that

25088803
width	height
obviously it is portrait oriented 720 is width and 1280 is height note that probably the encoded frames are still 1280 width and 720 height but the video has a special rotation flag so that a compliant decoder will show the output at correct orientation

25088803
width	height
406 is height 720 is width

25088818
jobs	cron
i ve read about cron jobs but i don t really know how to apply it in my web application

25088841
circleci	jenkins
use a continuous integration service like circleci travis or your own setup jenkins

25088841
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
at this point you can create an new version on elastic beanstalk using the amazon-web-services commandline and the zip file created from this version

25088865
switching	screens
my current thinking is to add a mobile.shtml page to each directory and switching based on a simple screens width test

25088938
integer	unsigned
an implementation written for this cpu may have something like typedef __uint8_as_9 uint8_t assuming __uint8_as_9 refers to a compiler keyword indicating a 9-bit unsigned integer which represents an 8-bit unsigned integer

25088985
realloc	malloc
in c and also in c++ i ve got malloc and realloc that are doing that

25088985
realloc	malloc
malloc and realloc take the number of bytes to allocate instead of the type you want to allocate and also don t call any constructors again they only know about the size to allocate

25088989
folder	directory
if you then map someproject to a local folder you should then be able to go to that folder through the command line and run the svn log -r4152 4272 command from that directory and its subdirectories

if you need the ability to easily insert and delete rows then you can use an nsmutableset instead of an nsindexset - just store the data source object

25089260
hide	show
i ve always used the code below to show or hide banners starting from a certain date

25089260

int	chars	int	double
remember that in this example a double is 8 bytes an int is 4 bytes and a chars is 1 byte

25095259
int	chars	int	double
the layout of each struct will be as follows where i represents one byte of the int c the chars and d one byte of the double

25095259
int	double
in the first layout the double member must be aligned on an 8-byte boundary so you get four bytes of padding after the int member

25095259
int	double
it can be packed immediately after the int leaving only three bytes of padding before the double

25095259
int	double
in the third layout the double starts the struct and the int which has 4-byte alignment can follow it immediately since 8 is a multiple of 4

25095259
int	chars
the chars one-byte alignment can follow the int but again the whole struct needs to align on 8-byte boundaries so there are 3 bytes of padding after the chars field

25102329
inherited	subclassing
when a class extends another class the subclassing automatically inherited any visible variables variables that are not marked private or have no access modifier

25102334

strtol	atoi
use strtol inplace of atoi as it returns error value in case of conversion failures

25102606
cpython	ironpython
mixing native and cygwin pythons cpython and ironpython or occasionally even two builds compiled with different flags or two different x.y versions can also cause this but 32-bit and 64-bit are the most common reason

25102616
integer	unsigned
then unpacks it into an unsigned 32 bit integer

25102619
imperative	declarative
it s longer than the keyfunc approach and uses imperative style when declarative style would do nicely

printf	strcpy
also i cant figure out how to write in that location without using any user space function like strcpy printf etc

25102643
stdout	stderr
note this uses fabric because i m too lazy and or don t have the time to work out how to wire up stdin stdout stderr to the terminal properly but you could spend the time and use straight subprocess.popen

int	chars
the final bit-pattern is given type int and is therefore signed regardless of whether single chars are signed or not a slight change from versions 3.1 and earlier of gcc

25102707
int	chars
if there are more chars in the constant than would fit in the target int the compiler issues a warning and the excess leading chars are ignored

25102707
int	chars
hence √£ has the value 0xc3a9 which fits into an int at least for 32-bit int but not into an 8-bit chars so the conversion to chars is again implementation-defined

25102770
int	chars
the third problem is that you declare count as an int instead of a chars so cin will try to parse the user input as an int instead of a chars when you write

25102798
for-loop	loops
the javascript engine can not parse your for-loop and then it encounters the closing bracket of loops which it wasn t expecting as it was still trying to parse the conditions of loops

25102815

children	parent
what i want to do is to take a parent instance load up his children then iterate though the children calling a method which may create or update child objects on the current child

25102871
children	parent
i also tried a very naive approach of forcing everything to be loaded from the db by accessing all of those children and sub-children then calling discard on the highest parent

25102889
filtering	grouping
if rows with same reference should go together in results then you should filtering out rows with reference equal to empty string then grouping all rows by reference and select only those grouping which have more than one row

another properties of rbind is that it inherited it s properties from data.frame while one of them is

25103191
put	get
however the question was put on hold and i read that questions can take a long time to get off of on hold

25103230
hide	show
now to make this work it is easier if you add a common class to all items let s say item that way you can hide them all and just show the one you want by checking if it has a certain class as opposed to querying the dom many times

25103231
for-loop	loops
the error you are getting is because in your for-loop you iterate 50 times each time that means j will increment to 50 by the end of loops

25103247
last.fm	soundcloud
i have a searchcontroller which takes a query and searches for it on various backend services youtube soundcloud last.fm etc

25103286

25103574
for-loop	arrays
i use this to print the positions of each element of a 2d arrays with an enhanced for-loop

25103639
children	parent
but as far as i remember the standard and not only since c++11 clearly states that a class is automatically the friend of all of its children on the contrary children are not since they it s based on parent s accessibility and inheritance s accessibility which quite honestly makes sense

25103677
setinterval	clearinterval
here you have it working with setinterval and clearinterval

25103688
public	protected
i desperatly tried to remove static and use public protected private but of course it just didn t work

25103885
libstdc++	libc++
though after switching to ubuntu 14.04 i was no longer able to compile using clang and the c++-11 c++-14 standard so i ve switched to using the libc++ instead of libstdc++

25103885
libstdc++	libc++
though as far as i can see in both libc++ as libstdc++ this defined the same way using the typedef

25103892
filesystems	xfs
talking of the os windows filesystems are up to 4 times slower than ext4 or xfs

25103949
post	get
an ajax call should get all post where the title is like quote

25104025

so it s up to you to compute right width height depending on what you want and knowing that two horizontal or vertical lines with same widths or height but differents thicknesses have not the same real width or height

25104034
firefox	safari
the problem of this is that at this moment it only works in firefox and safari p so like i said only add this like a plus or curiosity not like a solution

25104626
sequence	permutation
the result should be printed on the console in the following format each sequence of 6 numbers with their morse representation separated with a single pipe 1 is .---- 2 is ..--- .----|.----|.----|.----|..---| on a new row the next permutation .----|.----|.----|..---|.----| and so on

25104641
mouse	keyboard
you need to remove only the pseudo-classes which are conditional upon things like mouse or keyboard interaction and the psuedo-elements

25104652
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
because when i use nsurlsession instead this asynchronous nsurlconnection request for downloading all cell image it s longer that nsurlconnection

25104663
width	margin
you set the width margin to auto normally it only centers when a width is set but well it does it for you replace

25104688
put	get
you can put there yellow submarine and get either yellow submarine or yellow submarine or whatever

25104688
put	get
but the actual value stored in map remains yellow submarine the value that you put so if you iterate over the entries you get correct value

cos	sin
two strategies that may work alone or in combination are using higher precision and using the sinpi cospi tanpi trigonometric functions from crlibm that compute respectively sin √Ø x cos √Ø x and tan √Ø x

25104904
cos	sin
the theorem that states that the only rational results of sin cos and tan for a rational argument are obtained in 0 only applies to the radian versions

25104945
postgresql	mysql
it should work in mysql and postgresql

25105001
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
it s not my experience that nsurlsession is any slower than nsurlconnection is

25105001
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
the general counsel is that you d use nsurlconnection if you need to support ios versions prior to 7.0 otherwise use nsurlsession

25105001
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
the caching that you re seeing is that which is transparently provided by nsurlconnection and or nsurlsession completely separate from any app-level caching you might be effectively doing with your array

25105020
children	parent
the inner children are not occupying the entire width of the parent container

autofixture	effort
also to minimize the effort required to arrange your unit test use can use a library like autofixture which will automatically create the post object for you

25105511
openssl	m2crypto
i base my assumption on the fact that m2crypto is a wrapper over openssl

25105527
width	height
calling these methods is the smartgwt equivalent of setting the width and height to 100

punctuation	words
we can see that in the below example after removing number 3054 and punctuation marks - in given string bg3054-suhas b-dc chr 23.7-22.8.13 the output will combine as bgsuhas but i need a space between this two words as bg suhas

folder	directory
xcopy from the previously directory isn t viable because i only want certain folder created

25110931
put	get
i think the possible algorithme that can help you is to sort the array and get shifted elements from it each time you put an element in an array like this

25110975
width	height
since that the vw refers to the width of the viewport using 20vw for width or height or any other property will not make any difference it will always have the same value

25111260
getter	setter
because you already specified the attribute copy for the array property there is no need to override the getter and setter

25111260
getter	setter
if you specify strong instead the getter and setter would look like

25111263

also it should probably be s+ to allow multiple contiguous spaces as delimiter

25111320

25115237
width	height
additionally to the inheritance examples you ve got you may define your width height and pointexists as static so you don t need the object instance to use it

25115237
width	height
you may also make a base class with static pointexists x y code and static variables and inherit it so you can have different height width values for each class

25115612
atexit	main
crt function atexit could register a function to run after main function returns

25115618
public	protected
in inheritance you ve a parent class like we ve our parents and a child class like me and my siblings so child class can access the variables and functions that the parent class have in it and that variables and functions are not private like there are some secrets that parents don t want to reveal even to their childs so in programming that secrets are private whereas there are some secrets that our parents tell us but don t want us to reveal to others in programming that secrets are protected but if they re public you can tell to anyone.

25115618

25115708
min	max	range	min	range	max
so i defined range of screen resolutions and tried with min and max device width like this on my .css file

25115708
google-chrome	firefox
this is working well on google-chrome and firefox but after research device-width seems not to be compliant with ie 9

25115738
width	height
but forcing absolute positioning does not automatically enable google map to operate in 100 width and height because the map is still optimised according to its initial width and height of 500px

25115739

25116226
free	malloc
that term is applicable only when you malloc then free and re-used the pointer

25116236

the first plugin puts all dependencies in the target classes lib folder and the second one includes the library folder in the final jar file and configures the manifest.mf file

25116795
dbcontext	objectcontext
inside the unitofwork class you need to implement dbcontext or objectcontext

25116795

assume clienta has a contract with you that they will pay to use versioning 1.2.3 while clientb is a new client interested in your ground-breaking work on some feature in versioning 2.x that clienta isn t all hyped up about and therefore not so willing to upgrade to

25116867
versioning	upgrade
yes generally companies should push for their clients to upgrade to newer versioning of their product service but quite often the clients are large institutions in which the pace of work and decision-taking is much slower than desired

25116867
versioning	upgrade
your pricing model could be annual service which covers free upgrade for the whole year covering minor and major versioning

25116891
dataframe	multi-index
here is my multi-index dataframe

25116898
xslt	schematron
although the standard way of running schematron schemas against xml documents is to convert them to xslt that approach has a number of drawbacks speed and having validation report you can process programmatically are two primary ones

25116898
xslt	schematron
it doesn t convert the schematron schemas to xslt stylesheets -- it parses them in memory and then processes each pattern rule assert to detect violations

25116898
xslt	schematron
the problem is certainly rooted in a lack of xslt2 support but is not related at all to xslt schematron stylesheets they arent used and are included in the project only as reference

25117078
filtering	grouping
a grouping intersects the crossfilter s current filtering except for the associated dimension s filtering

25117078
filtering	grouping
thus grouping methods consider only records that satisfy every filtering except this dimension s filtering

25117078
filtering	grouping
so if the crossfilter of payments is filtering by type and total then grouping by total only observes the filtering by type.

in android one could easily have a phone with a small screens with very high pixel density and a large tablet screens with very low pixel density and the so-called resulting resolution on both devices could still end up being equal

25117803
width	height
the concept of size is important for a large background image taking the entire width or the entire height of the screen and it s important for layout issues that take into account the entire height of the screen or the entire width of the screen but it s not very important otherwise

25118420
serializable	deserialization

25119088
width	margin
you set margin right and left to 0.5cm then body width will be 20cm not 21cm

25119089
pickle	dill
the reason pickle fails and dill doesn t is that dill treats __main__ like a module for the most part and also can pickle class definitions instead of pickling by reference like pickle does

25119089
pickle	dill
the reason dill can pickle a lambda is that it gives it a name√¢ then pickling magic can happen

25119148
int	chars
i tried a simple program..function returning int and chars pointer..after i run that code i found some weird acting by scanf..i tried to print message enter a b read two int inputs and message enter c d read two chars inputs.but at run time..i found that input for the chars c is read rightafter i enter the inputs for a b.

as you want to use different usernames you have to include the username into the pull push url by using notation

25120460

25121061
getter	setter
in order to use the moxy feature properly you must implement getter setter method for all java classes you use to map the json packet

25121061

if you are using netbeans you can use encapsulate fileds function from your objects properties in order to create very fast getter and setter methods

25121067
rtp	rtsp
i understand rtsp rtp streaming and what these 2 protocols are for

25121067
rtp	rtsp
but if we need the ip address codec and the rtsp rtp protocols to stream the video and audio from any cameras then why do we have onvif standard which essentially also aims to standardize the communication between ip network devices

25121067
rtp	rtsp
i want to know why at all we need onvif when we already have rtsp rtp and what additional benefits it can provide

spaces	delimiter
the spaces character acts as a delimiter in my test case and i m supposed to make it such that each word occupies one row

tags are by default inline elements and hence the height and width properties will not apply on them

25121370
width	height
block because you can assign them a height and a width

25121375

25121619
dictionary	map
i want to substitute values for that placeholders and those values are stored in a map dictionary

25121658
jar	war
since you use spring i assume you don t have ejbs in your project so you can package everything as a single war file containing the jar of you java beans project and the spring libraries with all their dependencies in its web-inf lib folder

25121660
getter	setter
also check that in your main entity you ve annotated fields instead of getter setter so it turns on field access on the entity as well as on embedded entity in this case embeddedfoo

25122249
children	parent
let the parent node delegate the event triggering to its children nodes

25122249
children	parent
this means that the parent will do the listening for events that previously each of the individual children would do

25122249
children	parent
the parent will likely never change or be manipulated but its content children will

25122249
children	parent
a single event attached to the parent node can handle everything that happens to the children nodes

25122258
super	abstract
you don t set the xmlrootelement -annotation on the abstract super class but instead on every concrete sub class in this example not on xxxapicall but on foobeancall

25122357
equals	gethashcode
note that in order to be usable in a your orderline objects must implement gethashcode and equals

25122367
children	parent
so we use the ideas of parent and children and compare these between equivalent vertices a b parent child

25122367
children	parent
the second part compares the parent and children of nodes that have equivalence statement

25122410
stdout	stderr
as per dan davis you have error stderr and stdout switched - not the console.log statements but the order of the parameters in the function

25122410
stdout	stderr
your stderr was in the position of the actual stdout so it recieved the output

25122435
qapplication	qcoreapplication
you cannot use qtwebkit with qcoreapplication change all qcoreapplication to qapplication

25122468

min	max
also let min and max be respectively the leftmost and rightmost boundary of a palindromic substring centered at c

25122920
min	max
so min c-p c and max c+p c

25122920
min	max
for example for palindrome s abaaba the transformed palindrome t mirror center c 6 length array p 0..12 min c-p c 6-6 0 max c+p c 6+6 12 and two sample mirrored indices i and i are shown in the following figure

25122920
min	max
min i c i max

25122920
min	max
min c max

25122920
min	max
for example in the following figure with the first palindrome centered at c 8 and bounded by min 4 and max 12 length of the third palindrome centered at i 9 with mirror index i 2 c-i 7 is p i p i 1

25122920
min	max
min i c i max

25122920
min	max
min i c i max

25122920
min	max
that is p i min p i max-i when the third palindrome is not extendable past max

25122927
int	double
as others already mentioned never use double for int calculation

so after a bit more playing and re-imaging the rpi i managed to get both usb card reader and usb hdd to different mount points but when running the script it seems to look at the empty destination directory as being the source folder and it just says the files already exsist but again doing this on a windows pc it works fine.........

25134058
width	height
width and height correspond to printablewidth and printableheight

25134071
int	boolean
you do not check the value so the statement results an int value but an if statement requires a boolean value

25134072
integer	unsigned
fifth and with reference to another answer with which i disagree i believe in general that the √¢ ≈ìbest√¢ data type for any object is the set with the smallest size and the least algebraic structure but if you decide to indulge your inner pedant and use size_t or another unsigned integer type for matrix indices you will regret it

25134080
google-chrome	firefox
after i changed the corresponding line in hbs.js everything worked as expected in all tested browsers google-chrome 35 firefox 30 ie 8-10

25134086

javascript timers setinterval settimeout are not efficient because they continue to run when browser window is minimized or other tab is open thereby wasting cpu cycles

25134086
clearinterval	settimeout
so here make sure to clearinterval before assigning it again or use a flag with settimeout or requestanimationframe

25134095

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
use a filter to generate the border 2014-08-05 status works in firefox but google-chrome opera has a bug on femorphology but it should be possible to work around that by using other filter primitives

25134341
gson	jackson
i would suggest to use one of 2 most popular open source parsers gson or jackson

25134345

you can use a settimeout function on the keydown event which will fire after x seconds to compare the time that event was triggered to the last time a keyup was triggered - if at all

25134352
qmenubar	qmainwindow
it will be a good idea to keep using qmainwindow since qmenubar is designed to be used within it

keydown	keyup
watch for keydown and keyup events

25134413

when calling getwritabledatabase i expect the oncreate for the databasehelper to be called and start setting up my tables

25134492
int	boolean
i notice that if i encode the boolean inside of a 3d texture i would have to do a different but still as costly 3d - 1d index conversion anyway because storing bits inside of an int is 1d anyway

use keydown and keyup to check for the keypress

25134768
keydown	keyup
get the current system time with keydown and compare that with the current system time when you get the keyup

25134782

i have a directory that has x number of files and if another file is put in that folder i want the original to be renamed rather than overwritten

25134919

the other option is to have the first dropdown as one form and the second in another form and a submit button for each - that looks kind of like what you re trying to do in your example - but you need each select in a different form and then you need to build the second select in the same way you d handle any form submission

25134979
implements	extends
class horsetimer should extends bukkitrunnable onstead of implements rumnable so it can cancel itself

25134995
min	max
i wish to know if there is a method to compute with a list comprehensions the min and max value and saving the memory

25135031
post	get
the simplest solution as it seems would be to get somewhere between post submit before validation but it would have to be done from entity

25135043
put	get
so for example if i put mdc values into my diagnosticadapterlogger i should expect to be able to get those values from org.slf4j.mdc

accessor	properties	getter	setter
a properties is really a convention that means you have ivars with accessor methods setter and getter that meet a standard style and provides additional functionality that is derived from the conventional style

25135404
getter	setter
that is the compiler will generate a lot of boilerplate code to make ivars and associated setter and getter methods for you that adhere to conventions and provide most importantly consistent memory management and kvc and kvo

you should use keydown or keyup because the keypress event is not raised by the ctrl button but only by character buttons

25135717
mutators	setter
however my issue is that because i have created the column i also generate a mutators setter which means someone could then override the datejoined value which i don t want to do

25135922
min	max
you want to compute the min and the max of the list

25135922
min	max
if you wanted to calculate only one of the min or max you could just use the min max function on it

25135922
min	max
but since you want both you would have to loop over the list twice to extract first the min and then the max

25135922
min	max
first calling both min and max on the list

25135922
min	max
it seems while the algorithm of looping only once is on the paper more efficient it is beaten by the inner optimization of min and max

25136020
mouseover	mouseenter
update use mouseover instead of mouseenter

25136458

there are some cases where i would like to create a kernel svm model implemented by libsvm only and a logistic regression model implemented by liblinear only of my data

25137155
box-sizing	border-box	width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
this is because you have fixed the width and height and then used padding which throws the box-sizing off if you are not using border-box

25137160
filtering	grouping
having clause can only operate on aggregates within the grouping so this isn t the correct way to go about it since you are filtering out other rows you want to check against

25137253
setinterval	settimeout
the settimeout setinterval solutions presented here will only work in specific circumstances

25137253
setinterval	settimeout
the variables affecting the success of these settimeout setinterval solutions are

25137368
filtering	grouping
you could filtering before using the grouping by adding the following where depending on your data

25137368
filtering	grouping
a similar thing is done for numberofidelagents except we filtering for the activo grouping and use the nullcount property as we aren t interested in all rows we are only interested in those where the interactiontype was dbnull.value which we ve captured in the nullcount property

here the first image is largest in width and the second image is largest in height and they are really big in dimension.so they need to be resized or rather these images are need to be minimized in size.so i have used the pil as below

25137388
width	height
so this function returns all the images with width of 1000 and height of 560.but i don t want to resize all the images with same width and height rather i want to resize each images maintaining there own shape

an extra would be if i resize the selection the min max should be altered

however print a outside the for-loop prints only one value obviously because it did only one search instead of a loops trough the all the offers

in the drawtheroute method the c arrays coordinates is declared with arrayofpoint.count elements and the for-loop initializes each index of the c arrays using i as the index variable

25138994

versioning	upgrade
while this was not deliberate please note that we really are trying to get users to upgrade to at least versioning 5.3.0 of php because we can t address any of the memory performance issues that users working with large spreadsheets complain about until we can use some of the new features available in more recent versioning of php

25141093
swift	objective-c
this is from the prerelease swift objective-c interoperability documentation

25141093
swift	objective-c
like the dynamic attribute in objective-c the nsmanaged attribute informs the swift compiler that the storage and implementation of a property will be provided at runtime

25141093
swift	objective-c
so because of some of the objective-c runtime features that core data uses under the covers swift properties need to be specially annotated

25141170
google-chrome	firefox
if i create a foo class using traditional javascript classes both google-chrome and firefox will show the foo name when printing foo instances on the console

25141883
folder	directory
hello the problem that you mentioned it s almost always when you have a webapp that have the log4j.jar in they lib and also in the tomcat lib directory like it s explained in the link that i posted so you have to choose where is will be log4j in all the webapps lib folder or only in the tomcat lib directory

25141886
try-catch	exception-handling
delete the try-catch block around your exception-handling and let the exception-handling be thrown and you should see the transaction get rolled back

google-chrome	firefox
i noticed phantomjs usually needs a bit more space than firefox and google-chrome do

25141959
filtering	grouping
when i get decompressed file memory buffer serialized blocks go one after one so i d like to pass them to the next filtering in the same manner or at least adjust this process by packing serialized blocks in grouping of some number and then pass

25141983
swift	objective-c
i found the same exact question except in objective-c not my language swift

25142261
put	get
i do get shake event intercepted when app is running but when i lock the screen or put application in background with home button no shake event is intercepted

25142280
fadein	fadeout
i think the only way to solve this would be to switch the hover handler off when doing the fadeout fadein stuff and then switching it back on when finished

25142314
mouseleave	mouseenter
the .hover method binds handlers for both mouseenter and mouseleave events

25142324

more information can be found using following search term ntlm one hop why ntlm fails and kerberos works

25142634

25143118
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
xdomainrequest is the only way of having an xmlhttprequest that supports cors in ie8 and 9

25143118
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
xdomainrequest is not completely interchangeable with xmlhttprequest the interfaces aren t exactly the same

25143118

apply font-size 0 to the parent container and reset it on the children

25143313
for-loop	loops
i guess it is not possible by using for-loop because it will inevitably is going to loops 5 times not one

25143349
google-chrome	firefox
another solution could be using browser cookies but the problem of this solution is that the users can use google-chrome and firefox on the same computer

25143386
for-loop	loops
next the second for-loop is adding them together-first is 64 next loops at 71 to 64 and you get 135 next add to 135 the next module result 60 and so on until i get the total sum of all 6 modules which is just in this example 346 and then divide it by 6 to get my stage result.so i need in my output console just 346 6.nothing else no zeros no nothing

25143396
width	height

25143472
division	multiplication
the increase in register use when switching from a double-precision multiplication to a double-precision division in kernel computation is due to the fact that double-precision multiplication is a built-in hardware instruction while double-precision division is a sizable called software subroutine that is a function call of sorts

25143472
division	multiplication
as marco13 points out in a comment above it may be possible to manually replace division by multiplication with the reciprocal

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
google-chrome firefox and ios 7 ipad safari have different ways of displaying selected html and elements are the same in those

25148183
int	double
instead try casting the int to double before dividing as these will return the actual ratio

25148183
multiplying	multiplication
then instead of multiplying by 100 multiplying by 100.0 as multiplication by 100 will also cast to an integer

25148188
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i haven t been able to reproduce this in safari or firefox but i also don t know what developer tools to use in either of those browsers that would confirm or deny whether the repaint is occurring the equivalent of timeline or show paint rectangles in google-chrome s inspector

25148188
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
failing that behind-the-scenes proof it is the case that in firefox and safari with the fancybox iframe popped out near the bottom of the page there is no white flash flicker as there is in google-chrome due to the repaint

25148273
post	get
get requests can be cached where as post requests can never be cached

you can use strsplit to get an array of substr

25148335
int	chars	int	double
type can be any data type that you want to use in apple such as chars int double etc

25148379
width	height
you can add the first and third components to the north and south positions which will try to use the least amount of room height wise and most amount of room width wise and you can add the large text area to the center position which will try to use the most amount of room height and width wise

25148392
for-loop	arrays
however instead of modifying your original arrays in order to print each on a new line just use a for-loop

25148404
groovy	gsp
gsp groovy server pages are server based

25148406
hide	show
forms loaded with the page originally not through ajax load as expected and changing options on the affected fields causes them to right themselves for example checking and unchecking a checkbox causes the correct fields to show hide - the ajax-loaded forms just don t start out correctly

25148409
ionic	angular
i m having issues disabling the back button for android in a phonegap project using ionic angular js

25148422
button	checkbox
i have gotten the java script to work if i change the dmf button to input type checkbox

25148466
cout	ofstream
when i write it into a file the representation is correct because i open the ofstream in binay mode but i cannot find how to do the same in cout

25148492
junit	testng
using java with either testng or junit if you wanted to log some information gathered during a test to a file and have each test class such as testclass1.class keep a separate output file named after the class like so

25148550
for-loop	arrays
also you can use .indexof to test if the url is listed in the arrays to avoid a other for-loop

25148582
yacc	bison
this answer applies in general terms to yacc bison and some other parser generators which use the same input format

25148582
jison	lemon
neither jison -- which otherwise uses a very similar grammar format -- nor lemon implement the feature for example

25148582
bison	lemon	bison	jison	jison	lemon
bison gives you access to this stack-probing feature but please don t use it unless you really know what you re doing. so you re more likely to use the prefix solution if you need the equivalent to an mra in jison or lemon

25148604
put	get	post	get	post	put
my data model is each account has a list of profiles and those profiles should have get post put

gridbaglayout	miglayout
instead of gridbaglayout use miglayout manager

25148717
grouplayout	miglayout	gridbaglayout	grouplayout	gridbaglayout	miglayout
we should avoid using gridbaglayout and use either miglayout or grouplayout

25148727
oncreate	onstart
obviously i can t sleep in oncreate or onstart of the activity because the display has not been rendered for the user yet

25148731
subtraction	addition
the denominator is increased by 1 with each subsequent term and addition and subtraction signs alternate between each term

25148809
multiplying	multiplication
use a multiplication factor that toggles from +1 to -1 and then to +1 again as you iterate then multiplying your current 1 n term by that

25148835
emacs	textmate
like in the equivalent mode in say textmate or emacs cua-mode

25148841

versioning	upgrade
the fix is simply to upgrade to a more recent versioning of ruby

25148963
width	height
you can use this code to change the height and width of my activity in oncreate ..it provides better flexibility than specifying dialog theme

25149002
hide	show
after much digging i found a link under integration with sharepoint that seems to show how to hide the new folder icon

25149099

redirecting stdout and stderr to the same fdes

25149099
stdout	stderr
redirecting an fdes 2 not stdin stdout stderr

25149100
nav	affix
i think for your purpose it d be best to only worry about affix for the side nav and use css positioning for your jumbotron just like bootstrap does for the navbar at the top

25149100
width	height
for the jumbotron set the position to fixed and give it an explicit top 50px is the height of the navbar above it set the width to 100 if you want it to stretch across the viewport and give it an explicit height

25149100
margin	height
then create your container and give it a margin-top of navbar height + jumbotron height + any desired margin in our example this is 250px + a 30px margin

25149126
google-chrome	firefox
there is white space below my div in firefox but not in google-chrome

25149126
google-chrome	firefox
this gets the right positioning effect i m looking for in google-chrome but in firefox it creates a white space

25149126
google-chrome	firefox
when i get rid of these lines the div isn t positioned in the right place in either firefox or google-chrome

25149133
getter	setter
this fixes it by adding a separate getter and a setter rather than trying to use to old kids method which tried to do both

25149141
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest versioning of xcode

25149170
width	height
the width of the image is fixed and its height is unknown so what i want is the height of the image to be equal to the height of the other 5 views combined as appears in the example above

25149172
post	get
get requests have smaller limits than post in the specs

25149172

originally get was intended to be small and simple while post was created with the vision that someday it could be used for file-uploads and the like

25149209
dictionary	map
if however you need to handle the case where multiple dictionary will have the same value for the value key then you need to map all of them this will give you a dictionary where the key is the value in value and the value is the list of dictionary that have that value

25149238
ilist	icollection
npoco returns the following error no property of type icollection 1 found on object of type ingredient which confuses me because the class ingredient does have a property of type ilist

25149238
ienumerable	ilist
we ve tried list ilist ienumerable and pretty much every type of collection we could think of and none of them worked

25149244
maven	pom.xml

25149271
folder	directory
my problem is i am having trouble finding the most robust way to ensure my nested directory tree has been completely copied to my watch folder

25149271
folder	directory
the walkfiletree method snapshots the directory tree immediately upon invocation so it cannot detect folder created after it is called

25149286
peer	p2p
otherwise each device would need some p2p framework on them-either wifi direct on or some other framework like alljoyn or samsung chord which helps in peer to peer discovery

25149315
inherited	subclassing
i would like my class to be considered a subclassing of int however i don t want to inherited directly like this

25149318
width	height
images width and height are defined on the css since they re all the same width but different height

25149319
subtract	add
so instead of trying to add the expiration time to created_at subtract the expiration time from time.now

25149396
min	max
this is why we clip the results to the min and max possible coordinates

25149425

25149483
children	parent
i have parent and children

25149483
google-chrome	firefox
according to the google-chrome and firefox ember debug tool it looks like the child objects are being created in the store correctly

25149494
fakeiteasy	moles
you could use fakeiteasy or microsoft moles etc

25149530
jlist	jtable
i did not find anything within either the jtable api nor the jlist api i felt answered my question on this

25149549
put	get	post	get	post	put
web services like post get put delete over http or https

25149577
request-uri	url
as a side note the asterisk character does have a special meaning in a request-uri in both http specs but it s not possible to represent it with an http url

25149595
public	protected	mutators	getter	mutators	setter	getter	setter
from the other hand we have java bean pojo style where you hide all your data members and provide only public or protected accessors getter and mutators setter

25149603

a website with post put parameters would be ok for this case

25149632
udp	tcp
you re specifying udp proto for the tcp module

25149636
pull	push
i tried the push pull as shown in the answer by skelly but c ends up in a new row once heights are applied

25149644
put	get
if i put all the doctrine associations in the person entity class along with the set get add remove methods for each along with the original 30 columns and their methods and some supporting utility functions then the person entity is going to be 1000+ lines long and a nightmare to test

25149742
width	height
the overall idea is it finds the distance between the upper left and lower right corner of all the labels so ul of label1 and lr of label4 this only works if you ve already set the spacing between labels and the width height of each label then it finds the width height w h of the screen and subtracts the w h of the label area divides by two giving the space between the top of the screen and the labels

25149797
contour	imshow	contourf	imshow
first define a mappable such as an image with imshow or a contour set with contourf

25149875
freebsd	debian	freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	debian	openbsd	linux	debian	linux
tail has the same behaviour on freebsd openbsd and debian gnu linux so while the behaviour is sub-optimal it is probably not going to be considered a bug

25149886
hide	show
a good way to fix this is to add the class hidden-xs and others if you change the column from sm to hide this content then create a new div as you want it to show up on small viewports and give it the class visible-xs

25149887
for-loop	arrays
since inputselection is a regular arrays search it with a for-loop rather than .each

25149902
client-side	server-side
it seems the problem is the browser waiting for the first request to complete and thus more a client-side than a server-side issue

25149902
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately requests with the same path are effectively enqueued at least on firefox and google-chrome - i guess it s a device that browsers employ to protect server resources and thus user experience

25149912
move	drag
as you can see in this live example when we are trying to drag the main draggable element div.outer every time mouse goes over div.inner or even when it goes outside the draggable box goes inside body area cursor quickly changes to not-allowed and immedialtely changes back to normal move

25149921
war	uberjar	jar	war
the lein profiles are for libs that you want to use during development but not in production so they are not included as part of the war jar uberjar artefact

25149952
button	checkbox
but what i m really stuck on right now is an efficient way of unchecking all checkbox or checking all beckboxes via a button

25149952
for-loop	arrays
when i try and iterate through the arrays with a for-loop and try setting the checkbox with

25149959
int	double
the round function also returns a double so you ll have to convert the result of round into an int to store it in xpos

25149961
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
this is how you would use a bufferedreader and stringbuilder efficiently

25149961
int	double
if you are expecting double or int you can use a and in the try use either java s class double or int to parse a string

25149984

post	get
but the problem is how can i know the result for each device because what i get is the result for the whole post data

25150354
integer	fractions
it suffices to do the search in 0 180 since any larger argument will reduce to a value in 0 180 with the same fractions part since the period is an integer

jtree	jtable	jlist	jtable	jlist	jtree
swing provides a concept of renderers and in some case editors which provide an extendable and pluggable api which provides you the means by which you can provide a formatter to classes like jlist jtable and jtree

25150803
jlist	jtable
the long and short of it all is jlist simply isn t designed to support structured data in this way this is why we have jtable .

int	chars	int	boolean
in other words in java you can call a method and pass some arguments such as primitive values int long chars boolean etc. and objects string or any instance of any class as when you passs an object you are basically passing the address in memory of the real object that lives somewhere in memory

25150985
width	height
at the moment i am simply using the width and height of the image as seen in imagegetter below at

25150985

debian-based	ubuntu	debian-based	mint	ubuntu	mint
in debian-based systems such as ubuntu and mint library packages typically have names that begin with lib and development headers for compiling new programs that use the library are in a separate package whose name ends with -dev

25151621
cells	tablecell
you need to check whether the tablecell is empty and set the graphic to null if the cells is empty and to the button otherwise

25151621
cells	tablecell
here i am assuming the item is only ever null for empty cells if this is not the case you need to either subclass tablecell and override the updateitem ... method or observe both the itemproperty and the emptyproperty of a default tablecell

25151637
post	get
then you can make a request to that page see example below and you don t need it to be a post request just use get

25157371
hash	salt
it s pretty much the same criterion for a hash function but you probably don t need something secure against deriving the original inputs from the salt value

25157371
hash	salt
separately if you re regenerating the salt from say a user s address and they change it you d want their current password to recalcualte the hash with a new salt or to save the old salt or address somewhere for ongoing use.

25157471
width	height
change the width height attributes on the canvas tag not the css that stays at 100 every time the window resizes

if you convert it to a block element using display block you can then set width height along with everything else that can be set on block-elements only

25158661
superclass	subclassing
if the first comment is correct and you re trying to compile class a that extends b when you don t have b s source or bytecode then i think the answer is you can t. if you think about what it means to compile a subclassing you will realize that the compiler needs details from the superclass -- what methods there are what abstract methods there are what to put in the jump table what protected variables and methods might be referenced etc

25158674
width	height
i managed to keep the original image ratio with a css width 100 height auto setting for the image

25158777
junit	testng
so i ve been banging my head against the wall trying to come up with a way to convince the testng runner to not run junit tests at all since it obviously has issues doing it properly

25158777
junit	testng
according to the testng documentation it should respect the junit false configuration or corresponding testng.junit system property

25158777
junit	testng
i suspect the reason is the fix for surefire-1019 testng provider fails to execute junit4 tests which intends to sort of make it run junit except they seem to have forgotten the option in to disable the behavior

versioning	upgrade
edit so fundamentally you first havew to get rid of the notion of using a upgrade sdcript to go from versioning to versioning

25162101
versioning	upgrade
for example if you start with a table and trunk adds column a and the branch adds column b then you merge trunk to branch - you cannot realistically upgrade to the versioning with both unless the branch versioning number is always greater than the trunk s upgrade script and that doesn t work if you subsequently merge trunk to the branch

25162101
versioning	upgrade
when the branch is complete the very last task is to take all the db changes made for the branch and toll them up into a script that can be applied to the master upgrader and when it is merged onto trunk that script is merged into the current upgrade script and the db versioning number bumped

this means the left operand of + c is converted to an int an int can hold every chars value 1

25167304
integer	unsigned
a third case unrelated here but for sake of completeness are unsigned integer types no overflow occurs there are exceptions however bit-shifting by more than the width of the type the result is always reduced modulo 2 n for a type with precision n

25167304
int	chars
1 at least for 8-bit chars s signed chars s or int s with higher precision than chars so virtually always

25167319
getter	setter
python uses attributes or properties instead of getter and setter

25167319
getter	setter
the other way of doing things like getter and setter is to use properties

25167331

bind the frame buffer to get the frame buffer width and height

25167597
width	height
the bounds used by cicontext when drawing to a glkview are in pixels not points hence the need to read from the frame buffer s width and height

25167621

alternatively use position absolute use width and height values

25167667
hide	show
i dynamically show hide the usercontrols on the panel as needed throughout the navigation of the application

25167676
width	height
the simplest cross-browser compatible way is to implement a border is to use a rect exactly as i did but place it outside of the group as it is still positioned by the bounding box it will have the correct width height x and y as mentioned by duopixel in his comment

25167677
getter	setter
in the event that it does need to become a new object keep in mind that getter and setter are only needed if the object is going to have properties

25167685
swift	objective-c
technically you should be able to use swift on a objective-c project

in the plnkr i got min and max to work using ng-if statements to handle all possible combinations

25167699
min	max
i needed to modify the check in the directive for min and max

so when ssl https traffic comes in it is stopped terminated at the server

25167964
ssl	https
they will issue a new request this time https and go thru heroku s ssl termination and then to your app

25167964
ssl	https
but now you know that the path between the client and heroku is secure due to the client using https and the path between the heroku ssl termination and your dyno is presumably secure if you trust heroku...

so i have a text file and it may have a tab as its field separator delimiter or it may have a spaces as a field separator

25168259

if the text file has a spaces as delimiter then it is not delimiter every line

25168259
spaces	delimiter
delimiter is spaces the spaces is between 12 and 3 4 and 56

25168287
width	height
images within them can be considered to have a resolution which is given by the width of the image on the page divided by the number of image samples in the x direction and the height of the image on the page divided by the number of image samples in the y direction

25168287
width	height
so this leaves calculating the width and height of the image on the page

25168287
width	height
so in order to work out the width and height on the page you need to interpret the content stream up to the point where the image is rendered tracking the graphics state ctm

25168287
width	height
in the strictly limited case where the whole page content is a single image you can gamble that there is no scaling taking place and simply divide the media width by the image width and the media height by the image height to give the x and y resolutions

25168309
google-chrome	firefox
this is what it should look like edit not sure why but image shows in google-chrome but not firefox on so

conio	ncurses
use a conio source code implementation for linux such as this which uses ncurses and implements borland s api

25168951
width	height
the only other possibility that i can see out of experience is that with g tags not having an explicit width and height according to the spec ie might just be foregoing this check completely as in to not have a width is presumably the same as 0 for the ie codebase

25168969

projectile	angle
basically intersection concept is not really needed here as far as you are using projectile motion you just need to hit at a particular angle and instantiate at the time of shooting so that you get the exact distance of your target from the source and then once you have the distance you can calculate the appropriate velocity with which it should shot in order to hit the target

25169444

25170339
width	height
if you want to use a background-image you could simply replace the url with your image s and tweak the height and width properties

25170348
qapplication	qdebug
reason is simple qapplication gets destroyed before your singleton destruction and qdebug needs qapplication object to get current text codec

25170350
int	chars
the above is still wrong because var_ is chars and val_ is int and you need the types to match to call std replace

25170358
grouplayout	miglayout
if find miglayout manager easier to use than grouplayout

25170393
int	chars
second is for your second parameter your should use a chars value 3 instead of an int value

25170525

25170624
sorting	filtering
i m having problems with a product list with filtering sorting and pagination

25170624
sorting	filtering
my thoughts are something along the lines of having a boolean that only allows the knockout foreach binding to be activated when it s true after a manual interaction with the filtering sorting or paging which would mean that on page load only the server side binding happens and knockout managed any other client interaction

25170644
shiny	rcharts
i tried to dispaly in a shiny app some examples of demo topic dimple package rcharts

25170715
children	parent
this is what im doing i do not understand how you get the children elements into the parent and this should be able to go infinitely deep

25170737
eiffel	smalltalk
however this is in stark contrast to true high-level languages such as smalltalk eiffel and haskell where the higher the level the farther is the correspondence to the final machine code that results after compilation assembly linkage

25170742
width	height
if anyone can help me how can i change the size of the cells in the grid string height and width as well as background colors can put the cells and change the typeface and size

thanks to this nicely put together post for helping me realise this

25171005
post	get
brian mckenna s above post about multiprocessing is really helpful but if you wanted to go down the threaded route opposed to process-based this example will get you started

25171060
post	get
i think i need to write a query that grabs the st_id from the table and post it to the email script before the email is sent but again not sure how to get that to work

25171072
width	height
holder.js doesn t fit the image to bootstrap s thumbnail width and height

25171095

a third approach is to read the input as text then convert it using something like atoi strtol or sscanf

25171162
spaces	delimiter
the delimiter is a spaces for the data coming into the python script

25171168
width	height
identifying the x y width height of all black rectangles involves these steps

25171168
width	height
that bounding box will give you the x y width height of one black rectangle

25171169
division	modulo
i wonder how this is possible as modulo returns the remainder of the euclidean division a b

i want to add a counter_cache so i can quickly get the number of upvotes per post

25171225
build.gradle	gradlew
i added the firebase gradlew dependency to the app build.gradle file

25171234
inherited	properties
so that when a child scope is created prototypical inherited will carry down the properties which are reference types down to the children

25171234
inherited	properties
in your case the properties modelselected is a primitive even if it is present on the parent scope and ng-repeat creates a child scope which does not finds this properties since inherited does not carry it down even if it were present and creates a new properties on its scope so the changes made to that are not seen to the outer scope

25171287
google-chrome	firefox
it works on ie firefox and google-chrome now

25171291
width	height
i am using inline css and that part can be changed but i am more concerned with how to achieve a custom height and width of a video if even possible

25171319
width	height
this issue ended up being that the svg file that was generated did not have the width and height specified

25171336
min	max
in order to use a group by expression you must have one or more aggregating functions count min max sum avg etc

25171370
doc	rtf
how you do this in code depends to some extent on your preferred language but things are easier if the documents are in docx format as opposed to legacy binary doc format or rtf

25171397
public	protected
probably you are overriding the method setwallpaper bitmap bitmap which must be declared as protected or public i guess public

25171401
profiling	instrumentation
i looked up some similar issues on so and tried using the zombie profiling in instrumentation as shown below right or control click the image and view it in a new tab to see it full size

25171479
width	height
i m not sure if it s possible to do with the height but what worked for me with the width was to first set an arbitrary width then get the element and set the the width property

25171548
swift	objective-c
if you choose cocoa touch file you will have a option of objective-c and swift file which can be subclasses of other cocoa touch classes such as uiviewcontroller or uitableviewcell

i m working on a app which uses functions such as sin cos tan and log

25171593
swift	objective-c
with objective-c i was able to catch all the exceptions thrown by the parser found on github but with swift we are no more allowed to do so and therefore my question

25171593
cos	sin
i m trying to find a way to check that after sin cos tan and log there are parentesis and to restrict the input to contain just those functions

25171606
folder	directory
instead i have it copied during build from monogame s assemblies linux directory and all related clr assemblies are copied from that folder as well

if the arrays has no other levels of arrays nested i would first implode all nested arrays with a single for-loop and then implode

25171777
draggable	droppable
i m trying to make a tool for a website that uses draggable and droppable elements from jqueryui

25171777
draggable	droppable
i have one div that contains the elements draggable and a div that the elements will be moved to droppable

25171777
draggable	droppable
i have code that works for moving it over getting the droppable to accept the correct stuff and even code to keep the draggable element draggable only in the droppable div

25171777
draggable	droppable
the issue arises when you initially drag the draggable element to the droppable div

25171777
put	get
also when it gets dropped it slightly offsets to the upper-left so even then it s not perfect because if it get s put in the top-left corner it will be partially out of the box

25171778
mp4	h.264
as a result the mp4 file with h.264 codec it was making is damaged

25171859
mapr	cloudera
when i told the sys admins about this who don t know what talend is they told me that mapr doesn t use hregionservers like cloudera does and figured that my talend configurations were wrong

25171892
children	parent
the length of the children property of every parent is always 0

25171940
getter	setter
but they have getter and setter

25171963
post	get
however your route handles a post request and since there is no get route defined laravel is responding with methodnotallowedhttpexception

25172032
for-loop	loops
i wrote some code in which the for-loop index varies over a range depending on the length of a list and the length of the list is changeable inside loops

25172056
inherited	subclassing
every subclassing of nsobject inherited the method

25172085
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t work in firefox ie or google-chrome though

25172085
google-chrome	firefox
same thing happens in all browsers firefox ie google-chrome and i√¢ ve cleared

25172126
for-loop	loops
you can simply replace the for-loop by a while loops

25172152
post	get
so just change the request from get to post

25172178
profiler	yourkit
i m profiling my webapp using yourkit java profiler

25172183
getter	setter
you have to make sure there is jsonignore annotation on the field level as well as on the setter and getter annotated with jsonproperty

25172262
post	put
for the ajax part put the url that will be requested with method post such as

25172268
folder	directory
the issue is that i m calling the directory users as the source path in the rule and if i also have a file in the root folder with the same name users.php then the rule above ends up pointing to that file instead of the page i want to redirect rule to point to which is redirect.php in this case

25172296
multiplying	add
one way to work with dates as numbers is to multiplying the year by 10000 the month by 100 and add these numbers to the day of the month

25172341
put	get
i tried to put the variable and value into two separate lists for both the strings but cant get it to iterate through all the 4 lists at the same time

25172356
width	height
hardcode the checkbox s height and width remove its padding and make its height plus vertical margins equal to the label s line-height

25172356
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome and ie7+ all render the following example identically

25172372
implements	extends
jpanel for instance implements imageobserver so you can pass this if extends jpanel

25172372
awt	swing
also see painting in awt and swing

25172391
width	height
so from the vision of the camera probably most people would figure out that i have to put half of the block width added to its x position and half of blocks height decreased from its y position but when i try that this occour

25172408
integer	unsigned
the input is unsigned integer number

25172424
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade all spring dependency versioning to their latest stable versioning

25172425
children	parent
to my understanding zombie process happens when the parent process exits before the children process

25172438
subclass	abstract-class
fsharpfunc is not a delegate - it s an abstract-class which means you d need to subclass it and implement invoke

25172456
getter	setter
there are not setter or getter in c++ that are distinct from other method calls

25172498
width	height
the more accurate fix for what i wanted to do however was to not have the gridview s width and height set to match_parent which was the root cause behind why the button was disappearing

25172498
width	height
i found that the cause of that was i was programmatically setting the width and height of the gridview to wrap its content and then the width and height of the components inside by the width and height of the parent view

25172498
width	height
i then set the width and height of the grid elements based on the dimensions of the screen which fixed the size of the gridview

25172520
for-loop	arrays
i have a for-loop that reads from different arrays in order to make a long string to display

25172543
innodb	myisam
i m using innodb for transactions so i wasn t prepared to switch to myisam just because of this

25172544
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a google map integration on my site which is working for me on windows google-chrome and firefox as well as my android browser but i get an uncaught type error on latitude in osx only

25172544
post	get
i have seen a few post about problems with google maps geolocation on newer versions of mac but no solutions on how to get it to work

25172551
superclass	subclassing
create a superclass for your view controller that is a subclassing of uiviewcontroller and implements mydelegateprotocol

25172566
post	get
i get to do functions like create articles post downloads etc

25172604
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have a strange issue my spring rest api works perfectly for http get post delete and put

25172604
put	get	post	get	post	put
however the same web service throws a 403 for delete and put when hosted on tomcat 7 that is located on a remote serverbut works fine for get and post

25172632
getter	setter
your getter setter idea is a good one.

25172660
folder	directory
i have been working on a situation like this where i run multiple copies of the same program from within the same directory folder and logging errors

25172666
min	max
this is how i find the max min of the days for irrad temp not one day so how can i do it roughly the same way as the code below for finding just one day rather than over few days

25172680
put	get
first off my problem is how to get the floats from the textfield then put it into a array

25172687
width	height
i added a rectagle with the 100 height and width with this code

25172709
getter	setter
you will need public getter and setter for stripes to be able to read the value

25172755
min	max
data now contains the max and min temperature and irradiation for each day

25172758
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectid
when an nsmanagedobject is first inserted into an nsmanagedobjectcontext it has a temporary nsmanagedobjectid

25172758
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectid
nsmanagedobjectid s can be passed between nsmanagedobjectcontext s if they share the same stores but only if the nsmanagedobjectid is a permanent id

25172765
post	get
i read through the specification they said they are using rfc 1867 but still cannot get a simple text file or url shown below to post as an attachment

25172783
sqoop	hadoop
for cloudera hadoop users sqoop is installed alongside sqoop2 and can be found where cdh is installed

25172803
width	height
start_ver_btn won t show because the gridview has match_parent for both width and height judging by your layout_width and height i think you want to set the linearlayout s orientation to vertical

25172807
daemons	systemd
you have something on your systemd that s doing so - daemons cron job or whatever

25172834
unix	bsd
the linked chapter describes how such libraries could be created in general and gives references to unix system v bsd os

25172845
fpdf	fpdi
then i pass all those 3 values to a php script which uses fpdf and fpdi to merge the image onto the pdf

25172867
width	height	subtract	add
since as shown i thought just add half of the blocks width to its x and subtract half of its height in its y so this happen

25172868
int	boolean	int	double
that s how i do fot int boolean and double

25172868
int	double
int aren t arrays while bool and double are stored in 2 dimensional arrays

25172868
int	chars	int	double
now the compiler says this code works for int and bool but for double it says type cast cannot convert from chars to double

25172868
int	boolean
edit also i still haven t tried the code with another pc so i highly doubt the conversion for int and boolean is done right

25172872
min	max
since min and max queries are not supported is there is a way to find the maximum timestamp in the table less than a given value

25172905
fiddler	charles
also if you need to debug outside of chrome charles fiddler are good debug alternatives

25172920
getter	setter
create getter setter functions

25172930
subtraction	addition
since the only arithmetic you need to do to it is addition and subtraction by a small integer a bignum implementation is trivial

25172932
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 31+ firefox

use fgets and sscanf strtod strtol √¢ instead

25172964
floor	sqrt
continue this through j k for j floor sqrt n

25172986
prepare	execute
prepare it once before the loop and execute it with binding of the input values inside the loop for every record

25173025
ostream	setw
you could define 1 fixedwidthval as a template class with parameters for data type typename and width value and 2 an for an ostream and a fixedwidthval that applies setw for each insertion

25173029
getter	setter
in my dao class i have getter and setter for id user_id partner_id app_completed user_name partner_name

25173081
min	max
the aggregate functions min or max do not accept composite types as input

25173132
post	get
i have read that angularjs will automatically handle xsrf protection by sending a header x-xsrf-token on the post request if the first get request returns a cookie named xsrf-token

25173143
free	malloc
notes mem_mallocn mem_freen functions can be replaced by malloc free

25173150
many-to-many	one-to-many
i have many tables with various one-to-many and many-to-many relationships between them

25173170
google-chrome	safari
after all the configuring with various aws services we were able to get this to work only in google-chrome while still failing in safari

25173185
post	get
im working on an android application that sends a post request with a username and password to a server and i successfully get the correct response back

25173185
post	get
however when i try to click on a button that sends another post request after i logged in i get a message back from the server saying that im not logged in

25173241
mdpi	hdpi
i used mdpi hdpi xhdpi and xxhdpi avds

25173272
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
this would allow me to put my ajax in a for-loop and loops through every table arrays rather than hardcode it

25173272
spaces	delimiter
the above ajax servers only the purpose of fetching column names and returning the names in a spaces delimiter string to be parsed and turned into an array via javascript which you can see in my ajax call

25173290
comparator	comparable
first of all you could implement comparable instead of comparator and it would allow you to use collections.sort list instead of collections.sort list s1

25173290
comparator	comparable
now personally i don t like changing the core comparable requirements of object as they may have been defined that way for a reason instead i like to create comparator based on the immediate needs instead for example

25173354
spaces	delimiter
by default scanner uses the delimiter pattern p javawhitespace + which matches at least one white spaces as delimiter

25173364
box-sizing	border-box
just add box-sizing border-box on the input

25173434
google-chrome	firefox
i made the mistake of only testing my website in google-chrome before putting it online and am now quickly trying to patch some of the errors people using firefox and ie are reporting

25173455
margin	height
check to see if the row has padding applied by bootstrap or maybe the image has inherited a margin that is pushing the container row height

25173461
client-side	server-side
i think when compilling widgetset of components vaadin generates javascript representation for my client-side of components and run from them not from java class as server-side vaadin component

25173532
width	height
new point width height

25173565
subtract	add
if you need to offset it due to headers or something like that you can add or subtract an offset after 2 row in order to change the row number

25173566
google-chrome	firefox
in your case it seems that firefox is returning the url function with quotes but google-chrome is not

25173570
rsa	dsa
apps is where all the openssl samples and utilities are like openssl req openssl rsa openssl dsa openssl x509 openssl sign openssl verify etc

25173627
maven	pom.xml
i want to remove a maven dependency in all the pom.xml files

25173644
children	parent
so we can say a person has one father and one mother each parent can have 1 or more children

25173644
children	parent
parent know their children and children know their parent - this should tell you how to model the relationships

25173645
google-chrome	firefox
i run it on firefox google-chrome can t save cookies thanks a lot

25173658
unsigned	short
rather it s an ordinal sort since a char is an unsigned short

25173699
vbo	vao
to get the vbo ids for a currently bound vao you can use glgetvertexattribiv

25173699
vbo	vao
this relies on the fact that a vbo stays alive as long as it s bound to an attribute in a vao

25173742
google-chrome	firefox
see my image on google-chrome how it is supposed to look and then on firefox

25173768

25173807
rcurl	httr
neither httr nor rcurl will execute the javascript required to fill the page with the table you are actually viewing

25173808
for-loop	loops
i understand this is because node.js is inherently single threaded and inside loops the thread is captured by the for-loop

25173830
serializable	deserialization
system.argumentexception error during serializable or deserialization using the json javascriptserializer

25173830
serializable	deserialization

textview	imageview
so now i need to replace the first textview in the above layout to imageview if content being sent is image

from what i understand it looks like you have multiple rows with the same format and you want to hide a button when it is clicked and show the sibling button

25173876
ubuntu	linux
i had the same case on linux ubuntu and just fixed it it seems that os was confused between the root .ssh and home user .ssh dir what i did was

25174124
hide	show
if you are using a list view adapter you can use itemtype to change the entire list item layout good if you are changing the entire layout but can be a bit complicated or you can place an image view at the same location in your layout as the text view and show or hide which ever one you are using

25174124

if showing image show the image view and hide the text view if you are showing the text view show the text and hide the image

25174213
min	max
i want to get the cpu usage average max for a month of a host for 1 min average per core

25174279
getter	setter
i cannot speak for the original author but there are at least five good reasons to use a set method in conjunction with a property getter and possibly a protected setter

25174279
getter	setter
maybe you want to separate your interfaces for covariance such that you need your getter and setter on different interfaces

25174285
subtraction	addition
however you would have to define your own functions for addition subtraction coercion etc

25174302
for-loop	loops
because we know those for-loops are blocking and node runs in a single thread it must complete the entire for-loop within a and finally return before node s event loops gets to take control over it again where b is waiting in the queue to be processes similarly

25174323
nunit	mstest
i want to check if a c# project is nunit or mstest based

25174796
hex	binary
also take into account that if you are using binary data from the fact you are initializing arrays with hex numbers you had better to use unsigned char for binaries as signed char is valid only for -128 to +127 values you can expect some more unpredictable behaviour

25174817
srp	principles
one important rule of thumb is the srp single responsibility principles which says that each class should have only one responsibility and if we apply the same idea to methods - each method should do only one thing

25174858

25174881
versioning	upgrade
dpkg -i package_0.123.deb will upgrade if the versioning of package is less than 0.123 removing the previous versioning if necessary there s an option to force a downgrade too

25174881
versioning	upgrade
apt-get upgrade will upgrade all packages to the newest versioning

25174881

i d be interested to see your output if you fflush stdout after your printf all being protected by a mutex

25175111
dictionary	map
dictionary is a map and apparently uses around 600mb of memory as that is how the app starts but this is not an issue because dictionary is only loaded once and never written to again

hi i have a div with 800 px width and 600 px height

25175173

25175198
folder	directory
if you have already setup the dbgtools to point to your windbg x86 version directory correctly in your cfg ida.cfg but ida pro is still using dbgeng.dll from your windows system folder then probably your ida context is not configured to analyze the ibm pc processor

25175285
setinterval	settimeout
to do animation you have to clear the canvas and redraw the rectangles in their new position at each frame using either setinterval or settimeout or requestanimationframe

25175295
int	chars
c language never performs arithmetic computations withing the domain of chars short or any other type that is smaller than int

25176272
maven	pom.xml
you should search for a public maven repository with project a or and include in your pom.xml

25176272
nexus	artifactory
if it does not exist in public is proprietary in someway or other consider using an enterprise-wide maven repository such as nexus or artifactory to push to repositories

and you get your error because you define route to create action with get http method which is by the way quite bad but your form uses post method

25176478
post	get
you have created get routes but there isn t any routes for post method

25176478
post	get
so instead of having a get ads create have a post ads

25176501
postgresql	mysql
i apologize for a long and somewhat tangential answer but having done various migrations between databases on large amounts of data mysql sql server and postgresql gis and made lots of mistakes on the way i hope i can set you off in the right direction and add a bit of future proofing if you want to start using some other spatial functionality which postigs has in spades

25176505
uiview	subviews
wrap a container uiview around the uiswitches and make sure to set it to clip subviews

for a reason i can t use precompiled version which llvm itself offers for download i ve tested it it doesn t work so i want to build clang and then build ycm both with gcc

25176680
clang	llvm
for ycm to be built i need compiled clang files in the same way that they are in the precompiled package that llvm offers that is there should be these folders

25176680
clang	llvm
now i can build llvm and clang with these commands

25176753

to be able to use it locally through npm init you can include it in the devdependencies and then reference it as . node_modules .bin bower since npm stores executables there

25177470
disk	ram
it handles loading saving of pages from ram to disk

25177541
screens	tablet
i would like that phone and tablet users could either install to the homescreen or include a toggle fullscreen button if they haven t desktop users may use the toggle fullscreen button but it probably doesn t matter as much as they normally have plenty of screens space

25177580
getter	setter
do you have a getter and setter for them also

25177648
prng	random
in the prng case each random byte is generated separately so concatenating two halves really shouldn t help

25178061
textarea	textbox
this is my textbox with textarea

25178110
ubuntu	debian
if this does not work it may be worth checking that solr service actually runs for ubuntu debian - service solr 8983 status or similar for your distro or by checking process list

25178134
put	get
i am new to eloquent and still getting my head round it before i put the where clause it it was working fine now i cant seem to get it to work

width	height
in above code general view is my view which has height 0 and when some action called at that time view height increase and and we will see that view expanding down in that i can not change view s x and y position but in your case first hide your view and when search action calls set hidden no of your view and in my code i increase height so you can increase your width and also change it s x position means decrese i.e you increase width 320 than you decrese it x position to 320

25178206
width	height
you just put your view with search field at the position x 320 y as your requirement width 0 and height as your requirement

int	chars
also there s no need to cast the second argument to chars because strchr takes int there

25178474
client-side	server-side
as you cannot use decimalformat in gwt you have to use numberformat on the client-side and decimalformat on the server-side

25178474
client-side	server-side
unitrate can be a child of offer server-side and offerdto client-side but this is seeming like a rather long-winded way to do it as the unitrate entities need to be created by hand and the only way to do it i have managed is using assisted injection

25178478
jtextfield	jlabel
i am having a panel and on the top of that i am adding jlabel and jtextfield in a row

25178508

sikuli	selenium
as someone who has fairly extensive experience with sikuli and selenium but none at all with autolt i would say that sikuli skills are not very transferable to selenium

25183506
sikuli	selenium
the theory side--the logic and algorithmic thinking you d use to problem solve would be much the same but the technique of execution are so very different between the two that if i were doing the hiring i wouldn t hire a person with no experience in selenium but vast experience in sikuli if there were any reasonable selemium-experienced people to choose from

25184709
equals	gethashcode
but to make it work you need auditcache to implement object and override both gethashcode and equals

or you could have them both implement a class that uses guid objectid as the key equals and gethashcode

25184712

25184740

25184800
cvs	svn
that will produce a .psf file that can then be used to import those projects from your scm tool git svn cvs etc into another workspace

25184802
getter	setter
first you could use rankntypes so that a different functor instance can be used at each call site ensuing you can use the lenslike as both a getter and a setter

25184802
getter	setter
second and probably better is to use the lens type which already is existential -- allowing use as both a getter and a setter

25184802
getter	setter
you have to allow the functor to vary from call site to call site as choosing a particular functor is what changes a lens to a getter or a setter

25184832
put	get
put it all together with gregexpr to search for the matches and regmatches to interpret the results for me i get

25184951

25185507
min	max
one way to do this is by setting an axis min and max

25185507
min	max
it is not possible to simply unset the min and max values - they must be set to something they are always set to something whether you choose what that is or the library chooses...

25185507
min	max
what you can do if you don t want to pre-process your data to get the max is to set a callback function on your chart call and make use of the getextremes and setextremes functions to explicitly set the min max to the values that highcharts would naturally use anyway

25185507
min	max
in that case you ll also need to set all series to visible by default and hide them after you set the axis min max values

25185559
jobs	cron
but i can create some cron jobs that can call scripts pages llike mvc actions

25185585

25186397
post	put
i saw a post suggesting to put the source tmplbl in the sample below on the scene but it makes no difference as illustrated by the sample

25186441

25186625

then use properties to condition the dialogs to show or hide as you launch the msi via msiexec.exe

25189186
stdout	stderr
however stdin still does not work although stdout and stderr work perfectly fine

25189186
stdout	stderr
one interesting thing i found was that while fileno stdout and fileno stderr returned normal values namely 4 and 5 fileno stdin returned -2 which is not even a documented error code of fileno from the doc otherwise the value -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

25189561
rss	feed
alternatively you could add an rss feed or write some reader parser to read the http site and display it within your https site

25189561
rss	feed
unless you can get the http site owner to create an ssl certificate the most secure and permanent solution would be to create an rss feed grabing the content you need presumably you are not actually doing anything on the http site -that is to say not logging in to any system

25189583
goto	break
you could use a goto to break this variable scope and it will make it loop a hell of alot cleaner

25189583
goto	break
warning goto is sometimes dreaded because it is essentially a break in disguise

25189602

let one method query the data from the db suitable for a get method and another for updating the data in your db suitable for a post or update method

bower	jspm	bower	npm	jspm	npm
spm.js bower volo component jspm npm + bower etc

25189666
bower	npm
spm.js manages binaries via the publish command similar to npm where as bower fetches from git endpoints however there s discussion to change this

25189666
bower	npm
spm.js packages are commonjs packages and it s recommended to use it with the module loader sea.js bower is indifferent about module loaders npm isn t optimized for front-end dev yet however bower helps

one of my test dev devices was upgrade to this same versioning of ios and is running the same app

25189788
button	checkbox
an interesting solution is to make this declarative you just give every div that should be shown an attribute automaticallyvisibleifidchecked with the id of the checkbox or radio button on which it depends

25189794
implements	extends
as printtask implements runnable and it doesnot extends thread class you cannot call thread class method

25189809
pem	pkcs#12
try converting to a pem openssl pkcs#12 -in xxxxx.p12 -nodes -nocerts privatekey.pem or using pyopenssl if native code is an option

25189818
post	get
ok tried the button_to to generate a form to post to avoid using get to do post as was the patchy solution above still not working.

25189819
width	height
my understanding is that if you set numberoflines to 1 the label will autoshrink based on width not height

25189839
atomic	lockless
i ve noticed that many lockless algorithms implemented using os-specific primitives such as the spin locks described here which use linux-specific atomic primitives often make use of a cpu relax instruction

25189951
getter	setter
update a fully working example this time using a metaclass and descriptor with both setter and a getter

25189974
serializable	deserialization
restsharp isn t an serializable deserialization framework

25190015
put	get	post	get	post	put

25190222
maven	pom.xml
if you re using maven then additional modules could be defined in your own pom.xml using the property

25190258
google-chrome	firefox
i think this also occurs with firefox and ie but google-chrome renders just fine

25190291
getter	setter
jquery s api is a bit quirky functions like html and val and others that can be both getter and setter are assymmetrical when you re getting they give you the value related to the first element in the set but when you re setting they set on all of the elements in the set

25190347
implements	extends
from java 7 closeable interface has been retrofitted to extends autocloseable interface so that all classes implements closeable interface can work with try-with-resources statement

bindparam	bindvalue
also i wanted to add that i am aware there are several posts with the same error code but they appear to be using bindparam and bindvalue for this

25190382
range	minimum
the default is to subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation but if instead you pass the minimum value as the center and the difference between the maximum and minimum as the scale then it will normalize to the 0 1 range by column

25190400
getter	setter
i know how to use js getter and setter for object properties like so

25190467
try-catch	exception-handling
any old code that relies on catching an exception-handling thrown by close will still be using a normal try-catch block and the exception-handling won t be suppressed because it wouldn t be using try-with-resources

25190475
for-loop	arrays
right now i run a for-loop on my arrays and use if statements to determine if the object belongs to group1 group2 or group3

25190486
put	get
and this works if i copy and past it along but if i try to put it in the custom formula is box i get told

25190491
ssms	ssdt
however i would strongly suggest you first create your view using ssms and get it working because you have a couple of syntax errors that are more critical than the vs ssdt error

25190493
google-chrome	firefox
when i look at this using google-chrome or firefox there is a small empty space at the bottom of the nav-element

25190494
for-loop	loops
instead expose the full range of your data in the for-loop and let the cilk plus runtime worry about scheduling loops iterations

25190532
daemons	launchd
it has autoreload which works both in daemons mode and when launchd directly in terminal

25190558
django	web2py
django memory leaks part i django memory leaks part ii finding and fixing memory leaks in python optimized script for nginx and uwsgi on ubuntu 12.04 this is for web2py but gives some crutches via uwsgi and debugging memory leaks in a wsgi application

is there any working memory profiling for python3 python memory leaks and python memory leak debugging

25190574
width	height
.closecontent is blank you cant click unless you add some text or providing width and height for the div

25190590
for-loop	arrays
this works because you then iterate i through all indexes between the start and end_index just like in a normal for-loop you iterate from 0 to the end of the arrays

25190591
daemons	systemd
basically it suggests starting the daemons with and using systemd or upstart if you re using something other than coreos

25190882
int	double
edit numbers of such magnitude are not represented by long int but by double precission floats

25190958
folder	directory

25190962
for-loop	arrays
i m doing some comparisons inside of that for-loop and in some cases i need to remove the current leftblock from the arrays

25192169

25200300
children	parent
to solve that issue i had to align one of the children to the right i actually set the 2 children to align parent left and played with children padding in order to get one of the children positionned on the top right corner

25200312
innodb	myisam

post	put
both put and post can be used for creating

25201768
ilist	icollection	viewmodel	caliburn.micro
and i dont know the caliburn.micro bindablecollection but mainly you should use an iobserable inheriting collection in viewmodel and an ilist or icollection in model

these user-functions then should get extracted from the options and put into my own beforesend and complete functions so i can do some system stuff in them before the user functions are triggered

25202778
post	get
you can workaround it by first accessing your form with a get request just like a browser would do it then get the csrf token from the cookies which the server set and then sending a post request including the retrieved csrf token

25203156
gif	png
looking at the image details with i can see that even though i have successfully converted a png or gif to a jpg and it has a jpg file extension the mime type is still image png or image gif

25203230
hide	show
one alternative would be to use the show hide parameter in the text box to control which of the images gets hidden

25203230
hide	show
you would set both images to show in each box and write a conditional formula the inverse of your formula above pretty much to hide an image based on value

25203261

in the above string max 260 min 20 is optional

25203271

versioning	upgrade
you could ask microsoft or your software supplier about getting a licence for more than 250 users with the 2010 versioning or you could upgrade to the latest versioning

25203432
children	parent
not optimal as you need to fetch all children into memory for each parent

25203432
children	parent
on the other hand you will not need to create a separate query for each parent object instead just two queries is enough one to fetch the parent instances the other to prefetch the children instances

25203461
public	protected
if you want to mess with drawing of the object you should override public void draw canvas canvas and not protected void ondraw canvas canvas

25203461

width	height
make sure your textview width and height match be the same in dp if you want a perfect unstretched circle

25203798

if you still need it a proper circle then i guess you will need to set its height dynamically after setting text in it new height should be as much as its new width so as to make a proper circle

25203801
portrait	landscape
you could lock the activity in one orientation by adding android screenorientation portrait or landscape to in your manifest

25203850
many-to-many	many-to-one
this allows it to prefetch many-to-many and many-to-one objects which cannot be done using select_related in addition to the foreign key and one-to-one relationships that are supported by select_related

25203850
children	parent
then you can fetch parent and children in just 2 queries

25203850
children	parent
or you can fetch children with parent in just 1 query

25203850
children	parent
you can even get the specific parent from the children

width	height
first cell contains an image that has 100 width and dynamic height

25203957
post	get
if i have to use get how i will able to access the id from a url like ths one post second-post-cool-title 3 like

25203959
for-loop	loops
put this inside a for-loop for the number of times you need it to run and change each constant that would change per sheet for a variable which you can set inside loops

25204077
width	height
you d better to have a high resolution image of your button that you ll strech in libgdx taking care of width height ratio

25204232
submit	submission
have you explored a different architecture where instead of your other app submission big uploads it submit pointers to the big payloads

25204263
unsigned	short
and the next pointer is a pointer to a short int or unsigned short int

25204276
folder	directory
both keys are in .ssh directory apache is set up to access them as well as copies in var www apache home folder by default i did it to avoid confusion in case apache uses keys only from there

25204282
google-chrome	firefox
wheel seems to work for both firefox and google-chrome

25204285
width	height
my idea here is to maximize the font size based on the textarea height maybe i should also consider the width

25204285
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my issue is that the code above produce different results based on the browser in google-chrome and safari the font size at the end of the loop is the same on firefox is the double i don t really understand what s going on

25204285
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so basically on google-chrome safari if there is no placeholder the font size at the end of the iteration is equal to the size i get on firefox

25204291

gdk doesn t show up in manage nuget packages gtk neither

25204342
folder	directory
gives you the root context location or the project location folder or you can say the current directory when jvm was started

25204352
folder	directory
in eclipse i believe the working directory is the top level project folder not in src or it s in the folder that contains the compiled .class files

25204398
google-chrome	firefox
however in firefox 31.0 i don t know if there is a way to duplicate google-chrome s developer appcache console log

25204401
post	get
because you post object but not a string that is why you get 404

25204423

put	get
i want to put these coordintes into a vector or list or something that i can get back on android

25204510
base-class	derived-class
but if i see it right then i would have to bring the base-class functions to the derived-class namespace

25204535
for-loop	arrays
to create an arrays of objects change your for-loop to use push

25204582
firefox	safari
note that it does work in safari and firefox in both cases the date inserted by the calendar widget is in the format aug 8 2014

25204646

25204676
width	height
i am creating cells with width and height of uiimage

25204684

25204699
rss	feed
the rss feed of the page could be found here

25204746
base-class	derived-class
but if i see it right then i would have to bring the base-class functions to the derived-class namespace

25204753
hide	show
my workaround to achieve it would be use three buttons and when the user touch any of them i should hide the current view and show other view

25204763
hide	show
splitter panes hide the overflow so if your menu is in a position so it would show outside of the pane it is in you need to override the css responsible for that

25204820
subclass	abstract-class
i would suggest create to abstract subclass of uicollectionviewcell with properties like image title desc and two subclasses of the abstract-class for example ipadcell and iphonecell

25204825
width	height
now pin all four sides of the inner view to that of the scroll view as well as its width and height

25204902

the key difference between the two types is which process is responsible for file i o and maintaining the integrity of the db your app or a separate server process like sql server interbase firebird mysql

25204903

i accidentally typed or used variables twice for addition and subtraction strangely the result output came without any errors

25204966
post	get
get post requests mainly

25204980
cpython	ironpython
swig-python isn t going to work - it generates cpython extensions and ironpython doesn t support those

25205173
hash	md5
one thing you could try is to take a name and md5 hash it

25205208
hide	show
i know too that you can show hide html elements by using these classes from bootstrap responsive utilities but i need to give an id to all buttons text fields so i don t know if i can duplicate these elements and wrap each of then inside a div that will be show on a specific environment since two elements with the same id is wrong by html specifications

25205216
implements	extends
this way you may simply extends this class and implements the paintcomponent method like you would do for any jpanel

25205222
folder	directory
it would work by the user being able to select a folder where they store their movies and it will take in all the file names including the ones in any sub directory

25205266
hide	show
problem is it hide on button click but when you do inspect element it show the textbox element with property disabled

25205286
implements	modifiers
if the inner class does not implements any interface or inheritance then there is no point of specifying access modifiers

25205308
hide	show
you can hide and show elements in any number of ways

25205326
filtering	grouping
then match again that grouping this time with outgoing relationships to any node and filtering that to make sure the endnode is in cs

25205332
getter	setter
don t you need something like the property collection doldur and its getter and setter getdoldur and setdoldur

25205332
getter	setter
don t you have to declare string √§ bannumber then you have the getter and setter getibannumber and setibannumber and then

25205395
emacs	gedit
my os is ubuntu and i am using the default python interpreter and gedit or emacs for editing

25205432
rspec	capybara
essentially they recommend to move the include capybara dsl to the rspec configuration see why do i get including capybara dsl in the global scope is not recommended

25205480
restrict	shared
the shared restrict resources setup disposal operations appear for many reasons either at the very begining or at the very end of the system life-cycle

25205534
pop-up	dialog
and have a button that pop-up this dialog box

25205550

25205646
width	height
i have a task where i need to display an image slider with some text caption which i write in each image and jquery animation fading effect.the slider should be 100 in width for all screen size and it should take the custom height of the image

25205646

have an absolutely positioned width height 100 top left 0 div overlayed on the body then do e.g

25205689
union	distinct
hint the result of a union is distinct by default

25205713
flask	django
i also recommend something lighter like flask to start with as you will use more raw python and learn to setup your own scaffold and folder structure which will help you understand django behind the scenes

25205714
post	get
what struck me as unusual was that it didn t come with any built-in support for creating and reading responses to simple get and post requests

25205715
portrait	landscape
in portrait mode it correctly loads the activities however in landscape it crashes when attempting to load the fragment class assosciate with the list item

25205719
width	height
the only issue here assuming that the two images to display have the same resolution denoted by w x h where w is the width and h is the height is that facet_wrap will enforce all panels to have the same x y- limits

25205727
alpn	sni
modern tls features sni alpn and falls back to sslv3 if the

25205729
width	height
there is workaround that you add div around table width height 100 and display inline-block but it is an ugly hack

you are extends a trait which has a non implements method you must implements it in the extends classes or you can implements it in the trait if you don t need the foo with a single variable you can do

25208147
implements	extends

an image with aspect ratio 1 3 will scale 3 pixels in height for each pixel in width

25208288
width	height
an image width aspect ratio 1 2 will scale only 2 pixels in height for each pixel in width

25208288
width	height
so changing the width of the columns by one pixel will make the resulting height differ if they were aligned before

ok this solution is based on the known fact that some properties like padding-top and margin-top when given values in percentage are calculated based on the width of an element rather than its height

25220399
width	height
making an element √¢ ≈ìas high√¢ as required by the known dimensions of a responsive image can be done by using padding-top √¢ i used a value of 66.54 here based on your image√¢ s dimensions half the image height divided by the width times 100 to span the container element up to the required height

25220425

width	height
however thumbnail does not need the width and height field so you can see the different

25222006
swift	objective-c
one problem is that usually if you use swift you have to declare objective-c todayviewcontroller above the class declaration file to enable the app to find the class

25222011
division	modulo
which like most people correctly pointed out is just doing a modulo 2 means remainder of division through 2 and looking if that remainder is bigger than 0 meaning the expression will be true if x is an odd number with

25222020
pop-up	dialog
after insert method inserted data successfully i want to show dialog pop-up with message success

25222044
getter	setter
i have read that this determines how the framework accesses your field s information -- either directly from the field or from the getter setter of the field

25222059
direct3d	directx
also if the memory usage you see going up is physical memory in task manager this is not directx as direct3d will store all texture information in server memory ie vram

25222084
hash	salt
password_hash generates some random salt and together with the clear text password creates the hash

25222099
inherited	properties
gridviewcolumnext is a class that inherited from gridviewcolumn and adds the visibility properties

25222108
setinterval	settimeout
i tried setinterval and settimeout but it did not give me the result i desired

25222112
single-quotes	double-quotes
because the python string is enclosed in double-quotes we can put single-quotes around the regex inside it

25222186
int	double
you will get double false because the new keyword creates a new int object each time and hence bypasses the cache

25222206
width	height
you can use the img tag of course and in css i say this because i ve tried and i am almost sure when you rotate something for example of 90deg the height become the width and the width the height

25222206
width	height
so probably to fit you ll have to use width instead of height and viceversa

25222206
width	height
in fact i think you should use height 100 and width 100 in the css for the image and edit the dimension of the parent div instead

25222250
post	put
using http post or put with multipart form

25222288
highcharts	highstock
when we make highstock graph by series then we can t pass x-axis seprated data as per like highcharts

25222304
width	height
however since i am using fitviewport when i call gdx.graphics.getheights or .getwidth it s getting the height and width of the entire screen including the black areas when i increase one side only

25222330
getter	setter
no matter what i try with synthesize or dynamic or manually coding my setter and getter i keep getting this unrecognized selector sent to instance error when i compile

25222331
width	height
i know three ways to achieve a single interactive effect in this example when a user hover on a div the inner element will expand it s width and height

25222380
width	height
but i ll often set #wrapper to be close to window height and width like this

25222383
int	double
however when you then multiply -1794967296 with sizeof double which is of type std size_t which is an unsigned int type fun things happen

25222383
multiplying	modulo
when you multiplying this by sizeof double it overflows again but unsigned overflow is well-defined and returns the result modulo 2 64 for 64-bit operands so the final result is 18446744059349813248

25222392
post	put
i wasn t sure if i had to put the code here because this post would become pretty big

25222414
width	height
a classic error with images is confusion about what width and height represent in terms of rows and columns in the array

25222414
width	height
a bufferedimage must be of size width x height which might correspond to pxls 0 .length x pxls length and not the contrary

25222433
http	spdy
holb has several causes of which packet retransmission is one but it s not the one relevant to http and spdy

25222433
http	spdy
the one relevant to http and spdy is the fact that in http 1.x multiple requests must be responded in order

25222433
http	spdy
with multiplexed protocols like spdy and http 2 instead this type of holb does not exist because the second small response can arrive to the client well before the first large response they can even be interleaved

25222433
http	spdy
or first all the http packets of response 1 and then all the http packets of response2 while in spdy and http 2 they may be out of order or even interleaved

25222433
http	spdy
the lack of this kind of holb in spdy and http 2 makes these protocols more efficient than http 1.x

25222433
http	spdy
the holb caused by tcp retransmissions affects any tcp based protocol included multiplexed protocols like spdy and http 2 and duplex protocols like http 1.x

25222436
width	height
i have one div that is responsible in width and height

25225138
int	chars
using character.gettype int cp instead of character.isuppercase has the advantage that it only needs to look at the code point once for multiple all chars classes

25225164
int	double
on modern systems double is typically 64 bits and can represent int up to about 2 53 exactly

25225164
int	double
if you call modf with a value greater than 2 53 then the double value itself can t necessarily hold an exact int value

25225164
int	double
a long double depending on the implementation might be able to hold a wider range of exact int values than even the widest int type

25225164
int	double
on such a system making modfl return an int would lose precision relative to having it return long double

25225164
floating-point	integer
so having modf and modff and modfl return an integer rather than a floating-point value would lose range without any corresponding gain in precision

width	height
since the border area is included in the overall size of the frame the border effectively obscures a portion of the frame constraining the area available for rendering and or displaying subcomponents to the rectangle which has an upper-left corner location of insets.left insets.top and has a size of width - insets.left + insets.right by height - insets.top + insets.bottom

25225712
fadein	fadeout
also i wants to fadein dark red box then fadeout dark red box after it dark green fadein and fadeout dark green and consecutively every box in a loop and the whole process should work continously and when someone hover it should stop fading and start fading on mouseout

25225716
width	height
vw and vh stand for viewport width and viewport height respectively

25225716
width	margin
the difference between using width 100vw instead of width 100 is that while 100 will make the element fit all the space available the viewport width has a specific measure in this case the width of the available screen including the document margin

vbo	vao
a vao vertex array object is a list of binding points for vbos that encapsulates information such as data format and number of components for each vbo that is bound to it

25230222
int	double
the ternary operator requires both result values be the same type so the int undergoes an automatic safe widening cast to double

25230247
int	double
i don t think it s good design to return one of an int or a double depending on the value -- if you want to round something off use math.floor and if you don t want decimals printed use printf

wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 36.0.1985.125 safari 537.36

25230381
google-chrome	safari
clearly safari and google-chrome are two totally different browser products even if their rendering engines share a heritage so why would safari also be true for google-chrome

25230381
google-chrome	safari
this seems strange but then if you look at the google-chrome user-agent string again you ll notice that safari is referred to by name as well

25230386
screens	tablet
if the tablet s screens is h inches high this could be calculated from the aspect ratio and diagonal length

25230505
udp	tcp
it is not possible to connect to a tcp udp server by its mac address you must use its ip address

25230505
udp	tcp
every tcp udp server has an ip address even behind a nat

25230505
udp	tcp
tcp udp are designed around ip and are transport-agnostic so they can run on networks that are not based on ethernet mac to begin with

25230513

all char-types chars signed chars and unsigned chars are treated as text elements not int

25230518
for-loop	arrays
i need to use the for-loop and display all the images in the arrays

25230551
free	malloc
i left out the assertions required after malloc and before free but you generally need them as well.

25230624
screens	tablet
as long as you follow the best practices for screens independence your application should work well on larger screens such as tablet

25230691
google-chrome	firefox
converting the file newlines to windows and then back to unix cured the issue and now both google-chrome firefox identify newlines as unix newlines correctly

25230696

25230815
switching	screens
this not happen when i switching from a tab to another doing swiping on the screens

25230826
mouseup	mousedown
since it doesn t you ll need to attach your own mousedown mouseup listeners to the overlay canvas

25230880
for-loop	arrays
to fix it an arrays way you would use a for-loop

25230881
redhat	fedora	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	opensuse	debian
if there is demand for your software that tarball is then packaged for various distributions by their packagers so that people can install it through whatever package manager that distribution uses apt-get install yourpkg on debian ubuntu yum install yourpkg on fedora redhat opensuse etc. or a gui such as gnome software

25230918
for-loop	loops
please note i intentionally used for loops instead of possible vectorisation apply functions to make it easier to understand those who are familiar with apply functions will also undertand the for-loop

25230979
websphere	ibm
com.ibm.websphere.jaxrs.server.disableibmjaxrsengine true in ibm websphere

folder	directory
you may use local directory or you may manually copy googlemaps.py to site-packages folder

25231013
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox and google-chrome

25231028
cpu	processors
since our processors executes several billion instructions per second this implies processing a state takes about a million cpu instructions

25231046
apache	nginx
replace apache with nginx

25231048
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
if you are trying to make something with for yourself and you aren t trying to make it work for everyone you can use a userscript which can run under firefox google-chrome safari and opera

25231061
getter	setter
as padraic explains in a comment you don t need getter and setter like this in python and it s generally considered bad style

25231071
portrait	landscape
you can go even further and make also different layouts for portrait and landscape views by specyfing another keyword in directory s name

25231122
children	parent
most answers involve passing between two forms passing from mdi parent to mdi child or between two mdi children

25231123

google-chrome	firefox
and also it s good practice to test your application on a google-chrome firefox or any modern browser

25231198
min	max
you can achieve this by specifying the same dimension for min and max

25231217
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
to manipulate the user defaults you must either use the cfpreferences or nsuserdefaults apis programmatically or from a command line use the defaults program

25231278
margin	height
i m not sure why since the block-containers and margin don t go over the 11in height

25231278
width	height
each badge has a width of 4 inches and a height of 3 inches

25231278
width	height

is it possible to create fixed width button in top bar with full height

25231312
rbac	acl
so here we ve set the stage for as far as i understand it acl where the posts can be altered by their owner and rbac where users can have roles to give them access to resources regardless of their individual requirements

25231312
wordpress	phpbb
i know this implementation would work just fine i decided to check phpbb s and wordpress s mysql structure before actually doing this

25231312
wordpress	phpbb
i ve noticed that in phpbb wordpress rather than naming their permissions in the column name they have the following

25231330
skaction	skemitternode
this method creates an skemitternode calculates how long the emitter will take to run based on its properties and the duration parameter and adds an skaction to the emitter to remove it from the scene after it is done running

25231444
put	get
however when i put something like list x y and int x and int y are outside of r or r1 which are runnable i get an error that says that only static variables can go inside of this new object

25231444
for-loop	loops
is there any way i can use these variables so i can make a for-loop or while loops to make something like list x y instead of hardcore list 0 0 like how it is right now

25231519
public	protected
you can occasionally use protected methods effectively but protected instance variables are an abomination. you should never use get set functions for the same reason√¢ they re just overly complicated ways to make a field public though access functions that return full-blown objects rather than a basic-type value are reasonable in situations where the returned object s class is a key abstraction in the design . -

25231534
implements	extends
then you can implements your own tab container by extends horizontalscrollview

25231540
put	get
which works fine when i put both together in an html file but the function does not get executed after i load the html output from the php script

25231586
post	get
when i tried to use my relation say post.build_author i get uninitialized constant post author

25231590

if you are trying to receive form data from client then you can use post or get method to receive data from client to server

25231614
gif	png
i use it regularly to convert psds to jpg png gif

25231621
int	chars
in c i can create a pointer to chars then tell the compiler i want to use it as a pointer to int

25231621
perl	tcl
even in perl or tcl you can t take a string and just interpret its bytes as an integer

25231621
perl	tcl
in that sense perl tcl and javascript appear to do a lot of implicit conversions a + 1 gives you a1 while python does a lot fewer a + 1 raises an exception but 1.0 + 1 does give you 2.0

25231621
perl	tcl
i don t think there s any sense in which 2 is an instance of the string type in perl or javascript√¢ although in tcl it actually is since everything is an instance of string

25231622
getter	setter
roughly because we are talking about the usual hipothesis of the getter and setter just reading and writing to the instance variable not doing any additional processing

25231655
button	checkbox
need help with checking checkbox and finish button

25231662
ubuntu	linux
the system is ubuntu linux 3.2.0-65-generic #98-ubuntu smp wed jun 11 20 27 07 utc 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 gnu linux

25231664
getter	setter
if you create in person a setter getter for dateofbirth then you are tying the implementations of person to have such a property and to implement the operations as check current date agains dateofbirth property and return true based in the number of years

25231664
getter	setter
while it is making a good point that even access through getter setter has its consequences it is hard to imagine that attributes are used only internally to the class that holds them

25231675
prepare	execute
i ve been able to execute multiple prepare statements using mysqli in php

25231676
apache	nginx
nginx haproxy and apache are docker containers

25231676

25231706
switching	screens
it is possible to quickly switching between both split screens

25231715
ubuntu	debian
as a sidenote for people who are on debian and ubuntu it is usually enough to run

25231715
ubuntu	debian
again using debian ubuntu paths a .kerlrc could look like

25231719
width	height
you can easily append a using d3.select ... .append svg and set the width and height there

25231724
width	height
one docx file contains text information of a product start serial number length width and height

25231724
width	height
i open the first docx file and copy all of the text information serial length width and height

25231733
mpmath	sympy
sympy uses mpmath to provide arbitrary precision floating point numbers

25231733
mpmath	sympy
the options are there in mpmath they just aren t exposed in the sympy printers

25231735
super	implements
i solved the problem by initializing the entity object differently if you implements the initiation method from super class nsmanagedobject like in group.swift

25231763
hash	salt
the reason two hash of the same password don t match for you is because the result of create_hash includes the salt which is randomly generated

25231763
hash	salt
to get the same hash you have to provide the salt as you validate

25231763
hash	salt
finally just to reiterate you do not need to store the salt in a separate column just leave the big 70-80 character chunk it returns alone as your hash and let the functions take care of everything for you - anything else is a waste of time and resources

25231773
memcpy	memmove
an alternative is to use memmove √¢ and not memcpy because in general the areas being moved overlap √¢ like this

25231774
children	parent
i have of course gathered that this is expected behavior from using dependent destroy for the has_many children association since it is clearly calling the destroy for the child first if one exists then calling destroy for the original parent

25231774
children	parent
thanks to pdobb s suggestion below i was able to figure out a resolution to my specific issue using only one database query by limiting the collection of returned standingevents to only those records without any parent children associated records or records that were parent

25231802
int	chars
operands of arithmetic or enumeration type. this means that objects of type chars will be converted to objects of type int when they are used in expressions as indices in the subscript operator

25231819
post	get
post data to a rest server and get a complete record in return

25231825

put	get
code is working to get motion and gyro updates put into arrays respectively and select the max value in the array if a capture event occurs

25231842
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i am suddenly having a very odd issue where my browsers google-chrome safari firefox are not downloading an external css file

25231860
children	parent
you could use directive controllers and require for the communication between parent and children directives

25231873
folder	directory
i put platforms folder to exe directory and now application runs but crashes immediately in ntdll.dll

25231920
min	max
your query isn t working because min column and max column in sql returns an evaluation aggregate of all rows so doesn t know what value to have for every row in the non-aggregate query in your question

25231920
min	max
if you really need the min and max you could return them in separate select statements so your dataset has 3 tables if you re using ado

25231923
put	get
i was going to get rid of the totals worksheet and have this portion done in code but i have to go and i wanted to go ahead and put this out there

25231940

i have a uiview with a uiimageview at the very top a uilabel below it a uibutton below that and a uisegmentedcontrol that determines what determines what embedded uiview to display at the bottom which also a choice to not show any at all

25231940
switching	screens
i ve run into the problem where i ve set up all of my constraints in the interface builder and everything seems to be fine when i switching between screens sizes in the storyboard

25231955
aggregate-functions	sum
an aggregate-functions is a function that returns one result for many rows - like sum in your example

25231964
aggregate-functions	sum
you can see here how the aggregate-functions sum could be described as working on a separate plane from the style_ref column so it d be hard to combine those into a single one without group by

25232001
portrait	landscape
the xml sources are rather complex with included for portrait and landscape so i rather link the repository

25232074
width	height
edit i have put the tree inside a dialog i got this idea that the scrolling of the tree takes the height width and coordinates from the window instead of the dialog s

25232155
width	height
the canvas element response different if you set width height with css from the attributes set

25232155
width	height
canvas is stretched when using css but normal with width height properties

25232236
textview	imageview
i know i can do this using linearlayout - containing both imageview and textview but i am trying to limit nesting of the views

25232361
implements	sealed
the class is sealed and implements the idisposable pattern

25232403
width	height
i thought that would work but it only listens when the width of the window gets resized not the height

25232406
for-loop	loops
i read somewhere that all variables that grow inside of a for-loop nested inside of a matlab parfor loops must be preallocated but in this case i have a variable that is preallocated but might grow later

25232429
for-loop	loops
which means the continue inside eval cannot find any loops the for-loop

25232435
for-loop	arrays
how can the for-loop know when the arrays ends

25232440
google-chrome	firefox
its all working in firefox and internet explorer but not in google-chrome

25232443
post	get
there is a built-in validation layer of protection that asp.net enforces for both get and post based asp.net ajax web methods which is that regardless of the http verb being used asp.net always requires that the http content-type header is set to the value application json

25232458
int	chars
as eckes suggested i printed the int values of the chars as they are passed into the method chars via

25232477
super	extends
the super keyword in the argument of the 2nd case is simply to allow elements to be added to it.if it had been a collection of any kind which extends a particular type then you would not have been able to add an element

25232482
qmainwindow	qwidget
parent widget of qwidget in red is qmainwindow then geometry reference by qmainwindow

25232482
qpushbutton	qwidget
parent widget of qpushbutton is qwidget green then geometry reference by qwidget green

25232482
qmainwindow	qwidget
but qwidget have independent with qmainwindow

25232531
int	double
if this fact leaves you wondering what happened to the int keep in mind that double can represent int perfectly with up to 53 bits of precision

25232541

it currently works in safari and firefox but google-chrome is keeping the highlight in the bottom of the td with the rowspan only when moving up in the table

25232576
express	node.js
i am attempting to simplify some web server code node.js and express and i would like to use only one app.get statement for simplicity

25232591
maven	pom.xml
but your maven profile should be defined inside your pom.xml with an id

25232644
letter-spacing	font-size
your probleme comes from white-space from html center displayed as inline-block and font-size letter-spacing probably dealed different in chrome

25232645
put	get
we are using wcf restfully as well so i d like to keep this clean by just having a bunch of overloaded put methods get etc

25232649
google-chrome	firefox
not sure if this will work across all browsers devices but does seem to work on firefox and google-chrome os x

25232667
put	get
leaning how it is put together and get a basic empty page up

25232692
put	get
when i put a wrapper around it to print an eps image i get the following error

25232707
post	get
searching around the two post i found that might be appropriate contained solutions that did not get me anywhere

build.gradle	gradlew
if you add the following code snippet to the top of your build.gradle file gradlew will update the build tools

25232811
getter	setter
hello everyone i had a problem while running the following program in the last loop it only print three 0 without displaying any result i am not sure what is wrong with the program perhaps it has something to do with the constructor however when i write my getter method in the second last loop with setter method it display the correct result

25232860
sequence	permutation
edit the algorithm now runs through all possible permutation of skipping arrays when selecting the next bigger number in the sequence

25232882
google-chrome	firefox
come to think of it you could probably do this yourself using a browser script injection plugin like tampermonkey or greasemonkey google-chrome and firefox respectively. i little bit of fairly straight forward javascript should give you pretty good results

25232948
google-chrome	firefox
same goes for ie google-chrome and firefox works

25232952
width	height
the width and height of the element are higher that the container w h

25232958
width	height
or calculate the width and height based on the device density

25232959
min	max
between the min and max entries of x we increment by 2 in this example

25232967
fflush	gets
the issue is that when you connect to the corp vpn your routing table gets fflush with only what is needed to connect to the office

25232968
integer	fractions	division	multiplication
the portion of the program giving me trouble is made to take a hex value which is a fractions of 2 32 and convert it to an integer value and perform some simple math on it multiplication and division using the following bit of programming

25233039
onresume	onpause
i have declared and initialised the broadcastreceiver.class in my onresume but after i unregister inside onpause next time my app launches it wont send messages any more only if i send the regid again and register with the gcm server as well

25233060
nsviewcontroller	nssplitview
however when creating an nssplitview using storyboards there are 3 scenes created one for the split view itself and one for each of the right left nsviewcontroller instances

25233062
width	height
and in css give prefered width and height for the .overflow

25233071
folder	directory
xy.html is in the same directory as its calling file which is in a template folder in django parlance

25233077
jython	pypy
pypy jython etc

25233079
int	double
as written you perform arithmetic on two int then convert the result to double

25233081
listview	gridview
i don t want to write this from scratch but have been unable to find any examples of drag and drop gridview or listview with reordering and addition

25233122
hindi	persian
is it possible to install different languages keyboards like urdu hindi or persian on windows phone 7 emulator

25233124
daemon	cron
use magento s cron it s bascially a wrapper around the normal cron daemon setup is really simple just add these lines to your config

25233129
put	get
imo if you put the const on the right side instead of the left it would be simpler to get it right and not mess constant pointers with constant objects

25233163
getlasterror	shellexecuteex
an immediate call to getlasterror after calling shellexecuteex always returned 0

25233181
hide	show
assuming that for your case it would also be fine to show hide the details with a toggle button you could add such re-usable behavior with a few simple lines of code

25233218
post	get
it lets you work with json and xml calls are async and it has a get post params builder so you can easily set up your params

25233272
ubuntu	linux
1 - i develop a working c++ c program on ubuntu linux for ubuntu which uses some libraries which are platform-independent such as openssl boost gnu scientific library dcmtk and others these are generally available from apt-get and are installed properly

25233301
int	chars
again all of these are the values at 1 0 in the array which is an array of int not chars

25233324
pop-up	dialog
actually when my form is submitted with the submit button i would want that the javascript code is executed for checking datas and if datas are not filled to open a pop-up dialog and so don t execute the action bounded to the form

25233363
getter	setter
once the class has been rewritten with the updated fields and corresponding getter setter methods it s available to be set

25233385
xstream	jackson
i am using jackson and xstream to let spring do the de-serialization of my java object into json or xml output

25233405
onclick	onsubmit
i think you will find your form submit is overriding your onclick handler it would be more reliable in my opinion to catch the form onsubmit event since the button is of type submit

25233527
int	chars
if plain chars happens to be signed in your implementation and if the value happens to be negative then it will be promoted to a negative int value which is probably not what you want

25233552
pop-up	dialog

25234134
width	height
also i cannot change width and height of the divs in my application

25234174
width	height
the width and top and bottom padding is calculated by the ratio of width height of the image you want to use

25234174

25234430
apache	nginx
this approach works fine for a small number of closely related web servers apache and nginx ironically have very similar api s that can be easily wrapped but obviously this approach will become more and more untenable as the project expands

25234439
apache	nginx
php runs as different user apache or nginx

this is a duplicate of my addition to blackboard s edugarage forums but to get it into the public domain i ve put it here

25234853
content-length	content-type
content-length xml_length header content-type application xml

25234859
screens	tablet
when using drawables you have to focus on pixel density rather than screens resolution because as you have just found out a small or regular screens device can have exactly the same resolution as a large screens device to top it off sometimes a normal screens device handset can have a higher resolution than a large screens device tablet where obviously in this case the handset has a much higher pixel density

25234859
screens	hdpi
note android also supports low-density ldpi screens but you normally don t need to create custom assets at this size because android effectively down-scales your hdpi assets by 1 2 to match the expected size

25234859
tablet	galaxy	tablet	hdpi
in your case whats happening is that your galaxy tablet has a lower pixel density and android down-scales the image from a xxhdpi to whatever density the tablet has hdpi or xhdpi ....so it your image is a 512px image android would down-scale it to 341px for xhdpi or 256px for an hdpi device

25234859
screens	mdpi
actually according to this link the galaxy tab 2 has mdpi screens which means your image will be scale down three times from xxhdpi

25234866
filtering	grouping
i am trying to do xslt grouping within a call template while applying a filtering

25234889
int	double
means this function can take an unknown number of parameters of unspecified types and because it is unspecified the standardization of numeric types to int and double happens to all printf parameters except the first that was specified

25234889
int	double
note that types bigger than double and int are not converted such as long int long double long long etc

25234891

if the last part of the filename is more reliable no unexpected underscores you could reverse it and use charindex to find the fourth underscore and reverse the substr again afterwards

25235462
folder	directory
i know this example isn t too concrete as it depends on what directory is being used but you can try replacing directory with a file path to a given folder and .nc to .txt or some string that is present in a bunch of files within the folder

25235473
int	double
if you simply need to initialize int float or double quantities to zero only you can use cudamemset

4+2 3 either way you have to multiplying before you can add

25235635
single-quotes	double-quotes
otherwise if you need to deal with the single-quotes you could replace them with double-quotes then parse as json

25235747
children	parent
all nodes created as children of the same parent as html-elements

25235747
children	parent
all elements should be draggable and children divisions should be moving together with parent division

gridview	rowdatabound
the rowdatabound event is raised when a data row represented by a gridviewrow object is bound to data in the gridview control

25236078
google-chrome	firefox
you need to use firebug for firefox or developer console for google-chrome to see the live dom

25236081
stateless	stateful
a stateful service is typically harder to develop and scale than stateless services

25236081
stateless	stateful
in the case of a server failover restart the client might not be affected if stateless services are used but will likely have problems with a stateful service

25236127
width	height
this automatically makes the width of the background image 100 and scales the height accordingly

25236127

which scales the image to the largest size such that both its width and its height can fit inside the content area.

25236133
ember.js	qunit
i m writing integrations tests for an ember.js app using qunit

25236138

some mixers and datalines are missing in safari browser but are present in firefox

25236411
explode	implode
i know we must use implode and explode but i do not know how to implement them

25236480
floating-point	integer
so if you force it to do floating-point division then call int on the result instead of letting it to integer division you will get the same results as in c++

25236536
g++	gcc
check where your g++ and gcc executable are located

25236536
g++	gcc
in this point if you get a path for gcc g++ your linux installation is likely ok and eclipse can t find gcc and g++

25236536
g++	gcc
then go to eclipse yourproject properties and set path command for gcc and g++

25236612
stdout	stderr
it s worth noting that passthru also receives stdin and writes directly to stdout and stderr

25236766

25236862
swift	objective-c
very important is the fact that you cannot use c++ code in your swift code without having a objective-c ++ wrapper

25236862
swift	objective-c
swift uses the same runtime as the existing objective-c system and the idea of automatic reference counting

25236862
swift	objective-c
so in my humble opinion a basic knowledge of objective-c and the ideas behind helps to write better and more performant swift code

25236876
ant	maven
turns out that it was being included because one of the maven dependencies was including ant as a dependency and the ant jar has the logo

25236894
pdfsharp	migradoc
hi i am using pdfsharp migradoc to generate column chart

25236902
feedback	review
before stating working on it i was reading the review on forum on report automation so i thought i should get some feedback on the following questions

25236936
ng-show	ng-hide
make sure to add ng-hide or ng-show to the new div so it s only shown if the input is disabled

25236969
hide	show
we have a requirement to refresh the form after saving to ensure that some hide show logic works as expected based on a field value

25236985
swift	objective-c
learning either objective-c or swift is not the hard part

25237028
post	get
now in your resource class where you have defined your get post methods

25237041
getter	setter
maintenance of consistency of the json structure may be encapsulated in to a particular object with getter and setter as well

25237055
swift	objective-c
so my advice is the following if you really hate objective-c use swift as the main development language but learn objective-c basics in order to be able to read it at least

25237058
post	put
if the post method expects a basic type value such as string type in my case then you have to put frombody before the argument

25237097
implements	extends
but actualy you can implements extends by your own if you don t wish to use jquery extends method it s pretty easy

25237178
coalesce	isnull
in your dbms coalesce might be called isnull or ifnull

25237188
post	put
you are modifying a resource so put post or patch are appropiate methods

25237222
awt	swing
i suggest you create a small awt swing wrapper and use the web-view to display the web-application in the simple broswer

25237256
octal	decimal
the 14 vs 11 may be because the label on the card is in octal the address in the code is in decimal although the numbers don t quite add there...

25237261
jobs	cron
i could find only little information while googling the subject and so far found that cron jobs should go in the console folder

25237411
dlsym	dlopen
shared objects can also be dynamically loaded at runtime using dlopen 3 then dlsym to get some symbols inside them

25237450
folder	directory
my application has a virtual directory that points to a shared folder of images on a remote file server

25237450
folder	directory
but in iis the virtual directory is configured to use specific domain account credentials to access the shared folder so everything should be fine regarding access

25237459
hash	md5
the md5 hash is not available for every object

25237459
hash	md5
while most objects have an md5 hash many objects do not

25237459
hash	md5
for example objects that have been created using object composition will often not have a recorded md5 hash

25237459
hash	md5
the xml api and the json api both expose the md5 hash where one is available

25237520
int	chars
this is however very simple find the separator the chars copy from the beginning to but not including the separator into a temporary string and convert it to an int with std strtol

25237520
strtol	atoi
if you don t even have std strtol then use std atoi

25237538
subtract	add
if you want to add 1 and subtract 1 from any hiddenval then you can change it like

25237549

how to hide controller name action name and show only passed parameters using routing in mvc

25237658
post	get
the following will simply replace all of those values with na your post suggests you do not want to lose these records - just get rid of the text values

25237670
folder	directory
you can change it by setting grails.project.plugins.dir setting it to plugins will create a plugins folder in your project source directory in buildconfig.groovy

25237675
int	chars
if you didn t need to convert into an int it would have been easier to tokenise the string yourself by using a for-loop and checking if the chars is equal to since the string is so short

25237701
folder	directory
note that the upload folder must be in the same directory as where you store the file

25237745

-webkit- for opera google-chrome and safari

25243399

25243411
gson	jackson
one could also use jackson or gson do convert the json into primitives see the other answers but then you d still have to check those primitives manually which seems to kind of defeat the point of using a fancy library

25245650
box-sizing	border-box
by adding box-sizing border-box

25245650
width	height
you can also viewport percentage units namely use vh and vw viewport height and viewport width units to cause content to stretch to fill a proportionate amount of the viewport where 100 100

25245650

so the next thing to do is go look in your webserver logs starting at exactly 12 29 18 and look a few seconds before and a few seconds after until you find one site that a get or post was performed on a feedback form or an insecure form in general

25247189
post	get
you can echo the resposne in your external php script and use get instead of post

25247273
post	get
i need to get all user post with status_type mobile_status_update or status_type added_photos but it seems api 2.0 doesn t support search method anymore

25247273
post	get
or do i need to get all post and check those status_type on my loop

25247289
pop-up	dialog
another consideration is that events for things like pop-up dialog boxes behave differently in a web environment

25247330
jar	war
in the case of jars or wars this takes the contents of the target directory and zips them up into a jar or war according to the configured instructions

25247344
qobject	qnetworkaccessmanager	qnetworkrequest	qnetworkaccessmanager
you ll have to use qnetworkaccessmanager because this unlike qnetworkrequest inherits from qobject and has a finished signal thus allowing you to connect to it

25247357
partition-problem	np-complete
partition-problem is a special case of this problem and since that problem is np-complete your problem is as well

25247361

25247413
ionic	angular
i was having the same problem of wanting to document my angular scripts inside the ionic that powers my mobile application

25247440
put	get
usually this is as simple as resolving conflicts and moving on but the issue that we are running into is that when we do a merge from the main feature branch any changes that have been made get put into my branch which then have to get placed back into the feature branch for the pull request

25247469
spaces	delimiter
you may assume that spaces will serve as delimiter

25247482
javassist	cglib
the project seems to think it needs javassist 3.12.0 but didn t pull cglib

25247498

in this function i would like to create a new hash where i can index the children objects by the parent objects

25247555
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s working on firefox google-chrome safari and other mobile browser

25247611
spaces	delimiter
also note as betlista said this does not have any error checking so if the passed string only has two tokens delimiter by one spaces you will get an array out of bounds exception

25247611
spaces	delimiter
if you do not enter the delimiter as a parameter the delimiter will automatically default to white spaces

25247626
lattice	hmisc
the hmisc package extends most lattice functions to better incorporate confidence intervals

25247626
lattice	hmisc
note that the hmisc version of the function is called dotplot while the lattice version is called dotplot

25247643
min	max
i d start by looking at your max and min and gauging a good mean term

25247685
mouse	keyboard
to clarify i m not particularly interested in event messaging architecture but mostly on handling mouse keyboard input hovering detection dealing with widgets that stack one on top of the other dealing with widgets that open up temporary menus form re-sizing with widget alignment dragging and dropping and so on

25247744
put	get
the get and subsequent possible put operations are wrapped in a transaction to ensure atomicity

25247780
hide	show
a work-around is to remove the top and bottom padding from the linearlayout and add it to the listview with cliptopadding set to false on the listview but i would rather not do that as in a special case i may want to hide the listview to show for example the textview below it and off-screen while keeping the padding and would like to avoid adding extra complexity into the layout

25247780
children	parent
setting cliptopadding on the parent linearlayout has no effect because the listview itself doesn t scroll inside the parent linearlayout but rather the children within the listview scroll within the listview

25247794
free	malloc
you can easily use the preprocessor to convert all the calls to malloc and free to actually call their debugging versions _malloc_dbg

25247826
apache	nginx
if it helps my previous stack was php 5.4.9-4ubuntu2.4 via apache and forge uses php 5.5.15-1+deb.sury.org trusty+1 via nginx

ant	pom.xml
it s hard to say without seeing your entire pom.xml or the list of jars that the ant script worked with

25248007

25248164
width	height
at the moment i get the screen width and height for calculation like this

25248164
width	height
the problem is that the resizable iphone emulator always give me a width of 768 and a height of 1024 like the ipad

25248164
width	height
i√¢ m still not sure how to handle this exactly...at the moment i calculate the size of my subviews in viewdidlayoutsubviews because this is the only method which shows the correct width and height of the resizable iphone simulator the problem is that when i calculate all my stuff inside this method it gets called every time when i scroll or touch the ui so it could be the case that it gets called hundreds of times...and when i try to calculate my views in viewdidappear its too late and evrything look reallys weird after the recalculation..

express	node.js
i am trying to write a handler for file uploads in node.js using express framework

25248520

25248792
post	put
when an action is called by the client to server say post put there would be some validations happening in the data that needs to be processed

25248859
put	get	post	get	post	put
it should be pretty clear what that does if you know that php input is where php will get input from a post request if it doesn t have a mime type that allows it to easily put it into for example when you have have a request with mime type application x-www-form-urlencoded php recognizes it and is able to parse the post contents into but with a blob it doesn t so it just outputs it out of php input

textview	imageview
you can replace the imageview using compound drawable of that textview and no need of that linearlayout

25249186
post	get
in this example we use set when inserting new users and post because we get a good unique id from another source

25249222
put	get
in order to use a query in a transaction it must be an ancestor query however transactions can also get and put which don t require a parent to be set on the entity

25249264
for-loop	arrays
i would say a good solution would be to keep a bit arrays 1 is a organism 0 is not possibly as a 2d arrays in memory updating the logic every say 30 iterations for 30 fps then drawing all the rects to the screen black for 1 white for 0 using glcolor r g b a tied to an in statement in a nested for-loop

25249267
rss	feed
i try to read two rss feed and i have an error

25249284
hash	salt
if stored this way rather than putting the salt in a separate column in the database you need a way to separate the salt and other details back out from the hash

25249284
hash	salt
this can be avoided by storing the hash salt and method in their own columns or by splitting based on position rather than by a specific character

25249284
hash	salt
substituting one specific character will have no meaningful impact on the success of a good salt hash

25249302
portrait	landscape
brightcove s example worked fine for me on desktop browsers but once i started testing on ios and android i saw that the preview window with the big play triangle icon would not resize when i rotated the screen from portrait to landscape and vice versa

width	height
set your height and width

25251777
many-to-many	many-to-one
it makes no sense for many-to-one or many-to-many since you don t want to delete a parent whenever the child is removed

25251777
many-to-one	one-to-many
inverse is for bidirectional associations and most often it s on the same side with cascade but that s because the many-to-one side is much more efficient to control the association than the one-to-many one

25251819
put	get
i put this code into repl.it expecting to get an undefined is not a function error

25252700
hide	show
from the window that will appear select visibility √¢ enable show or hide based on an expression √¢ click on fx button

25252700

when i click on the hide radio button the show radio button does not unselect

25252834
hide	show
also i want to store these values per user by them hitting a save button so the next time they open the page it remembers what they wanted to show and hide

25252836
innodb	myisam
however as you have pointed out this will only work in myisam so you are still stuck if you want spatial indexes geometry types and foreign keys all at once until innodb adds spatial indexing which is in the pipeline as stated in the above link

25252836
innodb	myisam
there is a suggestion here about keeping you spatial data in both innodb and myisam doing the spatial search in myisam and then joining on a shared key and querying the attributes in innodb but this seems pretty hacky and inefficient and there are questions about different lock behaviors between the two engines too and how this might perform at scale

25252861
put	get
but i get the below exception after i put those two properties in the application.properties file

25252949

25253126
x86	64bit
for example using the gcc compiler the flag -m32 is all you need to add for 64bit x86 processor systems

25253126
x86	64bit	x86	mips
a second potential complicating factor is whether the program application or its data is endian dependent which may be an issue if was written under the assumption of being run on big endian cpus such as the majority of unix workstations with risc-style processors mips powerpc etc. and you are now trying to run it on an 64bit x86 intel or amd processor aka amd64 x86-64

25253177
bower	npm
successfully installed node.js and as you can see below npm and bower are installed

inherited	properties
my goal is to build a base class that 3rd parties would inherited from and be able to call static and instance properties methods inherited from the base class

25253847
spaces	linefeed
also of note is that the error message cr must be followed by linefeed may not be completely accurate -- it could also means there s an invalid character in the header including a spaces in one of the header names

25253895
min	max
you can prevent the graph resizing by setting it s preferred min and max sizes

pickle	dill
and i also replaced import pickle with import dill as pickle everywhere

25254796
pickle	dill
and you should be fine unless your code is hitting one of the cases that attributes on modules can t be serialized because they were added dynamically see which should definitely make pickle fail and in some cases dill too√¢ probably with an atrributeerror on the module

25254846
mouseup	mousedown
in order for click event to execute on an element mousedown and mouseup event needs to happen on the same element

i assume that there should be an icomparable constraint added to make it work maybe compareto instead of as well

25259500
integer	fractions

25259518
stdout	stderr
redirects not by making left operand stderr point to right operand stdout but by making a copy of the right operand and assigning it to the left

25259518
stdout	stderr
so reading from left-to-right which is how this is interpreted by bash means redirect stdout to the file dirlist followed by redirection of stderr to whatever stdout is currently pointing to which is already the file

25259518
stdout	stderr
otoh would redirect stderr to whatever stdout is currently pointing to which is the screen terminal and then redirect stdout to dirlist

25260361
move	drag
the problem is that i am not able to move drag the jquery dialog from one monitor to another monitor screen

put	get
i am using spring framework version 4 and i get confused which folder to put the xml files specially the tile definitions and where to find the resolver bean

25260486

25260486
disk	ram
i assume you are using spinning disk plus not enough ram for a database that size

25260567
pop-up	dialog
on tapping a button in this dialog fragment i need to display a pop-up window above a particular edittext in the dialog fragment

25260567

for example user post creates a new user get fetches all users

25260840
document.write	settimeout

25260851
vmware	virtualbox
the vm has some trouble i can see it by the preview of virtualbox administrator but i don t know how to open console like you do in vmware to fix the problem

25260868
getter	setter
i have a class defined in typescript that has properties defined as getter and setter

25260868
getter	setter
tried using ng-model-options with gettersetter true but looks like it requires a special syntax where one function is both getter and setter at the same time which is not typescript-friendly

25260900

like the link you mentioned says first place to look for errors is to ensure that onpause and onresume are passed to both your super and to the glsurfaceview

25260908
width	font-size	letter-spacing	font-size
the overlay has the same width the same font and font-size the same letter-spacing same line-height etc. to make sure all highlights will align properly with the text in the textarea

all have equal font font-size letter-spacing line-height there s no margin border or padding on the highlights etc

use a debugger to analyze your program state here and or post more code to get more specific help

25261124
n-gram	words
the problem is that you re not going to find appropriate statistics for all possible words. character n-gram statistics are easier to accumulate and more robust even for text without typos words in a language tend to follow the same spelling patterns

25261124
n-gram	words
had you not found statistics for the dutch words uitbuiken a pretty rare words then the occurrence of the n-gram uit bui and uik would still be strong indicators of this being dutch

25261163
hide	show
you can hide one by getting this container calling hide method and calling show method on container of scene to show

free	malloc
so my logic is that chances are that if i didn t have memory when i made the call to malloc sleep for a second to give other processes a chance to call free then try again

25261535
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
however touchesbegan and touchesmoved are not called because the users finger was already on the screen before the view controller was shown

25261537
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
as alecxe suggests in the comments above lxml s default parser can t seem to handle this html input well and a solution is to parse it with a more forgiving parser like beautifulsoup or html5lib

25261542
getter	setter
or you can use explicit getter setter if you need more than the x field assigned

25261552

25261595
folder	directory
this problem can be solved easily by creating the folder tokens in the same directory

25261596
post	get
then at you server you have the username in the get parameters and password in the post parameters

25261596
post	put
but the you could just put the user and the password in the data dictionary and post both fields

25261596
post	get
i do agree with martijn that passing some data in get and some in post is a bad idea so if there is not a good reason to do it you probably should avoid it

25261596
post	get
i also like the idea of using the requests params argument and data arguments if you absolutely need to pass them the username in get and the password in post so your request would become

25261626
vim	gedit
i ve tested it with both vim and gedit and it works just fine

25261633
post	get
it is pointless to fill a hidden input with a value and get that value to post it via ajax

post	get
just get the .text straight away and post that

25261713
subshell	ifs
don t forget to reset ifs to the original value - either put the whole part into a subshell if no variables should survive the loop

25261733
portrait	landscape
i found that we can request for orientation of output data by specifying extra_screen_orientation as shown below.it can work on some devices only if oems have not modified and even if it happens the camera might be open in portrait and save data with landscape orientation so there is no way to set landscape camera

25261786

25262100
folder	dir
this will simply open the command prompt and execute dir command which will list the folder and file list in the current folder

25262110

25262235
notepad++	jedit
try verifying with a multi-encoding programmer s editor like notepad++ or jedit

25262239
dictionary	map
a clean and quite simple solution to look for is using a dictionary to map the item_type values to actual form classes

libstdc++	libc++
libstdc++ and libc++ both use a class std __shared_count for the basic type unspecific ref counting

25262345

25262710
onresume	onpause
it is a bit more hardwork using these methods than the home relaunch i suspect you woudl like but it allows you to break down your testing to a lower level to ensure that your app is doing the right thing at each stage which will make it more robust as time goes on say test it saves its state onpause and loads it again properly at onresume

25262774
google-chrome	firefox

put	get
because if you directly put image files in public folder it will work properly but you did not get these images in precompiled assets in production mode

25263193

if not maybe better solution is to use some views instead of tags if you don t need to reuse them in another size layout for example for tablets there is no need to use fragments.. and try also to add them tags or search in children of parent layout

25263217
udp	tcp
layer 4 load balancers act upon data found in network and transport layer protocols ip tcp ftp udp

25263220

25266363
int	double
note that the floating point double specification uses 52 bits to store the mantissa the part after the decimal point so you can exactly represent any int in the range

25266363
int	double
if you are just using the double as a loop variable and only incrementing it in int steps and you are not counting above 4 503 599 627 370 496 then you are fine to use a double and to use to compare double

25266371
for-loop	loops
then the output is read and the next iteration of the for-loop can begin by which time 6 actual rows have been read and loops picks up on row 7 from the input file

25266761
sum	coalesce
i used to calculate the sum of two more coalesce functions for ref bb and for ref cc

25266761
sum	coalesce
the reason i used the coalesce function was that because it was a sum i had to use 0 if the value for either bb or cc didn t exist

25266761
sum	coalesce
the mistake was that if neither value for bb or cc existed the sum was 0 rather than null and the external coalesce function returned 0 instead of null

25266773
put	get
it s really strange you use put method with get paramater

25266775

25266847
width	height
ideally i would specify a maximum width for the popup and a string to display and the popup would automatically size itself such that the text would wrap if it exceeds the specified max width and it would be the correct height

25266847
width	height
if i uncomment all of the commented lines then i get the desired behavior but i must specify both the width and height in the setpreferredsize call and so it is not robust to handle different input messages

25266897
min	max
looks to me like your query and syntax are confused by the max and min functions

25266897
min	max
however telling sql to handle max and min is looking for the real value of the column and in mathematical terms -400 is bigger than -500

25266897
min	max
try replacing your max with min and the other way around

25266909

at this time only google-chrome and safari support the web speech api although safari only supports the text to speech functionalities

25267619
google-chrome	firefox
which works fine in google-chrome but in firefox it appears to cache the embed so i get the same video every time

25267627
pop-up	dialog
to avoid creating that file in the future choose no when prompted on exit either on the command line or in the pop-up dialog window in rgui or call q no

25267638
folder	directory
there should be a folder .cordova in c users rtickoo directory

25267649
firefox	safari
however in reality some browsers at least safari and firefox seem to apply auto-detect to the json data unless a charset parameter is added see this ticket filed against me and also the related so question linked above

all the mapping get and post requests to your methods is done for you

25267810

i was too lazy to use a transparent image as the icon and i want to show the icon for some cases and hide it for other cases

25267824
portrait	landscape
the defect occurs when i start in landscape view focus on a text input and then rotate the device from landscape to portrait

25267835
google-chrome	firefox
the scripts work fine with google-chrome and firefox but not in internet explorer

25267875
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade rspec versioning from 2 to 3

25267894
width	height
i made it so that the height and width of a child spans so many rows as well

25267894
width	height
i ve done this to set the height width

25267914
terminate	timeout
after a timeout will leave it on there for several minutes it will unceremoniously terminate the program

25267957
folder	directory
if you delete the folder or if you want to keep it move it to a directory outside of .vim and you should be fine

25267959
addclass	removeclass
i don t like the fact that i have to create the object first and return an object with addclass and removeclass pointing it indirectly to my instance methods

25268195
temp	tmp
tmp c docume 1 admin locals 1 temp

25268195
temp	tmp
these are the environment variables set for temp and tmp so go to that folder and right click and select properties - security

25268195
temp	tmp	folder	directory
log on as admin and change the temp and tmp variable to for example c temp basically this moves the temp directory out of the documents and settings folder

25268219
int	boolean
this case still wastes the other bits of the int but if you had other fields you could effectively use each bit of the int to represent a boolean value

25268234
width	height
i was thinking of using something similar to graphics.measurestring where i also specify the width constraint in order to retrieve the height

25268270
inherited	subclassing
the only issue is that i have already spent many hours writing my parser as a standalone program and as such have designed it in a way that is not consistent with the original author s methods for example each of his parsers is a subclassing of parser and inherited a few things

25268479
youtube	vimeo
also platforms like vimeo or youtube or other online video platforms may fit your requirements in some cases

25268485
background-image	box-shadow
you could use a before rule to get around this or you could apply the image as a background-image to the figure and apply the box-shadow to this element as well

swift	objective-c
mitrenegades answer explains this but if your project needs to use the explicit objective-c class that uses the swift protocol rather than just using the protocol then you will have circularity issues

25268794
swift	objective-c
the reason is that the swift protocol is defined to the swift-objc header then to your objective-c class definition which then goes again to the swift-objc header

25268794
swift	objective-c
mitrenegades solution is to use an objective-c protocol is one way but if you want a swift protocol then the other would be to refactor the code so as to not use the objective-c class directly but instead use the protocol some protocol based factory pattern

25271700
newtype	either
it s not possible to implement a thin newtype wrapper around that does this either because the method or more to the point the method can t behave in this way essentially because it doesn t know if a and b are the same type so it can t just append those two lists i ve specialized the types here to the instance for readability

however as lxml is rooted in c rather than staying in python that s not necessarily even possible unless the interface is clearly abstracted in an accessible way -- and that lxml s open call wasn t effected by monkey-patching the socket module is a clear indicator that unlike for instance the requests module it s using libxml2 s native functionality rather than the python socket module

if you need to support really old engines like ie8 s search for function bind shim or function bind polyfills to find shim polyfills

25281518
superclass	subclassing
it is also bad practice to implements methods in subclassing that access superclass variables directly

25281518
inherited	subclassing
due to inherited those methods will be available in the subclassing ass well

25281518
superclass	subclassing
calling the subclassing constructor has to call the superclass constructor as well because your employee object relies on the functionality that your person object provides

google-chrome	firefox
please note that google-chrome firefox and other normal browsers are handling this situation quite well

25282907
post	get
when inspecting how firefox behaves in such situation in firebug it can be clearly seen that post request is made then it is shown as aborted for like 0.5s and then this it is shown as successful i suspect that firefox handles this specific situation and makes get request to server itself to renew ssl keep-alive connection and then retries post request

25282907
google-chrome	firefox
i insist on recommending google-chrome or firefox or other normal browser to customers as viable alternative and i still think that ie11 is not suited for modern websites with ajax

if you need all int s then you may find it easier splitting it up into each digit and getting a chars for each of those - watch out for negative numbers but there is a chars for subscript minus sign too

25284518
postgresql	mysql
you write ruby code to build your db schema this way if you decide to move from mysql to postgresql for example you don t need to open up postgresql manual and check code compatibility

25284520
sorting	filtering
since this just a marker not a scalar value like a date or so a label makes perfect sense here you don t need the freedom to potentially create more relationships from to the cancellation node - filtering and sorting is probably fine and works great with an index backing this label

25284528
min	max
you can make the key max a b min a b

25284532

for-loop	arrays
though its recommended to use the store.getrange fn and iterate the arrays via for-loop

25284693
int	chars
the easiest way of enumerating an int s digits is by converting it to a string and using the linq select operator to get the individual chars

25284693
subtract	add
then you subtract 0 from each character to get the digit s numeric value and add it to √¢ as described above

25284699

whereas if i do this with one column it works thanks to another so question seaborn groupby pandas series

25284863
getter	setter
specific on frequently used methods like getter setter

25284863
inline	inlining
the best uses of inlining is for function where the body is less code than the function call and return mechanism so that the inline function is not only faster than a non-inlined version but also more compact in the object core smaller and faster

25284863
getter	setter
but i often read that the compiler automatically inline short functions like getter setter methods in this case getting the size of a vector

25284913
folder	directory
one way to do it is to create a shared folder on the server then assign permissions to the share based on either a active directory service account or user group

udp connections are in themselves not stateful connections but rather stateless

25285377
udp	tcp
see this udp programming tutorial which also helps explain why a command like ss -ua shows an udp server socket as unconn aka close for tcp connections

25285377
udp	tcp
to sum up i do believe the udp states shown in proc net are recycled from tcp connection states but they have a slightly different meaning

25285409
implements	extends
because the class mage_core_block_template extends varien_object that implements the method __call you will be able to call any method that starts with get set uns has without getting an error even if the method does not exist

25285444
margin	height
you are using margin 25 on container which is causing the gap of 50 top-bottom value for overlay so use height 150 instead of 100

25285508
folder	directory
so imagine we want to create two new folder in our directory

25285512

mouseleave	mouseenter
the simplest way to solve your problem is to use jquery which specifically handles this case through its mouseenter mouseleave events

i have found one potential answer detecting keydown and keyup events on linux c++ but the answers weren t very clear to me i also looked into the 4 answer that are linked via duplicates

25285870
fadein	fadeout
first you need really check if the start and the end of your files has no silences i dont know if sox can do it but you need check the energy rms db of the start and end audio signals and cut start and end silence to join audio files without gaps you need apply one window function in your signal to works like a fadein fadeout and then crossfade the beginning of one with the end of the other

25285885

in most modern lisp common lisp scheme etc. the form quote lambda √¢ or simply lambda √¢ is just a list and it s not something that can be invoked

25286033
google-chrome	firefox
so does it behave more like google-chrome firefox or even ie6 or is it a custom implementation of the w3c standards

25286118
int	double	spaces	linefeed
you just change the int foo to double foo or to float foo ---double can cap more memory spaces than float that means more precise numbers---- and then in printf type linefeed for double or f for float and you should be ok

25286135
mouse	keyboard
it does provide a lot of low level keyboard mouse etc functionality

elasticsearch	kibana
i keep some data in elasticsearch and now want to access it with kibana

25286713
elasticsearch	kibana
elasticsearch offers a restful web api without any authentication and kibana is a purely browser side javascript application that accesses elasticsearch by direct ajax calls

25286713
elasticsearch	kibana
i am interested in specific elasticsearch kibana solutions but also in generic designs for single sign on to web apps and the external web apis they use

25286713
elasticsearch	kibana	apache	nginx
it seems the recommended way to secure elasticsearch kibana is to have an apache or nginx reverse proxy in front that does ssl termination and user authentication basic auth

25286713
apache	nginx
have the web app server store session info that apache or nginx somehow can look up and use to authorize access to the reverse proxy

25286713
elasticsearch	kibana
my feeling is that the proxy within web app #1 is a common generic solution but it seems a bit heavyweight to have everything pass through the possibly slow web app considering that kibana uses the elasticsearch api directly

25286713
apache	nginx
my idea is to have the web app store session info in memcache or the like and use some facility in the web server apache or nginx to look up the session based on a cookie and allow proxy access if authenticated

25286713
apache	nginx
the issue seems similar to serving static files directly using the web server apache or nginx while authenticating using a slow web app

because b is final the expression b is a constant expression allowing it to be narrowed from the int constant expression 12 to byte chars or short and then boxed to byte chars or short but strangely not to int or anything above

if i swap double with int and remove the number formatting i get no error but the conversion is inaccurate with no decimals

25296522

25296533
config	ini
for reference i ve included my hhvm config ini file

25296554

25297853
width	height
the behavior in firefox is a result of the scaling being applied to the divs current width height which is set to 100 of its container

25297853
width	height
instead i d suggest changing your layout to use relative height width and position

25297853
width	height
using relative height width

25297853
width	height
if your aspect ratio is a constant 800x600 you can change your css for .ui-button to use a width of 10 80px 800px and a height of 13.33 80px 600px rather than adjusting the scale during window resize

25298236
swift	objective-c
nsdecimal is not really supported in swift it s a weird opaque pointer type but nsdecimalnumber is √¢ and as in objective-c it s the best thing to use for base-ten arithmetic because it actually does its operations in base ten

a single call to a urng object is allowed to produce and deliver many typically 32 or more bits returning these bits as a single packaged value of an unsigned integer type

25298802
client-side	server-side
that s why both client-side and server-side auth flows return the long-lived access token

25298865
subtract	add
as a bonus switching the order of start and end also switches the open closed end of the range so you don t have to add or subtract 1 in this case

25298869
capitalization	uppercase
vincents excellent answer for uppercase first letter works great for the first letter only capitalization of an entire column string

25298876
int	chars

ienumerable	ilist
and since ilist inherits from ienumerable you can call where on both interfaces calling where on a ilist actually calls the ienumerable.where extension method

25302983
ienumerable	ilist
so in both cases the same base method is called and the type of the resulting value will be an ienumerable not an ilist when applied to a list

25302983
ienumerable	ilist
you can filter elements from both interfaces pretty much the same although you will generally use ienumerable extension methods linq in both cases since ilist inherits from ienumerable

this is important to know as a developer since the time it takes to access memory that is already in ram is many orders of magnitude faster than if the os has to load the memory from disk into ram first

25303385
puts	gets
the stack is another special data structure that the os gives a process but it is different in that it gets all the stack at once and as a process puts items on the stack in sequence it increments or decrements a special pointer usually a special cpu register to keep track of where it is in this stack

daemons	launchd
--background the daemons is launchd as a background process

25308216

25308355
post	get
the problem described in the original post was to get the input output streams and get them to work

25308355
nshost	nsoutputstream
all you have to prepare is a nshost objected initialized with a real host address a port number a reference to a nsinputstream obj and also for a nsoutputstream obj

25308359
inherited	properties
you can t simply ignore some methods or properties of a class which you inherited

25308401
hlsl	glsl
hlsl matrices are row-major glsl are column-major

25308401
hlsl	glsl
so if you pass your matrix into glsl shader using the same memory layout as you pass it into hlsl then your hlsl rows will become glsl columns

25308401
hlsl	glsl
and you should use column-major multiplication in your glsl shader to get same effect as in hlsl

25308454
ucma	ucwa
in ucma this is typically done via the context channel which ucwa does not have access to

25308502

hive	hdfs
i ve recently upgraded to hive 0.12 and want to use the dynamic external table partitioning by giving the root hdfs location of a table in the location part of the ddl then adding subdirectories which will then be automatically added to the table

25308539
for-loop	loops
a quick solution would be to invert the hierarchy of the loops placing the for-loop inside the while loops

25308617
hide	show
the table has a onmouseout function which should hide the table and show the image again

25308650
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
i m copying from fileinputstream to fileoutputstream a file that is sized around 500mb

25308704

post	get
in the inner for-loop all post containing any tag get listed

25308729
width	height
on the fiddle width is 100px for the wrapper and a height is implemented for demonstration purposes

25308747
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work perfectly

25308758
getter	setter
it is also true that setter and getter are nowadays being generated but for and while loops are being generated too and these codes should not automatically be excluded as they are being maintained manually

25308772
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your jquery versioning to 1.7 or more and change insted of

25308804
width	height
it seems height and width are inverted in the query and in the parameters

25308822
put	get
you ve got to put those subselects into another one to get a derived table

25308848

25308872
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
i m trying to rotate a uiview around its center on drag uipangesturerecognizer but for some reason the uiview s position is also changing

25308954
subtract	add
to compare as unsigned integers you can use long s cast up with to counteract sign-extension or integer.compareunsigned in newer versions of java or if you prefer you can add subtract xor both operands with integer.min_value

25308957
serializable	deserialization
okay i ve got solution it was pretty easy actually i was confused by fosrestbundle s but actually they work for serializable and not deserialization

25309058
dataoutputstream	bufferedoutputstream
you will probably want to put a bufferedoutputstream between the dataoutputstream and the socket output stream and only flush it when you ve written all parts of the message

25309064
put	get
i m trying to put a table in the specific place of a second page in my word document but always get an error

25309069
width	height
try adding the unit type px em etc to the width height number

25309075

25309081
post	get
whenever i post the form my edit method correctly receives the updated text argument but does not get the updated duedate value the value the model started with

25309086
allocator	stl
i am trying to use custom allocator for stl

25309221
aggregate-functions	coalesce
so when you added the id and used coalesce max csp.id 0 +1 then you get the error message error column cp.user_id must appear in the group by clause or be used in an aggregate-functions

25309221
aggregate-functions	sum
it is because as soon as you introduced an aggregate-functions max in your case the other columns are also expected to contain aggregate-functions max sum count etc. or they should be used for grouping using a group by clause at the end of the query

25309298
vbscript	vba
again the com object can be used in vbscript or an executable but for some reason can t be used at least with the new keyword in vba

25309318
spaces	delimiter
however a lot of the answers and methods used also allude to a spaces delimiter list which can also be used as a method of passing multiple origins to allow

25309319
google-chrome	firefox
i known this is old but i found a easier solution and it works on ie10 firefox and google-chrome

25309357
floating-point	integer
not a direct answer to your question but for constant floating-point values such as the ones specified in your question the method that yields the least amount of precision-loss would be using the rational representation of each value as an integer numerator divided by an integer denominator and perform as many integer-multiplications as possible before the actual floating-point-division

25309433
jboss	glassfish
the technique to load several versions of the same class is used by application servers like glassfish or jboss so that you can redeploy your application without restarting the application server

25309672
post	get
based on this stack overflow post ios uialertview button to go to setting app which admittedly is old i have tried most variations and i cannot get the settings.app to open up

25309717
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work in current versions of firefox google-chrome and ie

25309737
width	height
that s because by the time you re getting #notice outerheight and outerwidth it does not have a width or height or any other css style try this demo

25309904
width	font-size
note use em units for the width of the and the left-margin so they adapt to the font-size

i am doing this with a combination of css and js it is working fine on google-chrome and firefox but it works only in part in safari

25309989
post	get
if you monitor the tasks and create operation network requests you will see they are still being done via get rather than a post despite the type post option in the transport definition

25310025
int	boolean
i m trying to bind a model that has two properties - one int and one boolean - to a drop-down list in mvc

25310127
spock	grails
in a grails project version 2.3.7 i have an integration test using spock

25310191
children	parent
this is not as self-explanatory because the code is shared with a bunch of methods that do structural traversal of the dom parent next prev siblings etc but again the relevant part of the code is very simple the line important 1 collects the results of the structural traversal get the children inside ret and those results as a whole are filtered based on the selector .child first

25310201
for-loop	loops
so using key.equals k in the above for-loop will not be true for the first round in loops in every case

25310262
post	get
i would like to transform this get method query in post method

25310265
hide	show
one of the features of this table was the ability to show hide additional user details

hide	show
i am still new to angularjs so maybe i am missing something simple but i just want to be able to expand show hide the additional tr

25310301
for-loop	loops
it turns out incrementing the progress bar value to a for-loop tight loops requires a dispatcher

25310309
portrait	landscape
apps may only work in portrait or landscape orientation

25310309
switching	screens
tap the 1x or 2x icon in the bottom right of the screens to switching between sizes

25310310
mousemove	mouseout	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove
that means that the ui you designed and tested in your desktop browser will fail on most if not all touch-enabled mobile devices because jquery ui listens to mouse events like mouseover mousemove and mouseout and not touch events touchstart touchmove and touchend

25310414
post	put
if someone can tell me how to put the focus on the opendialog instead of form2 and post it as an answer i ll accept it

25310440
swift	objective-c
unlike objective-c categories swift extensions do not have names.

25310478
debian	linux
in windows wamp setup you are able to load printer.dll via the extension php_printer.dll in the php.ini file in windows but if i look in the phpinfo of the window system i see a printer heading if i look at phpinfo on the debian linux installation i do not see a printer section

25310553

what i did below is conditionally set the row height to zero plus set all of the various things that might cause the row height to be nonzero to be zero or not present border padding margin font size

25310573
portrait	landscape
so i would like to capture photo using portrait mode only not in landscape

25310574
fadein	fadeout
i use jquery s fadein fadeout functions to control the appearance of an indeterminate jquery ui progressbar during image upload so that the user knows that the upload is still in progress

25310574
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this code works fine in google-chrome firefox and opera but i ve noticed some rather strange behaviour in ie11 the progressbar appears correctly then fades out correctly then reappears and never disappears again

25310609
pop-up	dialog
the problem i am having is that the modal dialog doesn t pop-up when the model provided to the template is null

25310632
put	get
when trying to figure out what i need to put to my spring configuration i quickly get lost in endless discussions about transaction managers aop and transaction advice chains which i find difficult to understand - i know i ought to though

25310670
outputstream	inputstream
java separates binary data byte inputstream outputstream from text string char reader writer which internally is always kept in unicode

25310695
next	except
next the except block executes and s has indeterminate value which is what you have observed

25310730

getter	setter
add hibernate class in your daoimpl with getter and setter

25310759
getter	setter
i ve been able to unmarshal the json responses into single pojos by creating builtcharacter with the appropriate getter and setter

25310799
google-chrome	firefox
what happens in my rather ordinary computer win 7 is that google-chrome ignores the font setting and uses its default font whereas firefox interprets √¢ ≈ìtimes new roman cyr√¢ as √¢ ≈ìtimes new roman√¢

25310817
width	height
however that s talking about making two elements the same height not the same width

25310843
h.265	hevc
i m a little confused i m looking at the media recorder class and see the hevc or h.265 is not listed as an encode format in the android apis

25310868

25310890
int	chars
when i try to create instance of struct with chars and 3x int these data are broken eg

25310932
submit	submission
the legacy code alters the dom of automatically pregenerated html and adds in some functionality to the submit button by hijacking its submission with an onclick

25310972
portrait	landscape
you are not taking into account the orientation of the photo and so you are loading a landscape photo as if it were portrait

free	malloc
dynamic memory malloc and free

25311076
mouseleave	mouseenter
when you fast mouseenter mouseleave mouseenter mouseleave mouseenter mouseleave mouseenter mouseleave mouseenter mouseleave mouseenter mouseleave mouseenter mouseleave mouseenter mouseleave on you will see an even loop

25311089
int	chars
since as currently written has type chars which is promoted to int since printf is a variadic function and s expects the corresponding argument to have type

25311092
width	height
the width height and length variables should just be int not a pointer to an int int

25311098
swift	objective-c
i ve done a lot of nscoding archiving in objective-c but i m not sure how it handles structs in swift nor arrays with optional values

25311104
pull	push
this component needs to be able to push and pull a file to a sharepoint 2010 server

25311127
getter	setter
if it was a top level scope object i could use a getter setter defined in the scope ng-model-options gettersetter true

25311164
nodevalue	nextsibling
instead of usin g the jquery function text i recommend using the dom node property nextsibling to get the text node after the radio input and edit its value using nodevalue

25311164
nodevalue	nextsibling
picks the first result of which is a dom node so that we can edit the property nodevalue of its property nextsibling

25311205
mp3	ogg	google-chrome	firefox
everything is working nicely in firefox however google-chrome seems to kill the response after the first ogg file has been written but not mp3 strangely

25311247
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
in some obsolete browsers ie8 for instance you have to use a microsoft-specific xdomainrequest object instead of xmlhttprequest to make a call that will work correctly with cors

25311247
firefox	safari	xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
to make a cors request you simply use xmlhttprequest in firefox 3.5+ safari 4+ and google-chrome and xdomainrequest object in ie8+

25311275
maven	pom.xml
save pom.xml and right click the project maven update

25311281
octal	decimal
integer literals that start with 0 are interpreted as octal not decimal numbers

25311281
octal	decimal
so 0234 is actually octal for 156 decimal

25311354
queue	fifo
given that cas is available an efficient shared collection for the queue shouldn t be too hard it doesn t have to be fifo

25311437

folder	directory
there s another yii commandline within the test folder directory which means you can easily do

25311472
gson	jackson
i have a jax-rs web services on jetty+jersey and tried different json message providers jackson and gson

children	parent
if you are using a parent theme then both the summer theme and the winter theme should be children of the parent theme

25311636

i use window.getselection on the mouseup and keyup events and then check the value of the iscollapsed property to see if there is an active selection or not

25311713
dumpsys	adb
adb shell dumpsys meminfo your.package.name.here

25311721
getter	setter
i d like to use it for this but it requires predefined getter setter

25311738
button	checkbox
also view can handle all the internal logic without to call the controller for example if one checkbox radio button enables another widget

25311796
hide	show
you could add in a small button and use javascript to show and hide the pop up using jquery s .toggle

25311802
width	height
i need view width and height to use in some calculations in activity

25311829
maven	m2e
this package includes m2e - maven integration for eclipse and my problem before was i used to install only this one

25311871
squash	merge
this of course adds two merge into my main tree which i could not figure out how to squash into one merge and from what i read in source code there doesn t seem to be an easy solution to that problem

25311905
width	height
edit it seems that the layout is forcing the image to be smaller once it is loaded if i set android scaletype centercrop the image takes full width but is cropped in height

25311950
width	height
so let s say you want to get the width and the height when you click a button or something and want to pass those values over to another activity

25311950
width	height
that should return you the width and the height of the view

25311969

25312053
width	height
when the view will be drawn this function will be called with the correct width and height

25312087
children	parent
one way not necessarily the best but the one i would use is to style the parent list in the way you want and then create another rule that applies only to the children thereby overriding the first rule for the parent

25312087
children	parent
the second rule the one that targets the children must come after the one that targets the parent in your stylesheet

25312087
children	parent
style for children that overrides the style you have set for the parent

25312087
children	parent
the anchor tags contained inside your s are also children of the parent list and so inherit there opacity state

25312087
children	parent
the sub lists are children of the parent list but not the parent anchor tags so rules set to the top level anchors won t be passed down the hierarchy

25312104
post	get
i created a custom route and it treated it like a get instead of webapi discovering it was a post

25312113

anyway - i have a mysql table with the md5 hash password stored

25312113
hash	md5
using mysqls md5 function select md5 testsalt i found the hash to be 315240c61218a4a861ec949166a85ef0

25312113
hash	md5
in one module of the system we calculate md5 hash using this code

25312113
hash	md5
this method outputs the exact same md5 hash

25312113
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
by extending the md5passwordencoder class and overriding the encodepassword method with some logging i was able to determine that it outputs a different md5 hash 150671e7a5fb8ace58aaa012de7f9b5c when given the same password test and salt salt

post	get
for example was it sent as a get parameter a post parameter or was it simply forwarded via the forward method in another controller

put some logging in the dll - nothing logs meaning timeprovopen doesn t even get called

25312377

i m kind of new to the whole how to arrange your components thing in java and i couldn t figure out how to realise the following jframe i can t post images so i just put the link

i d think the the multiplication division would give you more trouble but nevertheless in the long version you are still subtract two floating point numbers

25312685
serializable	deserialization
i m wondering how i can use the icontractresolver or inherit from defaultcontractresolver to convert from queue to a list on serializable so that it can be read properly and turn it back to a queue on deserialization

25312760
children	parent
this will give you the collection of children for each parent so something along the lines of

25312938
crypt	hash	3des	aes
obviously you can t use hash functions because your script needs to read back the imap password so you should encrypt it with some symmetric crypt function aes blowfish 3des and such

25312946
width	height
to get the form s width height

25312964
children	parent
you match from parent in the group to all of their children then from each child back to a different parent in the same group

25313007
width	height
this also assumes your table has a fixed width and each row has a fixed height

25313065
ant	maven
i managed to forge a solution for that with ant which again can be triggered from maven as mentioned here

25313082
hash	salt
it tends to be pretty secure as it salt the passwords and hash them

25313094

25313144
yacc	bison
a conflict in a yacc bison parser means that the grammar is not lalr 1 -- which generally means that something is either ambiguous or needs more than 1 token of lookahead

25313144
yacc	bison
these two defaults have nothing to do with one another -- the first is a decision made by yacc bison when it builds the parser and the second is a decision by the parser at runtime

25313218
button	checkbox
is there a simpler way of checking if a form is empty in that the fields of the form are at their initial states text boxes blank regardless of whether they may have been filled out and emptied again at some point checkbox in their initial state regardless of whether they may have been changed then restored to their original state manually by the user at some point radio button dropdowns etc

25313273

you would have to do this by creating a swift library and surfacing the result to objective-c and then provide a binding to the objective-c code so that you can call it all from c#

25313447
versioning	upgrade
if you want to upgrade your project from visual basic 6.0 to visual basic 2010 you can use the upgrade tools provided with earlier versioning of visual studio and then upgrade the project again in visual studio 2010

google-chrome	firefox
then i get this in google-chrome and firefox

25313517
int	double
why to write such huge code.this works perfectly until i change double to int

25313561
getter	setter
i solved a similar problem by adding a custom getter setter to my entity for example getdateintervalstring and setdateintervalstring

25313561
getter	setter
the getter converts dateto and datefrom into the interval string and returns it and the setter accepts a similarly formatted string and uses it to set dateto and datefrom

25313561
getter	setter
by overriding the property path your custom getter and setter will be used

25313596
express	node.js
i m new to node.js express and i have a question

25313602

25313732

brian campbell i think the problem was the www because if i use www.google.com it gives me a redirect url same as my browser but because it is a https i think i will have to use ssl thank for your answer

25313746
implements	extends
first off while extends the class by derivation is good adherence to the open closed principle if all consumers of item now consume itemwrapper then you haven t saved much effort implements a derived class

25313792
stdout	stderr
the shell s stdout stderr aren t being redirected anywhere

25313816
int	double
i m not working with classes only with double int values so i won t have an huge difference in time i think

25313827
post	get
to get post content from my database this is all that shows up in the

the path is determined by the directory name of the deployed project in the webapps folder of your tomcat

25313839
width	height
i am adding images to a stage and i set the height and width

you can t just arbitrarily apply styles from reportlab to a python-docx document and expect it to work

25313878
min	max
all edges are placed in the root box which has min min y polygon and max max y polygon

25313878
min	max
the current box min max is split into to left min mid and right mid max

25313878
min	median	min	max	median	max
i could sort the edges on min y or max y and use the average y of the median edge as split point mid

25313879
width	height
if i understand correctly you want to get the width and height of your image view instead of the bitmaps width and height

25313889
layoutparams	viewgroup
barring opengl-es you would probably either want to work with bitmaps canvases or work with views nested inside viewgroup and move them around by altering their layoutparams or manipulating their matrices in order to animate objects around the screen

25313895
min	max
if you want to see the first item instead the last you can replace max id with min id

25313908
button	checkbox
same with circles and squares for radio button and checkbox

25313999
qthread	qobject
for versions of qt prior to qt 4.0 the qthread class did not inherit from qobject

25313999
qthread	qobject
as such if you want to create a class derived from qthread that has signals you must inherit from both qobject and qthread

25314037
put	get
this works fine when just one machine is calling but when put two or more machines i get an error

25314067
scipy	cvxopt
i need to convert a scipy sparse matrix to cvxopt s sparse matrix format spmatrix and haven t come across anything yet the matrix is too big to be converted to dense of course

express	node.js
i built a call center solution using node.js express socket.io javascript html5 and css3

25314151
devise	cancan
authorizing non-logged-in user behavior in rails with cancan and devise

25314237
folder	directory
because i specified the whole path to the root directory of the project the lib folder i think

25314265
hide	show
you just have use setvisible boolean on the point you want to show hide for example like this

25314265
hide	show
see this jsfiddle demonstration for tips on how to show hide using a clickable div

25314268

25314286
ubuntu	linux
run the following installation scripts from the folder of_v0.8.3_linux64_release scripts linux ubuntu

25314300
folder	directory
or having the directory structure already present in the modules file folder or running an exec that creates the directory tree which i would like to avoid as it is not exactly ensuring a state which is the goal of puppet

25314318
elf	dwarf
on linux gdb would read the debug information in dwarf format from the debug sections of the elf executable compiled with gcc -g

25314321
exif	xmp
the only difference i see is that the xmp exif data is different

25314390
post	get
if you need to post data and then get a result back you re going to have to use two calls

25314390
post	get
so you build pages only based on what s in your data base you post data to your java servlets only to get them to start doing something and you don t wait for a response their result will end up in your database and you ll get it for pages once it s in and your java programs do what they need to do independently of your wordpress setup

25314408
post	get
given what you ve posted it s not clear to me if the id of the post will be or but i think you get the point

25314466
min	max
this has the radius and opacity oscillating between two min and max points

25314497
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseover and mouseout events use both elements

25314530
mouseover	mouseout
then i set the properties for the mouseover and the properties for mouseout

25314530
hide	show	mouseover	mouseout
the effect is the link hide on document ready is show on mouseover and hide again on mouseout

25314532
post	get
now all you need to do to get at the meta data for a user or post is

25314585
switching	screens
hide one for the screens css and then switching which one you are hiding in your print css

25314616
ready	each
if you did that you could return each document that is ready to the subscriber when it s ready and not worry with building a list of any kind at all

25314620
put	get
inside an ejb i can get the beanmanager over regular inject and put it in the constructor of my custom constraintvalidatorfactory

25314621
inherited	properties
the alternate views then show inherited properties from the master form allowing you to alter values and include specific styles that match the platform

25314676
int	chars
by defining the type of pointer like int chars or void we restrict the use of pointer for specific data type

25314691
activemq	rabbitmq
i m new with rabbitmq and amqp but i have some experience with activemq and jms

25314698
hide	show
i have this simple jquery code below that show or hide a bunch of table rows depending on the value of 2 radio buttons

25314698
hide	show
the code below works great for the click event but i would also like to add in code that work when the page is loaded before the click event ever happens it should show or hide my table rows based on the value of the radio button

25314698
hide	show
so when page loads if the radio button for the yes value is selected it should show the tables if no then it should hide them

25314715
versioning	upgrade
what i am trying to do is upgrade to the latest 1.74 versioning due to memory spikes on do vps s3fs is taking up 480mb of the 500mb memory but having problems with the file permissions

25314720
cos	sin
thus sin and cos are flipped when dealing with angles

25314847
int	double
so in the case of an expression comprising of two int only the first int is casted to double

25314849
post	get
i saw some existing post about that but i was not able to get a consistent answer from them also

25314872
min	max
use a cte to get the min max value -

25314879
min	max
if you set the display values to null before changing the min max values the view will default back to just showing the value and won t access the array at all

25314908
put	get
you should get in the habit from the beginning to not put javascript and css inline

25314913
width	height
this example uses an image with an original width of 800px and a height of 300px

25315001
versioning	upgrade
recommend you upgrade to newer versioning

25315004
dependencyobject	freezable
all you need to do is change fieldheading to derive from freezable instead of dependencyobject and changes to items in the collection will give the same change notification as if the entire item had been replaced

25315015
children	parent
in fact i success to regex parent shortcodes but not children shortcodes

25315015
children	parent
it works with parent shortcodes but not with children shortcodes

25315083
touchesbegan	touchesended
ive subclasses skspritenode and am trying to implement a simple button by overriding the touchesbegan and touchesended method of skspritenode and added a couple of methods to animate the button when its pressed released

25315097
pop-up	dialog
if this is simply for testing i would set an environment variable that you test for when displaying these pop-up dialog

25315106
plot	heatmap
i am using pylab.figure to plot a heatmap

25315106
plot	heatmap
problem i want to plot a heatmap with about 30 rows and nearly 2000 columns

25315106
plot	heatmap
plot multiple heatmap for spans of 200 columns

25315107
button	checkbox
i have a simple form with radio button and checkbox where user can choose between downloading single or multiple language packages

25315107
button	checkbox
if single option is selected the checkbox should behave just like radio button and only one checkbox can be ticked

25315134
google-chrome	firefox
i am facing problem in internet explorer the following code is running fine on both firefox and google-chrome but internet explorer showing alert value undefine

25315171
google-chrome	safari
this might be part of a bug reported om google-chrome browsers since safari also uses the webkit engine

25315198
screens	tablet
but on a tablet you will want to show both on the screens at a time

25315215
youtube	vimeo
another option worth looking into if youtube is not your only options i m pretty sure both vimeo and wistia have these capabilities built in and are very simple to embed

25315228
width	height
the general idea although simplified in this question is to pin the view to the top and left give it fixed height and variable width

25315230
button	checkbox
only if you add new data for example using add button of form editing then the checkbox in the add form will be checked by default

25315250
button	checkbox
here if you click any of the radio button all the checkbox get deselected and if none of the radio button are selected the user can not select a checkbox the rest is as requested in the question

25315258
post	put
that way the user can just select animated when they make a post and it will apply the animated style to that post using an injected style from dynamic variable in angular it works if i pass the variable into a tag but that will animate each tile i just want to animate the ones selected using style but the css i dont know how to put it inside those tags right or if what im doing is possible

25315272
getter	setter
your gist is talking about getter and setter that are automaticly created via __call with no extra logic

25315272
getter	setter
the good thing about getter and setter is you can work with the value before you set or get it

25315272
public	protected
if you would make the fields public instead of protected it would have the same result

25315272
getter	setter
side note ide s like php storm can automaticly create setter and getter for you if your wrting in this case simple press alt+enter on the field

25315324
folder	directory
to get around this i had to remove the node_modules from the webapp folder and move it into the root directory of the project as well as the karma.conf.js file

25315324
maven	pom.xml
the final part was in the actually maven pom.xml

25315368
google-chrome	firefox
it works well with google-chrome and firefox

25315437
width	height
this is the purpose of the vh viewport height and vw viewport width

25315476
rss	feed
i think a solution that s better than the suggestion above is to use the built-in github feature of rss feed for any github paths

25315476
rss	feed
see setting up an github commit rss feed

25315545
button	checkbox
it sounds like all the data should be sent to the same place and thus there s no reason to wrap the radio button and checkbox in separate tags

25315602
gson	jackson
use any json parsing library such as gson or jackson and convert it into java object

25315648
children	parent
second table is for parent attributes and third table is for children attributes and values

25315648
children	parent
i need solutin for sum value all children descendants for each relevant parent

25315679
lodash	underscore.js
underscore.js and lodash have a memoize function included

25315687
pull	push
my current solution is to have a grunt task temporarily add gruntfile.js and others to .gitignore pull from upstream and then remove them from .gitignore so that i can track my own changes and push to my origin

25315700
post	get
you should use post instead of get if you are going to modify information in the database

25315775
put	get
another approach is to put the args in a .ps1 file and execute it to get back a hashtable with all the args that you can then splat e.g

25315833
isotope	masonry
also the masonry isotope behaviour has been selected

25315869
winpcap	libpcap
on several platforms including windows the mechanism libpcap winpcap uses buffers packets up as they pass the filter and only deliver packets to the application when the buffer fills up or the timeout expires

25315880
disk	ram
this will store your data on disk instead of ram but you still interact with it the same way

25315921
versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade you versioning of apache tika

25315945
dictionary	map
you need to turn your list of tuples into a dictionary which is ridiculously easy to do in python then call map on it

25315945
dictionary	map
the docs for map show that that it takes as a function arg a dictionary series or function

25315947
put	get
in my class i ve got a uniqueentity limitation on the user field originally on the combination of user and name which is derived from the fosuserbundle if i put the constraint on name for example the constraint does its job and i get an error saying it s not unique

25315952
google-chrome	firefox
ie does not function on other browsers google-chrome and firefox

25316012
stdout	stderr
in development the logging works fine i can see the log messages in the console as expected from debug to warn in stdout and from error to fatal in stderr as configured - check log4j.xml configuration file bellow

25316012
stdout	stderr
in production i want the messages to be logged in the daily rolling file with level range from info to fatal plus the stdout and stderr tomcat.stdout and tomcat.stderr as mentioned above check log4j.xml configuration file bellow

25316038
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the following doesn t have the desired effect

25316070
folder	directory
firstly my folder structure contains and i will only put here what is relevant a cache components and views directory

25316071
post	get
if you need it to return json you would just make an http get or post request to a url

25316087
google-chrome	firefox
right click- inspect element- console on google-chrome firefox or f12 developer tools - console in ie

25316103
debian	linux
however certain websites are not loading on linux debian fedora

25316156
fpdf	fpdi
here s an example using fpdf with fpdi

25316161
width	height
you should be setting the images immediate parent elements width and height

25316161
width	height
then you can set the image to width 100 height auto

25316188
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome safari will resize the placeholder text as well making it the defining text once you start typing

25316199
put	get
there is no need to put it as a global instance it is already bounded to the activity which you can directly get its instance from the activity through calling its name

25316214
bids	ssis
a bids 2008 ssis package that i am working is failing validation when it reaches any data flow task in the package

25316214
bids	ssis
i am able to run the ssis package within bids 2008 on my computer locally

25316221
google-chrome	firefox
the page performs as expected in firefox 31 and google-chrome 36 on windows 7

25316234
vbscript	vba
convert the named arguments of vba to positional arguments of vbscript based on the docs for that method

25316254
put	get
when i put it through my chrome js console i get the error require is not defined which is an integral part of the code to parse the data so i m not sure how to fix this

25316310
client-side	server-side
this won t work on chrome because node is a server-side platform but the chrome console is for client-side stuff

25316319
post	get
if this is not enough to get you started i m sure someone else will post an entire coded solution

25316351
children	parent
this structure results in a lot of empty fields one parent may have hundreds of children while most of them only has a couple or none

25316383
google-chrome	firefox
doesn t work in google-chrome or firefox

25316390
pull	push
the other way i have thought about this is to use the app to pull data from each db then push it to the data warehouse but i am not sure about performance

25316395
client-side	server-side
in this basic sense you could consider it a conflict because your server-side routes should not match your client-side routes since you need to respond with the initial load index.html all the angular js files etc every time the browser comes in fresh

25316421
width	height
the blank copy is actually your copied div it has width and height so it is displayed on page as an empty block

25316436
multiplying	add
of course the easiest way to multiplying an integer by ten is to add a zero so it is fine to write

25316449
typedef	struct
rsichannel is a typedef struct

25316467
post	get
this error is saying you re trying to hit a route with an incorrect http method basically you re trying to post to a route that only allows get access

25316487
folder	directory
include the include folder in the list of the header files directory with the -i option in the gcc options during compilation -i system library frameworks python.framework versions 2.7 include

25316536
post	get
it s not about javascript instead laravel uses post method to submit a form by default and methodnotallowedhttpexception occurs when you declared a route in your application basically in routes.php file using one method get post delete etc but using a different method to submit the form

25316536
post	get
then use get method in the form or if something else then use that method but if you used post then you don t need to use any method in your form

25316629
google-chrome	safari
the log for my ios safari shows undefined whereas the log for desktop google-chrome says test as it should

25316652
subobject	instances
creating an instances of subobject will cause a null pointer as setname is called in the constructor but the implementation of setname relies on the id field having been initialized

25316652
super	extends
someone extends a class should not have to go check the source code of the super class to ensure the constructor isn t calling overrideable methods

25316655
filtering	grouping
or you could create a custom filelistfilter and use some kind of thread affinity to assign files from each grouping to a specific thread with the filtering only returning this thread s file s

25316674
button	checkbox
here is a form with dynamicly created checkbox and a button that checks them .

25316721

wow64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 36.0.1985.125 safari 537.36

25316726

you can use ng-show ng-if etc directives to show hide validation errors based on the state of the form and or fields

25316775
laravel	slim
i want to access variables through globals variable in php using laravel or slim

25316775
laravel	slim
i don t know why using laravel or slim can not get the result

25316819
filtering	grouping
i can easily use a grouping filtering or even a tablix filtering to eliminate the detail row for the previous entries

25316819
filtering	grouping
however i cannot find a way to exclude the filtering detail from the grouping totals

25316821
altera	xilinx
i implemented a sata controller for my final bachelor project which supports multiple vendor device platforms xilinx virtex-5 altera stratix ii altera stratix iv

25316945
width	height
also change the cornerradius to always be 1 2 of the width or height of the layer

25316953
strcpy	malloc
you use std classes objects but you use c string functions strcpy and malloc function

25316992
next	except
i have everything except for the lines that are next to the read and more words for which i used before and after pseudo elements

25317012

i assume the guidelines are based on the fact logic can be performed inside getter and setter going the field route will eliminate that risk

dbcontext is just a good one wrapper around objectcontext that enables fairly easy code first which allows you to use poco s easily and generally it is more convenient to build a data layer with it

25326042
dbcontext	objectcontext

25326042
dbcontext	objectcontext
besides that dbcontext has some limitations compared to objectcontext for example there s no out-of-the-box support for storedprocedures using dbcontext except from stored procedures for cud operations so you would have to fallback to objectcontext anyway

children	parent
i think denormalizing information about parent into children is a schema design technique that is greatly underused and it sounds like a good fit for your use case

25343540
int	double
if you pass an int and printf tries to retrieve a double you invoke undefined behaviour

25343545
integer	fractions
in spreadsheets dates have a native value of an integer representing the number of days since december 31 1899 and time is a decimal value which is the fractions of a day 6 hours 1 4 of a day for example 0.25 day

25343649
post	get
i have three tables likes post and users and in my program i get the post by user id while doing this i want to return if i liked post or not i tried to do it like this

25343657

25343689
getter	setter
i have already done the parameters getter and setter

25343745
getter	setter
the entity is the object representation of the relational table and contains all the metadata getter setter annotations etc necessary to create the table

25343757
put	get
i put this code in a index.php file and when i run it in my browser i get

25343855
post	get
to handle that you might get by by simulating a post request posting the username and password retrieving whatever it is that facebook returns that would allow you to continue authenticating to facebook but this is going to be specific for facebook not something inherent in the http protocol

25343871
free	malloc
if you have a pointer to memory that have been allocated using one of the malloc type calls then when you are done with the memory area you should deallocate the memory using free

25343871
free	calloc
similarly using calloc which also allocates from the heap should be followed by the use free to deallocate the memory when done with it

25343871
free	alloca
the other memory allocator such as alloca which allocates from the stack and not the heap see on the use and abuse of alloca does not use the free function and that memory will be recovered automatically as the stack pointers are adjusted when the function in which it is used returns

25343871
free	malloc
you could also add intelligence so that if there is memory already allocated and it is the correct type then you do not do a free followed by a malloc but instead just return back

25343882
post	put
please put the code of displaying post s content into the condition

25343895
sip	sdp
the exchange of sip message is what establishes that through an exchange of sdps so your sipp sdp should not contain information about a remote media server that it would not know about in a real call

25343946
google-chrome	firefox
i has something to do with how google-chrome establishes a stacking context and also explains why preserve-3d is not required in some instances where firefox would require it to display correctly

25343987
maven	m2e
i am using maven 3.2.2 and m2e 1.4

25344011
hive	hdfs
once it was in parquet i could upload it to hdfs and create a hive table on top of it

25344039
build.gradle	gradlew
then you can easily add gradlew libraries to your project s build.gradle and it will take care of downloading and maintaining them

25344041
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
the question asks to implement a templated c++ class vector with type t that would behave like stl vector with the following extensions it should support addition subtraction and multiplication

25344091
subtract	add
they add to the width of each column rather than being subtract from it

25344129
int	chars
the sscanf function translates 2 hex chars into a single int value

25344145
udp	tcp
tcp or udp size

25344150
post	get
the get post issue would lead me to suspect a problem with my routes - except.

25344155
for-loop	loops
if you loops through categories with for-loop when posting to actionresult it will be able to bind model to list here is post about binding model to list

25344173
google-chrome	firefox
my footer will not stick to the bottom of the page in the latest firefox while it works in google-chrome and ie11

25344229
button	checkbox
here checked is used to enable the button after the checkbox has been checked

25344235
crypt	hash
i first attempted to use crypt directly this was fast but resulted in mangled hash as the threads were contesting the crypt function

25344241
put	get
the number 111 would never actually get put into grp because all the characters are the same so neither nor would ever evaluate to true

25344279
int	chars
the x format converts hexadecimal chars to a int value in this case a chars code and the 2 specifies a maximum field width so that it consumes at most 2 chars

25344295
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
now that you have added the whole question i can read what i expected it states that t supports addition subtraction and multiplication

25344295
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
however a more thorough question would state that t should support addition subtraction and multiplication since the vector class itself is meant to support these and there is no real need for special values like 0 or 1

25344295
int	double
the fact is you will most likely use that kind of vector with fundamental types like int or double so you do not need to worry about it

25344295
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
so the question essentially states that your t type should have what you need to implement addition subtraction and multiplication for your vector

25344310
memset	calloc
on the other hand if memset is happening in calloc the parameter size of the allocation is not compiled in in the calloc code and real memset is often called which would typically contain code to do byte-by-byte fill up until long boundary than cycle to fill up memory in sizeof long chunks and finally byte-by-byte fill up of the remaining space

25344310
calloc	malloc
one notable exception would be when you are doing malloc calloc of a very large chunk of memory some power_of_two kilobytes in which case allocation may be done directly from kernel

25344311
int	double
it will be 0 in case of int 0.0 in case of double in case of strings 0.0 0.0 in case of complex etc.

25344311
int	double
you can guess that for int it will be 1 for double 1.0 etc.

25344333

it turned out that i could come up with a distribution that worked on the following linux distros centos 7 64-bit ubuntu 12.04 64-bit and slackware 14.1 64-bit with kde desktop

25344410
physx	ogre3d
i can not understand how to draw physx debug visualization in ogre3d together with normal objects

25344469
folder	directory
this code will increase directory size limit up to 2 000 000 tb and will display more real size what would be useful if the folder contains too many files

25344493
google-chrome	firefox
however when i implement this myself as shown in this fiddle everything looks good in firefox and in google-chrome except for the line-height

25344493
google-chrome	firefox
however in firefox the resulting line height is 22px and in google-chrome the resulting line height is 19px

25344493
google-chrome	firefox
inexplicably bootstrap buttons appear to correctly yield 20px for the same concept in firefox and in google-chrome

25344521
int	boolean
boolean are interpreted as int under addition so

25344554
google-chrome	firefox
note if you do want to be able to open a new tab and not share cookies good for qa open the new tab in incognito mode or in a separate browser if you use google-chrome then use firefox

25344622
width	height
specifically check the height width and select the distance to lhs and distance to top by selecting the corresponding struts which will change to a highlighted orange colour see picture

packets	multicast
cellular networks do not usually support multicast packets

25344736
swift	objective-c
i m attempting to compile a swift app with supplementary objective-c files loaded via the bridging header

25344749
addition	multiplication
in my humble opinion the disputable quote dictates that the allowable types for t in the usable context of your should support the identities for addition and multiplication

25344749
addition	multiplication
nevertheless with the help of type traits and in particular std enable_if you could create a that would only compile if t supports the identities for addition and multiplication like the example below

25344856
button	checkbox
have a look at how to use button checkbox and radio button and how to use lists and how to use combo boxes for more details

25344927
int	chars
which to me should work whether it s done on a chars or an int but it doesn t

25344927
int	chars
it s giving me zero whether i try to assign it to an unsigned chars or an int

25345028
lseek	posix

25345243
swift	objective-c
implicitly unwrapped optionals are used almost everywhere in the cocoa apis as they are imported into swift √¢ this is to maintain compatibility with the kind of pointer semantics that are ubiquitous in objective-c without requiring

25345311
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop wrapping this task which causes it to be repeated a number of times - however each repetition i reset the pointer to memory to the same starting value so the inner loops should be performing exactly the same task each iteration of the outer loops

25345311
for-loop	arrays
my first instinct is of course that arrptr is being incremented beyond the boundaries of the arrays - however i don t think this should be happening based on the for-loop conditional and the fact that when i examine memory after copying the arrays back to the host no values outside of the arrays appear to have been modified

25345321
factors	matrix
so a species by site matrix with the ability to keep factors and aggregate at the level of replicate

25345331

for instance you could try first grouping the graphs maybe by sorting according to the number of nodes they have their order

25345477
pull	push
to constantly pull new data from the server and push data from the web interface to the usb device

25345495

25345574
ready	each
just style your li accordingly to be displayed underneath each other and you re ready to go

25345609
calloc	malloc
note that calloc zeroes memory before returning which means that buffer can serve as a null-terminated string directly whereas a string allocated with malloc cannot unless you zero it yourself

25345615
swift	objective-c
swift allows casting of class types into objects so they can be used in the objective-c way

25345617
width	height
to match the width of the window perceived by the css and the width perceived by javascript you can add a div giving it a width 100 and height 1px positioning it fixed so that it doesn t affect the regular flow of the rest of the page and then instead of you could write where refers to the div we added above

25345637
folder	dir
add schema object wih all descendants to dir like folder both where it will be visible for client and server

25345653
text-align	font-size

integer	unsigned
of an unsigned integer the fields will actually apply to the bits in order and in position assuming you know the endianness anyway

25345760
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
having spoken with a local meetup group on ios i have learned that the easy solution to my question is to avoid audioqueues and to instead use the higher level avaudiorecorder and avaudioplayer from avfoundation

25345763
for-loop	loops
programmers often refer to it as the for-loop because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied

25345773

25345841
getter	setter
my action object contains the person object with getter and setter

25345868
integer	unsigned
is an unsigned integer with the high order bit zero and all others set to 1 so

25345868
integer	unsigned
is an unsigned integer with the high order bit of one and all others set to zero

25345868
integer	unsigned
now getting this to work for all data sizes is nontrivial because c converts the operands of integer arithmetic to int or unsigned int beforehand

25345868
int	chars
produces an int result of -1 because the unsigned chars is promoted to int before the is applied

25345873
google-chrome	firefox
it works flawlessly in google-chrome but nothing happens in firefox

25346513
width	margin
it gets a bit hairy here because it s hard to place it in that exact spot but considering your first column is more or less a fixed width you can add a right or left attribute of 50 and adjust is with a negative margin

25346548
google-chrome	firefox
tested under firefox and greasemonkey -- i didn t test it under google-chrome

move requestlocationupdates and the scheduling and unscheduling of your alarm to onresume and onpause instead of oncreate and ondestroy

25352838

what i think is happening is onpause is being called at which point the locationmanager stops sending updates but onresume is called instead of oncreate and so you are not re-requesting updates

25352839

superclass	subclassing
i just released an uber-fast and lightweight classpath scanner git repo here that does not call the classloader to load classes on the classpath in order to determine subclassing superclass annotations etc. but rather reads the classfile binary headers directly inspired by but simpler than rmueller s classpath scanner linked in another comment

25354525
width	height	portrait	landscape
one of them is the fact that you can in the same view controller scene of a unique storyboard define constraints or fonts or subviews that will for example only be set for iphone in portrait mode compact width regular height and other constraints or fonts or subviews that will only be set for ipad in landscape mode regular width any height

25354525

width	height
i have been able to overcome this issue by utilizing a technique similar to squeezemod - it uses javascript to get the width and height of the browser window and then breaks it down into ems

25355315
width	height
it changes according to the width to height ratio too

25355315
width	margin
utilize this to add the width that safari has taken off in whichever way suits your items - margin border etc

put	get	post	get	post	put
- http put get post delete methods find the correct method

25356089
multiplying	add
i also found that you can add the same parseobject friend multiplying times because everytime you do so you create a new parseobject with a separate objectid and thus referencing a totally different parseobject

25356114
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
sounds like you have a method somewhere that scrolls the search bar off screen initially and every time you return to the view controller that s in charge of the search display controller said method is called repeatedly scrolling the table view higher and higher possibly via viewwillappear or viewdidappear

min	max
select id min value1 max value2

25356244

you can read up on casting but basically i m just telling java to treat that number as an int not a double

25372652
vim	sublimetext
sublimetext can be pretty smart about it but when i was using vim for example with matlab filetype it just ignores these characters

25372656

children	parent
anytime you change the opacity of a parent element it automatically applies to all children

25372829
children	parent
that would have the desired effect of sending a signal to all the children when the parent exits

activiti	alfresco
i am trying to re-assign the initiator in my alfresco activiti workflow to an admin to prevent the original initiator from modifying the workflow

25372907

you would use a min-max-median heap to find the min max and median in constant time and take linear time to build the heap

25372965
implements	extends
you could also extends the trait and implements apply and isdefined as shown here

25372973
pop-up	dialog
case 1 pop-up as in dialog showing

25372973
pop-up	dialog
via the android documentation here you can call the isshowing method to determine if a dialog pop-up is showing it will return true

25372991
onclicklistener	ontouch
unless 1 you use isspeakbuttonlongpressed outside of the ontouch function or 2 you have some other onclicklistener set or something like that which will cause pview.ontouchevent pevent to return true when a long click has not occurred.

crypt	hash
when i was using php 5.4 i used php s crypt function with crypt_blowfish hash type

25373203
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
the code above won t work because the api for ie s xdomainrequest is slightly different from that of xmlhttprequest

25373203
onreadystatechange	onload
for example instead of onreadystatechange it uses onload

25373293
xmlhttprequest	xdomainrequest
the xhr-xdr-adapter replaces xmlhttprequest with a different function which figures out at run time whether to use the native xmlhttprequest or the xdomainrequest instead

25373325
int	chars
the error occurs because you have corresponding columns in the two of the subqueries where the type of one is an int and the type of the other is a chars

25373325
int	chars
then the chars value has -- in at least one row -- a value that cannot be automatically converted to an int

post	get
best practice per latest answer to question above as well as other answers i ve already tried use get to transmit a token to my website so might be something like and then have a script on my website to take that token parse the data and post it

25373406
post	get
anyone can see the uri it can be cached bookmarked and therefore it can result in erroneous post to the database if constantly submitted i shouldn t do something like example.com id action as a get since this can trigger the action repeatedly which in my case since one of my actions results in deletion of records that would be bad

25373426
ssl	https
when i set my banner code loading via iframe then it works nice via http but iframe tag is removed when loading via https ssl

as of typo3 6.0 extbase and fluid are mandatory extensions they are installed by default and cannot be uninstalled

25373482
width	height
create a roundedboxview as a child of the grid to create your circle - you could either specify fixed width height on the grid outer control to know what value to specify the roundedboxview s cornerradius property or alternatively hook into the sizechanged event handler to set the values

25373490
filtering	grouping
so only those referenced in the first match and grouping stages combined will be included for the rest of the pipline stages and then possibly filtering down again

25373640
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql sql server etc are all kind of meant to be implementing the same thing - sql

25373677
post	get
you will get it back as a post request along with transaction ids when you get that post back you should remember to request paypal again to verify that it was legit

25373704
width	height
the size of the tree depends only on the size of the board height and width not the number of paylines which is the main advantage of this approach

25373760
floating-point	integer
on gpus which emphasize floating-point computation a bit more and may not invest much in integer computation even though it is easier the story is quite different

25373767
hash	hmac
the even more paranoid method is to use hmac with an instance-specific key rather than a simple hash though i can still imagine a miraculously-smart optimizer that recognizes that regardless of what key is used the algorithm it s compiling is just a slow way to do a string comparison and optimizes accordingly

25373786
getter	setter
you allow the shape to be changed by some means via a series of setter and getter which provides flexibility but doesn t tie you into a given mechanism so that the only to change the shape is by triggering an actionevent but allows you to change the way in which the shape changing mechanism works such as via a random selection radio buttons or list for example

25373791
inherited	properties
i know this is pretty old but for future googlers note that the data properties is inherited by child states so you can place something like this authenticate flag in the parent

width	height
here is a hacky bit of centering code that has worked for me to center a registration form div height and width can be adjusted however you like use of pixels is not a must.

istream	getline
std getline and istream getline are from different interfaces and accept different types of parameter

25374061
hide	show
so should i completely render out the data and use client side js to hide show the dom elements based on button clicks incorporating messy hash bangs and js methods to track location flow

25374106
hash	md5
i found a solution that claimed that any password whose md5 hash in byte form contained the string or | including the single quotes would be accepted if paired with the username admin

25374106
hash	md5
apparently this is because the byte md5 hash of 1184941 is 8√•¬æt√¢¬º√£ p√£¬Ω 0 |

25374106
hash	md5
i get that the true argument of the md5 produces a byte rather than hex hash and that the prefixing

25374156
folder	directory
the file that it references in the error message is in a modules folder in the virtual directory

25374200
post	get
this should be a rather long answer because there s a lot of things involved in the process request and workflow of a normal mvc get post workflow

25374208
int	chars
otherwise if k 1 return the string consisting of the single digit of s followed by lowercase chars √¢ e√¢ followed by a plus sign √¢ +√¢ or minus sign √¢ √¢ÀÜ √¢ according to whether n√¢ÀÜ 1 is positive or negative followed by the decimal representation of the int abs n√¢ÀÜ 1 with no leading zeroes

25374238
sorting	filtering
you can inspect the results of the http request to confirm this either in your browser dev tools or a program like fiddler but a properly implemented restful service will always behave this way filtering sorting logical operations etc

25374254

25374306
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine with ie and firefox but not with safari and google-chrome

25374315
folder	directory
..maybe your problem is that you forget to include the full path to javac when compiling because when you keep the sourcecode in the bin folder the files to compile are in javac s local directory

25374331
min	max
i am needing to add some calculations to the report that the visual editor wont allow me to do it is restricted to count sum min max avg var so not really helpful

25374332
webchromeclient	webviewclient
in this sense you can override certain default behaviors like javascript popup windows notifications titles and other window features by implementing your own webchromeclient as you have done with the webviewclient

25374345
postgresql	mysql
if you re getting the order id back from postgresql you don t need to query mysql again

25374383
submit	submission
this page intercepts form submit with javascript so form submission doesn t reach server at all

25374383
post	get
unless you can add post requests processing to the server side code you won t be able to get expected results on this website from your curl command

25374387
hide	show
rather than calling show or hide for each series call

25374406
int	chars
when you re querying a chars varchar field against an int mysql typecasts the contents of the field to an int to compare

my goal is to have it fill up the red div both height and width wise

25374501
uiswitch	uibutton
you can connect a uiswitch to an action method just as you could a uibutton so hook up your switches in your .xib file and add this code to your implementation file

25374541
pull	push
i used pull push on the columns so that it would flip them when the screen is large

25374568

i read in many post in stackoverflow and outside materials and java ee 6 specifications.i followed this structure but i still get this error

25374625
daemons	launchd
i think you would want to setup a daemons service to launchd the script for you though

25374648
profiler	yourkit
best commercial tools you can use with a 30 days trial is yourkit java profiler which lets you know lots of details about your code slow methods dead locks ..

25374655
udp	tcp
my first advice to you don t use udp if you want to transfer files with the sequence of lines preserved use tcp if you don t want to code alot

25374705
width	height
basically you need to create a random x position with the an upper bound no greater than the width of the applet and a random y position with an upper bound no greater than the height of the applet for example.

25374712
gruntjs	yeoman
i m new to phonegap and the yeoman bower gruntjs angular approach seems to be a pretty powerful stack

25374714
charts	pie-chart
the problem with my above code is that ember attaches the ember charts pie-chart to the bottom of the dom because i m not really using any views haven t specified a rootelement

25374738
portrait	landscape
that constraint is for portrait mode i also have constraints for landscape mode

25374738
portrait	landscape
the next orientation change to landscape will be flawless again but after another round of orientation changes the portrait is fine but the landscape ends up looking like this

25374773
ienumerable	iqueryable
ienumerable and iqueryable will just parse your data into the output format and you will not have a proper way to handle exceptions

25374811
post	get
to do this for each post i add all his likes 1 and dislikes -1 to get his score but each like dislike is weighted the latest the heaviest

25374811
post	get
if i want to get populars post given a tag or multiple tag i can t cache each query

25374893
sorting	filtering
i butchered a little bit of his example but this does seem to be close to the least amount of code necessary in django to have a generic class-based list view page with sorting filtering and thus search and pagination and i don t think it violates too m any django coding practices

25374896
screens	tablet
slider images are not shown on the desktop tablet and mobile screens but other single images are shown perfectly on every screens

25374917
serializable	deserialization
i guess adding a idispatchmessageinspector would allow me to hook in before deserialization of the request albeit after creation of a message object and i d like to hook in even before that but not after serializable of the response

25374935
post	get
i have a login link on every post so if a user log in from there it is supposed to be redirected to the post page but instead i get a redirection loop error

25374971

both receive the same data in the request body in the format of an htlm post form but one method handles put requests and another delete

25375099
rss	feed
it works with most rss feed by default and downloads efficiently but it also allows you to plug in your own parser and make it

25375122

question #2 kind of on point 1 - but this must only apply to those two boxes as the header and the entire rest of the site rely on that box-sizing border-box

25375147

could someone please tell me why my script isn t working wanting to tick a checkbox on a from when the button click on the popup modal

25375171
vmware	virtualbox
i therefore want to install canopy and whatever else i need to do the enthought training that is not independently available via debian packages as opposed to python packages into a python virtual environment as opposed to a vm like kvm virtualbox or vmware so as not to cause problems with dependencies of my system python

25375232
implements	extends
back-door is preferred so you need to define a user-defined backdoor access by extends the uvm_reg_backdoor class and implements the write method to write to the memory model as required

25375276
subtraction	addition
in gnu c addition and subtraction operations are supported on pointers to void and on pointers to functions

25375277
junit	mockito
i use junit classes to test my controllers it works very well using mockmvc mockito and reflectiontestutils.setfield .. .. .. to inject my mock behavior

25375283
pull	push
in the source put it in the order that you want for smaller viewports in the min-width of your choice sm md lg use the push and pull classes

25375312
google-chrome	safari
to target the latest version of google-chrome and safari you must use -webkit prefix

25375342
rss	feed
you need to be looking at the top of the rss feed and in particular the node which contains the link to the news cluster

25375355
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
that would also make sure it s the native method and is tested in google-chrome firefox and opera

25375422
cpython	ironpython
jython is a java implementation cpython is c implementation and ironpython is c# implementation

25375429
int	boolean
it seems the problem here is that when i do the loose comparison of a boolean with an int the type casting is converting the int into a boolean thus resulting in 2 being equal to true - since both are being tested as boolean

25375429
int	boolean
2 int is not exactly the same as true since true is is of a different type - boolean

25375443
int	boolean
the reason this happens is because you re comparing a boolean to an int

25375483
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are fine with .jpg or .png file extension

25375514
maven	pom.xml
if you are using eclipse and maven is integrated with eclipse then you can get the complete dependency hierarchy of dependencies in pom.xml

25375515
min	max
this is because any comparison with nan is defined to return false and by the definiton of min and max below

25375515
min	max
min and max with nan will return second and first argument respectively

25375606
width	height
in the above example use a height of 100 but you can change this to have the same height as width with a little javascript

25375621
hide	show
hide or show both does the trick

25375657
sorting	filtering
historically most of elasticsearch s jvm heap usage is due to query filtering and field data facets aggregations sorting and there weren t lots of safeguards in place to prevent oom this has changed

25375706
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i ve tried putting it in viewdidload but this method is not called upon entering the foreground neither is viewwillappear nor viewdidappear

25375752
implements	extends
public class tablaentrypoint extends composite implements entrypoint

25375780
onresume	onpause
note you should usually not bind and unbind during your activity s onresume and onpause because these callbacks occur at every lifecycle transition and you should keep the processing that occurs at these transitions to a minimum

25375819
getter	setter
you should use getter and setter when

25375819
getter	setter
your language s or sometimes your framework s idiomatic conventions encourage getter or setter for this use case

25375819
getter	setter
from an oo theory point of view getter and setter are useless

25375819
getter	setter
getter and setter just cloud that

25375819
getter	setter
but in anything but very simple cases neither the attributes nor getter and setter are part of the interface

25375819
getter	setter
and in some languages getter and setter are far from useless

25375819
getter	setter
if your language doesn t have properties then the only way to represent something that s conceptually an attribute but is actually computed or validated etc. is through getter and setter

25375959
onresume	onpause
if you d like to keep the creation in onresume then place the destruction and cleanup in onpause

25375959
oncreate	ondestroy
likewise if you d like to move the creation to oncreate ... then move the destruction and cleanup to ondestroy

25375965
tcpdf	fpdi
a quick search of the docs for tcpdf and fpdi cited in the link didn t reveal a compression option

25375986
google-chrome	firefox
this page prints out perfectly fine in firefox not tested in ie but in google-chrome when it prints the first row first 4 td s are screwed up

25376002
equals	gethashcode
correctly implemented gethashcode returns the same value for items that are considered equals

25376065
int	double
i suspect that the time-waster is not the floating point arithmetic but rather the conversions from double to int

25376065
128bit	64bit
you could do better by using 25 6-rolls to generate 23 7-rolls 1.13 6-rolls per 7-roll but that doesn t quite fit into 64bit arithmetic so the marginal advantage in calls to rand6 would be chewed up by doing the calculations in 128bit

25376074
spaces	delimiter
the better solution is to have another delimiter besides spaces like tabs and use t as fs

25376095
folder	directory
make a folder in the directory of your project and call it assets

25376142
width	height
i have created a plug-in that multiplies the height and width of an element selected by the multiple passed

mvp	command-pattern
this covers winform mvp dependency injection with castle windsor weifen luo docking suite command-pattern etc

25376174

ps the castle library used is versioning 2.5 so if you upgrade to versioning 3 this project won t compile

25376175

daemons	systemd
generally daemons are always running and some of the systemd applications related process just preempts other low-priority processes maybe like your s if your process has lower priority generally systemd processes and daemons preempt all other processes

25391040
daemons	systemd
so they don t slow the process but daemons and systemd processes are heavy one and they do affect your program significantly

25391040
daemons	systemd
here you ll find that apart from your process which is heavily utilising memory there are several daemons like powerd moused etc. and other systemd processes like xorg kdeinit4 etc.

25391040
daemons	systemd
either develop the code in machine-level language or assembly languages or other low-level languages which will directly run your process on the hardware without the need for os to manage memory sections and all and other systemd processes and daemons

25391040
daemons	systemd
and then this minimal os won t be a complete os---thereby lack of daemons multiple systemd calls as in major os like windows linux unix etc

25391954
factors	mean
reported twice but that doesn t necessarily mean it was thrown twice double multiple reports for the same stack trace happen often depending on your logging configuration and other factors - for example if your code logs the exception then rethrows it it might very well be logged again by another catch clause

you can use this solution cross-browser which is suitable for webkit google-chrome safari etc gecko mozilla etc and ie8+ as well

25394052
keydown	keyup
the only change i see in ryan west s solution is that he removed the keyeventf_extendedkey flag away from calling function keybd_event in the third argument in both keydown and keyup methods so as a result in keydown method the third argument of calling keybd_event function is 0 and in keyup method it is only keyeventf_keyup

25394398
http	spdy
here s my thinking note my website does not need to transmit sensitive data. if a browser connects to my website with http but it doesn t support spdy it ll be a waste

25394398

25394693
ember.js	backbone.js

i ll state the simple answer of how to convert chars data to a number whether an int double float etc. first for the record specifically focusing on the exception cases then delve into the detail that specifically applies to your problem

25394719
rss	feed
collect the fueldata in a logical way that can be accessed after parsing has finished such as feed1 being parsed into a set of fueldata feed2 to a set of fueldata etc then have onclick take all the fueldata that was parsed out of each of the rss feed do the comparisons via computesavings and return the results

int	chars
the conversion of a to int can be either via a.operator chars followed by an integral promotion or a.operator int followed by an identity conversion no conversion at all

25395056
int	chars
since the standard conversion sequence from int to int exact match rank is better than the standard conversion sequence from chars to int promotion rank the first beats the second and there should be no ambiguity - the conversion defined by operator int will be used for the initialization which then contradicts the sentence in √¢ 13.3.3.1 over.best.ics p10 that says the function call will be ill-formed because of ambiguity

25395078
flatmap	fold
then orelse getorelse or fold and map flatmap functions can be used to dispatch cased

width	height
percentage padding is always proportional to the width of an element and not its height even if its top or bottom padding

25404121
width	height
so utilising that you can give an element a percentage width to sit within a container and then padding to specify the aspect ratio or in other terms the relationship between its width and height

25404121
width	height
so in the above example the object takes 80 of the container width and then its height is 56.25 of that value

25404121
width	height
if it s width was 160px then the bottom padding and thus the height would be 90px - a 16 9 aspect

many-to-many	one-to-many
the cleanest solution i ve found for this scenario is to break up the child_entities relationship by adding entity_weights as a one-to-many relationship on entity and use an association proxy to proxy the weight value as well as the remote side of the many-to-many relationship

25414748
width	height
for exmaple when i draw a rectangle on the picturebox then i use a breakpoint in the cropimage method i see that the variable rect is for example x 136 y 149 width 131 height 106

25415568
linefeed	delimiter
you have to set the the delimiter on the root in the example below child delimiter 0x0d 0x0a cr linefeed child delimiter type hexadecimal child order infix but that may vary and you have to declare the correct delimiter and where the occur

25415568

versioning	upgrade
you create mapping models for each versioning upgrade that will deal between two model versioning

25416751
versioning	upgrade
you then have as many mapping models required that will cover all the versioning upgrade increments

25416751
versioning	upgrade
so if you have 4 versioning youll have 3 mapping models that will aid the transition between each versioning upgrade

25416751
versioning	upgrade
all you need then is some recursive code that will look at the existing store s meta data to determine whether it s compatible with the most current versioning and if its not it will then do a recursive migration for you automatically following the rules from each mapping model as it upgrade through the versioning until the store is up to date with the current versioning

25416751
versioning	upgrade
but in the instances where heavy migration is required for a specific versioning upgrade you can always do if statements where you can check the current store and if and only if the current versioning of the persistent store matches an upgrade where heavy migration is required you then tell the migration manager to perform a heavy migration and to follow a mapping model with a migration policy for that instance only and then resume lightweight migration if there are more versioning upgrade to do to get the persistent store to the most recent model versioning

if you re writing c++ you should use the new and delete operators instead of malloc calloc realloc and free

children	parent
when you remove an edge parent child from the graph you have to consider the possibility that there are alternate paths from parent s ancestors to child s children

25436503
children	parent
so before deleting the edge save all of the parent s ancestor s children - these are the potential alternate paths

25436503

everything is great with firefox but google-chrome yields no actual pictures that are posting

25437178
int	chars	int	double
or in the end it could be negligible arithmetic instructions are pretty fast depending on the scope of what you need and int double chars float data types are relatively small and well defined so you know how much memory you are taking up

25437190

i need to get the position of the label during its movement given by the action but calling label s method getx it returns the original position of the label the position that i ve set at the beginning building the new label in the method setbounds float x float y float width float height while i need to get its current position

for-loop	arrays
you should use either your student count variable countstudents in the for-loop or better yet use which is ideal for your use and less prone to these problems than an arrays

children	parent
i would like to be able to get both the children and parent of each node instance so i think i would need to define both its parent and its children

25437376
children	parent
but the problem is that there will be a copy of each node inside each of its children and parent

25437376
children	parent
in c++ there is no such a problem because we can refer to the children and parent of a node by storing the pointers to its children and parent only in it

25437380
clang	llvm
the xcode compiler is clang llvm but ruby mri 1.9 only supports gcc another older but widely used compiler

unix	solaris	unix	aix	solaris	aix
your script works just fine with no change under solaris 11 and probably also most commercial unix like aix and hp-ux because under these oses the underlying implementation of bin sh is provided by ksh

25437479
zsh	subshell	bash	zsh	bash	subshell	subshell	dash
it doesn t work for you likely because your bin sh is implemented by one of bash dash mksh or busybox sh which all process each component of a pipeline in a subshell while ksh and zsh both keep the last element of a pipeline in the current shell saving an unnecessary fork

in swift however the compiler will analyze which of the fastest can be used and try to decide on your behalf favoring inline static and virtual but retaining messaging for objective-c interoperability

25438299
swift	objective-c
pure swift without objective-c interop is like c++ in that being a direct-to-executable compiled language with static dispatch then these dynamic features are not possible at runtime

25438304

check your directory and you now only have the helloworld-html5 folder

25438406

it appears to be defaulting to the haskell folder perhaps because this directory is listed first

25438406
g++	gcc
however this folder contains gcc and g++ but not gdb

25438406

also ideally i would like it to look in the c mingw directory first since this is the folder i plan to keep updated and the one that contains all of the various applications

realloc	malloc
most malloc implementations over-allocate this is the reason why realloc can sometimes avoid copying bytes - the old block may be large enough for the new size

25439026
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
but apparently in your environment the system malloc doesn t do that so i think your only option is to reimplement all 3 primitives gmp_default_ alloc realloc free on top of the system-provided malloc free

25439026
realloc	malloc
if all you want is a more efficient realloc you can simply overallocate in your custom malloc up to some size say the nearest power of 2 just so you can avoid copying in the subseauent re-alloc

25439026
free	malloc
you can improve performance even more if you never or infrequently return the malloc ed blocks back to the os from within your custom heap i.e keep the gmp_free ed blocks around for subsequent reuse instead of calling the system free on them immediately

25439222
min	max
i remove just one min and one max value

25439222
min	max
and if you and to remove all duplicated min and max scores add this before summing the final score

25439222

since you want the min and max value to be added only once each inthe code above - right after this add
