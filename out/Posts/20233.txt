clang	llvm
compile llvm with clang inside from svn linux and osx by following the getting started page by running the configure script without using cmake

25920130
clang	llvm
presumably i can just set up my llvm build to build clang along with libc++abi and libc++ by also checking out libcxxabi and libcxx from svn and my expectation is that installing it ought to make magically work

25920130
clang	llvm
unfortunately i am running full filesystem text search over my llvm source dir and finding no matches to such a string so it can t be a config used by clang or during the process of building clang

25920130
clang	llvm
the presence of two ignoring nonexistent directory entries indicates to me that xcode s clang is able to find a libc++ at its hardcoded apps xcode.app ... c++ v1 while my svn clang is not finding one at the place it wants to look inside the release+asserts build dir which seems silly but it may actually be where libcxx copies its headers into by the llvm build system

25920794
disk	ram
now if you like to save room on disk or in ram due to needing to store lots of bools go ahead but it isn t going to save room in all cases unless you actually pack the structure and on some architectures packing can also have performance impact because the cpu will have to perform unaligned or byte-by-byte access

one approach is to get cloudberry to put the files somewhere else and then run a script periodically that either moves or renames the files into the directory you ve attached your streaming app to

25921267

i suggest that if you do not need elastic capabilities it is fine to use load balancer like apache nginx and etc to load balance the identity server cluster

25921518
gruntjs	yeoman
i m somewhat new to web app development and ran through the yeoman tutorial which uses yo gruntjs bower and angular

25921545

what you can do is redirect stderr to stdout and either pipe to out-null or capture it as suggested

25921603
width	height
i want to ensure that its height and width are no greater than 100 of the container it is in

25921603
width	height
i cannot set the width and height values to 100 because that would force the image to potentially lose its ratio

25921608
cout	cin
you need a cin to set yes and your cout lines are in the wrong place

25921612

we have to update a spring project where we need to embed a https server which supports ssl protocols and cipher suites selection

25921683
width	height
here you re saying let s make this image as wide as possible preserving its proportional height however let s not grow over 250px width

25921683
width	height
in this case image will adjust to 100 width with proportional height

25921683
width	height
however if height reaches 200px then the width will adjust proportionally

25921714
move	drag
in some applications when you move the form near a border corner of the screen the application automatically self adhering to that border until you drag the form far the border to un-adherit

integer	unsigned
unsigned integers shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

25921843
integer	unsigned
48 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type

width	height
adding the max-width and max-height to your images will restrict the width and height but will never cause them to increase beyond the images initial dimensions

25921994
getter	setter
i would recommend using the define plugin which makes it easy to create computed getter and setter without having to explicitly create computes

25921999
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
working with objectoutputstream and objectinputstream

25921999
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
then we wrapped the fileoutputstream in an objectoutputstream which is the class that has the magic serialization method that we need

25922133
for-loop	loops
other notes if you know how many times you want to loops then use a for-loop

25922138
free	malloc
but your 1d array is really just another malloc d chunk of memory to hold these malloc d addresses and that needs to be free also

25922144
fast-forward	merge

25922162
min	max
i am trying to use opencv min max or minmaxloc to get min and max values within a mat

25922162

the alternative would be to iterate over the entire mat manually and calculate min and max values while ignoring -100 but i would like to use built in functions if possible

25922193
post	get
post re-installing i can t remember for the life of me the settings i changed to get it to work

m2e	maven-jar-plugin	maven	m2e
the weird thing i noticed when reproducing your scenario is that if i add all of the above maven configuration the maven-jar-plugin and the test-scoped dependency but i keep the resolve workspace artifacts checkbox ticked m2e fails to resolve the test jar in the workspace even if the target folder contains the jar and the project is refreshed updated

25922556
yacc	bison
you should look into flex bison also called yacc which are compiler generators

25922556

25922665
google-chrome	firefox
of course i ve used both indicated methods for google-chrome and firefox

25922673
memcpy	malloc
if you are using pointers before you use memcpy you must explicitly reserve or allocate space for storing the bytes you are copying over using malloc or other memory allocation routines

25922717
namenode	hdfs
i am not able to view the files in my hdfs on hadoop fs -ls command and i think it is because the name node is not running.i have tried formatting the namenode as well as changing the port in core-site.xml to a different value.still my jps is not listing namenode

25922746
width	height
the arrow symbols do not have separate adjust-ability in width and height its just size

25922750
put	get
imo this negatively affects some applications for example if you are displaying an image defined by on an integer grid you d better put 0 0 outside the image area otherwise you ll get a visible line at x 0 and another one at y 0 on some image operations

25922776
google-chrome	firefox
there s no way to duplicate a tab opened as a popup in ie and firefox at least i havent found one but in google-chrome is still possible

25922803
factors	matrix
a compounding factors is that i programmed the algorithm to fully interact all categorical and continuous variables in the training frame so a 1 000 000 x 8 matrix can very easily expand to say a 1 000 000 x 32 matrix

25922858
children	parent
you see macmade objc4-437.1-runtime contains what you d get if you went to apple s open-source web site looked under the os x column for 10.6 clicked the disclosure triangle to show this parent item s children clicked on any of the links in the section of the sub-list from 10.6.2 through 10.6.7 scrolled down to find objc4-437.1 downloaded the source code went to wherever you saved this download deleted everything but the runtime folder extracted its contents into wherever it resided deleted the now empty runtime folder and made the resulting folder into a github repository

25922895
g++	gcc

in the desktop the game runs on a resolution of 480px width x 800px height orthographiccamera

25923135
min	max	minimum	max
incidentally min and max compare two elements or pairs of elements of identically-sized arrays and gives you the minimum or maximum rather than finding the global min and max of an array so these are probably not what you want

25923164
onresume	onpause	oncreate	ondestroy
in case you re talking about your own app measuring time from itself you could set starting and ending points within oncreate ondestroy and onresume onpause

oncreate	ondestroy
set it to true oncreate and back to false ondestroy

25923175

25923751
portrait	landscape
im trying to fire a segue based upon if the orientation is in landscape or portrait

25923755
int	chars
this should be int opt instead of chars c because it s an int value that is returned by getopt

25923755
int	chars
so it s hard to make a test to verify the behavior that you are getting but a suppose that the conversion from int to chars and then back again to int make it equal to -1 in this case

25923929
many-to-one	one-to-many
this would normally be one-to-many and i think would simply be within account there would be a list with the one-to-many annotation and in position an account with the many-to-one annotation

25924167
int	double
i know that you are not supposed to use double values in an int but i don t know of any other way to do this assignment

25924200
int	double
you will need to use a type of operation called a cast to explicitly narrow the type from double to int

25924200
int	double
also the word as makes a bit more sense than of --you re taking the product and representing it as a double int instead of taking a product of specifically int or double your factors divisor dividend are always double

25924211
int	double
this is java detecting what you are doing and thinking it may be a mistake on your part - int s are less specific than double s

25924215
int	double
you used the double to calculate an int result the double is more precise than the int so you lost precision

25924215
int	double
what you needed to do is to cast the variables from double to int by doing the following

innodb	myisam
innodb and myisam with respect to designing a table or database you asked about are support for referential integrity and transactions

25932973
innodb	myisam
if you need the database to enforce foreign key constraints or you need the database to support transactions changes made by two or more dml operations handled as single unit of work with all of the changes either applied or all the changes reverted then you would choose the innodb engine since these features are absent from the myisam engine

25932973
innodb	myisam
those two specific engines you asked about innodb and myisam have different design goals

25932973
innodb	myisam
so in choosing between innodb and myisam the first step is in determining if you need the features provided by innodb

25953598
jtextfield	jpasswordfield
myself i would display the above gui as a modal jdialog not as a jframe i would use a jpasswordfield instead of a 2nd jtextfield and i d give my class public getter methods that would allow the calling class to query the state of its fields something like

25953612
min	max
you have to adjust the min and max values to your needs

25953628
int	chars
you need to compare the chars with the chars constants 0 and 1 rather than the int values 0 and 1

25953644
strlen	strcpy
you should include cstring header for strlen and strcpy

25953691
post	get
alternatively change post to delete to get you going

25953699
post	get
at this point i need to inject the data from the second incoming http post into the response of the first incoming http get request

25953699
post	get
i can allocate an id to the original incoming http get request and have that id be a present in the second incoming http post

accessor	properties
note that these are not isfinished isexecuting or iscancelled - those are the names of the synthesized get accessor for those properties

25953717
accessor	properties
what you re doing here is sending manual kvo notifications for the get accessor not the properties being observed

25953717
accessor	properties
if you are truly paranoid about kvo and want to send notifications for the get accessor key paths such as isfinished register your properties as a dependency of the key path

25953729
subtract	add
note that jim inverts c_in with binv which allows c_in to be used for daisy chain operations a 64 bit add or subtract with a 32 bit alu

25953729
subtract	add
synthesis software is generally smart enough to do all this with using jim s form modified to either add or subtract based on binv and a and b extended to 33 bits without any direct bit or bitfield manipulation our synthesis tools have had more than 25 years to get it right.

25953779
accessor	properties
isfinished is simply the the synthesized get accessor for the properties finished

25953779
accessor	properties
if you are truly paranoid about kvo and want to send notifications for the get accessor key paths such as isfinished register your properties as a dependency of the key path

25953794
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
to loops over the values of the arrays you can use a for-loop

25953890
accessor	properties
nsoperationqueue observes the key paths finished and executing for those states - isfinished and isexecuting are the names of the get read accessor for those properties

25953892
pull	push
in order to encrypt or decrypt you need to push or pull data through the portal from one side to the other

25953916
put	get
referring but whenever i put it before rng in if statements or before range set rng ... i get errors

25953934
width	height
right now my understanding is that i need to set the world bounds by calling game.world.setbounds width height and then check bounds by calling player.instance.body.collideworldbounds true

25954146
profiling	instrumentation
as always profiling with instrumentation

25954165
cpu	processors
the difference you notice is very small but i think the multi-thread processors is spending more time because the concurrency for the cpu resources between the threads

25954165
cpu	processors
the multi-thread processors needs to share the cpu between the threads and this may cost time and extra-processing and sometimes become your process more slow

25954165
cpu	processors
while the single thread processors does not need to share the cpu with no other thread it can run more efficiently

25954168
post	get
browsers can send an options request in addition to get or post to find out how the server feels about cors

25954191
for-loop	loops
at the end of the for-loop loops increments the variable so when you set it to 0 before the next check it becomes 1 due to the internal code of the for-loop

25954215
int	double
it mostly created types correctly but there are a few instances where double or int were created where strings are desired

25954230
osx	yosemite
i know similar questions exist such as mysql with mamp does not work with osx yosemite 10.10

swift	objective-c
once you have those in place your navcontroller property in swift can look pretty similar to the objective-c one

25954386
hide	show
i tried looking up the list of available functions in my case zclip has none and downloadify only has unrelated stuff like show hide classes so still no luck

25954462
put	get
the reason you get an error in the query you put in your comments is because your inline view -- the subquery in your from clause -- does not select the parent supplier name field so yes it does not exist in that inline view because you didn t add it to the select list of that inline view

25954467
getter	setter
i m just trying to find an abstracted method of updating a record syntax without having to explicitly define some sort of getter and setter

clang	llvm
in this case i m not exactly sure how to link the llvm api headers when compiling main.cpp with clang

25954490
try-catch	exception-handling
for catching errors in the input you should catch the exception-handling being thrown with a try-catch statement

25954497
distance	polygons
plenty of others don t use a delimiter at all and require you to start a new segment polygons if you re more than x distance away from the last point. furthermore these things often wind up being multi-gb ascii files so reading the entire thing into memory can be impractical

25954507
addition	multiplication
there are two overflow checks because there are two things that can overflow the multiplication by 10 and the addition

25954535
nstextview	nsbutton
the custom nstableviewcell commentcomposecellview contains a nstextview and a custom nsview commentcomposefooterview that contains an nsimageview and an nsbutton

rss	feed
in testing an article with the registered access level i find that article s content is revealed in the public atom rss feed for the category

25954589
public	protected
the menu item is set to public so visitors can see where the protected content is

25954589
rss	feed
the whole article is still in the atom rss feed though

25954589
rss	feed
both this feed and the rss version shows the entirety of the body of the test article

25954589
rss	feed
since the menu item is set to public i did try setting it to registered on the off chance that had anything to do with this but the entire test article still displayed in the atom and rss feed

everything went swimmingly git checkout -b my-patch-branch make my changes commit and i was able to push my-patch-branch back to a clone on github so the project could pull it

25954632
post	get
but this is working for me - combined with the map you have in your original post when i curl -h accept application vnd.com.example.api.v2+json localhost i get the expected response from an index.php file inside the version s directory

25954632
apache	nginx
i m not sure exactly what it does but i ve come across it before and it had fixed a weird 404 problem i was having in the past where the 404 was coming from hhvm not apache nginx

25954634
memcpy	memset
the initial page mapping is not assigned to any process just the kernel but doing so simplifies and speeds up the i o and or copying of data code kernel structures to freshly allocated memory maybe just with a memcpy or memset

25954638
for-loop	arrays
strings can be iterated over with a for-loop but you can t reference it like an arrays using

25954641
mouseover	mouseout
css doesn t distinguish between mouseover and mouseout but this thread seems like it may have the answer to your question

25954641
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout in css

25954696
verilog	hdl
an important distinction between writing system verilog or any hdl and writing in any software language c c++ java etc is that system verilog is designed to facilitate describing hardware structures while allowing for software-like testbenches while software languages are designed to allow users to give instructions to an interpreter vm or actual hardware

25954696
verilog	hdl
looking at your code and flow chart you were given it appears you are trying to use system verilog as a programming language rather than a hdl

25954698
inherited	properties
it will be nice to have base class which every ui page will inherited and put this properties in the base class

25954726
for-loop	loops
hint based on what i think you ought to be doing the inner loops should not be a for-loop

25954742
width	height
however i don t know why i cannot increase the width and height of the green circle in a way which is a little greater than the gray circle which i call it the main circle with a lower z-index in a way that by passing the time the green circle shows the progress around the main cirecle just on the border of gray circle because i use a lower z-index for green cirecle

25954766
for-loop	loops
do not change loops iterator inside the for-loop itself

25954784
tiff	png
delegates bzlib mpeg freetype jng jpeg lcms lzma png tiff xml zlib

25954787
width	height
i specified the width and height of the div so you can see the color changed because if you just define a empty div without dimension and contents you cannot see it

25954830
octal	decimal	octal	binary
decimal in binary work in a similar way to they do in the decimal octal or hexadecimal or any number system in that each number after the decimal point or binary octal hexadecimal point carries its own value

25954870
free	malloc
don t forget to free the dynamically allocated data after it is no longer needed to do so call the free function with the pointer returned by malloc

25954873
width	height
but you still don t get it s height width values before hand without javascript unless you know them

25954898
for-loop	loops
also your for-loop could encounter issues when it reaches the end of the string lets say the string was 10 characters long once loops reaches its 7th iteration it will no longer be able to add 4 to the index and check the character in that position so it would be best to only iterate as far as the 4th from last character since we already know that there wont be any further possible checks to carry out

25954922
for-loop	loops
you don t have to use for-loop loops just simply use following in delfun

25954931
width	height
inline-block elements are like inline elements but they can have a width and height

25954933
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox and ie ironically but never in google-chrome

anyways i m trying to create a template option in my main menu that hide show arrows but cannot seem to get it to work using elseif statements the class is not being inserted

25954956
jasmine	qunit
i think the xunit extension displays code coverage but it currently only works with jasmine qunit or yui tests

25954960
addition	multiplication
in the same way that you do multiplication before addition you do and before or

25954997
int	chars	int	double
the error is because you re passing a chars edit aka an int type single quotes where it expects a string double quotes

25954998

25955265
post	get
a form can be get or post

25955293
min	max	range	min	range	max
that is the preferred size must be in range of the min max sizes so you need to set the preferred size last

25955316
int	chars
shouldn t all short or chars types fit into an int by default given that int is larger than either in size

25955339
unsigned	short
in that case it is possible to have an unsigned short value that cannot fit into an int

25955403
onchange	onkeyup
as the suer types i want to validate onkeyup but i need to also fire the javascript onchange

25955423
int	chars
getc returns an int you re assigning it to a chars before comparing it with eof which is defined as -1

25955423
getc	gets
if it just so happens that getc returns character 255 it gets assigned to a char a signed 8 bit value which results in in a manner of speaking char -1 which then gets signed-extended to -1

25955489
put	get
this works when vars is empty but when i put something in vars i get

25955517

hex	binary
if you are trying to convert to binary data using a hex string this

25955566
hex	binary
in binary using hex notation as ff

25955566

25955676
jobs	cron
therefore i need to run many cron jobs in parallel in the same time during one minuets

25955731
metaclass	subclassing
if c# had metaclass you could say something like or perhaps the syntax would be and the compiler would only allow you to pass myclass or its subclassing as instances

25955764
pull	push
do i need to create a call from within booksservice to push the new data to bookscontroller or should bookscontroller have a call to pull the new data from booksservice and if so how would it know when it should make a pull

25955819
unistd.h	string.h
you will need to include some additional headers sys stat.h unistd.h for stat and string.h for strcpy and strcat in this example

25955823
foldable	traversable
you may be interested to see that getleaves in both cases can be implemented in the pattern of foldable or traversable

25955823
foldable	traversable
traversable implies foldable

25955829
pull	push
you need to create a fresh branch from the remote head cherry-pick the commit to that branch push the branch to your repo on github then create a pull request

25955839
post	get
i m not sure if the issue comes from creating the formsets in the get or post methods

25955848
apache	nginx
check you web server s apache nginx error log

25955869
apache	nginx
we use them for dynamic doc roots currently in apache but are migrating to nginx

25955895
dplyr	tidyr
you could use dplyr with tidyr

25955911
children	parent
the reason for this is that terminating the parent process will terminate its daemonic children but the daemonic children will not be able to terminate their children which will leave behind orphaned processes

25955950
initializer	class-method
most frequently class-method are used to initializer a new instance for example dict s fromkeys classmethod

25956009
put	get
getting 404 page not found error when try to access odata meta data information from breeze but i can get the information if i put url directly on browser without breeze

25956015
metaclass	isinstance
which makes me think that possibly testitem base is a child-class of table but isinstance self sch.table returns false so either it s not or the metaclass muckery is completely breaking isinstance

i have an android tablet samsung galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition which offers the screens resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels

25956136
width	height	screens	tablet
i ve installed android s firefox browser on my tablet and when i run a javascript code returning the screens width and height the result is less actual device s screens resolution result is 1280 x 800 pixels

25956178
dplyr	tidyr
just to clarify my code already does what i need it to do using spread then gather so what i m interested in is finding a more direct route within tidyr and dplyr

25956193
saas	iaas
i want to know regarding saas paas and iaas

25956200
width	height
i think that there is no need to complicate things you can use width property first then followed by height in animatorset your view gravity property will define in which direction view will expand .

25956288
dictionary	map
the problem is that you re passing a dictionary object to map

25956297
hide	show
e jquery is being used to have a hide show details on the page

25956368
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
next amazon-web-services encompasses the range of web services that includes ec2 and elastic beanstalk

25956368
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
elastic beanstalk will setup an environment for you that can contain a number of ec2 instances an optional database as well as a few other amazon-web-services components such as a elastic load balancer auto-scaling group security group

25956368
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
then elastic beanstalk will manage these items for you whenever you want to update your software running in amazon-web-services

25956368
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
you could run it straight on a single ec2 instance you could use a solution from the amazon-web-services marketplace or you could use elastic beanstalk

25956376
puma	unicorn	puma	thin	thin	unicorn
perhaps give thin puma or unicorn a go - they all handle concurrent requests

25956376
postgresql	mysql
switch to postgresql or mysql

25956378
saas	iaas
should i go for paas iaas or saas

25956389
listview	gridview
especially when you have a large amount of pictures and or using them to populate your listview or gridview

25956415
mp3	wav
i was loading a wav file that was being created by javazoom mp3 converter which was continually overwriting a file without deleting it first

25956438
width	height
then in the show the size inspector set the simulated size to freeform again and explicitly set the width and height to 768 and 1024

25956439
folder	directory
so i added a folder in apps directory called spree and model called product.rb and the code inside it is

25956442
post	get
so sending a get and then a post depending of the results of get is an elegant way to keep support for both old and new one

25956451
spaces	delimiter
then i need to parse all the data on those lines using both the dilemeter for individual words and as a delimiter for the words inside the brackets which need to have the spaces included

25956454
intersect	contains
for instance recognizing underline means start from a textrenderinfo object and scan all shaperenderinfo to try to match rectangle contains intersect .

25956473
filtering	grouping
if you create a query and add a filtering of iterationpath was ever project grouping iteration 1 you will see the work items that were ever under that node

25956486
cpu	processors
use 2 or more processors within single cpu

25956516
width	height
adding ids and classes between the two parenthesis above will specify special rules that will overwrite the rules written in media all header and would come into effect only on the screen whose width is between 1278px to 1282px so as you can see we are here targeting a screen of 1280px x xxx height 12 inch typical low-end netbook

25956523
accessor	properties
play safe and just have accessor methods for those two properties and not fields

25956565
post	get
now i need to get in to headache of post and get

25956569
stdout	stderr
note that i m also routing stderr to stdout

25956577
getter	setter
the last part of code triggers error missing return so my question is that - is there any possibility to make getter and setter without making a second variable

25956605
getter	setter
stored properties in swift are backed by hidden instance variables - the property itself is its own getter and setter unless you implement it as a computed property in that case you have to provide your own getter and or setter

25956658
int	chars
for example int and chars are both instances of eq

25956658
int	chars
so it is possible to create a polymorphic list that is also an instance of eq and can either contain int s or chars s but not both in the same list

25956658
int	chars
since haskell s lists are homogeneous it is not possible to put chars and int into the same list

25956658
int	chars
now let s make chars and int implement the trait eq

25956658
int	chars
now it is possible to create a in scala that accepts both chars s and int s into the same list note that this - putting different type of elements into the same list - is not possible haskell at least not in standard haskell 98 without extensions

25956741
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
for older versions of google-chrome firefox opera and safari browser prefixes like -webkit- -moz would be required

25956796
for-loop	loops
at the end of the while loops i id zero gets incremented by the for-loop i.e one

25956883
dplyr	tidyr
alternatively here s a dplyr + tidyr approach

25956908
ssl	https
we are using a comodo premium ssl wildcard certificate and it s working fine for our website and we setup the same for https and rdc

25956918
postgresql	mysql
for a real application you would probably pick some other database like postgresql or mysql

25956918
maven	pom.xml
with maven all you need to do is to add a dependency to your pom.xml

25956995
width	text-align
the thing is that it obviously also extends the p tag inside .content2 but that s a problem for me because i have a p tag inside .header and i don t want it to inherit that padding and that text-align i don t know if it s possible to just to inherit the first level of .content from width to background

25957083
implements	modifiers	moose	mason
override in mason implements the method modifiers override in moose

25957170
getter	setter
confusing to me and perhaps relevant is that some examples i see annotate the getter and setter but others as i am doing here annotate the actual lists

25957191
put	get
however i need to get the numbers keyboard to appear when the user clicks on the password graphic so i put an edittext over the graphic and made it invisible

25957218
pull	push
you d need to push from local and pull on the remote though

25957236
prepare	execute
sidenote i suggest since you are using mysqli utilize prepare statements to execute safer queries

25957343
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller

25957355
redhat	fedora
for redhat centos fedora

25957356
for-loop	arrays
i want to store these values in a vector or an arrays since the list is of finite length so that i can access the list in a for-loop to compare the users current position to the list of points like geofencing except i have a database of points

25957385
mouseover	mouseout
then in your section you define mouseover and mouseout functions which define 1 where the labels should show up and 2 what they should say and 3 toggles the class from invisible to visible

25957385
mouseover	mouseout
finally you just call the mouseover and mouseout functions when you re drawing all your circles

25957401
hide	show
the problem is i can t show or hide the window when i want

25957428
portrait	landscape
you can optimize for ipad by using the regular w regular h size class but you can t optimize for iphone in landscape because it s always the same in portrait compact w compact h

thin	unicorn
see basically unicorn or thin are all single threaded servers

25957490
thin	unicorn
for a production setup you would generally run many instances of unicorn or thin depending on your load etc you would need to load balance b w those rails application server instances thats why you need nginx or something similar on top

25957890
portrait	landscape
it seems as if the touch control think that ipad is in portrait mode instead of landscape mode

25957919
width	height
i think you would probably be better off with just a plain old tag with width and height specified which will handle the vertical-align automatically if you want vertical-align middle

25957955

i want the image s height to cause the cell to expand the height to the correct value image height + 2 margin

25958391
imageview	universal-image-loader
i have an adapter for a viewpgaer where i cache images with universal-image-loader on a imageview

25958422
post	get
you probably try to send form using post method and you use get for the route

25958431
hide	show
my question how should i load image and during this time show a progress bar to the user and after loading finishes hide the url

25958488
accelerometer	gyroscope
though some people have rigged accelerometer and gyroscope simulators that can augment the simulator it took a long time for this to be created and there is no such equivalent for cmaltimeter

25958518
for-loop	arrays
i think i can do it by using a for-loop and an arrays with the letters inside though that way seems a bit uncouth

25958596

25958767
dplyr	tidyr
you could use dplyr with tidyr for multiple position columns

25958841
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
however it also says that it might throw a nullpointerexception if the collection doesn t permit null elements or a classcastexception if the type of the specified element is incompatible with this collection

25958866
width	height
i ve tried to make a kind of hack by creating an empty navbar-right with the appropriate colour height and width but since the site is supposed to be responsive this navbar-right solution only creates additional trouble

25958872
width	height
i ve tried to skip setting up layout manually and use size classes instead but it looks like ipad has regular width and regular height so it is not possible to make changes for certain orientations

25958917
folder	directory
i would like to ask for your help on how i can access and list the files directory available inside a folder located in local directory or within the same server location of my web-app

25958968
put	get
if your client need to get the specific data with the access token you can send as scope param to auth server and then when redirect access toke to redirection url you will get data you put in scope param this is used to store stat of your user before and after authentication

25958985
nsstring	nsobject
in the handler method i try to fetch before after values but compiler complains nsstring is not convertible to nsdictionaryindex nsobject anyobject

25958990
int	double
when you assign an invalid type to double or int you will get undesirable behaviours

25959008
post	get
route for thanks need to use get method and not post because you make redirection to it no form data are sent by user to this route so instead of

25959008
put	get	post	get	post	put
i advise you to look at basic routing - you should really understand verbs and routing and in case you don t care you can always use route any to match all verbs post get put patch and delete - but in my opinion it s better to use correct verb and not all of them

25959056
daemons	launchd
i encounter a strange situation in a launchd managed daemons when i try to sleep in the sigterm handler that is managed with grand central dispatch as described here

25959058
post	get
i am working in cmd to send http get and post requests with curl

25959191
nsstring	nsobject
since change dictionary is nsobject anyobject you might have to type cast it to nsstring bool as you expect the value of that kind

25959192
width	height
topleft is the start coordinates and the width and height values are the size of extract i needed

25959211

i m developing a new app in xcode and the app is in portrait view but the video should be able to be in portrait and landscape view

25959270
portrait	landscape
the problem with this code is if user closes video player while it was watching video in landscape mode the whole app turns to landscape view even though i disabled it in xcode gui after closing video player app is in landscape view if user rotate device to portrait it switches to portrait view and after that it stays in portrait regardless device rotation

25959316

google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
it works well in google-chrome firefox and opera but not internet explorer

25959424
integer	unsigned
in java se 8 and later you can use the int data type to represent an unsigned 32-bit integer which has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2 32 - 1

25959424
integer	unsigned
use the integer class to use int data type as an unsigned integer

25959424
integer	unsigned
static methods like compareunsigned divideunsigned etc have been added to the integer class to support the arithmetic operations for unsigned integers

25959498
dictionary	map
and if i map the item into a dictionary the call also works fine

25959608
exif	xmp
geotags are available in metadata formats such as exif xmp and geotiff

25959609
google-chrome	firefox
i ve been able to do this on the current versions of firefox google-chrome and internet explorer

25959643

i used to be on virgin media and have recently moved and this is not an option now so moved to sky fibre i currently use a well known tv sites rss feed for my nas box to pull the info and automatically download said shows

25959704
implements	extends
we use a contentprovider for all of our db related calls and we want to implements a feed like activity with a listview that has an adapter that extends a cursoradapter

25959726
awt	swing
in general avoid awt for swing which has much greater power and flexibility although it too is showing its age just less so than awt

25959763
folder	dir
if a folder is detected move copy it s file content to the extraction dir and delete the folder afterwards

25959763
folder	dir
that would flatten the dir structure with every iteration on a folder

25959781
filtering	grouping
provided you can get the lines sorted in the right order a simple awk filtering which prints only the first line in a grouping should work

25959785
post	get
as long as encoded is a variable that can be set externally through http get or post for example anyone can execute any code on your server

25959803
strstr	substr
of course in the case of strstr and strstr when no substr is found the function will actually return false and so a type and value check of the return value is not uncommon

25959834
ionic	angular
new to angular and ionic so what is the right way of doing required field validators in this case

25959896
addclass	removeclass
i can use one variable in addclass removeclass

25959900
youtube	vimeo
sonatamediabundle is a main bundle of sonata admin which handles all media providers like youtube vimeo dailymotion files all file types and provides a structure to build custom media provider.the sonatamediabundle is a media library based on a dedicated provider which handles different type of media files videos or images

25959906
client-side	server-side
this means the server-side programming language is java standard or inside the scriplets for jsp pages while the client-side one is javascript

25959906
client-side	server-side
this probably means i need two methods the first one to be used in the server-side servlet and jsp and the second one to be used in the client-side

25959984
mouseup	mousedown
while looking a bit more into this i realized that this behaviour creates a stray mouseup event that is not fired after a mousedown event

25959984
mouseup	mousedown
the fact that a mouseup event is always after a mousedown event is true in all modern browsers

25959984
mouseup	mousedown
so the solution i used was to set a flag that a mousedown event occurs and that the mouseup event will occur the flag should be set to true

25960012
onresume	onpause
in the onpause event of the activity set isthreadpause to true and in the onresume event set isthreadpause to false

25960039
width	height
you can play around with the flags height width etc so that it ll behave as you want it to

25960069
width	height
then the image will be shrinked into the size width x height and then displayed

25960081
swift	objective-c
pps i am using swift to do this but i m sure solutions in objective-c works as well

25960087
for-loop	loops
but exceptions bubble up when they are not catched and when it raises inside the enumerate function in loops the enumerate function didn t catch it and so it bubbles up to the for-loop which takes it to mean that the enumerate iterator is finished

25960132
lodash	underscore.js
you may find online numerous examples of what it is and how it works and there s a pretty damn good chance at least one library you use already in your project implements it jquery lodash underscore.js angularjs ember.js...

25960175
post	get
the name of the function that is repeated every 5 seconds to get new post is postdata

25960196
subtraction	add
this means if add_sub is zero perform an add operation if its one perform a subtraction

25960196
subtract	add
if you want to add binv and c_in are zero if you want to subtract both are one

25960199
spaces	linefeed
but s match any characters that is not spaces spaces newline character return linefeed tab vertical tab ..

25960246
radio-button	checkbox
if you click on a radio-button or checkbox it work s fine

25960319
width	height
i made the width 320 and the height 1000 so that i have enough room for all the text fields

25960347
post	get
is there a better way to extract the form fields without using a post request using req.body or a get request using req.query

25960351
put	get
i m using the xml-maven-plugin to add the new elements to the file you can get additional details in this question and had success in achieving it having the plugin put the trasformed file in target generated-resources xml xslt i guess that s a default destination directory

25960396
udp	tcp
or can the tracking units transmit gprs data to a specific ip address using tcp or udp where the server with a static ip address would be listening

25960433
versioning	upgrade
and everything works ok but we save some other javascript plugins and they we need to upgrade them as well latest releases have some bug fixed and we want to take advantage of them and they also need jquery upgrade as well but when i upgrade to latest jquery versioning

25960561
hide	show
how to hide and show

25960662
folder	directory
one possible solution in your case would be to put the images directory in your application folder and access it using the application.startuppath property something like this

25960680
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve testing this in this in safari and it works fine but when using google-chrome or firefox the bold is way to bold

25960680
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
safari on left google-chrome in center and firefox on right

25960680
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as you can see google-chrome s and firefox s bold text looks fuzzy compared to safari

25960684
hash	salt
however the script won t genereate a hash as you are using an invalid salt value which should result in the following warning

25960749
oncreate	ondestroy
an activity will do all setup of global state in oncreate and release all remaining resources in ondestroy

25960749
oncreate	ondestroy
for example if it has a thread running in the background to download data from the network it may create that thread in oncreate and then stop the thread in ondestroy

25960833
folder	directory
the libraries that you are looking for may be found in the bin directory of the mono installation folder

25960863
superclass	subclassing
middleclass is an example of a parent class by which it means superclass i assume which is also a subclassing

25960863
superclass	subclassing
even superclass isn t really needed here as any class other than java.lang.object is a subclassing - either of java.lang.object or of some potentially indirect subclassing of java.lang.object

25960942
post	get
when the user associated with the post doesn t have the status active i still get the post and null for the user

25960956
stdout	stderr
to capture and display at the same time both stdout and stderr from a child process line by line in a single thread you could use asynchronous i o

25960970
qtcpsocket	qobject
qobject connect no such signal qtcpsocket newconnection tcpsocket in .. soleditorserver server.cpp 45

25960970
qtcpsocket	qobject
qobject connect no such signal qtcpsocket lostconnection tcpsocket in .. soleditorserver server.cpp 46

25960979
width	height
also one ugly b solution b would be to iterate over the whole hashmap sum up width and height of each biome initialize the tilemap with that information and simple copy everything to the right position

25960995
put	get
get rid of the authz file entirely and only put bob in your passwd file

25960997
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
if you re using nsurlconnection you need to switch to modern way of using nsurlsession to support request canceling

25961001
getter	setter
as david said you can implement both a getter and setter in the subclass property override

25961077
matlabpool	parfor
in matlab s parallel computing toolbox the command matlabpool local starts a local pool of matlab workers which are then used transparently to speed up commands like parfor by distributing processing onto the different cpu cores

25961123
division	modulo
how to perform a division and a modulo at the same time

25961220
keydown	keyup
the main idea is to have from the soft key two different events one for the letter submitted for example as with keyup and keydown and one relative to the touch like dispatchtouchevent since when you press for a letter you touch the screen meaning that you should arise a dispatchtouchevent or something similar

25961274
onkeyup	onkeydown
however you can react on their key presses using the onkeydown and onkeyup events

25961278
for-loop	loops
these powers must change inside a while loops and later a for-loop until the product of w x y and z raised to a certain combination of the elements of the powerarray are within 1 relative error to the original 3.14

25961304
int	double
during operations with binary operators arithmetic promotion to highest needed form is done from int to long float or double

25961307
installation	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
if you didn t recently change your repos i guess this sort of thing is still possible via a regular upgrade of your existing media players or the installation of a new media program although your package manager should have warned you if it had to uninstall any libraries

25961377
hide	show
i read here on stackoverflow that i should save the access token string and it s expiry date and check if it s expired ignoring the case it can be expired at any time by facebook - just theoreticaly or if it wasn t inserted yet points that user hasn t logged in and then show hide the button respectively

25961437
put	get
i want to do a rest call to update data i have done a get request to fill up the form and when i click on update button i want to send and put call instead i get the type error

25961490
super	self
if clear super articlesadmin self .save_formset request form formset change then job good

25961536
vbo	vao
i thought the idea was to create a vbo vao per object bind it set the data and repeat that operation for each object

25961536
vbo	vao
note though the order from the first code fragment for the vao vbo order declaration would also work

25961620
setinterval	settimeout
use setinterval instead of settimeout to execute the codes you can even change the delay period dynamically

25961631
vbo	vao
the vao kind of takes ownership of the data that belongs to the vbo currently bound when making those calls

25961652
put	get
that is the out put i get

25961658
matlabpool	parfor
even though matlabpool starts and communicates with background headless workers you can still create figures and plots and print export them as images inside the parfor parallel loop

25961722
setinterval	clearinterval
you just need to save the setinterval identifier so you can call clearinterval on it later on

25961750
tooltip	scrollbar
i was expecting some kind of scrollbar or something to resize the tooltip rectangle with

25961765
maven	pom.xml
if the pom.xml of a dependency has transitive dependencies inside profile section of pom.xml then those dependencies are not resolved by sbt whereas they are resolved by maven

25961784
put	get
also if you re adding jar files it s really best to not put them in the build folder -- that can get erased if you do a clean build

25961828
flyway	liquibase
anyway your choices here are basically play evolutions flyway or liquibase

25961888
width	height
you need to take into account the width and height assigned to your view when determining your circle s center point and radius

25961901
for-loop	arrays
moreover your calculation will complete much faster if it can be expressed through operations on the whole arrays a rather than through operations on pieces of a such as on columns using a python for-loop

25961922
flurry	crashlytics
i have written my own crash handler for my ios app - the reason why i did not use an existing one like flurry or crashlytics is not important

25961922
flurry	crashlytics
to be more precise how do the crash reporting tools such has flurry and crashlytics handle the signal and exit the app because in my case the default signal handler does not fire despite me calling it

25961975
quicksort	heapsort
your heapsort is an excellent sort with a guaranteed upper bound -- but not quite as good as quicksort on average

25961977
getter	setter
model is my getter setter class

25961979
children	parent
you have to create a listener interface create an instance of it in your parent fragment and pass that instance to all your children fragments

25962022
folder	directory
but when user specifies directory where parent folder is missing there is the error

25962027
express	node.js
i have a backbone application running on an express server in node.js

25962075
saas	iaas
not a saas or an iaas

25962146
int	double
when we make a class we use of c++ standard objects like a bool int or double

25962203
post	get
so if you have had this issue please post your complains there to grab google s attention and let s see if we get an official answer this way

25962230
put	get
text is sending into controller there i put breakpoint to see what he get and wverything looks fine

25962234
getter	setter
so i am experimenting with oo oriented controllers the new controlleras and using ec5 style getter setter in my controller

25962261
put	get
if you have full access to source code it may be easier because it allows you to implement get put has inside the xml class for rhino

25962285
free	malloc
this is analogous to how malloc returns new pointers as long as you don t free them at which point the ones you free may be reused

25962328
crossover	mutation
as you know there are some random events in the algorithm like roullete selection crossover mutation etc

25962383
ember.js	backbone.js
client side - ember.js angular backbone.js knockout

25962389
accessor	properties
for example valueforkey and setvalue forkey can be replaced by the equivalent properties accessor methods using dot notation eg.

25962419
hide	show
secondly sounds like all you re looking for is to give hide and show some transition

25962419
fadein	fadeout
you can simply replace them with fadein and fadeout

25962421
width	margin
you have to use css calc rule in order to count 100 width - the margin size

25962459
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
box-sizing border-box is added to prevent the padding from influencing the width of the div

25962479
width	margin
since the element is positioned absolute ly you could set its left right offset properties to 10px instead of specifying an explicit width and margin s on its sides

25962520
qpropertyanimation	qtimer
i used qpropertyanimation instead of a hand-made qtimer handling on the value property

25962531
opera	safari
it works on safari but not on opera

25962548
integer	fractions
without the suffix your expression represents an integer division which produces an integer result and drops the fractions

25962551
portrait	landscape
setting the keyboard height to 400.0 might be fine in portrait mode but it likely will not be appropriate in landscape mode

25962551
portrait	landscape
for example the standard keyboard view size for an iphone 5 is 320 216 in portrait and 568 162 in landscape

25962551
portrait	landscape
setting a constant height changes keyboard view size to 320 400 in portrait and 568 400 which is effectively the entire screen in landscape

25962612
google-chrome	safari
oh i ve testing this on safari and google-chrome and issue is pretty similar

25962624
int	chars
the x format specifier takes an unsigned int argument so in the arm case is the conversion is straightforward - chars is unsigned so just gets zero-extended to unsigned int

25962624
int	chars
sign-extend the chars to a signed int then cast it to unsigned int

25962624
int	chars
first cast to unsigned chars then zero-extend to unisgned int

25962624
unsigned	short
in short if you re dealing with char-sized values rather than characters always specify signed char or unsigned char as appropriate never bare char

25962640
google-chrome	firefox
next download firefox and download the firebug extension or you can use google-chrome s console alternatively

25962682
post	get
i m using php post to get their score and add it to mysql

25962710
next	except
i have try except blocks inside the function that attempts to download the files but if an exception occurred inside the function how do i properly handle it in the main so i can make decisions whether to proceed to the next date or not

25962743
post	put
i would like to know how can i post new data to this custom data slot when they log out and retrieve it when they log in.i m new to using node and i don t know where to put my code or how to access the user account info when they have logged in

25962948
implements	extends
hashset implements interface set extends interface collection which extends interface iterable

25962960

25963089
int	double
also it doesn t look like you need to use floating point numbers for this job so i ve changed all the double variables to int

25963143
integer	unsigned
typical cpus might have instructions to add two 32-bit signed integers or two 32-bit unsigned integers or two 64-bit signed or unsigned integers but none that will directly add for example a 32-bit signed integer and a 64-bit unsigned integer

25963143
int	double
these rules tell you for example what happens when you try to add an int to a double the int operand is promoted by conversion to type double and the addition adds the resulting two double operands

25963149
post	get
the reason why i get that error is because the variable post is an array

25963169
post	get
try to get post value with this code

25963184
swift	objective-c
since it looks like you re learning objective-c note that this is different from swift which does allow methods to return multiple values

when save is called a post is made to my application server instead of a put

25963244

maven	pom.xml
i m using the following versions maven pom.xml

25963272

int	chars
the value is returned as an int value that can be implicitly casted to chars

25963287
textview	imageview
first in single_list_item_view.xml you ll need to use an imageview instead of a textview since you want to show an image

25963287
textview	imageview
second you ll need to change the line that looks up the textview to find your new imageview instead

25963315

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
that has been the expected behavior of viewwillappear and viewdidappear ever since their introduction

25963416
portrait	landscape
now with ios8 it seems as if the touch window is rotating itself so that touches in landscape are limited to one side of the screen as if the display window is landscape but the touches are all within a portrait window that is set to on one side of the screen

25963416
portrait	landscape
if i turn the device to portrait the view controller does not auto rotate it all works but in landscape it switches to this strange behaviour

25963423
rss	feed
but now i decided that i want to have that list under a tab representing a specific category of an rss feed ie breaking news educational new and so on

25963427
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox 31 and google-chrome 37

25963514
width	height
the weird thing is that as you reduce the width of the window at a certain point the height of the picture starts reducing when it shouldn t and then it bounces into a different position

25963529
width	height
there are two sets of width and height used in a view api here

25963529

what i would want to have is a flag checkbox or something like hide menu button internally externally - logged in user etc... which i can check what would cause the link to disappear

25963559
folder	directory
the first problem that i m trying to solve is that the css folder css is in the same directory with index.php isn t used so the site isn t shown correctly

25963579
google-chrome	firefox
all of these google-chrome and resource urls should work from within firefox

25963603
minimum	max
here i have an algorithm that adds a number to another number e.g current + step and if that number is greater than the max value the remainder of the step is added to the minimum

25963631
folder	directory
if the css folder you want to use is in the same directory as the index file then you can reference it relatively

25963638
strcpy	malloc
you have two choices either change the structure s definition of name to have a fixed size like or use a malloc to allocate space in your add function and then strcpy

25963640
google-chrome	safari
all calendars display fine on my iphone safari but the problem above occurs on safari on my laptop as well as ie and google-chrome on my desktop

25963664

25963759
queue	fifo
it is just generally used as a queue fifo structure

25963808
post	get
the ajax script will send the data by post not by get

25963808
post	get
get is to get the value post is to pass the value

25963808
post	get
you also only use the send value for post so change the get to post in the ajax

25963817
pull	push
yes you simply can reset your branch to the previous commit and force push the pull request will be automatically updated

25963919
profiling	debugging
for simple debugging i ve created a file settings.properties in the root of my project and specified in it hoping to also trigger the deploy profiling

25963919

so while debugging i discovered that environment.getactiveprofiles will only return 1 item even if there s multiple active profiling dev deploy in this case

25964020
width	height
i keep getting the -wreorder error saying willl be initialized after but it s very strange because i have two variables int width height

25964020
width	height
then in the initialization list i do width col_width height col_height and i get a warning saying

25964020
width	height
int width height

25964020
width	height
int width height

25964102

when password_hash is used it generates a random salt and includes it in the outputted hash along with the the cost and algorithm used. password_verify then reads that hash and determines the salt and encryption method used and verifies it against the provided plaintext password

25964107
internationalization	localization
if you add languages to your project and use the means apple provides for internationalization and localization the switch is automatic

if you use display inline-block the div will take up the specified width and height and the background image will be visible and the hover effect will work as you expect

25964130
portrait	landscape
you set the orientation in the plist as deepak described and then you set your portrait launch screen to the rotated version of your landscape launch screen

25964135
put	get
i get results and want them to be put into a more usable form

25964143

25964167
put	get
attempting to put the directx june 2010 sdk in the include path to get a version of xaudio2 that will work results in macro conflicts between dxgitype.h and winerror.h

25964204
getter	setter
i am very interested in es5 getter and setter for use as angular.js controllers

25964206
int	double
which is even weirder because the swift library file has got a lot of initializers for double from int or float types

25964251
width	height
i am trying to setbackground of my app from a file source with calculated width and height and then rotating it if it needs to with this code

25964383
put	get
just put a null check before you try to get the value out of the datepicker

25964389
textarea	textbox
i think if you use a asp textbox and set its multiline property to true it will render as a textarea in html and then you can get and set the text of the control as with a normal asp textbox

25964406
free	malloc
also you don t need to derefence the malloc d pointer before returning it back because the function caller won t probably be able to deduce that he needs to free it afterwards to prevent a memory leak unless he uses a tool like valgrind

25964406
int	chars
the reason i did this is because if fscanf doesn t find the formatted text to store in the variables it simply stores 0 as a float an int a chars or even a string

25964416
mouseout	mouseleave
soution the solution was to use mouseleave instead of mouseout

25964418
sorting	filtering	children	parent
i also tried to extract the sorting to an array proxy using help from here ember.js sorting and filtering children of a hasmany relationship in parent route

25964526
maven	pom.xml
i m using maven with eclipse - my pom.xml contains the dependencies

25964554

25964619
sudo	passwd
the above passwd is the same passwd i enter when using sudo commands

25964627
swift	objective-c
that view s superview no superview the other so questions with this error message are using nibs for the most part and i m tring to avoid that or use objective-c instead of swift

25964643
free	malloc
if you want to pass the value of i at the time of the pthread_create i suggest malloc a small piece of memory copy i to it and pass the malloced thing to the thread which can read it and the free the memory

25964680
next	except
is there a way around this except having to add a custom parameter to the socket.io request with cluster_id value so that the load balancer could pick it up which is not a good idea - load balancers tend to convert the parameter into a number and use that to select the server from the list of available ones hence when i add one more server to the cluster most clients will be sent to the wrong server on their next request

25964695
portrait	landscape
although it seems to be working fine following the gps location the map is not centered on user location but it moves so the location dot sticks to middle right for portrait mode and bottom center in landscape

25964721
multiplying	subtract
i m talking about multiplying divison adding and subtract

25964742
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

if you don t have the mysql root password and you are on a debian based system which ubuntu is you can use the debian-sys-maint account and the password you find in etc mysql debian.cnf

25964758
hash	salt
use randomly assigned salt for each separate hash that you generate

25964780
filtering	grouping
as for the second question the simplest way would be to select your header row then go to the data ribbon and click filtering . the when you want to see your legendaries grouping together simply click the drop-down arrow on column e s header and click sort largest to smallest . this way you can also sort by the other columns if you want name id whatever

25964781
versioning	upgrade
it s better than modify css file where turns dificult to upgrade to newer versioning

25964790
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
mysite.com style.css and see if the file is old or new from experience this will also recache the file in google-chrome and safari - sometimes not in firefox and not sure about ie

25964803
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
use mouseleave instead of mouseout because mouseout will trigger for sub-elements too and should be used with mouseover instead of mouseenter

25964860
integer	unsigned
c s operator already performs a logical right shift on an unsigned integer

25964899
min	max
but in my statistics and on other places i want to have min and max values as well as averages for every type

25964905
google-chrome	firefox
as i said this problem only occurs so far only in firefox and seems ok in google-chrome and ie11

25964963
comparator	comparable
if it implements comparable you can use its comparator method given an expression of the appropriate type

25965059
nsgradient	nsbezierpath
to do that use nsgradient and nsbezierpath for drawing

25965065
int	chars
this works because is a chars and so is 0 and subtracting chars gives you an int in c#

25965065
int	chars
well strictly speaking it s not that subtracting chars s gives you an int

25965065
int	chars
subtraction is not defined for chars but chars are implicitly convertible to int so that s what happens two implicit conversions into int and those can obviously be subtracted from each other to give another int

25965072
post	get
if you want to post on your visitors account you ll have to create some extra code to redirect them to twitter for login and get the access token

25965090

the code is suppose to make a sound either yes or yes 3 play when clicked but i get an error before i begin to debug that says rand cannot be statically allocated but i can t put a there because it s an integer

25965097
comparator	comparable
to further add a class that implements comparable only has the comparator method which returns a negative number zero or a positive number for less than equals to or greater than respectively

25965120
google-chrome	firefox
i need to print onto specific avery labels at exact dimensions and although i can get it to work with google-chrome despite it ignoring some print css styles - it doesn t work in firefox

25965130
comparator	comparable
as shown above you can use a cast to treat obj as a comparable and then you can use the comparator method

25965133
int	double
d corresponds to an int not a double use f instead

25965152
put	get
2 put my profit formula in the report footer section use those summaries in the formula to get my totals

if we get it fixed then i ll update this post with a link to the revived wrapper code

25965332

in the end i ll have threads listening on the stdout and stderr but for now i m trying to troubleshoot the basics

25965368
converter	multibinding
after i used a multibinding instead of a binding passing acualwidth property which actually is not used by the converter

25965388
post	get
since it s ajax you need to check what additional data headers or cookies are being sent when done via browser and whether it s get or post to retrieve subsequent pages.

25965388
google-chrome	firefox
check which one is happening in your browser using the dev tools -- network in firefox or google-chrome

25965433

background-image	background-color
i want the nested to have background-color but it keeps displaying the background-image of its parent

25966081
spaces	delimiter
the data has a couple delimiter colon and spaces

25966089
post	get
seems like i cant post an image i need to get at least 10 rep uploading fail

25966123

in a nutshell it is because in the case of the for-loop the variable p is local to loops itself so at the end of each iteration p and any other variables local only to loops s scope is deallocated

25966126
int	double
anyways i m currently working on an assignment using method overload and i want to be able to get a double or an int from the user

25966126
int	double
i need some way of the code checking getting the input and then checking whether it is an int or double before declaring the variable type...or if there is some better method please share.

25966160

i have not yet tested it but you should be able to recreate the objectinputstream each time on the same fileinputstream and it wil re-read the header

25972267
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
the theory should be that when you create the objectinputstream it will read the header and then read an object advancing the underlying fileinputstream

25972267
fileinputstream	objectinputstream
then when you iterate and create a second objectinputstream it has no knowledge that the underlying fileinputstream was already partially consumed so will re-read the header and read another object

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
please note if you are using google-chrome and now also firefox on ios at least in ios versions 6.1 and newer and you wonder why none of the hacks seem to be separating google-chrome from safari it is because the ios version of google-chrome is using the safari engine

25975282
google-chrome	safari
it uses safari hacks not the google-chrome ones

25975282
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox for ios was released in fall 2015 and it also responds to the safari hacks but none of the firefox ones same as ios google-chrome

post	get
otherwise as a security tool post over get serves a similar function to a password mask on password inputs prevent someone from looking at your data over your shoulder

25975906
post	get
i would say that just like with synchronous http requests you should use get when the user or your application need to get data and post when your app of the user needs to post data for persistence - in the session like a login or a database etc

25983530
post	get
according to all post i read so far how to manage a redirect request after a jquery ajax call and many similar ones you can t simply catch the 301 redirect because browsers usually fetch the content and give the endpoint to the user which is why you get the 200 status code instead of the 302

gcloud	gcutil
bdutil still uses gcutil ssh instead of gcloud compute ssh but work is in-progress to upgrade to using gcloud compute ssh so even if you can configure your local environment to make gcloud compute ssh work bdutil still requires gcutil ssh to work in order to deploy hadoop clusters - note that in most circumstances these two different commands function the same

25984315
xslt	xquery
the w3c test suites for xslt and xquery which are publicly available have moved away from comparing equality of xml results because that s so inflexible and for the reasons you describe

25984459
int	double
also since average is floating point number not int it should be declared as double

25984834
realloc	malloc
here are two functions to malloc a two dimensional array and to realloc a two dimensional array

25984834
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
what i have tried to do is to use a single malloc and realloc for all of the memory needed so that you can free the memory with a single call to free

25984834
realloc	malloc
you could also just use the realloc version if you provide a null pointer since realloc will do a malloc if the pointer to the memory to realloc is null

25984836
int	double
i want to be able to round up any double value to the closest higher int even if the value itself is already an int value

25984843

cpu	irq
there is a single handler for each type of exception so when irq is asserted the cpu just jumps to the irq address 0x18

25986309
cpu	irq
this is where the external interrupt vectoring comes into play - because the interrupt controller already has all the details the cpu doesn t need a top-level irq handler to work out which interrupt this irq is for and what to do it just needs to load whatever address is showing in aic_ivr jump to it and it ll be in the correct interrupt-specific handler

25986309
cpu	irq
this means the irq handler can be reduced to the magic instruction - the magic being that the aic_avr address 0xfffff100 is close enough to the cpu s exception vector for a pc-relative load thanks to the address wraparound thus an ldr targetting the pc can perform both the address load and the branch from the single exception vector instruction itself minimising latency

with a service you can go so far as to use getter setter and you could even wire the state transition call into the setter

25999861
width	height
the problem is that the frame for my custom node is origin x 0 y 0 size width 0 height 0 while the regular node s frame is like expected origin x -43 y -1 size width 86 height 25

25999883

the order of the children is not important but they should follow right after the parent and the ischild column would be used to indicate whether the row is a child and to what it is a child

25999888
pop-up	dialog
i believe xcode will pop-up a helpful dialog if you need to do something xcode can t do automatically

box-sizing	border-box
i also tried putting the video in an extra div container and applying the box-sizing border-box attribute to the container still no border visible

26000037
hide	show
actually in many cases this is exactly what you want or rather you want their presence and to control their visibility. in addition to a visibility property on the viewmodel and some js helper methods or class to show hide your views via the viewmodel references typically associated with a particular url as well.

26000037
hide	show
these would handle integrating with history api for routing deep-linking and knockout to show hide dom elements via the isvisible binding

26000039
put	get
turns out if you put your model in temp data you can retrieve it in the get action and then re-validate it

26000058
public	protected
the base class member c is doing what i want but is not static const as desired i ve made c a protected member so that it cannot be modified but if i can declare it const then it can be public

i have set the framesize of the uiscrollview to be width 320 height 300 in the storyboard

26000139
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
you ll find it with google-chrome firefox and opera

26000158

you are comparing the value of the text box as a boolean and then assigning the value of your text box to a variable of type int

26000165
width	height
you re using the width and height in a time range by accident

26000189

i tried to convert a simple multiplying function with two input arguments like c mul a b but still the converted function has this extra argument inside the function in addition to a and b

26000511
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the firefox profiler but it s not nearly as helpfull as what google-chrome has

26000519
getter	setter
then make getter and setter for it

26000529
sorting	filtering
if you re actually loading more than 1000 records to the client you should probably be using sever-side sorting and filtering

26000572

play with the width and height of the vid-border box to overlay the video

26000694
min	max
first write a function that compute the min mean-1sem mean mean+1sem and max

26000696
for-loop	loops
you already have a for-loop iterating through every row of your data so you could add a condition to stop loops when it gets to a value that you don t want

26000822
folder	directory
you have to delete parse.framework from framework list and from the project directory when removed from both places copy again and check copy items to destination s group folder

26000823
for-loop	arrays
i am rather sure that the conversion from integer to string to int arrays was functional due to eclipse debugging but am stumped as to why i am getting an arrayoutofbounds message from eclipse for such a simple for-loop

26000825
post	put
use post instead of put and the op_type will automatically be set to create

26000827

26001157
client-side	server-side
first validation happens both client-side and server-side

26001166
slider	supersized
another thing secondary i m searching in the slider is that the url of images need to be in the html and not as supersized have in the .js more seo-friendly

26001180
vmware	virtualbox
and may be not in vmware but in virtualbox using

26001206
backgrounding	multitasking
however some limited multitasking is possible the documentation says you can set up a backgrounding url upload or download task in an extension

26001262
wildfly	glassfish	wildfly	jboss	jboss	glassfish
if you read carefully antonio s book you ll see that on page xxxiv in section download and running the code it is stated that you need to deploy your code on glassfish 4 one of the open source java ee 7 server the other being jboss wildfly

26001263
keydown	keyup
note that cmd+a or any other combination is not really both together - it s a keydown event for both before there is a keyup for either

26001265
portrait	landscape
the app can manage only the portrait orientation but the view controller that hosts the player on the new window only landscape

26001296
pop-up	dialog
however the pop-up dialog is not showing at least i think it is a pop-up dialog window

26001313
portrait	landscape
i tried it in landscape mode with all kinds of devices iphone4s 5 6 6+ and in pure portrait mode but it also doesnt work

26001338
width	height
if the width height of the trapezoid shape should be changed dynamically you could achieve the effect by using css transform s as follows

26001375
next	except
the logic works welll except if you try to type the text really fast then first edit is populated correctly and cursor is moved to next edit but the next char that is typed is lost

put another way what would be a good way to get all records where the management_chain contains the id queried for at a position that is second to last given that the last item represent the user s own id

26001503
clang	llvm
apple clang 5.0.0 is based on llvm clang 3.3svn

26001503
clang	llvm
i can t find any version of llvm clang which selects the member function

26001545
rss	feed
article is wrong - this doesn t make sense to be in a rss feed for instance

26001554
dhtmlx	daypilot
we looked at daypilot lite s dhtmlx s javascript version 4.1 open source versions

26001554
dhtmlx	daypilot
javascript was the only free version offered by dhtmlx while daypilot offers the lite open source version for webforms and mvc

26001577
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
then outside the while loops write a for-loop to calculate the averge of the elements in the arrays which are the averages of each student

26001601
google-chrome	firefox
but when you want to run firefox you need to google-chrome path disable otherwise browser will launch but application may not. try both way

26001602
typedef	struct
also have a look at this post on struct in c++ which might simplify your struct definition by getting rid of the typedef

26001697
folder	directory
if you have a number of sub-folders and files within the share directory and you want the permissions to apply from the parent object the containing folder to the child objects the sub-folders and files you must use the -r recursive switch so the same permissions are applied all the way to the deepest folder contained within the parent

26001725
printf	strtol
as for sending an int you can use printf to format it as a string to send over the wireless link and strtol to convert it back to an int on the pc end

26001765
width	margin
absolute position is applied to the static aside element section has appropriate right margin 50 width is added for both article elements

26001799
instances	transient
how can i setup structuremap to inject a different transient instances of irepository into the dependency chain for controller1 and for controller2

26001800
imperative	declarative
you could perhaps think of java as having a declarative part at the top level that switches to imperative statements once you go deeper and then likely an expression as you go even further

26001847
setinterval	settimeout
i ve also tried using setinterval and settimeout to run the function once every 86400000 milliseconds 1 day

26001892
scipy	scikit-learn

26001907
hash	salt
i ve tried the method where i hash some pass with md5cryptoservice and then concat a salt string with 32 characters but without success

26001931
width	height
when i tried this i also added width and height constraints to toview to size it relative to containerview

26001945
backgrounding	multitasking
ensure to set in applicationwillresignactive since this call will occur both when sending app to backgrounding and when invoking the multitasking screen

26001950
width	height
also height and width constraints will behave the same as long as you addconstraint to the same view you constraintwithitem

26001950
width	height
so if you can change your constraints for a view that uses cgaffinetransformmakerotation to only use height width centerx centery then you should be able to have the same constraints appear the same when building on both ios versions

26001999
width	height
tested using 3-second video h.263 sorenson of 1280 width by 720 height with 44100hz 128 mp3 sound and there was no ..experiencing sluggish behaviour on my side with a crappy testing machine

26002033
swift	objective-c
update if youâ re using objective-c my original answer below still applies but if youâ re using swift this can very easily be performed more cleanly thanks to swiftâ s filter function for collection types

26002033
swift	objective-c
in objective-c something similar can be done with nsarrayâ s various predicate-based and enumeration methods but theyâ ll be a little more long-winded than their swift counterpart

26002070
jruby	rubinius
for that you may want to try jruby or some other implementation like rubinius that allows parallel threads

26002162
getter	setter
the modern approach is to use arc drop the synthesize and always refer to your properties with the synthesized setter and getter like this

26002192
post	get
i was trying to look up how to get just the ids of comments an associated model to post

26002223
outputstream	inputstream
you may try using the ioutils.copy inputstream input outputstream output

26002268
maven	pom.xml
in other words it does not seem possible at this time to use additional maven repos specified in the pom.xml file of a project built on travis

26002300
rpm	yum
i can just execute yum or rpm from the recipe but this is not elegant and not portable also

26002308
waitpid	fork
btw your program could generate some c code then fork + execve + waitpid the gcc compiler or make then perhaps even dlopen 3 the result of the compilation you ll need gcc -fpic -shared -o foo.c -o foo.so to compile a dlopen able shared object...

26002324
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s working fine in google-chrome safari and firefox

26002347
stdout	stderr
try print questions to stderr or any other file-descriptor but stdout

if i execute this outside of the loop and manually put in the 2456146.72784 then i get all the data i want

26002358
ceylon	kotlin
the code generator should indeed generate just java or if you like scala ceylon kotlin clojure .

26002374
maven	pom.xml
add resource_path property to the maven pom.xml and tell maven to compile properties found in resource files

26002392
accessor	properties
the get prefix comes from the javabeans conventions which states that if you have an accessor for a properties then the accessor method s name must start with get unless it is a boolean the primative type in which case is should start with is

26002395
portrait	landscape
when the screen orientation changed between reverse landscape and reverse portrait the oncreate method of activity would always be called

pop-up	dialog
so while your windows service can pop-up a confirmation dialog box the user will never see it because it displays in the session 0 desktop

26002428
firefox	safari
pause before the loop repeats -- only in firefox and safari

26002428
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and opera both play the loop without noticeable pause

26002476
children	parent
since children inherit most of their parent s styles by default you can focus on clearing the child s styles rather than setting them equal to the parent s

26002476
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome and opera you can do so with one line of code

26002501
post	get
get and post working fine without date time object.but when data returned from web api has date then i am getting below error

26002643
rcurl	httr
httr uses rcurl for the heavy lifting

26002643

prepare	execute
but before sql server can execute the statement sql server first has to prepare the statement and as part of that to figure out whether the referenced table or view exists if the user has privileges on it what indexes are available an so on in order to come up with an execution plan

26002692
prepare	execute
once the execution plan for the statement is prepare then the statement can actually be execute

26002747
implements	extends
anonymous inner classes in java are usually used to implements interfaces and extends abstract classes easily - where you d usually use a lambda expression in c#

in details that support wincache memcached files x-cache apc cache and say

26002871
put	get
i can put values and get them

26002949
trie	tree
so you idea of adding all suffices of all strings to a trie is actually correct but is inefficient compared to a solution with a suffix tree

26002958
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works on firefox google-chrome but not with safari with safari if you do ctrl+plus on this page the alert hello is launched but the browser s zooming is also changed

26002989
clang	llvm
maybe many of you are more interested in gcc than in llvm and clang

26002989
clang	llvm
after i tried to compile llvm and clang for arm i ran another gdb session

26002989
clang	llvm
as i made this hurdle it was pretty easy to build llvm and clang

26002993
pop-up	dialog
but i do use setstatusbarorientation to make sure any dialog keyboards etc that pop-up line up with everything else

26002995

put	get
this is only reproducable after sending the put i can make as many get requests as i please

26003070
google-chrome	firefox
as yizeng pointed out the problem is because selenium 2.42.2 only supports up to firefox 31 and google-chrome 36

26003086
portrait	landscape
launching an app whose root view controller only supports portrait-orientation but which otherwise supports landscape orientations on an iphone 6 plus while the home screen is in a landscape orientation results in a limbo state where the app s window is in a landscape orientation but the device is in a portrait orientation

26003086
portrait	landscape
i can t think of any other way to enforce a portrait orientation except to disable landscape altogether which i can t do our web browser modal view controllers need landscape

26003161
children	parent
define a parent directive that has the two children button and your current template

26003161
children	parent
this way the scope inside the parent is accessible to both children and they can communicate via the parent

26003166
children	parent
this will iterate through all the children of the parent in reverse order and apply the animation

26003180

repo	egit
the catch it all needs to be done in egit so it makes sense to my e-brain and all the repo are local

the order of the items in a ttreeview depends on the order of the items in the parent children list

26003348
addclass	removeclass

26003354
versioning	upgrade
as moonstom says doesn t work properly on an upgrade windows 8.1 it returns a windows 8 versioning link

26003357
put	get
what i would do is put all of those numbers in an array you can use the rest api to get the list of all of your twilio phone numbers and then in your message sending loop just use a counter to keep track of your place in that array

26003363
client-side	server-side
first it looks liek you have a server-side button that calls client-side code

26003420
getter	setter

folder	directory
i tried having teamcity checkout to the same directory but since each solution is in its own build config team city throws an error about two different configurations sharing the same folder

26003524
do.call	lapply
i would guess that the rbind.na in your do.call is reading a blank element generated from lapply on the extra 44k files and sticking in all those na s

26003534
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i think i might have had the same problem terminated due to memory pressure and i just changed the setup of the avcapturesession from the viewdidappear to viewdidload

after a lot of testing i get the impression that images are always stored in landscape format even if shot in portrait mode

26003697
client-side	server-side
no but i don t get why you want to do this you seem to consider the wrong charset server-side instead client-side

26003735
int	boolean
liquibase will attempt to convert standard types like varchar int boolean datetime to the correct datatype for the database

26003745
children	parent
only this element can be used with the this reference. for rest elements like parent children you need to use ids or any other selector

26003765
put	get
also i get to assume that any string entered will not contain uppercase letters and no numbers and that any string will contain less than 61 of any type of character so i get to assume no one will put in 64 continues a s in my program

26003926
put	get
sadly they all required me to put extra markup into my html to get things to work

26003928
integer	unsigned
c89 rules for decimal integer constant are different -2147483648 is of type unsigned long in c89

26003928
integer	unsigned
indeed in c89 it is different in c99 see above a unsuffixed decimal integer constant is of type int long or unsigned long

26003933
strcpy	strcmp
i canâ t see problems with strcmp strcpy but

26003996
subtract	add
if you wish to add a margin i d suggest you add a variable margin for instance 2 or 3 and then you subtract that quantity from the left column the right column or both

26003996
width	margin
and then you set the width of the #wrapp to be 100-2 x where x is the amount of margin you added

you risk filename collisions by putting your files directly in the static folder vs adding one more directory and putting them in there

26026191
umask	chdir
all the shells have umask as a built in command for the same reason that all shells have chdir as a built-in. remember that the umask setting is bits to take away so 027 means take away group write

move	drag
you click drag and then release not just move your mouse over the view

26026313
mousemove	mousedown
this behavior is particularly annoying because the page i m working on does things on both mousedown and mousemove so its fairly easy for the user to be in the middle of this operation and slip off the page and screw up what they were doing

26026341
sorting	grouping
i think this is much more optimal and efficient way of doing it sorting next grouping

26026346
children	parent
all its children are also custom views which would actually get the scale factor from their parent via a getter method and scale accordingly by setting the scaled dimensions like

26026346
children	parent
the children s onmeasure onlayout are never called even though the parent goes through its measure layout cycle

26026346
children	parent
but if i directly call requestlayout on one of the children just that child gets scaled according to the scale factor set in the parent

26026426
for-loop	arrays
you don t have to create a for-loop in your map map will call the function callback on each element of the arrays you pass as parameter

26026447
int	double
if these are int then use int otherwise you could use float or double depending on what you are passing

26026557

first of all what you can do to make your program more efficient is build a of hex characters to binary strings

26026923
for-loop	arrays
now for your program you can just use these methods you don t need and arrays or the for-loop

26026934
width	height
also initialize video recorder like this sending width as height and vice versa

26027016
mutators	setter
one problem with your code is that your setname method is a setter method or mutators method and as such it should set the state of a property or field of your class

26027089
int	chars
furthermore because c doesn t really do any strong type checking passing the value of int as the value of a chars pointer still works correctly

26027113
profiling	instrumentation
profiling my ios 8 app in xcode 6 instrumentation will run the app for about 5 seconds and then freeze

also initialize your videorecorder object as following giving width as height and vice versa

26027192
width	height
i need to force a constraint for width on this based on the screen size and let auto layout figure out the height from there

26027202

26027410
scrypt	pbkdf2	pbkdf2	hash
better hashing algorithms like bcrypt pbkdf2 or scrypt can be configured to take much longer to compute and an average computer might only be able to compute 10-20 hash a second

26027487
put	get
if i just switch the fromtimestamp to utcfromtimestamp it will use a naive value - the results then get put in the correct time zone but it gives the same results as the first section - showing the two invalid times

26027553
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox there is a choice in settings that in firefox defaults to always saving the files to the downloads folder

26027555

the vector wl is then copied into a c++ array of unsigned short by code not shown here

26027715
ftell	fread
best to check results of fread ftell and sscanf for unexpected return values and act accordingly

26027767
ant	maven
it should work if your ant project includes the maven local repository jar as dependency

26027787
hide	show
i am using a script for a gallery in which clicking on an element in the navigation show only one div but hide the others

for-loop	loops
i need to retrieve the list of variables from an ienumerable as well as iterate to each record and get the value either with a for-each loops or a for-loop

26027840
width	height
those i ve used are max width and max height which will shrink the included image or page from a pdf if the width or height exceeds these maxima while still maintaining the included image page aspect ratio

26027902
getter	setter
the alternative i d consider on is keeping the embeddable struct interface setup but defining the interface in terms of getter and setter

26027902
getter	setter
hiding properties behind getter and setter gives you some extra flexibility to make backwards-compatible changes later

26027902
getter	setter
so with getter setter you can change struct fields while maintaining a compatible api and add logic around property get sets since no one can just do without going through your code

26027903
x86	mips
not certain yet which of the other three armeabi-v7a mips or x86 was the required one but i do know that all three were automatically generated when i added the application.mk file to the same folder as the android.mk file and made sure it had the following line in it

i removed the return false in the jquery .click and have tried a standard php echo inside the php if statement that checks if the post isset and i couldn t get it to print to the browser

26028042
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you should move your test and method invocation to viewwillappear - often things aren t fully initialised in viewdidload

26028107
charindex	substr
also you didn t specify what database you re using and i just tried it on ms sql but it should be easy to adapt to other databases as it only relies on charindex and left or substr and those functions should be available on most databases

26028108
children	parent
for example let s say i want to insert the following data into a parent and children records

26028108
children	parent
the parent record would contain acme and the children records would have the details of tnt 100 and anvil 5

26028109

min	max
my log files are generated once a day and i am interested in looking at every event and not just aggregates mean min max or total

26028168

26028257
pop-up	dialog
a pop-up dialog is not a place - users would not expect to see it when they press the back button

26028302
hide	show
just hide all of them with css then override the one you care about to show

26028303
free	malloc
you need malloc don t forget to free

26028303
typedef	struct
when i use struct i also use a typedef as you can see in my example here

26028318
filesystems	ntfs
an ntfs filesystems object containing data that is processed by the filesystems filter when the associated file or directory is accessed generally used for references to data stored elsewhere

26028318

in general you re either foregoing templates entirely defining a different type for each possible instance or picking one probably double maybe an int size for displaying images and sticking with it

26028372
pop-up	dialog
the selection dialog pop-up after the main window is constructed and runs modally

26028372
hide	show
i would like to hide the root window while this dialog is being show but calling withdraw on the root window simply causes the modal dialog to not be show either - python just ends up hanging with no cpu usage and i can t figure out how to get around the problem without having to resort to a non-modal window and a significantly different control flow which i d like to avoid

26028379
int	chars
fyi- from a security point of view string is not a good choice for storing sensitive data either maintain it in a chars array or as it s a number as an int value

26028393

each screen has its own root window and some more associated properties - physical width height dpi etc

26028396

26028824
children	parent
the parent sets up some of the file descriptors for the children and when the children are created they finish manipulating the descriptors to their needs

26028865
sorting	grouping
now grouping by element i did it by hand by sorting to get

26028892
min	max	minimum	max
this code examines an array named x and finds its minimum value min x and its maximum value max x

26028893
range	max
basically it s creating a vector of values p that range from the smallest to the largest values of x which is fine but it s using steps between successive values of max x 300

26028893
min	max
if max x is negative then you would get an error as p would start from min x some negative number below max x and then each element would be smaller than the last

26028893
min	max
using linspace min x max x 300 or setting the step to max x -min x 299 would make more sense to me

26028894
gridview	entitydatasource
if i change to legacy objectcontext the new entity is correctly seen in the code and entitydatasource works fine i can perfectly see the gridview associated

i am aware that hashmap get put operations are o 1

26029183
stdout	stderr
many programs would just use stdout and not care but i would prefer stderr on principle

26029183
stdout	stderr
in short i believe stdout is for the product of successful execution of a program while stderr is for any messages meant for the user

26029183
stdout	stderr
calculated values go to stdout while errors stack traces help version and usage messages are meant for the user and should go to stderr

26029184
ssl	https
to communicate with webservice i added two components tidhttp and tidssliohandlersocketopenssl for ssl https

if you make such tests you must be aware that the function password_hash will generate a unique salt and includes it in the resulting hash

since type argument substitution will swap the bar t source to bar ilist source this method arguments will be a better match than the bar ienumerable source which needs a conversion

same goes for keyup keydown .

26037934
for-loop	loops
using a foreach loops wont work because the controls will not have the correct indexed name attribute for postback and a single for-loop wont allow your grouping unless you include conditional checks test if the parentname and subparentname has changed from the previously rendered item and then render a new group heading or start a new table or whatever

26038000

i am trying to learn graphs in which i found that to find shortest path from one node to other node we can use dijkstra and bellman-ford algorithm

26043924
bellman-ford	dijkstra
my doubt is i tried many kind of graphs which contains negative weight edge and applied dijkstra and bellman-ford both but in all the cases i found the same result i mean no difference for negative weight edge also dijkstra is working fine

26043924
bellman-ford	dijkstra
my question is can any one explain me a graph which have negative edge and explain the different result for dijkstra and bellman-ford

versioning	upgrade
to upgrade from older versioning on windows please use the supplied .zip file for windows from the luarocks website

26044037
superclass	subclassing
a private field of a superclass might be accessible to a subclassing - for example if both classes are members of the same class

26044037
inherited	subclassing
nevertheless a private field is never inherited by a subclassing

26044074
bellman-ford	dijkstra
to see the difference of answers that bellman-ford and dijkstra gives when there is a negative edge weight lets take a simple example

26044105
irix	linux
now i want to find the words array mac nt irix linux apple

26044175
disk	ram
due to the quantity of data coming in the available ram would be quickly exhausted so it needs to overflow onto the hard disk

26044175
disk	ram
if the reader is able to keep up with the data then it should never hit the hard disk as the ram buffer would be sufficient nice but not essential

26044194
bash	tcsh
i need to source a tcsh script from my bash script

26044241
children	parent
whenever a new child class subclasses the parent class or one of its children it probably requires updating the parent class as well

26044260
accessor	properties
the first pair of does build an array literal but all the following are properties accessor in bracket notation

26044279
int	boolean
however i return the error cannot convert from boolean to int

26044280
int	double
the remaining code is working fine as far as the int data type functions are concerned but i can t understand why compiler is giving the error with the double data type functions

26044286
inherited	properties
please note that inspite of the fact that customclass inherited from ndb.model and has simple properties stringproperty integerproperty... it also inherited from other classes and has repeated properties if it changes anything to the answer.

26044322
google-chrome	safari
but it isn t supported in google-chrome safari

26044394
scheme	racket
a racket source in racket language is a module and #lang scheme is not scheme but synonym for #lang racket

26044404
for-loop	loops
you can either do the for-loop like sanghas26 suggested which is the best solution or you can add a check at the beginning of loops to see if i has gone too far

26044446
portrait	landscape
after rotating to landscape and back to portrait i can scroll to a blank fourth page

26044446
uitabbarcontroller	uipageviewcontroller

26044449
min	max
every so often the values in results change to 10 and i need to find the average min and max during before and after each time of the corresponding cells in data

26044458
superclass	subclassing
so far the best way i could handle returning the subclassing type in the superclass is passing the subclassing type as type parameter

26044459
ssl	https
so i came to a conclusion that node.js cannot handle the https ssl connection

26044466
bash	tcsh
tcsh -c source test.tcsh sources the file test.tcsh in the shell running the source command which is an instance of tcsh not the bash shell that runs tcsh

26044466
bash	tcsh
you aren t going to be able to execute a tcsh script in any way that affects the environment of the current bash shell

26044466
bash	tcsh
you could start a new bash shell that inherits from an instance of tcsh which was so modified with something like

26044466
bash	tcsh
will leave you in an interactive bash shell but you won t see ok we re back until after you exit that shell which will cause tcsh to exit and return control to the original

26044467
min	max
however processes are oftentimes reused which is why you should tinker with the min and max process count for the apache config

26044483
swift	objective-c

i was testing a script which works fine on almost all desktop browsers and android s google-chrome browser but when i tested it on android version of firefox mobile browser i m got wrong viewport dimensions

26044721
public	protected
for default constructor it depends on the accessibility of the class if class is declared with public then default constructor will be public if class is declared protected then default constructor will be protected

26044768
for-loop	loops
it seems your inner for-loop should be building an string that is returned after the loops have finished

26044813
for-loop	arrays
i don t understand why though since the for-loop should continue until it gets to the end of the arrays

26044829
stdout	stderr
this swallows all your stdout stderr and redirects to your underlying logging system.

26044891
versioning	upgrade
the patched versioning of bash is already in the ports tree you can therefore upgrade it like any application

26044898
width	margin
then we make the ul create the next 2 columns but first you need to reset the ul by removing margin and padding and then float the li and give them a width of 50

26044979
versioning	upgrade
i think you should upgrade or tell your clients to upgrade to a newer - and supported - versioning

26045002
width	height
firefox stretches images when the width of the container is larger than the image s width for the given height

26045002
google-chrome	firefox
the result is not acceptable because the image-wrapper div with green olivedrab borders is not right around the image on firefox same in google-chrome when resizing the window vertically

26045039
ubuntu	centos
i have written an upstart task that i am trying to start on my centos 6 and ubuntu boxes

26045046
ienumerable	iqueryable
i am using unit of work and repository pattern and looking to return iqueryable but reading up on the subject it looks like it is not recommended to return iqueryable but instead returning ienumerable is recommended

26045048
uitextfield	uitoolbar
so the â œfooterâ is a uiview or uitoolbar with a uitextfield uitextview and a uibutton

26045048
hide	show
especially now in ios 8 the keyboard comes with a suggestions tool bar that a user may choose to show or hide

26045048
move	drag	hide	show
a second issue is when user drag the suggestion toolbar to either show or hide it while typing it causes my â œfooterâ to move in unpredictable manners which means i will need some static variables to meticulously track cumulative interactions with the suggestion toolbar just to fix that bug

26045048
children	parent
a third approach was to make the parent view a tpkeyboardavoidingscrollview such that i would have parent and children uitableview and â œfooterâ

gulp-if	gulp-filter
what started off with gulp-if has turned into me using gulp-filter which i prefer honestly

26045396
testflight	itunesconnect
i guess since apple has integrated testflight into itunesconnect there is a difference between version and build which is the wording they use in project-settings- target- generalscreen and in info.plist its equivalent is bundle version string short and bundle version

26045418
int	double
in other contexts this is also why small int and low precision floats would be converted to large int or double precision floats when operating on mixed types that the latter types

26045418
int	double
a small int can be represented as a big int or a double but the other direction is not generally a safe conversion

26045477
superclass	subclassing
this situation is called superclass reference for subclassing object in object oriented programming terminology

26045521

hlsl	glsl
here is how i translated glsl to hlsl

26045527

even if your custom domain does not have an ssl certificate your appid.appspot.com does try accessing your project via https and you ll see

26046007
uitableview	uisearchbar
i have a uisearchbar for a uitableview and my implementation is as follows

apache	nginx
if you want to abort earlier there are methods in your webserver like apache s limitrequestbody or nginx s client_max_body_size

26046079
ssl	https
ssl hence https creates a session that is unique to the user

26046096
hash	md5
you re sql escaping them then doing the md5 hash which means any escapes added to the password will become part of the hash

26046096
hash	md5
if you manually md5 d the original password then you ll never be able to get a match since your escaping is changing the original string before it gets hash which means the hash will always be different than the original un-escaped string s

26046125
children	parent
i hover over the parent children display and we can go

26046182
qtabwidget	qtabbar

for-loop	loops
but this and numerous other attempts in and out of loops including a for-loop within the seluser fail to achieve the desired results

26046578
post	get
i am referring to this stackoverflow post and i can get all of the rows on the second table but i cannot format them

26046580

width	height
in each of your tex2d samples you ll need to divide the first component of off by the texture width and the second by the texture height

26046650
hide	show
my only complaint about utilizing the .trigger method is that if you set up your grid to dynamically hide show columns the indexed feature would potentially sort on unintended columns unless you are only calling it on initialization when hide show capabilities are present

26046660
int	double
byte to short int long float or double

26046660
int	double
short to int long float or double

26046660
int	chars	int	double
chars to int long float or double

26046660
int	double
int to long float or double

26046660
int	double
a widening primitive conversion from int to float or from long to float or from long to double may result in loss of precision - that is the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value

26046660
floating-point	integer
in this case the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value using ieee 754 round-to-nearest mode â 4.2.4

26046704
google-chrome	firefox
however when i scp it to my website it s rotated 90 degrees when viewed in google-chrome but displays correctly in firefox

there is no other trick since 31 is a primes to see what the modulus of a number n is mod 31 you will have to divide and find the remainder

26047260
rsa	aes
to use rsa rather than aes symmetric encryption

26047280
jar	manifest.mf
so it seems if i want to access my web service from a java client i need to use wsimport to create the client jar file which i then later need to manually add a manifest.mf file otherwise the java compiler does not recognize the classes in the generated client jar file - there are numerous posts all over the web about this

26047347
pull	push
however underneath most push solutions there is still a pull mechanism in the background albeit generally a very efficient one that may for example piggy back on other messages between the network and the mobile device and hence have minimal power and data overhead

26047370
int	chars
this is simple for types such as int and chars etc.

getter	setter
also note that if your get and set methods really do nothing special as in your example you might consider making the data public and doing away with getter setter

26047426
division	multiplication
gcc avoids 32-bit division by a constant by replacing it with what is essentially a 64-bit multiplication by the inverse of the constant followed by a right shift

26047426
integer	unsigned
here s a simplified version say we want to compute n 31 for some unsigned 32-bit integer n using the pythonic to indicate truncated integer division

26047426
multiplying	subtract
so we need to multiplying the presumed quotient by 31 and subtract that from n

26047484

int	chars
there is an explanation to this but i cannot figure out why we use int instead of chars and so involving ourself in endianness hell

26048132
exponent	modulo
so there is enough data to calculate the public key modulo and public exponent which is what openssl rsa -in mykey.pem -pubout does

26048166
exponent	modulo
if you want to get the modulo of dividing by a denominator d such that where e is some exponent you can use the fact that the binary expansion of 1 d is a repeating fractions with bits set every e digits

26048177
rsa	aes
note that to encrypt larger amounts of plain text you should be using hybrid encryption both aes and rsa

26048192

junit	testng
then i would start with testng and not junit

26048464
post	get
you can t make a get neither post request with javascript to another domain because of the same origin policy

26048499

26048617
google-chrome	safari
it s also important to point out that this code works fine in safari but doesn t work at all in google-chrome so i know it has something to do with google-chrome i just don t understand what the problem is

26048617
google-chrome	safari
my question is mainly is there a way that safari loads versus google-chrome that would affect running javascript and php on the same page since it works fine in one browser and not the other

26048621
children	parent
the parent rerender the children with new props

26048632
multiplying	add
even in the case of primitive types you might want to enable more complex atomic operations than simply get and set increment or add or multiplying

26048641
subtract	add
to get the bounds you need to take the center lat lon convert it to pixel coordinates add subtract to get the pixel coordinates of the corners that you want and then convert back to lat lon

26048641
width	height	subtract	add
the pixel coordinate system starts from the upper left corner though so to get the ne corner you need to add width 2 from x and subtract height 2 from y

26048641
width	height	subtract	add
for the sw corner you need to subtract width 2 from x and add height 2 to y

26048656
width	height
this is because setcoords sets corner position coordinates based on current angle width and height -- but it does not update width and height based on changes to the text

26048672
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition
i am making a program that takes asks if you want to do addition subtraction multiplication and division

the post method you used sends a post request while your curl command line clearly uses get instead

26049258
put	get
lastly some regional networks put the merchant name in de048 and put the physical address in de043 and so you won t get all of the info in just de043 but have to look at both to get the merchant name

26049260
implements	extends
so you want to wrap calls to an instance without having to extends it or implements each of its methods that s actually possible but only for methods exposed over interfaces

for-loop	loops
finally in your for-loop you want to increment the number that is being displayed to the user for the character location as loops progresses

26049429

the python hash is very good but you might like to experiment with using another hashing function to randomize your tokens before applying hash eg one of the family of sha functions or md5 which can be found in hashlib

26049459
stdout	stderr
i did check the var log cron file and saw that the script runs but that absolutely nothing from stdout or stderr prints anywhere

if you put this into jsfiddle on google-chrome you see that it works in google-chrome and ie and firefox but a bit differently but there seems to be a small caveat

26049747
google-chrome	firefox
i test it on jsfiddle in google-chrome and in firefox and in ie

26049747
google-chrome	firefox
if someone can figure out and write about the issues with google-chrome and firefox that would be great

26049747
google-chrome	firefox
it would be nice to have double click or any number of fast clicks not to work in google-chrome and firefox too

26049752
lodash	underscore.js
i guess i could use either that or lodash underscore.js i prefer ramda though

26049758
hmac	md5	hash	hmac	hash	md5
many cipher suites will still use hmac using sha-1 as sha-1 and even md5 is quite safe within a hmac scheme due to the fact that a key is hash both at the start and at the end of the data to protect

26049758
hash	hmac
the structure of the hmac algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying hash algorithm

26049758
hmac	md5
hmac is quite resilient against the current successful attacks on md5 and sha-1

google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari and even bad ol internet explorer 9 the scaling works how i want

26049859
opera	firefox
opera mini also fails rendering this background image when enabled in that it doesn t scale the image down and given the presto engine s tradition of tackling specs with the earnestness of a summer thunderstorm it may expect the same updated approach that firefox does.

26049877
post	put
what you want is flush_rewrite_rules which you would put into your code after you register the post type

26049903
int	chars
i couldn t find a method that gets the unicode category directly from an int or two chars s

26049960

int	boolean
the idea is to override iscellselected int row int colum and changeselection int rowindex int columnindex boolean toggle boolean extend of jtable

26050082
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in firefox and google-chrome and both produce the same result

26050112
cpu	processors
if you want to compute the load on the processors s -- that is the percentage of total available cpu time that s non-idle -- i would make the api call at regular intervals say once every 5 seconds and for each interval compute difference in user + kernel from start to the end of the interval divided by difference in total

easiest way to do that would be to create an arrays of teacher and then inside your while loops put a for-loop that loops through all your teacher objects and checks the room number

26050478
quad	blender
i restored it by creating a new quad fbx file in blender and that worked for a long time but with 4.5.4p1 it has broken again

setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval will continually execute the function you pass to it every interval delay 2000 milliseconds 2 seconds until clearinterval is called

26051105
hash	salt
it can verify and it s not magical - the bcrypt encoded hash contains the salt

26051108
for-loop	arrays
i think i can work with the answers to this question by using for-loop and arrays operations but i would be glad to know if a d3 function can already take care of this

26051166
for-loop	loops
to loops over the items of a collection the most natural c++ loops is the range based for-loop

26051242
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to get it consistent in ie google-chrome and firefox

26051264
mouse	keyboard
so basically the application is running on the remote system and it is communicating with a local x11 server which provides you with the display and handling of the mouse and keyboard

if for some reason you are using this question as a placeholder for a more complex problem that really required a sub-shell to send output to the mail command then i leave the original solution in place

26051362
unix	aix
i m thinking mostly of old-line unix like sun aix and other vendor systems not linux

26051378

you can always extends activity and create your own baseactivity which in it s ondestroy method will implements your functionality

26051401
getter	setter
further you have setter getter

26051431
gridview	formview
i m doing this website for a school project and when i run this website i have a gridview where i select one registry then it opens the formview with all the details about the selected registry

however self.view and self.inputview s frame are both cgrectezero in viewdidload or viewwillappear and that s actually why we should set keyboard height only after

26051901
for-loop	loops
an else attached to a for-loop just means do this unless you exited loops early

26051974
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i do not experience this in google-chrome firefox or safari

26052472
division	multiplication
division is one of a number of operations which as far as computational complexity theory is concerned are no more expensive than multiplication

26052472
multiplying	division
the fast way to do division is instead of dividing a by by multiplying a by 1 b reducing the problem to computing a reciprocal

26052502
for-loop	loops
when i find the matching file and set it to the foundfile variable in the else if clause the for-loop just keeps on iterating and overwrites the value of the foundfile variable with the value on the next loops

26052538
getter	setter
you setter and getter for takehomepay is referring to itself

26062264
put	get
i am certain that triangle flush is being called i have put a std cout in it and it does get invoked

26062264
fflush	gets
ps to clear things out again when i make a fflush function inside the glut_functions.cpp the triangle gets rendered

26062343
post	get
the name attribute identifies the input value if it is sent to a server via a traditional get or post of a form

26062343
post	get
if you specify an input with no name but an id and try to submit it via a get or post it will not be parsed correctly by the server

26062350
haskell	scheme
i have written a program in haskell which is mostly universal for the type of problem i am trying to solve but includes two dependent components a run-time estimation function for a script calculated based on trial runs at a certain benchmark and a file-name conversion function which is tailored to the naming scheme of the files i was working with

26062386
folder	directory
you would have to paste your files and directory into the public folder if you want a quick fix

google-chrome	safari
i ve made a plunker with it and while it works in google-chrome it will break in safari

26062569

just as the title says need this because im serializing values to std ostringstream and don t wish to overload operator

26062774
profiling	instrumentation
you should run something like the time profiling in instrumentation to make sure that really is the problem before trying to optimize it

26062882
int	chars	unsigned	short
is there any advantage in using a shorter int variable short or unsigned chars to loop over array or stl container indexes

26062971
gson	flexjson	gson	jackson	flexjson	jackson
i have so far tried jackson gson and flexjson but i can t get it to work with my example included

and with qsystemtrayicon setvisible bool visible you can show hide the icon in the tray

26063117
mouse	keyboard
the afterselect works if you use your keyboard navigation to select a node but it doesn t work when you use the mouse because the mouse capture is forcing the parent form to remain in focus

26063130
post	get
when trying it with a post request i get this message

26063182
hide	show
as it makes no sense to hide the next page and show the current one

26063368
zoo	lubridate
a slightly different approach using lubridate and rollapply from zoo rather than apply.rolling

26063372
g++	gcc
however even though the source files have the .cc suffix gcc is selected to link the final executable instead of g++

26063372
g++	gcc
i know that i could work around this by specifying that c code should be linked using g++ instead of gcc but that feels dirty

26063431
post	get
one for online use with http get post which then stores data locally using indexdb

26063469
multiplying	division
1 we keep over-writing reversednumber by changing increasing its decimal position multiplying by 10 and adding the remainder of the division of inputnumber and 10

26063482
strncmp	strcmp
instead of using strcmp use strncmp which compares the first n characters

26063490
google-chrome	firefox
i have built a website using ext.net and it displays normally in google-chrome firefox and ie when it is on localhost

26063518
teamcity	jenkins
something like teamcity jenkins or ccnet is your best bet

26063618
strstr	substr
if you only need to search for the substr kas though you can use strstr

26063623
put	get
i m trying to get specific attribute values from an xml file an then put them into a table

26063721
post	get
you need to check for the get although i recommend using post information before you run your update database code

26063788
cout	cin
in out with std cin and std cout

26063802
put	get
put all your routes in this xml and configure it in a way so when you get a request like

change summary to tbs lte upgrade versioning of boost library no changes

26063901
openmpi	mpich
build rpms without python3 mpich or openmpi

26063901
openmpi	mpich
python3 isn t easily available unden rhel 6.4 and mpich and openmpi have all kinds of other compile trouble

26064025
screens	hdpi
if you are developing for api 14 it does not mean you have to focus only on hdpi this specifically depends on what is the screens resolution of your target audience

26064070
content-length	content-type
you need the content-type and content-length headers

26064072
pop-up	dialog
if you don t save and do so on the dialog that pop-up when you compile run you have to go again

26064089
yacc	bison
since flex and yacc bison integrates the usual pattern is to read until next token that is they don t do a loop that read all input before parsing

26064090
folder	directory
then i did project- properties- linker- general- additional library directory and pasted in the folder where the libusb header files are d libusb-1.0.9 libusb

26064108
min	max
use two cells one for min and one for max

26064108
min	max
assuming that min is in cells g5 g7 and max is in cells h5 h7 you can use the following formula to get your value

26064117
inherited	properties
it keeps the same properties as the entity but they aren t related in an inherited hierarchy

26064121
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
there will be four steps here -- we ll set up some constants to hold the picker view data and a bit of configuration then we ll add uipickerviewdatasource and uipickerviewdelegate methods and we ll end with the viewdidload initialization

26064154
int	chars
you are returning a pointer to a constant chars where your function requires to return an int

26064154
int	chars
use the to dereference the pointer into the const chars object which is interchangeable with int

26064157
kerberos	ntlm
i d like libcurl to fallback to ntlm when kerberos is not available

google-chrome	firefox
it s very messy but if you try opening the inspect elements on your web browser firefox ro google-chrome it fixes itself

26064235
box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
retry using min-height 100 box-sizing border-box and a padding-bottom equal to the height of your footer

26064258
put	get
to get all divs to appear as if they had the same height you can use pseudo-elements to put the respective backgrounds behind each one of the divs

26064323
portrait	landscape
the image can be transformed to landscape or portrait based on vertical or horizontal resize of the window

26064328
children	parent
so i have a expandablelistview and all of the children of one of the parent checked in is the name of the parent have a button that says checked out and when you click that button it send a rest put call json and basically it checks them out and on our server it will then put them in the next parent departed ...so when the button is clicked the call is done instantly and the record is changed in the database however the ui does not refresh unless the user pulls down to refresh so i need to force a refresh when this call is being done

26064331
splash	launchimage
i m also aware that under hig the launchimage is not a splash but for this app game that s how the bootflow is designed on all platforms so please limit answers to technical responses

26064331
splash	launchimage
additionally this launchimage is also displayed on a second splash screen shown by the application we launch the app with the launchimage plus some custom animation before streaming in all other data. from the user s perspective they see a single continuous splash screen with animation starting over it during the 2nd part of the load

26064346
g++	gcc
my problem was that my gcc and g++ versions differed from my gfortran version

26064346
g++	gcc
check what version of gcc g++ and gfortran you have

26064346
g++	gcc
in my case i only had one version of gfortran so i simply changed the g++ and gcc versions to match that of gfortran

26064357
for-loop	arrays
because of divakar s benchmarking i m curious to see how pre-allocating the arrays then using an actual for-loop to iterate through a and r and populate it by indexing would benchmark

26064370
min	max
so i have an id min and an id max and i want to have all hash values generated by the first code being within the min and the max generate with the second code

26064389
accessor	properties
see also properties accessor and

26064393
ppl	tbb
i have looked into the techniques used by intel tbb and also i looked into possibly using the concepts from microsoft s ppl its asynchronous agents library looks promising - both of which have task oriented techniques to achieve the above - unfortunately however these solutions will not work my target powerpc linux embedded target

26064435
postgresql	mysql
i didn t try it on mysql but for postgresql there is a postgis extension which provides full set of usefull functions for that kind of tasks

26064505
gif	png
but whenever i want to upload it i need to use either uiimagejpegrepresentation or uiimagepngrepresentation and that makes the gif become a simple jpg or png

26064525
min	max
if you have a min and a max value you re expecting then you should just be calculating min.add hash str .mod max.subtract min

26064533
post	get
when adding comments to the page using ajax and the post method i get 501 unsupported method post

26064535
hide	show
ultimately i m trying to hide or show different webparts depending on the value in the textbox

26064537
post	get
i know this is an old post but i recently came across a similar issue - mainly that if you do unset one-by-one you get multiple change events with the model in an intermediate state for each one

26064580
disk	ram
not the processor not the ram not the disk

26064588
folder	directory
i have seen already several times not working logon batch scripts because path on client computer contained as first folder path the bin directory of a compiler ported from unix to windows with executables also found in systemroot system32 but working completely different as ported from unix

26064731
post	get
i have asked this question on the forums i have yet to get a reply so i will try here as well i will copy the post from those forums but please do tell me if i am missing any details out posting it on the wrong forum on this website or whether i should actually post it to another website

26064734
versioning	upgrade
if you change your database schema at all you need to increment your database versioning used in your sqliteopenhelper constructor and handle upgrade drop and recreate or modify tables in the onupgrade method

26064778
for-loop	loops
python s for-loop is like other languages foreach loops

26064795
width	height
the other issue i ve encountered is that you really have to make sure there is an explicit width height on the map before doing anything

26064795
width	height
either setting the width height properties doing a position absolute with all top left bottom right defined or something else

26064806
google-chrome	firefox
it works normally firefox but not in google-chrome and explorer

26064812
children	parent
i agree with xurshid29 you should have a look to the tree doctrine extension which allow you to deal with parent and children

26064814
filesystems	ntfs
you may want set this file as executable inside git bash chmod +x .bashrc but its probably redundant since this file is stored on ntfs filesystems

26064856
implements	extends
i think nice solution i didn t have time to actually implements would be to extends simpledateformetter to apply local-aware messageformat before passing to the parent class

26064889
post	get
there are also functions triggered by simple links no post request for removing and ordering modules working the same way with get parameters

26064955
post	get
i was hoping to create a function that will check for post or get data

26064974
swift	objective-c
i m just adding this below in objective-c to make it clearer to beginners and those of us who refuse to learn swift syntax

26064994
queue	fifo
i have an application that is processing items in a fifo queue using tasks in .net 4.0

26064999
jar	war
i understand this breaks the runnable jar paradigm but we re planning to deploy this as a war anyway

26065028
lodash	underscore.js
this could definitely be solved a little more elegantly using ecmascript 5 or underscore.js lodash methods

26065036
scatter	graphing
i m generating five figures four line graphing and one scatter plot

26065070
google-chrome	firefox
i believe the error occurred in google-chrome and internet explorer as well as firefox

26065097
apache	nginx
changed apache to nginx on my server

26065117
folder	directory
in visual studio to add a folder to the include directory open the project properties for your target and add the folder to the c c++- general- additional include directory setting

26065143
submit	submission
i want to submit the form to www.example.com users signup but my page is submission to www.example.com test users signup

26065149
filesystems	ntfs
you may want set this file as executable inside git bash chmod +x .bashrc but its probably redundant since this file is stored on ntfs filesystems

26065156
client-side	server-side
if the form data is not sent to server-side processing but handled only in client-side processing the name attribute is not used as you can access the values with other means

26065183
for-loop	loops
for example if i try to use a javascript for-loop i can t index into my viewmodel lists because loops variable is undefined when i call model.geographicdata.regions i .

26065193
post	get
you would have to get the post type which i m pretty sure is the field type

26065222
put	get
you forgot to put quotes around your call to get the input value

26065235
octal	decimal
00101 is octal value which is 65 in decimal so it returns 5

26065237
for-loop	loops
the for-loop variable can be changed inside each loops iteration like this

26065246
superclass	subclassing
this is kind of an example of the more general principle that subclassing tablecell in this case breaks encapsulation because you need to know details about the superclass implementation in this case whether the index is updated before the item or vice-versa

26065246
sorting	filtering
since the cells that are adjacent to the current cell may change by filtering sorting or even just scrolling the listener on those values needs to be moved to the correct item when that happens

26065250
put	get
in submitting the put request i get the following traceback -

26065258
octal	decimal
00101 is in octal which is equal to 65 in decimal so that is why the modulus operator will always give us 5

26065258
octal	decimal
you can do octal to decimal converstion on this link

26065381
children	parent
then there are variations a website i was reading claimed that a node need not have a pointer to its parent and other places don t account for how children of a node are managed

26065445
realloc	malloc
as far as i understood malloc initially allocated the string to be 15 bytes long and then realloc reassigned it to be 25 characters long

26065481
width	height
but the problem here is that the font-awesome icons aren t of equal width or height so you may have issue of skewed circle ellipse shape

26065512
valgrind	memcheck
alternatively run your code in valgrind memcheck tool

26065516
unsigned	short
indicates that the conversion will be one of d i o u x x or n and the next pointer is a pointer to a short int or unsigned short int rather than int

26065565
put	get
however if you plan to use get put or if you might iterate it more than once creating a new map is advisable so that the work of filter and transform is only done once

26065571
filtering	grouping
set filtering type to expose to grouping filtering

26065583
vbscript	jscript
b activexobject only works for jscript so i converted it to vbscript as per

26065592
folder	directory
in that particular case i found the opencl.so file on the device and had to do a symlink opencl.so.1 to that particular apps appdata. in the appdata folder in the root directory

26065626
put	get
but when i try to remove the connection string of the app.config and put it as parameter on the dbcontext constructor i cannot get it to work

26065630
width	height
simple theory to make a circle is you need to define value for height width and radius must be equal

26065630
width	height
height 50px width 50px and border-radius 50px

26065672
int	chars
the standard way to do it is to read into an int variable then copy to the chars

26065682
post	get
however in my testing i did notice some things there are some things that you can get rid of for example qstring post isn t actually used it can be deleted

26065682
spaces	delimiter
i created my own implementation one of the major differences is my implementation takes a delimiter character and that character is used instead of always using a white spaces and i fixed the bug that i described above

26065706
width	height
set the width height leading alignment and center x alignment for each label

26065718
prepare	execute
you don t need to prepare your statement if you re going to execute immediate

26065746
put	get
but if i put a breakpoint on added onclick listener i get whenever i click outside the node regardless whether i click on edge or on empty space

26065750
width	height
i ve tried various things such as setting the image width to 100 leaving the image width and height undefined setting the actual dimensions 660 x 248 and then setting the table width to 100 using three table cells and setting the width of the center table cell with the image etc.

26065798
postfix	dovecot
this is on a debian 7 box using postfix dovecot mysql and spamass-milter

26065805
put	get
however when i go to put in my scanner method in the main i get an error java.lang.numberformatexception and have no clue what to do

26065811
min	max
my first approach was to use the parameters v_min and v_max using the min max values of the data

26065826
stdout	stderr
redirecting output from a script stdout + stderr tologfile 1 and a grep to logfile 2

26065885
blogspot	blogger
add jquery to your blogger and blogspot template code

26065965
uiview	calayer
to use core animation you have to modify a property of a uiview s underlying calayer

26065980
subtraction	addition
i am trying to do both integer and floating point simd addition subtraction etc

26065998
width	height
or minus 100 whichever works the buffer is supposed to take in account the width and height of the finger as well

26066014
actualheight	actualwidth	width	height
on sizechanged events of the scrollviewer - set the width and height of the middle grid to the same values as actualwidth and actualheight of the scrollviewer and perhaps set the left and right grids to be a little bit narrower to leave space to see a little bit of the middle panel when you scroll to the ends

26066016
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i tried log the uiview s frame but i did that in the viewdidload method then i got a wrong frame because the uiview instance in the storyboard hasn t be init at that time...i should do that in the viewdidappear method.

26066031
swift	objective-c
this is more of a cocoa frameworks question as you can do this with either objective-c or swift

26066077
int	chars
undefined first referenced symbol in file request request chars int int threadtest.o

26066085
ienumerable	ilist
i have already tryed with createalias createcriteria return ilist return ienumerable

26066105
swift	objective-c
this means objective-c objects should po the same in swift as they do in objective-c

26066105
swift	objective-c
as a future enhancement the idea is that lldb will be able to ask the swift standard library todebugstring object and let the swift library handle the details of what the operations means - much like nsprintfordebugger in the objective-c world

26066127
children	parent
the style applied to the parent tag will also apply to all it s children unless it is overwritten

26066206
installation	upgrade
running an installation of oscommerce 2.2rc2 secured but an upgrade is in the works on windows server 2008 r2 standard 64-bit and my tester is running windows 8.1 not sure if 32-bit or 64-bit and ie11

26066263
maven	pom.xml
there s lots of static content in your target work webapp where it came from is still an unknown but likely it arrived from some configuration in your maven pom.xml for that project this project could be heavily gwt-like in behavior with most of the client work being javascript html

26066273
hide	show
instead of changing id you can use label and add a condition to hide and show the form

26066301
width	height
so you can do that in the h264depay and check if it has the width height fields

26066301
width	height
if it does not you can add an h264parse and that should likely find out width and height for you and you can use the notify caps in its source pad

26066316
children	parent
lets say you have a parent actor that receives a request for a large chunk of work say you need to go to the network to download 100 files and so the parent actor splits up the work and routes it to 10 children so that we are downloading more than 1 file at once

26066318
gson	jackson
i know how to use gson or jackson library

26066335
rtp	rtsp
there seems to be a point where every person trying to do h.264 over rtsp rtp comes down to this question

26066335
decoder	encoder
that being said there are ways to configure the encoder to reduce the number of nal units in an access unit like not including the aud nal not repeating sps pps exclude sei nal s - with that knowledge you can actually know what to expect and kind of force the encoder to give you single nal per frame of course this will not work for all frames but with the knowledge you have about the decoder you can handle that

26066335
rtp	rtsp
when it is just rtp it s easy enough to implement the transport yourself since i ve had bad luck with gstreamer that did not have proper support for fu-a packetization in case of rtsp the overhead of the transport infrastructure is bigger and it is reasonable to use a 3rd party library like live555

26066346
cpu	affinity
visual studio 2013 has a package server running it was spending up to 2 million k of memory i put it to low priority and affinity with only one cpu and vs ran much more smoothly

26066374
spaces	delimiter
so i have a bunch of log files which are spaces delimiter mostly but contain square braces where there may also be spaces

26066385
post	put
interestingly i ran strings on the binary and it didn t output the dns address i put in as a response to the most recent post

26066401
width	height
classid codebase and width and height are both required attributes for an tag

26066444
addition	multiplication
now according to my understanding in-built array operations in fortran 90 is an example of data parallelism as fortran has the capability to perform operations like addition multiplication on array elements with a simple code like c a+b ..

26066477
goto	break
break - is like a goto end

26066518
mousemove	mouseup
for quick fix you can use mousemove and mouseup events like this

26066558
csv	tsv
if it is a tsv look at the csv module

26066567
smarty	oxid
i have a small issue regarding smarty and the oxid eshop

factors	matrix
i ve tried using many variations of the reshape function reshape2 package to turn a data frame of different factors into a two column matrix but i ve been unsuccessful

26066601
jqgrid	datatables
i have a model view and controller that will automatically convert a datatables to a jqgrid

26066614
google-chrome	safari
i m trying to port a simple google-chrome extension to safari extension

26066650
ng-show	ng-hide
perhaps the most simple way would be to have the html of the modal be hidden by either ng-show or ng-hide in conjunction with ng-mouseover

26066667
getter	setter
the underscore prefix for private attributes and the property mechanism for hiding attributes behind getter and setter can ensure that it s obvious that people shouldn t use your objects like that and make it harder for them to do so accidentally but it can t prevent them from actually doing so maliciously

26066673
versioning	upgrade
but i did the upgrade of selenium to 2.43 as firefox upgrade to 32 versioning

floating-point	fractions
what you probably should do is to decide exactly which of your variables and results are integers and thus in the integral class and which are floating-point and thus in the fractions class. then use the fromintegral function to convert from the former to the latter whenever necessary

26069538

26070272
superclass	subclassing
you can call super in the subclassing method which will call the superclass method and then make the extra changes you need in the subclassing method

26070272

26070438
put	get
http 500 means an internal exception in execution it is able to find the service and resource you are calling but while returning it leads to an exception best way to figure out is is debugging try this change the deployment server to visual studio internal development server in the web properties of the project run via visual studio by having a first call or exception call as default being set put a break point in the code it would break and debug the exception you can fix that you will get correct xml or json response you might have set in the service

children	parent
there is a problem whenever a parent node contains children with the same string value

26071393
equals	tostring
the only thing i ve come up with so far theoretically - i haven t implemented and verified that it will work is to wrap a string in another class override tostring to return the wrapped string and take advantage of the default equals method which tests that the actual wrapper objects must be identical same instance to return true

26071393

for-loop	loops
i would also change your initial while loops into a for-loop

26071885
superclass	subclassing
you are assigning subclassing object to a superclass type variable i.e upcasting is done its fine

26071888

26072302
post	get
when you pass the values to that processor file you can do so through various methodologies for simplicity lets just take a look at the get and the post ones

26072316
min	max
in regard to your groups in the table setup create a min age column and a max age field in a table that defines your groups

26072316
min	max
then to do your queries you would do search for the where the age value is between the min and max in the agegroups table

26072321
lemmatization	stemming
maybe you could use lemmatization over stemming to reduce unacceptable outcomes

26072322
int	chars
so i have a string passed into main function int main int argc chars argv

26072372

i assuming that the table layout gives default values for width and height

26072752
realloc	malloc
if you have a pointer to somewhere within a malloc d memory block at offset then use realloc to shrink the block to less than your offset your pointer becomes invalid obviously

26072846
int	chars
you tried to assign simple value like int chars etc. while expected type is obj-c object like nsnumber

26072862
int	chars	int	boolean
i am use to data types such as chars strings boolean int longs and decimals

26072918

post	get
my question that i have two servers one serving http post get while the other serving client with tcp each one working in different thread i want to receive the post requests and process it first then transfer the result to the connected client in tcp so far i was able to create the two server and receive data from each one but i was unable to make them talk with each other i try global variables and calling the tcp handler class function from the post function but it seem nothing worked

26073055
free	malloc
it s no different from doing a free and then a malloc and there is no guarantee that the two objects have the same address even if the new size is the old size .

26073055
free	realloc
and in a program with multiple threads any free memory can be allocated in a different thread between the two reallocs in which case the realloc for a larger size will be forced to move the object to a different location

26073055
free	realloc
it s not any sort of corner case and i don t know what you re seeing in the standard which is quite clear that free memory has indeteterminate content and that the values of any pointers to or into it are also indeterminate and makes no claim that they are magically restored by a later realloc

26073055
free	realloc
as soon as you realloc string overwrite is invalid and the compiler is free to trash it .

26073061
draggable	droppable
i ve a droppable div container and draggable div elements of class event inside it

26073061
draggable	droppable
1 - set .event elements to be draggable and at the same time droppable not accepting .event as draggable

26073061
draggable	droppable
3 - i tried to change the class of draggable to avoid draggable droppable with same class name in case this could be the problem

26073083
folder	directory
now i want to have an application specific download folder and save all downloaded music files to that folder only so that i can use directory listing to show all those downloads

26073094
integer	unsigned
unsigned should be avoided for about anything else due its broken integer arithmetics but is the best choice for bit operations as far as primitive types are concerned

26073147
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
you could use lxml and html5lib directly but then you d forgo the nice high-level api that beautifulsoup offers

26073162
swift	objective-c
to use swift code in your objective-c code you have to include in your .m or .h file the following line substitute productmodulename with the name of your target

26073162
swift	objective-c
your swift class needs to be a descendant of nsobject or you have to prefix your swift class with objective-c

26073162
swift	objective-c
there is a really great explanation about how this works in the ibook using swift with cocoa and objective-c

26073165
getter	setter
my transilientrain class has a getter setter for the mission attribute

26073205
width	height
the way i figured out is to just set the height and the width to slightly under 100

26073209
width	height
i want the height of my surfaceview in xml to be depending on the width so i would like something like this

26073220

26073243
charindex	substr
charindex substr rtrim ltrim convert - this is not an issue - it works fine

26073278
getter	setter
if i were you i would turn the global variable into a static member variable of a class with a public getter function and private setter function

26073279
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the roboto light shown as regular or bold

26073296
swift	objective-c
i m trying to switch from objective-c to swift but i can t understand how to declare skspritenode as property

26073339
implements	extends
that proxy object implements eventdao and therefor can be cast to it but it s signature has nothing to do with eventdaoimpl and hence the classcastexception since it does not extends eventdaoimpl

26073434
strstr	substr
simple as return substr strstr url v 2 11

26073524
swift	objective-c
all objects in swift are in a sense also objective-c objects in that they can be used with the objective-c runtime just like objects from objective-c

26073524
swift	objective-c
some members of the class the ones not marked objective-c or dynamic may not be visible to objective-c but otherwise all the introspection features of the objective-c runtime work fully on objects of pure swift classes

26073524
swift	objective-c
classes defined in swift look like any other class to the objective-c runtime except the name is mangled

26073524
swift	objective-c
using the objective-c runtime you can discover that for a class that is a root class in swift from the point of view of objective-c it actually has a superclass named swiftobject

26073524
swift	objective-c
so basically from the objective-c point of view a swift class either has an existing objective-c class as root class if it inherited from an objective-c class or has swiftobject as root class

26073568
alarmmanager	wakelock
the alarmmanager holds a cpu wakelock as long as the alarm receiver s onreceive method is executing

26073568

required	placeholder
you have a parameter placeholder name but you don t add the required parameter to the sqlcommand that executes the sql

26073631
required	placeholder
by the way string.format required the placeholder in the form 0 but also if you fix that problem it is still wrong because you leave open the door to sql injection

26073664
for-loop	arrays
i have a char arrays name where i store some values in a for-loop using the scanf function in c

26073704

however i ve never loaded images in java and i m not sure how to extends implements the abstract class functions

26073785
jobs	cron
it makes sure each of your cron jobs run when they are supposed to and alerts you if they failed to be run

26073791
int	double
i ve tried using all the different types like float double and int and none of them work

26073800
jobs	cron
you could also use to monitor your queues and cron jobs

26073842
free	realloc
a compiler is free to reuse the pointer variable for some other purpose after the realloc being free so you have no guarantee that it has the same value as it did before

26073842
free	realloc
the value of a pointer that refers to space deallocated by a call to the free or realloc

int	double
ps the first number in your list is too large to be an int this could be fixed by using string s bigint s long s or even double s

26074187
for-loop	loops
kiss is key perhaps in some cases on some js engines a decrementing while loops will outperform an incrementing for-loop but you re writing javascript not c or assembly

26074187
for-loop	loops
perhaps the closest you can get with a while loops in terms of predictable behavriour or behaviour resembling that of a for-loop is either one of this

26074228
serializable	deserialization
i will use json4s in the example because i am a bit familiar with it and because i heard it is the de-facto standard for json serializable deserialization in scala

26074287

superclass	subclassing
example on why it would be bad for a subclassing to throw an exception where the superclass does promise to not throw an exception

26074386
width	height
as a result scaled images have sharp corners if original images have no extra width and height

26074386
width	height
one possible solution to the problem is original images having extra width and height in this case sprite.png

26074439
superclass	subclassing
i may not be correct but i think you are asking why superclass a cannot extend subclassing b who extends class a

26074481
int	boolean
so far in my experience every piece of data saved inside table s columns did not have a specific reason to be int or boolean or so on

26074511

26074528
put	get
always put them within using-statements when possible so they get properly disposed of

26074546

viewdidload	viewwillappear
i can t use viewdidload or viewwillappear in my viewcontroller class because those methods are not called when the app moves from the background to foreground state

26079614
width	height
while this sounds as it should work by itself the element has properties of its own such as width and height so we need to apply a margin-left and margin-top equal to half of the size of the element in this particular case 100px and 250px

26079631
folder	directory
the idea is to create a native-libs folder in the build directory of the main project copy all required .so files from ndk library projects there and then tell the build system to package those libs in the apk

26079651
next	except
where it appends the number of days until the next game for every row except the last

26079652
width	height
one major thing that the above answers are leaving out is the fact that in ios7 and below when you check for the screen bounds it always lists the width and height as the same no matter what orientation the phone is in

26079652
width	height
so if it s an iphone5 in landscape mode it will still list the width as 320 and height as 568

26079652

i am trying to fetch objects that are children of a parent object using a predicate

26080332
noexcept	throw
the difference between noexcept and throw is that in case of throw the exception stack is still unwound and destructors are called so implementation has to keep track of the stack see 15.5.2 the std unexpected function in the standard

this js is incorrect - it doesn t hide at then show as i had hoped

26080815
int	chars
as i can t find a way to get the ascii value of a chars directly each chars in turn has to be cast to a string then the unicodescalars property lets me access the values that represent the string elements these values are uint32 so they can be compared to the int value of the non-printable chars with a bit of typecasting

26080831
int	chars
whenever you see int as the datatype of a chars that s what the int contains a utf-32 value

26080832

i am using pageradapter and viewpager to display imageview array textview array .but how do i delete pager on button click .entire code in the code below but i have added button in xml onclick should delete the page

26080857
children	parent
my basic understanding of perspective vs transform perspective is simply that the plain perspective attribute is what you usually use on a parent element to give multiple children the same perspective while transform perspective would be used on a child element or an individual element to give it its own perspective

26080878
put	get
when i get one i frame with a 4 bit start code just like 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x65 ... i put it into a cmblockbuffer

26080888
int	chars
every chars have an int value that you can use to get that chars as well you can convert a chart into int the same way by assigning a chars to an int variable

26080888
int	chars
i m using chars values in a loop and it is allowed just because every chars have an int value

26080914
swift	objective-c
top-level functions from swift cannot be used from c objective-c

26080928
typedef	struct
many experienced programmers feel that pointer typedef make the code harder to read so i would advise getting rid of slptr and just doing or if you also do typedef struct sl sl

26080965
folder	directory
to do so download and extract the code from the website and copy the bs4 directory into the same folder as your python script

26080987

stdout	stderr
you re running the subprocess without providing any stdout or stderr

26081036
stdout	stderr
when run in a terminal the subprocess will inherit your stdout and stderr so anything it prints will show up intermingled with your output

26081036
stdout	stderr
when run in idle the subprocess will also inherit your stdout and stderr but those don t go anywhere

26081036
stdout	stderr
the simplest fix is to capture the stdout and stderr from the subprocess and print them yourself

26081057

charlietfl s comment on my op got me thinking about the difference between setinterval and settimeout and i realized that

26081214
google-chrome	firefox
i tried imacro google-chrome firefox plugin but input interaction does not sync

26081229
width	height
the issue was probably occurring because of the gif s positioning happens with both float right and position absolute even when the img element has fixed height and width of it s own might happen with other positioning styles too

26081242
hide	show
thus i would like to initially hide the controls-- when the poster graphic is showing-- and then show them when the video is clicked to play and also to hide them again when the video is clicked to pause.

for-loop	loops
simply assign the channel from time.after outside the for-loop otherwise you will just create a new timer each time you loops

26081305
ubuntu	centos
i suspect what is happening is that the worker process starts on the remote machine centos but the master process on the ubuntu machine for some reason is unable to connect to the worker process that is spawned on the centos machine

26081305
ubuntu	centos
the odd part about this is that if i use the centos machine as the master and the ubuntu machine as the remote worker everything works fine

26081325
post	get
unlike the get post of ajax has diff data like this

26081366
getter	setter
see objective-c getter setter

26081388
int	double
why does r have to transform the double decimal values to int to operate

starting from the viewdidappear tried in viewdidload also made no difference i run a method to init my locationmanager stuff

26081668
for-loop	loops
secondly you shouldn t increment col within the for-loop -- loops does that for you already

26081680
fgets	fread
instead of using fread i used fgets to get the whole line

26081780
move	drag
to track mouse move and mouse drag use the mousemotionlistener.

26081780
implements	extends
the class that is interested in processing a mouse event either implements this interface and all the methods it contains or extends the abstract mouseadapter class overriding only the methods of interest

26081789
width	margin
the best way to get what you are trying to achieve is to change the width and margin of the element at the desired break-point

26081846
post	get
check the following post to get some ideas about the ways you can handle such situation

26081850
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you should make _pickerdata a mutable arrays instantiate it outside loops then add objects to it in the for-loop

26081864
width	height
if you want height and width to really be the percentage of the page use viewport units

26081878
treemap	treeset
and you can see the treemap has become map and the treeset has become collection

26081892
hackage	stackage

to achieve hide show behavior define the active class accordingly

26087338
children	parent
i m not sure if i m using the parent children method s properly

26087365
folder	directory
system.getproperty user.dir will return the directory where the program is running not the home folder

26087407
hide	show
the form is used to filter what div s are show on my page all of the div s are in a list and the form simply uses jquery to hide classes that don t have the same value

i am trying to write a program for converting positive binary inputs into hex

26087411
hex	binary
why am i getting this errors while compiling my binary to hex converter

26087427
rss	feed
my current project is a light tabbed angular rss feed reader from what i can tell it should work however it does not

26087432
hex	binary
it s not really clear what your expected input output is given that you ve got a floating binary point in there but i would just parse from binary to a and convert that byte array to hex using a 3rd party library.

26087448
multiplying	subtract
when you subtract 10 the remaining is 90 which can be obtained by multiplying by 90 100 0.9

26087472
uicollectionview	reloaddata
thanks to reloading a uicollectionview using reloaddata method returns immediately before reloading data

26087476
children	parent
the problem is that when i fadeout the parent element on hover the children elements get faded along with it

26087557
width	height
also i can t understand the position of lines or objects to put into the document because i follow this guide online that talk about a reversing axis disposition x for height and y for width but seems i didn t catch the right methodology i put in my code a constant left position at 40 and a variable top descreasing value from 600 i m not manage now the multipage if the value is less than 0

26087563
superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
when you call a subclassing constructor that will always work its way up through the inherited hierarchy executing the body of the superclass constructor before the subclassing constructor.

26087563
superclass	subclassing
indeed even field initializers in the subclassing are only run after the superclass constructor

26087606
stdout	stderr
the complete code with redirecting stdout and stderr to this console will be like this

26087609
oncreate	onnewintent
instead of calling onnewintent the activity s oncreate method is called resulting in a new instance of the activity on top of the activity stack

26087619
hide	show
i wanted to hide the subdirectory name and show only parameter in my localhost so example.com refers to localhost

26087647
put	get
i took the freedom to put the if-statement first otherwise you would get the output

26087650
bmp	png
as xmri suggested i was able to make this work by saving my png image as a 32-bit alpha channel bmp file

26087656
jpedal	ghost4j
if not then i will have to possibly work this out on server side by converting pdf page to image using jpedal ghost4j tools and then sending images to client side

26087661

i have been using synchronized this for get and put methods

26087759
min	max
i wanted to show max nilai and min nilai for each matkul or in english subjects so i created a query like this and it worked perfectly

26087759
min	max
but that query only showed max nilai and min nilai without showing whom max nilai and min nilai belong to so the final result will be like this

26087766
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
the problem is that upgrade in vs2008 setups and later use installer classes and an install sequence which is 1 install newer product over older product use file versioning checking run install custom actions 2 remove the old product running uninstall custom actions and getting rid of files that are no longer used

26087766
uninstall	upgrade
the uninstall custom action for the service should have a condition of not upgradingproductcode so that an upgrade doesn t try to uninstall it but a straight uninstall will

26087766
uninstall	upgrade
it needs to be in a fixed location because this upgrade solution doesn t install or uninstall the service - it just updates the binary - but obviously you don t want service entries referring to a service that has changed location

26087771
oncreate	onnewintent
instead of calling onnewintent the activity s oncreate method is called resulting in a new instance of the activity on top of the activity stack

26087779

26087779
google-chrome	firefox

26087788
cout	cin
cout and cin and cerr as well are namespace-scope objects not functions in namespace std

26087830
explode	implode
i believe that the problem is simply the need to encase each value in quotes because i have no trouble using in_array with a hard-coded array as long as it s formatted that way but i haven t been able to add the quotes with either explode or implode

26087900
folder	directory
i have tried doing .. to go back a folder and to go back to the root directory but i am still having problems

26087907

part of the point of this in an actual project would be to set the height of the widget based on the width using only autolayout

26087933
int	boolean
forkjoinpool int parallelism forkjoinpool.forkjoinworkerthreadfactory factory thread.uncaughtexceptionhandler handler boolean asyncmode

bower	npm
i m a npm bower noob - but what happened in my case was that i was using the angular js tutorial

26088292
bower	npm
which seems to have bower set up to be used via npm and not via the command line directly

26088292
bower	npm
then to run bower i actually used npm install

26088292

this is not the good way to declare setter and getter

26088386
int	chars
while setting c to int long chars but not array etc.

26088392
min	max
it looks like you want to return multiple students when there are ties in min belongs to and max belongs to

26088392
min	max
you can achieve this by selecting from derived tables where each row contains a list of students per subject and score and joining those scores to your max min scores

26088415
int	chars
unsigned int chars memory + i this should print 2686636 255 and 2686637 255

26088417
min	max
one way - if you want ties to show up is splitting the query into a union of two queries - one for the min and one for the max - and an outer query to combine them

26088422
post	put
the scaffolded web api controller is restful and it doesn t return anything from post put or delete

26088422
post	put
for example maintain a list in the scope and modify it simultaneously with the post put delete calls but it seems cumbersome

26088435
post	put
it means that i still can put some text in that input field and can post the form

26088514
int	double
cannot implicitly convert type double to int

26088533
margin	height
so we get the height of the text and add a negative margin to the second one so that they overlap to ensure that the first textview is on top of the second one we need to call bringtofront to avoid having the text with the same color as the background over the last line of the first one wow this is getting confusing

it was designed as an int just like the min max and value properties

26088633
hide	show
i d also like a loader from semantic ui to show before sending the request and hide when it is completed

26088634
put	get
any help on this situation would be appreciated also if you need to know or are just wondering why i want to make a if statement for a string its because whenever i try to put in a letter instead of a number java crashes i m hoping i could get this to alternatively solve the situation instead

when i mean it doesn t work properly i doesn t give me the max and min that i should be getting which 1.0 -1.0

26088740
int	chars
now when you are dereferencing unsigned int chars memory + i you are going to get the value at that memory address but you have given value to b only whose address is 2686636 .all other memory address have garbage values which you are printing

26088743
google-chrome	firefox
when i save and load the page in firefox or google-chrome the validation classes are not added validate-select required-entry validate-zip etc. the other classes are adding just fine

i see an onprogress when i inspect a form element on google-chrome and firefox both latest stable versions

26088901
multiplying	add
i understand what it does multiplying by x 3 and then add 1 if x is even and 2 if x is odd but son t quite see why one would resort to bitwise operations in this context

26088998
oncreate	setcontentview
remove the setcontentview in oncreate

26089116
division	multiplication
in theory three bit shifts are more efficient than a single multiplication and a single division

26089158
int	chars
i read couple posts about converting int to chars

26089158
int	chars
it s narrowing conversion since int has 4 byte while chars only has 2 bytes

d3.js	raphael
but when i try to add svg to it using a library such as raphael or d3.js the layout completely breaks

26089198
portrait	landscape
my program works as expected in both the android simulator and the desktop environment but when i run it on the ios simulator or a real device the main menu is drawn as if the phone were still in the portrait orientation and the just cropped to fit in a landscape view

26089198
portrait	landscape
i pretty sure that the problem has to do with landscape mode because everything works fine in portrait orientation

26089199
postgresql	mysql
i can not use select found_rows as this query must run under several dbms mysql mssql oracle postgresql sqlite sqlite3

26089213
int	chars
just converting the int value 5 to a chars creates a non-printable chars which is what you interpret as not working

26089219
punctuation	words
the only difference is that instead of words made up of the letters a..z+a.z separated by punctuation or spaces you are looking for word-pairs made up of the letters a..z+a..z+exactly_one_space similarly separated by punctuation or spaces

26089225
width	height
i am trying to get the width and height of the users monitor size

26089225

26089308
int	chars
z gzt9v and put all the numeric chars into a chars string to later convert into an int

26089338
google-chrome	safari
other better solutions would be to use eclipse + google-chrome remote debugger to debug android apps have never tried or xcode + safari to debug ios apps works fine

26089338
google-chrome	safari
also you could try weinre for both platforms but it is not as powerful as google-chrome safari

26089338
google-chrome	safari
weinre google-chrome and safari all of them require to compile the app install on the phone and connect the browser debugger to the running app via usb cable local wifi network for weinre as it runs under a local server in your local network

26089361
width	height
to make it half the screen size just put 2 after width and height like this

viewmodel	caliburn.micro
things get more advanced if you want to create your viewmodel first then the view as you ll need to look at something like caliburn.micro

26089495
button	checkbox
enable disable checkbox on button click

26089502
width	height
the short version though is that you need to anchor the edges content view to the parent scrollview and also set its height and width to match the parent scrollview

26089502
width	height
to affect the content size at the start or at a later time you can either use the layout constraints for that dimension either the width or height constraint or to my reading of the docs by implementing intrinsiccontentsize on the content view

26089502
width	height
i set the constraints to top right bottom left height and then set the width to twice the main scrollview width that was itself screen width

26089534
many-to-many	one-to-many
in my image model i have two relationships with my article model one many-to-many and one one-to-many

use double instead of int value

26089580
move	drag
user can drag some nodes if dragging a node all connected nodes graph should move accordingly as they are connected

26089586
int	chars
but running doctest and in ghci i get the error when putting in any test that has chars in addition to the int ie 54x

26089621
children	parent
parent can change its own state and change the child name but it will change the props for his children

26089654
getter	setter
in effect your model a model that delegates its setter and getter to other the blogslowdata and blogfastdata models i forgot the name of this pattern

26089655
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
button text position differs whether it in firefox google-chrome or opera ie

i understand is multiplication is division + is addition - is subtraction and finds the remainder

26089737
pull	push
there is two functions or mixins called push and pull

26089767
int	double
yes you must first convert it into an int double float etc in order to do a multiplication on such

26089787
backtracking	greedy
even if a greedy quantifier is used for the group the regex engine will backtracking to find the last ffd9 substring

26089822
hide	show
hide all elements and then show the current one

26089830
int	chars
with regard to the code under the comment first print them out raw -- he says that both the int array and number array are filled with 0s after the first chars since only one chars is specified for each array

26089859
hide	show
it would show but then it would not hide

26089904
gridview	formview
i m writing a data input page where i ve got a formview set to default to insert to handle the inserting and i have a gridview to view the data in the table and to allow editing

26089904
gridview	formview
the gridview s edit works perfectly however the formview is letting me down

26089918
int	boolean
this works as expected for any property path that resolves to a string but for int and less frequently for boolean the following error is generated in the case int32 property

26089956
inherited	properties
the d classes all inherited from a common abstract base class db but vary in their implementation both inherited and non-inherited properties methods are used by the c class

26089956
inherited	properties
ideally cb and db would remain abstract base classes because there are non-abstract properties and methods in each that i wish the c and d classes to inherited but they could be converted to interfaces if needed

26089982
put	get
when i put in binding.pry and check the params that are sent back after a successful payment i get these params

for-loop	loops
is it possible to do the for-loop in a vectorized way for loops are very slow on r it can become a problem if i have too many symbols

26090026
width	height
you can explicitly set your svg element s width and height to the same values as its parent container using clientwidth and clientheight

26090136
width	height
of course this approach would apply for your situation were you re using full body width and height but you could also use a div or whatever element with any size

26090147
min	max	range	min	range	max
first of all lets say the numbers are a x1 x2 x3 ... xn and they are in the range min xi max

26090176
portrait	landscape
i d like to display them side by side in landscape mode but one over the other in portrait mode

26090208
width	height
the problem is that you have not given the content view any width height constraints

26090208
width	height
this can be due to its subviews constraints pushing outward as it were or to its own width and height constraints

26090238
folder	directory
for your version it may be different but you want it in the lib folder under the example directory

26090256

or slightly improved avoid some of the addition in the latter part and just multiplying the total by 1.1 to have the original 100 and the tip 10 added together automatically

26090418

concave	convex
that said it looks to me like your original code is basically simulating a concave lens instead of convex

26090594
concave	angle
getting back to the concave lens though a concave lens is a reducing lens that shows a wide angle of picture from in front of the lens

26090611
mousemove	mouseout	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove
you re pretty close to the mark but you re not keeping track of which focus element you are updating in the mouseout mouseover and mousemove handlers

26090611
mousemove	mouseout	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove
basically what i ve done there is to modify the mouseover mouseout and mousemove so that it grabs the right focus element to be updated and then updates it

26090611
mouseover	mouseout
you ll see similar lines in the mouseover and mouseout handlers

26090616
integer	radix
since we sort on int indices the both times you can use some integer sorting like radix sort for an o n solution

uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
once someone taps the login uibarbuttonitem on the uinavigationbar then you have a view come up that is not contained in a uinavigationcontroller probably because it is a modal view that is outside the navigation flow of your app

26106590
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
at any rate you should be able to change the uinavigationbar for every view that is pushed on to the stack that is also contained in your uinavigationcontroller

i also know that the standard defines a couple of functions but they did not include any get or put functions like they did when they added in wchar.h in c99

26106671
put	get	post	get	post	put
if an endpoint is truly hidden any api calls to that endpoint whether they are get post put delete or whatever technically should return a 404 status code because it should not exist

26106671

width	height
once you know the actual width and height you call the following function in order to maintain aspect ratio

26107062
width	height
resize takes the actual width and height 320x480 etc which is the pixel value

26107107
hide	show
we also don t want them to show right away so hide them with display none

26107107
width	margin
since you are using fixed width navigation elements you can center your navigation with margin 0 auto

26107107
width	margin
using auto for margin left and right to center an element requires a width to be set

26107118
unicode	ucs
of course you can roll your own for conversions to from utf-8 since these conversions are 100 specified by the relevant rfcs ucs unicode standards but be careful most people implement them wrong and have dangerous bugs

26107124
children	parent
after some tests i decided to pass the parent as an argument to the constructor of the child widget and on the update function of the child to run a parent s function and check the string from there directly accessing the children gtkwidgets from the parent window

26107135
hide	show
wrap everything inside of a panel and then as you toggle the visibility on and off whatever is contained inside of the panel will show and hide as well

26107155
children	parent
however it is impossible to refer to the children from the parent in directives

26107159
width	height
i understand how to set spacing between views and width height for each view

26107159
width	height
i m a little unsure about dynamic height and width i m assuming that it s the margin-locks duty to adjust the weight appropriately

26107225
express	node.js
i am using node.js with express as backend and i have several object which have date type properties what happen is that when i post them to my webservices the date got converted to string

26107241
width	margin
if there is no width constraint the view will stretch if you have a left and right margin

26107286
listview	gridview
for instance a listview will show one size a gridview will show one size a slide show will show one size etc

26107295
comparator	comparable
there is no one generic way to compare objects thats why comparator and comparable were made in the first place

26107295
comparator	comparable
just make a class of w.e concept you want say a circle implement comparable and define comparator to define the criteria for how u compare that object

26107313
hide	show
infact this is probably bad because any real failures at other places will not show up in the jenkins logs if you hide stderr

26107342
express	node.js
redirect to different page url in node.js not in express or other frameworks

26107404

unsigned int memory + 1 unsigned chars memory + 1 sizeof unsigned int

26107408
getter	setter
i added the getter setter methods into the payment.rb file like so

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
while i realize the security implications of allowing the full local path to be disclosed i was curious if it was possible to override the fake path protection that other major browsers google-chrome firefox opera safari provide

26107790
integer	fractions
for the fractions part multiply it by 2 repeatedly and look at the integer part of the result

26107832
mouse	keyboard
the desired effect is for the table itself to get the keyboard focus so that it can give the same color change seen with the mouse hover and to allow the key to be the same as clicking on either of the links

26107878
do-while	goto
so i instead replaced the confusing do-while by a goto

width	height
it has the width 1 at the top the width 2m-1 at the bottom and a height of m

26108139
children	parent
child 2 and child 3 are lower than child 4 and child 9 -- because they are children of a later parent node

26108171
comparator	comparable
but somewhere in that code comparator comparable c is called to determin what is greater lesser than ill try to explain in a simplier algorithm

26108200
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
i am writing data with types as int chars double byte and boolean to and from files

as you can see ubuntu does recognise both node.js and express as installed on my system i think

26108207
express	node.js
and i got the nodeclipse-extension for eclipse but still eclipse doesn t seem to recognise either node.js or express see my image below

maven	m2e
if you like me are working with a recent version of subclipse you ll need the maven eclipse m2e scm connector for subclipse 1.10 svn 1.8 - update site thanks go to buluschek development see the last comments on that post so that you can choose the repository path from the check out as maven project dialog

26108297
children	parent
needs to be populated in two objects one for parent one for children and their hierarchical relationship maintained

26108297
children	parent
so that when a parent is selected children which are not underneath it are filtered out

26108298
children	parent
each instance of the children of your class will have their own parent data

26108298
children	parent
however if the parent reference was mutable and you initialized each of the children with the same reference then all three would see their private parent value change

26108326
google-chrome	firefox
this is not happening in google-chrome firefox or ie 10+

26108327
width	height
so the page1 element shrinks down to its minimum height and width

26108358
sorting	grouping
only one other change was made to the graph and that was the sorting in the category grouping so that the graph may pull data from different years

put	get
i put in the wrong number i get the error message and then instead of asking for the number again it moves on to the next get method

26108596
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
however you can write and read java objects to and from a file directly via the objectoutputstream and the objectinputstream classes

26108603
google-chrome	firefox
by failing to set a favicon image but having the empty tag google-chrome and firefox but not ie in my case however - reading around the internet the characteristics of each browser has varied the browser loaded the page twice looking for it

26108618
swift	objective-c
i want to start a new project but i don t know whether i should start with objective-c or swift

26108618
swift	objective-c
i see that i can mix swift and objective-c in the same project

26108660
mouseover	mousedown
by listening to the mousedown and mouseover events and adding line elements to the svg this works perfectly on the desktop

26108691
swift	objective-c
it s very easy to add swift on top of objective-c

26108691
swift	objective-c
a great place to learn more is the integrating swift with objective-c wwdc talk

26108691
swift	objective-c
you add the objective-c classes you want swift to be able to see to a bridging header

26108691
swift	objective-c
swift classes are automatically available to objective-c code

26108691
swift	objective-c
a file is either swift or objective-c

26108691
swift	objective-c
i believe the closest you could come to having a mixed class is by writing extensions in swift for the objective-c class but i haven t tried that

26108704
swift	objective-c
just like you can extend classes in objective-c you can extend classes with swift as well

26108704
swift	objective-c
you can write a swift extension for an objective-c class and it works just fine

26108708
inherited	properties
it sounds like you re trying to inherited from uiviewcontroller which has neither a drawrect method nor a bounds properties

26108725
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
use java s built in serialization utilites as objectoutputstream and objectinputstream only works on primitive types and objects that implement java.io.serializable

26108746
implements	extends
in order to do that the authentication wrapper extends slim middleware and thus implements the call method like this simplified

26108767
firefox	safari
tested on firefox safari and ie9

26108785
getter	setter
as a side note if you need to access stuff from your service class and you don t want to handle it through setter getter variables and such like you can make a custom event and pass all the necessary information there

26108817
octal	binary
it s a number converter for octal - binary and binary - octal

26108817
octal	binary
for example . conv octal binary 11 would yield octal 3

mysql and postgresql databases

26109044
pull	push
what i would do is to pull from the github repo make a shared private repo on some hosting that allows it for free like bitbucket and push it to there for your collaborators to share

26109044
pull	push
when you wish you can pull the latest from your private bitbucket repo merge them to code from github repo and push it there

26109044
pull	push
if the company wants to work through pull requests and review your changes before merging you could fork the company repo and push the merged changes there

26109138
public	protected
as long as you have protected or public property in the parent you can access it from derived classes

websphere	ibm
unsupported - you can modify something image css in the admin application for example top banner image called banner-swoosh.png located in c ibm websphere appserver85 systemapps isclite.ear isclite.war images - remember to clear browser cache to see modifications and that it will be replaced by any fixpack you will apply

26109246
min	max
when you are evaluating a min level the min player will always choose the path with the lowest score for the max player

26109246
min	max
note both the min and max levels can be implemented with the same code if you evaluate every node from the perspective of the player making the move in that round and convert scores between levels

26109284
apache	nginx
it can be fixed the following way then examples for nginx and apache

26109340
toolbar	tabs
based on your window.open parameters most browsers will decide to open it in a new window which makes sense since you have provided parameters to turn off certain ui elements toolbar location menu bar etc. that are usually present by default for all tabs and usually it is not possible to turn off those elements only for a single tab

26109393
post	get
but for liking a post it is necessary to display information like this example john liked this on your app name which appears on the news feed and stuff so to have a like button working properly you ll need to set up an app first and then when you create a like button on developers.facebook.com you ll get a code that you will need to insert on your header that looks like this and it comes already with your app id inserted in the code

26109416
inherited	properties
extending a component will cause the child to inherited the parent s properties

26109417
versioning	upgrade
check your versioning of the plugin maybe you just need to upgrade

26109429
woocommerce	shortcode
woocommerce adds the cart using shortcode

26109454
versioning	upgrade
same problem here illegalstateexception occured unsupported cookie spec default not even on play framework nor heroku but in a classic java web app mifos open source microfinance platform and solved for us by an upgrade of the rest-assured test framework from v1.7.2 to latest v2.3.3 and probably some of its implicit transitive dependencies which may be the root cause more so than rest-assured itself perhaps the change from org.apache.httpcomponents httpclient from v4.2.3 to currently latest v4.3.5 - clearly some versioning mismatch is the root cause of this one

26109459
int	double
i see slug and battingavg are already double s but you re assigning the result of an int division to them

26109506
int	double
when you divide int values and store the result in a double that is a widening conversion but the value was calculate as an int and thus you re widening the int value

26109583
ghost4j	tess4j
there are java wrappers for both of these ghost4j and tess4j

26109616
google-chrome	firefox
today i tried using google-chrome instead of firefox it worked

26109665
put	get
you instantiate an net_scp object by passing it a net_ssh2 or net_ssh1 object in the constructor and can then use the get and put methods to download or upload files via scp

26109699
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it looks like this which is how it s supposed to look

26109722

try-catch	exception-handling
a try-catch block isn t catching anything as they re errors rather than exception-handling

26109902
multiplying	modulo	multiplying	add
if you want the length m of the most common substring to be an input parameter then you can hash all substrings of length m in linear time using hashing with multiply-and-add where you multiplying the previous string hash value by a constant and then add the value for the next least significant value in the string and take the modulo modulo a primes p

26109902
primes	modulus
if you pick your modulus p for the computed string integers to be a randomly chosen primes p such that you can store o p memory then this will do the trick in linear time if you assume that your hashing has no collisions

26109959
centos	linux
let s say i m looking for similar versions of centos linux distributions on a range of 100 servers

26109959
centos	linux
the centos linux version numbers are something like 5.6 5.7 6.5

26109978
atom-editor	sublimetext
an easy way to avoid problems like this in the future is to use a text editor like brackets atom-editor or sublimetext each of which will show you whether or not your opening tags are associated with a closing tag

26110051
int	double
you could also cast your int s to double and calculate your traparea as so

26110116
versioning	upgrade
you might want to upgrade to the latest versioning

26110138
folder	directory
if i use pwd i would get the current directory of the folder i am executing the command from and not the folder of the file i am executing which is what i need

26110145
mp4	webm
finally you will update the src for your mp4 and webm sources so they reference the new random src

26110148
fadein	fadeout
you are applying the fadein and fadeout to all the span s in the .more-projects-gallery-img-container hence hover state is activated for all

26110173
maven	pom.xml
if you are using maven you can add the maven coordinates to your pom.xml

26110173
ant	maven
if you are using a version that has not been published to the central maven repositories you can download the source tarball and navigate to the lib java directory and build it with ant by typing

26110189
for-loop	arrays
for-loop with arrays sample is some thing like this

26110197
subtract	add
add or subtract if the number is negative 0.5 so the next step rounds to the nearest cent

getter	setter
so right now my businessidlist seen is above code for form options items attribute is a list of business objects and the business objects have private variables businessname and businessid with getter and setter

26110265
uiview	uiwindow
as to why you would be adding uiview to a uiwindow i do this for alerts that i want to display on top of everything else regardless of current view hierarchy

26110276
width	margin
give your containing div a fixed width set display to block and set left and right margin to auto like this

26110288
box-sizing	border-box
you just need to make the other browsers act the same as ie 8 and put in box-sizing border-box

26110336
int	double	width	height
the way martin r does works well but later i found that there are no reasons to bother to use cgfloat - you can just use cgrect instead of cgrectmake in swift on which you can specify the argument as int as well as double or cgfloat to all the x y width and height properties as long as all the four properties are of the same type

26110353
ubuntu	linux
i have mingw installed on my windows 8.1 machine and i m using it to develop c++ code that can be ported to unix linux systems in lieu of being able to dual-boot ubuntu or similar

post	get
if i get request to page-id feed with my user access token i m shown all published post fine

26110503

26110572
width	height
with a fixed height and evenly spreading the width ie

26110575
post	get
i get filenames with 0picturenamehere.jpg instead of nabrams.jpg or if using post data to set the directory i will never get the image or data in this way

26110619
subtract	add
i have a method here that will either add or subtract the location to get to the set location that a person needs to get to if the box needs to move to the left it works great but if it needs to move to the right it doesn t seem to work i know there is a problem with it i just can t figure it out

26110641
int	chars
i know that if i make degree_type c it won t compile because i can t turn an int into a chars

26110685
wildfly	jboss
jsf jboss - 2.2.6 as wildfly 8.1.0 deltaspike 1.0.3

26110715

yes you can use a while loops instead of a for-loop

26110728
folder	directory
the following contact_me.php file is in a mail folder in the root directory left the client email in so no one would think that was the missing link --

26110750
inherited	properties
the opacity properties is not suited for this kind of problem because it s automatically inherited by children elements

the easiest way is to declare the appbar on pages that you want to show it and to leave it out on pages that you don t want it but you should be able to hide it by disabling the appbar on pages that you don t want it on

also it offers a way to hide show elements even images at certain screen width s using it s responsive utilities

26111736

you then have an integer part between 0 and 16777215 and a fractions part which is between 0 and 255

26111837
integer	fractions
0xiiiiiiff where i is the integer part f is the fractions part

26111837
integer	fractions
that means our fractions part is nonzero but our integer part is filled completely with zeros

26111837
integer	fractions
fortunately in your case the integer part is not important so you ll have a lot of room for the fractions part

26111837
integer	fractions
ok but since you re supplying only the fractions parts and the integer part is always zero anyway you should be able to just toss the integer part

26111837

marionette	underscore.js
if you want to load external underscore.js template files instead then you can safely omit marionette.templatecache.prototype.compiletemplate so that marionette will use underscore.js template which is the default

why are you using dynamic.if you write dynamic properties then you have to write setter and getter methods for the properties.i think if you dont define your getter and setter properties compiler will result in crash or will give errors and do not compile

i have a for-loop nested inside a do-while loops which is to read through a text file and look for the given input

26122683
put	get
if you want to convert from a double to bigdecimal and not get all the extra digits one way to do it is to put the double into a string and then convert that to bigdecimal which will prevent all the extra digits coming over from the exact binary representation of the double

26122749
super	extends
you need to read the jsp specification particularly section jsp.11.2.4 which sets out a number of requirements for the super class you use with extends and none of which are met by the super class in your question

26122812

int	double
i can use strings instead of double in arraylist and then add up the numbers but my problem is that i need to store n elements which can exceed the range of int

the prod environment with the debugging mod to see the errors but you don t have access to the profiling to see the logs

26123456
for-loop	arrays
you should create an global arrays of the websites in init which is only called once and then you can write a for-loop to open each of the websites in the arrays

26123502
folder	directory
the reason that it works for your unit tests inside the ide is that all source folder get compiled into one directory and that is added to your classpath along with the jars ggts picks up from the project dependencies

26123526
width	height
if i open the links from the network tab like bbox 11.55578125 46.864296875 11.558671875 46.8671875 layers orthophoto_tirol_05m width 256 height 256 service wms version 1.1.1 request getmap styles srs epsg 3a4326 i get a blank screen

26123533
put	get
i would make sure to have views of the active records of each table and make sure devs only use the view unless they actually need the soft deleted records and don t have bugs caused by forgetting to put in a where clause to get only active ones

26123575

26123593
post	get
after looking at some similar so post such as this and this i manage to get the response in format of string

26123607
getter	setter
using a getter setter should do the trick

26123655
button	checkbox
issue with this piece of code is that it worked when checking the checkbox then clicking a submit button that would alert the list of values

26123689
hash	md5

26123714
google-chrome	firefox
our official supported browsers are firefox google-chrome and certain versions of ie

26123714
google-chrome	firefox
microsoft provides an official firefox plugin the microsoft .net framework assistant but nothing for google-chrome

26123731
jar	war
other jars will not be included in an archive like what happens for a war but will be searched in the classpath as required the entity classes including in the jar created by the other project are not scanned by default

26123737
getter	setter
the type emitted by entityfactory is actually a sub-class of sampleentity which overrides the setter getter automatically implementing inotifypropertychanged and keeping track of when each property was last modified among other things

26123740
centos	linux
however i have yet to find any approach in linux specially red hat enterprise linux or centos distroes

26123807

26123866
equals	tostring	tostring	getter	getter	setter
when you are implementing data pojo in java you should set the variable it hold add getter and setter for them implement hashcode and equals and probably implement tostring

26123875
exponent	modulo
the problem is that i have modulo and exponent and so i must to do this

26123886
super	implements
because somebody might remove the implements interface from the super class

26123923
rspec	capybara
i am using rspec 3 and capybara to run some rspec tests and i need to stub out method calls to return true false based on certain tests

26123923
put	get
for example when i put a pry in landing_page_controller i get the following

26123970
ng-show	ng-hide
fairly simple you can use ng-hide and ng-show along with an isediting flag

26123985
bower	npm
i want to use bootstrap and socket.io in my ember-cli app but only bootstrap has a ember-cli- npm package so i have to use the bower package for socket.io which is socket.io-client

26123990
post	get
for example if i am post the data like k s - i will get only k not posted data like k s

26124000
text-align	height
give the html body height of 100 get the footer out of the container remove position absolute remove floats from the div-children and add display inline-block to them and give them widths of 28 or remove whitespaces between them or otherwise you should use text-align center for container...but that s another story

26124033
for-loop	arrays
using a for-loop like just populates the hash with the last value in the arrays

26124043
google-chrome	firefox
this work in google-chrome and firefox but in ie it still try to download the page as a file

26124064
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
even if i login and try to open home page in another tab of the same browser google-chrome firefox ie safari i get redirected to login page

26124137
post	get
forget all i said about the forms and the structure of the document although it could be useful eventually as i don t know how reliable is that get and post

26124148
for-loop	loops
so i changed the for-loop into a while loops like so

26124193
children	parent
this will let you easily find a parent node and assign it children nodes as they re created

26124215
python-daemon	daemons
the python-daemon library which is the reference implementation for pep 3143 standard daemons process library handles this by using a file lock via the lockfile library on the pid file you pass to the daemoncontext object

26124231
implements	extends
you could extends timertask and implements the functionality you are looking for

26124310
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and ie this functions provides the correct results but in google-chrome the getelementsbytagname method returns no result when passing a tagname with namespace included

26124357
ienumerable	ilist
at the controller i had to assure that a ilist is being returned rather than a ienumerable

26124357
ienumerable	ilist
at the view i had to change the signature like 1. ilist instead of ienumerable

26124390
post	get
i had 2 instances of ckeditor and an ajax post to get the data so my workaround was

26124455
codeigniter	cakephp
a php equivalent to rails might be cakephp codeigniter but again those are app frameworks and don t have any of the pre built bells and whistles as any cms

26124462
put	get
but when i put this into excel and try and run it i get this error

26124534
pull	push
this works great since my team can just pull push merge the code easily

26124575
put	get
i also put my script physically in a different folder but after deployment for first few requests i get 404 on the scripts

26124595
spotify	last.fm
some people use last.fm api that can give you this information if you scrobble to last.fm from spotify or any music player

26124637
decltype	auto
decltype auto

26124637
decltype	auto
the paragraph i quoted is from a standard draft post c++11 so decltype auto doesn t apply to c++11

26124685
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox google-chrome will extend it in a single line

26124706
superclass	subclassing
in order to test if something shows up i also did a reference from the tableviewcontroller on my storyboard to the superclass papphototimelineviewcontrollers which is a subclassing of pfquerytableviewcontroller and it worked fine

26124733
int	chars
you are indexing your with the chars instance within your fast-enumeration which gets boxed as int and could very well throw an arrayindexoutofboundsexception if the int value of your chars was a part from the fact that it s not the index you want

26124734
for-loop	arrays
it is not suitable when you need to modify the arrays because for that you need know to the element s index in the arrays so you should use a traditional for-loop instead

26124759
filtering	grouping
assuming the firstname and lastname are uniquely indexed an alternative to grouping by is to sort using a left join to filtering the result set

26124774
bmp	png
i just tested it it converts many formats to pvr bmp and png included

26124774
disk	ram
pvr is generally fat on disk fast to load and equivalent to other formats in ram .

26124803
getter	setter
i wrote a handler which should set the getter and setter delegates for the computedfield but when get to the driver to update the model these delegates are null so i get a nullreferenceexception

26124803
put	get
i put a breakpoint on the handler to see when it get s called

26124803
getter	setter
at this point the driver gets called on the item which has the property value i set in step 1 but the computedfield s getter and setter are null so the exception occurs and the update fails

26124806
int	chars
you are forgetting that output is a chars not an int

26124827
ready	each
i d also be ok installing all the configuration files as let s say conffile.cfg.sample and only the first time the software is installed copy each of the samples to a cfg ready to be used rather than rely on the user to do so either way this requires some conditional install behaviour

26124852
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari the content appears to always be trimmed down to 524kb though it works in firefox

26124910
google-chrome	safari
this is definitely not a google-chrome specific thing the same behavior is exhibited on safari

26124924
versioning	upgrade
staying only as updated as the available client versioning ensures crashes don t happen while providing you with the upgrade

26124999
children	parent
if it does you will get very weird behavior since the failed child will begin to spawn all of the remaining children concurrently with the parent

26125019
post	get
i am trying to preforme get request with the specific post id by clickign the radio

26125028
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine using firefox and google-chrome the link shows up as text in my idataobject structure

26125055
googletest	cunit
you should have put your testing code in different files even better using proper testing frameworks like googletest or cunit

26125090
width	height
and make sure you re passing the new width height calculations to it

26125106
sorting	filtering
or taking a leaf out of friedi s book taking advantage of sorting the array first but using reduce instead of filtering which is slightly simpler because it means we do not need a iife to close around a previous item

26125333
width	height
when i check the output img using leptonica it is telling me the width is some large number which seems to vary each time i run the function eg 149996048 and the height remains correct at the same value as input image

26125355
pwd	chdir
this just baffles me because chdir was successful and when i type pwd i am in root public

26125363
folder	directory
in the same time qfilesystemmodel is asychronised so after you choose a folder then expand the directory you will find the sub-folder were not choosen

26125393
radio-button	checkbox
i have the following problem i have a select-box with 3 values a radio-button group and a checkbox

26125393
radio-button	checkbox
my intention is to check and disable the checkbox in case of the third value in the selectbox is selected or the certain second radio-button is checked

26125411
xstream	dom4j	xstream	jdom	jdom	dom4j
what you are trying to do is much more easily accomplished using something like xstream or even dom parsing jdom or dom4j

26125444
onfocus	onblur
the solution was to intercept the client side oncellselecting grid event along with the onfocus onblur radnumerictextbox events

26125481
post	get
the get post routes share the same actual url so change that line to this

26125494
free	malloc
the total heap usage cannot be zero -- there are many many calls to malloc and free throughout the application

26125494
free	malloc
the above sounds exactly like my problem so i checked to see that it s dynamically linked to the c libraries that contained malloc and free

26125494
toolchain	ldd
i used the uclibc toolchain s custom ldd executable i can t use the native linux ldd and the output included the following lines

26125494
free	malloc
the mips target device doesn t have an ldd executable. based on my understanding malloc and free will be in one of these libraries and they seem to be dynamically linked

26125494
free	malloc
i also did readelf and nm on the executable to confirm that the references to malloc and free are undefined which is characteristic of a dynamically linked executable

26125506
button	checkbox
the problem is that you are managing the visibility on button press which should instead be done on checking the checkbox

26125519
next	except
from that place find next one that is the closest except

26125560
itunes	iphoto
for eg if a notes itunes safari iphoto etc applications are running in mac i need to show them arranged in a grid in a dialog box

26125573
pull	push
except that i develop on one machine and when i m ready i push pull to a different machine

26125591
postgresql	mysql
i think that would work in mysql but i m unsure how do do that in postgresql

26125608
min	max
i succeeded saving picture with exposure compensation programmatically set at min or max level but i would like to be able to adjust before taking a picture

26125619
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have a django app that is using rest_framework and i can get post put etc. to it as expected

26125652
pull	push
the script checks only if there s a line matching in your repository s .hg hgrc file which should generally exist in the section if you push to pull from bitbucket

26125721
public	protected
it must be public or protected not private

26125738
profiling	instrumentation
without more data it would be mere speculation to say anything so i recommend you use instrumentation with the time profiling to see exactly what happens at startup and where the time goes

26125746
for-loop	arrays
here i made a 2d arrays and iterated through it using a basic nested for-loop but want to use pointers

26125760
post	get
if you use the resty gwt api you could just write your interface map the methods using jax-rs annotations like post get delete pathparam etc

26125818
ring	hiccup
i realize that this isn t correct as logged-in returns hiccup html and i believe that the ring response map isn t added on until after the route is fully evaluated

26125829
versioning	upgrade
i had a previous versioning of os x server set up and running fine but when i installed the upgrade to 3.2.1 i found that none of my bots would work correctly

26125840
post	put
in the post table i have the post_image column where i want to put all the values from the articles table with the matching article id

26125893
button	checkbox
i would recommend making a separate function that checks whether to make the checkbox selected and or disabled or not and calling that function on the change events of the radio button and the select like so

26125902
width	height
if you don t give it a height or width but do give it a top right bottom and left positions then the element s size is automatically 100 of its bounds

26125906
profiling	debugging
we have tried chrome profiling to debugging the issue memory build up is happening on change of route and we are able to see all the elements from previous screen as detached elements in the heap snapshot

26125910
int	boolean
i know that s work with constructor but imagine that i have method void setmyfoo int i boolean b

26125923

put	get
the behaviour i get once i put the p in .stretch first wrap then shrink

26125971
pop-up	dialog
now when i am constructing class a a dialog box pop-up and asks me to fill out a name string a int color and assign an instance of class from a spinner b that was created and stored in an arraylist

26125973
polymorphism	specialization
it follows quite naturally from the fact that can be used in function templates and class template partial specialization where t is a template parameter and also from the fact that polymorphism lambdas allow auto as a function parameter type which is shorthand for a function template with deduced parameters

draggable	droppable
so i just updated a client from fullcalendar like 1.6.4 to the latest 2.1.1 and the problem is jquery ui integration was removed from fullcalendar and i have some custom code to drag events from fullcalendar to an outside droppable div which worked in the old version because events where initiated as jquery ui draggable i guess but with the latest version dragged elements aren t recognized by the jquery ui droppable div as valid draggable droppable elements

26127451
draggable	droppable
now i can get around this somewhat by loading jquery ui draggable and calling now the droppable div will be recognize by the droppable div as an acceptable droppable item but now dragging and dropping events on the calendar gets messed up because if we go to move an event from say one day to another then the event eventdrop should fire but instead since the events are initialized with jquery ui draggable and the calendar also accepts jquery ui draggable elements the drop event is fired instead

post	get
working my way through the net http docs i ve managed to write a function that calls the parsemultipartform method on the request and then interrogates the multipartform field for the file data but i seem to be stuck on how to get the content type of the individual files uploaded as part of the post request -- all the contenttype related references in the source of request.go seem to be related to getting the multipart form encoding and when i printf-dump the uploaded file information i don t seem to see any types fields or map keys that look content type related

26131049
accessor	properties
but a number may still overflow decimal giving an invalid cast exception if you try any of the reader s .net type accessor getvalue getvalues in which case you have to use the reader s odp.net type accessor getproviderspecificvalue which gives you an oracledecimal and if it overflows a decimal its value properties will give you an overflow exception and your only recourse is to coerce it into a lesser type with one of oracledecimal s toxxx methods

26131066
swift	objective-c
but the objective-c swift dance is causing me some conceptual challenges

26131104
int	chars
i d recommend stripping the newline chars and int converting

folder	directory
i can t think of a super easy way of doing that except for counting the .. strings and if there are more of those than there are folder i am above my root directory

26131361
post	get
you should use auth to ensure people don t mess with your private apis - otherwise people could trace what kind of post or get requests you re sending anyway - auth is always a good idea rather than trying to keep your apis secret

26131373
width	height
just adding the method i am using to return screen width and height for further information on what i am doing

gruntjs	yeoman
so if you re using yeoman run gruntjs build to create a separate production ready version of your app in dist that won t require you to upload the bower components directory

26131841
google-chrome	firefox
in addition to what gas suggests another option might be to use a browser plugin like stylish for firefox google-chrome to apply a custom style for each environment

26131842
stdout	stderr
any diagnostic messages including debug mode notifications and fancy progress bars should go to stderr while all the interactions be it user or another program should go on stdout

26131842
stdout	stderr
also stderr is normally connected to a terminal while stdout may be part of a shell pipe thus invisible

26131842

and there is no way to connect stderr to next program separately from stdout

26131873
hash	salt
compute the salt hash and send back

allocator	stl
implementing a useful allocator that supplies the full interface required by the stl without just disguising the default std allocator is not as trivial

26132207
allocator	stl
the stl still does fun things with templates such as rebind and traits to homogenize allocator interfaces and tracking

26132216

basically the margin auto causes the browser to resolve the conflicting height properties 100 given by top 0

26132280
min	max	range	min	range	max
convert your input roman numerals to integers using romannumeral.parsestring from the linked code compute the min and max values to get the range then use makeromannumeral in the linked code to convert the range values back to roman nums

i want the body to be the parent of only a single wrapper element which will contain all of the previous children of the body

26132364

wordpress	joomla
considering the public-facing side is wordpress based and doesn t accept joomla browser commands fortunately it just goes to the main site

26132567
put	get
the way to fix this is to put print statements every where you think you are assigning values to temp_num_str and find out where it does not get the value you expect then fix up all the problems that this uncovers

26132574
put	get
the big goal is to just print out the variables that are available in the twig form template views form fields.html.twig so that i can find out which variables are available and in particular put a condition in the based on the field type which supposedly exists but for some reason is not accessible and other suggestions to get the type are warned against

26132588
put	get
and like zero21xxx says put your gulp modules in your normal dependencies list in package.json not in the devdependencies which get overlooked by the buildpack which runs npm install --production

i m developing an app in unity3d using the ngui plguin that requires me to build in custom google maps like behavior

26132636

all i have to do is change its width and height and the text will be always in the middle

26132662
put	get
if you don t trust them at all you could get new developers or put the facade in a separate assembly so the client code doesn t have direct access to the external library

26132716
ready	each
when i m ready to push them to production i ve got to go through each file that i ve modified or created and bring them to the production domain

26132740
shim	polyfills
note that the reason the second won t work in ie 8 is that it will not allow passing of host objets to builtâ in methods as this you can t fix that with a polyfills shim monkey patch or whatever

26132869
ord	chr
use the ord and chr functions to get the subsequent character

26132881
implements	extends
in your example you need to keep in mind that while tat is really an instance of p it has the interface defined by a assuming that p extends or implements a otherwise this wouldn t work

26132890
post	put
the only thing i could think of is for the server to only accept post requests that way the client doesn t need to put the token in the link

26132932

26133084
int	chars
48 has to be subtracted because an int value changing to chars goes through an ascii conversion

26133093
nsstring	nsdata	nsstring	nsjsonserialization	nsdata	nsjsonserialization
and to convert the nsstring to nsdata to feed through nsjsonserialization again you need to first use datawithencoding nsutf8stringencoding

26133302
mouse	keyboard
your kvm switch is based on keyboard mouse emulation technology which having problems with many wireless keyboard and mouse

26133309
int	chars
the reason you use int when reading chars with getchar is because the eof constant is an int and it is not guaranteed to represent a valid chars value

26133323
int	chars
in c a chars is really just an int of a certain size and an int can be implicitly converted into one so it works transparently

26133356
int	chars
edit i would also suggest we follow user3125367 s suggestion in the comment above which eliminates some sneaky casting from int to chars

26133371
int	chars
when you compare a chars and an int in c such as in your switch statement the compiler will automatically cast the chars to type int

26133371
int	chars
rather the chars in the case statements are all cast to be int so they match the type of ch

26133450
google-chrome	firefox
i received an error on firefox and google-chrome browser

int	chars
a chars is actually just a small int number think chars code and if you use the + operator with them it ll add the numbers together

box-sizing	border-box
look at the base styles and the global box-sizing border-box

26133783
box-sizing	border-box
either you change all your css to work with box-sizing border-box google it or you put that on the before after and element on all the bootstrap css that you need for forms buttons and the dropdown they work together

26133797
children	parent
or if all these items are children of 1 parent and there are no other elements between them then use the nth-child selector

26133802
inherited	properties
angular has the angular.foreach convenience method which specifically notes it does not iterate over inherited properties

26133808
client-side	server-side
originally i thought i could do this with a url variable however as javascript runs client-side and php is server-side there is no way to verify whether the window is a javascript window especially given the possibility that someone returned on a favorite or bookmark

26133808
post	put
which tells me how to put a post in a javascript with this code

26133819

versioning	upgrade
else upgrade your validation js with latest versioning

26134028

the second part of the problem is to read over the first file and create a second file that contains some statistics such as the sum of all integers in the file their average min and max values and my main issue the sum of all integers in each line

26134055
free	malloc
the key point to remember is there needs to be a free for every malloc

26134063
jndi	jta
all java ee as come with a jta transaction manager and their transaction engine manages transaction binding and transaction resolving like the usertransaction jndi context

26134063
atomikos	bitronix
you can use bitronix or atomikos and you need to set both the usertransaction and the transactionsyncronizationregistry in tomcat context.xml

26134114
submit	submission
before submission the form i want the ajax to send the same value to the other form in the same page and click submit

26134197
range	max
finally multiply the cosine product with 0.03 to move the pixels at max in the range -0.03 0.03 because moving pixels in -1 1 range will look weird

26134226
ubuntu	centos
this code working in ubuntu windows os but not working in centos

26134233
allocator	stl
that said dynamic memory allocator stl and exceptions are probably perfectly fine for smaller personal projects games but keep in mind what will be necessary for large high performance real-time games

26134250
swift	objective-c

26134305
hash	md5
i am trying to use an api that requires an md5 hash to be sent in utf-8 format

26134313
versioning	upgrade
but since the .net could upgrade to a newer versioning and overwrite gac we would need to be careful that the newer versioning would not have same problem

26134314
post	put
so one of the post asked to put the below dependencies as well i dont understand why i have to provide it if spring needed them why its not packaged with it

26134367
put	get
get methodical and put some logging in perhaps

26134443
spaces	delimiter
scan.next will simply read the next word more specifically a token as it uses spaces as a delimiter by default

26134445
hide	show
therefore it is not possible to properly control tooltips for disabled elements since we need to listen to events to determine when to show and hide the tooltip

you can use seaborn which is a wrapper around matplotlib that makes it look prettier by default rather opinion-based i know p but also adds some plotting functions

26139658
seaborn	matplotlib
if you don t want to use seaborn then you can use pandas.groupby to get the colors alone and then plot them using just matplotlib but you ll have to manually assign colors as you go i ve added an example below

26139658
dictionary	map
to select a color i ve created a colors dictionary which can map the diamond color for instance d to a real color for instance red

26139672

26140522
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are much faster

26140522
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are immune and show no slowdown or so little slowdown that it s unnoticeable

26140525
prepare	execute
technically the question is if you prepare the computer beforehand for this task or not and also how strictly you define a piece of code as two programs can yield the same execute instruction sequence due to branches

26140575
google-chrome	firefox
all works in google-chrome and firefox and i do not know why the application does not work on ie9

26140605

i am interested to learn about the time complexity for multiplying large integers modulo a large constant using multiple processors

26140678
division	multiplication
what this boils down to is basically just integer multiplication since division and remainder can also be implemented using multiplication reciprocal multiplication or barrett reduction

26140705
free	malloc
i would suggest using malloc and free and cleverly copying the data using mempcy

26140715

26140849
hide	show
this works properly also with different keyboard sizes standard emotion and any custom keyboard and also when you show or hide with your finger the accessory view provided by the default ios8 keyboard

26140865
hide	show
to make this work properly you need to create a custom table view cell with a maximum amount of images buttons pre-rendered and hide the ones you don t need to show

26140865
hide	show
do not add remove subviews while reusing the table view cell hide and show them instead it s much faster

hide	show
when i deselect all columns + button hide no columns in table pops in and user is unable to show any column

26141263
int	chars
i think the problem with your code is that you assume each next chars is an int

26141263
spaces	delimiter
which is not the case as you have spaces as delimiter

26141263
spaces	delimiter
then use a stringtokenizer to cut all integers apart from eachother by specifying the delimiter spaces in your case

26141267
button	checkbox
strange if i touch the button or checkbox i see that the background changes button_up button_down even so the listener doesn t work well

i m looking for clever ways of presenting a uiviewcontroller before a uitabbarcontroller without embedding both of them in a uinavigationcontroller

26141845
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i currently have the setup i want to avoid uinavigationcontroller - uitabbarcontroller because it works and makes sense

26141858
google-chrome	firefox
it s included in both google-chrome and firefox

26141889
portrait	landscape
the following code works just fine under ios 6 and ios 7 but on ios 8 it presents the media picker in landscape mode but a vertical gradient line appears along the right side of the picker where the portrait version would have its right edge

26141902
jobs	cron
finally if you want to run jobs in automatic fashion research cron tasks

26141902
jobs	cron
then again nothing prevents you from creating both admin panel and cron jobs that execute the same code

26141902
jobs	cron
other than through ssh there are no ways to execute the script outside www folder except for cron jobs

26141908

in get view method put condition like

26142037
int	double
i m trying to check if a double variable p is approximately equal to an int

26142039
spaces	delimiter
the problem is that your path contains spaces characters between c program and files microsoft and powershell uses this as a delimiter between parameters

26142061
mouseover	mouseout
the mouseup-handler is hidden by the mouseover - and mouseout -events the first attaches it and the latter removes it

26142061
mouseover	mouseup	mouseover	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
a natural click on an element always triggers four events in given order mouseover mousedown mouseup and click

26142061
mouseup	mousedown
to simulate a natural behaviour mousedown and mouseup are delayed

26142152
copying	overwrite
keys are not going to be overwrite for that delete the key before copying or flush the whole database before starting

26142187
daemon	cron

of course this attribute has setter getter

26142392
ddms	adb
i ve faced the same situation today started emulator from avd manager and after start it appeared offline in ddms resetting adb didn t help - it attempted to start several times and resulted the same way with offline status

26142394

the prepare statements through data binding execute faster

26142474
min	max
i have seen a class where someone named member variables min and max

26142475
submit	submission
the problem is that you are submission form over and over again try this check if form has already been submited and if not submit a form otherwise skip submission

26142507
highcharts	highstock
highstock contains highcharts

26142589
post	get
is it because it is a post that takes me from one page to the other and the datas get lost

26142695
post	get
but not via post via get instead

26142695
post	get
to overcome this allow both get and post to this route

26142695
post	get
small change as the method handles both get and post change the name of the method to requestpaybooking

26142734
jobs	cron
i have used cron jobs + wget curl to call php scripts in the past and the only benefit that i can see you getting from doing that would be a consistent language and consistent environment definition

26142762
width	height
prior to that i was only using regular width and height

26142774
for-loop	loops
if you have null spaces in cells with no pieces you get to write additional logic within the for-loop but ultimately once you complete the traversal of the two for loops you can assume they re equal

26142777
folder	directory
it will work if the header is in a files folder in the same directory as the current source

26142790
post	get
post can be get by

26142790
post	get
this is the simple code to get all the post

26142826
for-loop	loops
step 1 when the for-loop is encountered initially the first section of the 3 code sections inside the for-loop is run and if you declare a variable here it s scope is only within loops

26142826
for-loop	loops
step 3 the code within the for-loop is executed with the variable int this counter available if needed within loops in your case i don t think you need the variable in loops just to enforce 4 iterations

26142938
min	max
define nominmax before you include the windows header files to avoid the min and max macros from being defined

26142949
glfw	glew
i ve been working on a 3d game using c++ opengl alongside glfw glew boost

26142991
vcard	mime
to store a business card vcard using this mime type was enough

26143010
matlab	simulink
this is matlab simulink r2007a

26143130
inherited	properties
they show this in different ways and they may use different fonts there but the principle is the same there is a declaration for the font-family properties of the element in some style sheet hence that properties cannot be inherited unless you explicitly set the value inherited on it of course

26143146
width	height
drawing functions such as cv rectangle however are in image coordinates 0 0 is the top left x along image width matrix columns y along image height matrix rows

26143158
int	chars
i am aware that d prints decimal int and not chars and also that i am passing a signed chars pointer as a second argument

26143184
sudo	passwd
the host have a user deploy with passwd deploy which one i can connect ssh and make whatever with source.list using sudo

26143236
maven	m2e
make sure your eclipse has the maven integration features plugins installed aka m2e see

26143248
int	chars
also see the comment by blue moon the error message talking about pointer types indicates scanf not printf and a wrong length modifier in scanf is downright lethal writing sizeof int bytes to a place that can take only sizeof signed chars ...

26143259
boost	eigen
i am working on a generic piece of c++11 code that is supposed to work with boost multi_array eigen matrix and possibly other types of n-dimensional arrays

26143259
boost	eigen
the boost arrays contain a typedef called element while the eigen arrays contain a typedef called scalar

26143275
visualvm	jprofiler
when i started to investigate this i used profilers like visualvm and jprofiler

26143275
visualvm	jprofiler
so i figured that the problem must be in the native heap which both visualvm and jprofiler seem to be unable to access profile

26143283

26143290
versioning	upgrade
it from your index file and upgrade to the latest versioning of the sdk

26143314
box-sizing	border-box
i m a fan of using box-sizing border-box sizing whenever you need to divide a page vertically and include padding margings or borders

26143314
box-sizing	margin	width	margin
the default box-sizing is content-box which will apply the width rule only to the content of the element--if borders padding or margin are added they will be in-addition to the width

26143314
width	margin	width	border-box	margin	border-box
border-box changes this so the width rule applies to the entire element--if borders padding or margin are added they will not increase the element s size but rather consume space within the element

26143314
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
the key bit is the combination of box-sizing border-box and width 50

26143314
width	margin
together they mean that each will be 50 of the width of their parent element and that their width includes their border margin and padding

26143314
box-sizing	margin	width	margin
regular box-sizing uses content-box in which case the width rule applies only to the content--adding any padding border or margin will further widen the element s overall size on page

26143329
mayavi	matplotlib
if you want to keep your plots in matplotlib much easier to produce publication-quality images than mayavi in my opinion then you can use the marching_cubes function implemented in skimage and then plot the results in matplotlib using

26143380
post	get
if you re talking about the page that has been assigned to post under wordpress reading settings you can get rid of most of your code and simplify it

26143487
virtualenv	conda
as for conda it is simultaneously a package-manager and a virtualenv -like environment python install

26143487
virtualenv	conda
while virtualenv is added on top of an existing python install conda takes over the whole install so you can be more sure that all the dependencies are accounted for

26143539
oncreate	getwritabledatabase
your addswrow calls getwritabledatabase you call addswrow in database helper oncreate and oncreate gets triggered by getwritabledatabase

26143539
oncreate	getwritabledatabase
either remove the addswrow call or pass the sqlitedatabase from oncreate to it instead of calling getwritabledatabase there

26143580
switching	screens
i have a screens which has a list view and a switching in its footer view

but a similar switching in another screens works fine under similar conditions but it is not part of any list view

26143589
cassini	iis
this is for development purposes and i wanted to use iis instead of cassini for this

26143591
width	height
this resizes the cells in both width and height according to their content

26143591
width	height
the cell should fill the width of the collection view and adjust it s height accordingly

26143609
hide	show
you would need to add some javascript in order to show or hide the field

26143749
beanstalk	amazon-web-services

put	get
no you can t get a iqueryable from sqlquery this is because what iqueryable is doing is building a sql string dynamically based on what select and where filters you put in

26143932
ienumerable	iqueryable
your options are either dynamically build the string your self to pass in to sqlquery and use it as a ienumerable instead of a iqueryable or use a dbset in your dbcontext and do the more normal way of letting entity framework build the query for you

26143932
ienumerable	iqueryable
you technically can by calling asqueryable on the result but that is just a ienumerable pretending to be a iqueryable it does not give you any of the benefits of using a real iqueryable like only retrieving the needed rows from the server

quicksort	mergesort
radix sort tends to exhibit poor cache locality see for example this paper for an analysis of different sorting algorithms under the influence of cache skip to the conclusion for a discussion of radix sort s poor cache locality compared to quicksort and mergesort

26144731
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort and mergesort partition the data such that after a few iterations a partition will fit on a few cache lines whereas radix sort keeps shuffling the data

26144731
quicksort	mergesort
also depending on radix sort s radix size its constant factor may be larger than quicksort s mergesort s log factor

26144731
quicksort	mergesort
in an extreme case using a radix of 2 on 64-bit integers radix sort has a constant factor of 64 one pass per bit whereas it s highly unlikely that quicksort s mergesort s log factor is that large as this would imply that you re sorting 2 64 elements

what is the performance difference between a regular for-loop and a parallel.for loops with maxdegreeofparallelism 1

26169352
google-chrome	firefox
basically it works as intended in ie11 and google-chrome and firefox but if you do this fiddle in ie10 you ll notice when the child div slidetoggles the background color starts over in the child div rather than extending to include the child div as it expands

26169375
box-sizing	border-box
you might think of it this way with box-sizing border-box the padding and border press their way inside the box rather than expand the box

26169398
int	double
imagine if we were talking about a class like num we could use int or double or int or decimal each with totally different performance and semantic characteristics

26169419
dbase	adoconnection
if the main form have an opened adoconnection the connected property is true in the dfm then i will read good characters from the dbase files and i can write them into the file - the ansi characters will be converted correctly

26169419
decoder	encoder
why the ado character encoder decoder works only if i had a connected adoconnection in dfm

26169428
width	height
i would rather not force the height or width of any of the lines of text as this seems to me to risk breaking if text size is slightly changed

26169428
width	height
the current status of the above image is that i m just trying to get the text click here for a to appear at the top of its div - as noted without setting the height or width of the div to collapse onto the text if possible

26169428
width	height
perhaps the right way really is to set the width and height of the click-here-for-a div see css below to be nearly equal to the text dimensions in order to force its absolute positioning but as noted i d rather not unless answers here correct me by telling me that this is a good way to do it

26169481
width	height
edit fixed half the issue by setting height in the setwidthoftime variable but now it is taking the last value 37.5 for all the width values

26169496
min	max
time-to-exits is a list of values so it makes sense to use min or max with it

26169525

getter	setter
the takeaway on getter and setter

26169737
getter	setter
if you find yourself using getter and setter on simple types make sure you consider possible future changes to the interface

26169903
min	max
one is supposed to be the max temp and the other is min temp

26169959
getter	setter
i have getter and setter for the same records in my action class i am using struts 2

26169959
getter	setter
my action class has an arraylist named arraylist and i am using getter setter to set the value

26169967

26169984
express	node.js
your question is near of the following question test environment in node.js express application

26170045
int	chars
this actually is kinda nifty when you think about it by wrapping the magical and strict primitives like this we can handle lazy int s and chars s uniformly at the runtime system level

26170068
uuid	mac-address
you will also need a unique identifier for each device may be mac-address or some other hw uuid

26170147
gentoo	linux

26170179
pop-up	dialog
to remove events from the calendar the user clicks an event box and a dialog box pop-up

26170215
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying something with one is a useless operation as it doesn t change the value at all so the goal to have the value converted is hidden in the implicit operation that precedes the multiplication

26170217

26170259
client-side	server-side
it could have been done on the server-side or on the client-side but i did it on the server-side because it was much easier to do so

26170292
getter	setter
just add regular getter setter

26170318
super	extends
if i for example have a method that uses varargs for class types that extends a super class like

26170320
inherited	properties
the program is supposed to inherited properties from the person object and add two additional properties sid and courses

26170330
int	double
then it converts that from double to int d2i and there you go

26170330
int	double
so if there is a difference i would have to prep and fire up an arm to see at least one arm result already have posted that my intel result for your program verbatim is 8192 would be in one of the two floating point operations multiply or double to int and rounding choices may come into play

26170432

for this i m using glew freeglut adding the due search paths on project settings and adding the linker flags also and also the macos opengl framework

26170495
maven	m2e
for me i always use the m2e first option to import maven projects to eclipse workspace

26170513
int	chars
my intuition says that as soon as we encounter an unexpected chars for example a letter when trying to read an int we set the failbit and put every chars we read so far back into the stream

26170523
int	chars
i don t understand how you could split up an int and put it into different parts of a chars array

26170550
octal	decimal
0023122 in octal is 9810 in decimal

26170562
google-chrome	firefox
displaying it directly in a new tab would cause firefox and google-chrome to crash probably because the data uri is too long since smaller files work just fine

26170565
calloc	malloc
there is a problem with dynamic memory allocation for example malloc or calloc of an array when it is done in viewdidload

26170565
calloc	malloc
in viewdidload i allocated memory for the array using malloc or calloc

26170613
portrait	landscape
i have different layouts for portrait and landscape mode

26170613
portrait	landscape
since the fragments in portrait and landscape mode are not one instance i cannot use setretaintinstance or onsaveinstancestate

26170613
portrait	landscape
so if i enter some text in fragment2 in portrait mode and rotate to landscape and rotate to portrait mode again i see the entered text

26170632
floating-point	integer
however c and c++ has a happy rule that when people write things like a 3 the calculation is done in floating-point arithmetic rather than with integer arithmetic

26170632
int	double
the calculation is done in double unless both operands are float in which case the calculation is done in float and int if both operands are int s

26170669
post	get

pow	sqrt
you need to set those those values that go into pow and sqrt to get a valid result

26170782
width	height
i would generally recommend assigning a standard width and height in for each image

26170782
width	height
my recommendation would be to create a css class or identifier for the image and assign the width and height in css rather than html

26170782
width	height
while it s perfectly acceptable to assign the width and height in html for single-use images assigning such values in css tends to improve the maintainability of websites

26170782
width	height
note that while assigning a specific width and height is not strictly necessary it decreases the likelihood that the image will be replaced with a differently-sized image at a later time breaking the layout

26170782
width	height
most modern browsers will interpret basic width and height properties identically

26170796
inherited	properties
what i would like to be able to do is create many different childfoo s that each have a mystuff properties but that mystuff properties can be any class i create that inherited from basebar

26170803
textview	imageview
i want left of my textview a imageview with icon but only have the height of the textview

26170811

26171000
spaces	delimiter
edit the default delimiter of function strjoin is spaces no need to specify it

26171009
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	pointer-events
you can either add pointer-events none in css to the blocking element no support in ie10 and below i think or try adding e.preventdefault to a mouseenter mouseover event on that element

26171011
bmp	png
in particular there are variants where raw png of jpg data can be packed into a bmp container

26171011
bmp	png
paint on the other hand has codecs for png and jpg so i d expect its repertoire might include those formats even when they re packed in a bmp header

move	drag
i have this code works perfectly but when i add zoom to the uiscrollview i can t move the image around the scroll the images do not respond to event drag

26171403
int	chars
to convert the digit chars into an int you can cast it to an int and then subtract 48 because 48 is the ascii code for 0

26171431
int	double
if i replace the enumtype in the line somefunction with int or double everything is fine and dandy

26171455

the only way i can get it to work is if i put somemethodusingsomeapi inside the constructor.

26171550
udp	tcp
tcp or udp either is fine

26171556
floating-point	integer	integer	radix
also it would be good to use parseint value to integer docs with radix parameter and parsefloat value to floating-point number docs methods while getting your number values from your inputs

26171597
put	get
i am attempting to write a program that will read input from a text file parse the information put it into nodes of a linked list and then allow you to input keywords and get answers from the list

android textview has height and width of 0

26171614
width	height
to find the width and height of a view before it being drawn

26171614
width	height
now you can get width using getmeasuredwidth and height using getmeasuredheight

26171626
subtract	add
i will range from 0 up to the length of the second list but you subtract out the length of the first list and then add 1 so you don t go over the end of the index

26171633
folder	directory
however instead of selecting library module just hit empty module. this was a pain to figure out but intellij will change a bunch of files including the androidmanifest.xml strings.xml if you hit library module. also be sure to add the dependencies to the libs folder in the recursed directory to your facebook module so you include android-support-v4 bolts support

26171655

26171964
put	get
i m not sure if this is the answer but states that if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate

26172001

26172359
ienumerable	iqueryable
you can use ienumerable and iqueryable in different ways to return different results you can have all the fintering done in the db and only return the exact results that you want or you can have part of the query done in the done and it returns a lot back to memory and then the second part of the filter executes

26172390

26172410
width	height
these will each be floated to the left with a width of 50 and a height of 100 this is important because we can t center the legend vertically unless its parent has a height defined

26172410
margin	height
since you don t know the height of the legend you can t use a negative margin of 50

26172439
jar	war
my problem seems to be due to the fact that the ejb jar file containing the ejb rest web service is packaged in an ear file alongside a war file

26172439

26172575
width	height
the tiles that are shown on screen are user controls that are dynamically created once the user specifies the height and width of the level

the reason for recommending a keyup as opposed to a keydown is that in the below snippet if you use a keydown the event will always be one letter behind

26172692
printf	fgets
whenever fgets reads a line made up of only n or t printf .

26172718

if on your platform the size of double were 8 bytes and twice the size of int the compiler makes wrong assumption of where to read the values

26174345

it works in firefox google-chrome and opera but not in safari or ie edge

26181298
width	margin
it s recommended to only animate independent properties such as rendertransform properties or opacity and not dependent ones like width margin canvas.x or custom properties

26181348
width	height
you have to find an other way of zooming like changing both the height and the width of the image

26181350
children	parent
polymorphism should allow you to create a list of parent objects and populate it with children

26181369
folder	dir
you can use dir with recursive set to true to list all files in the folder tree and you can use pattern to define a regular expression to filter the .csv files

26181369
folder	directory	folder	dir
forces dir to traverse recursively through all folder below the working directory

26181410
mysqlconnection	mysqldatareader
so also your mysqldatareader should follow the same pattern used for the mysqlconnection and also for the mysqlcommand

i am able to access cookie value on page present inside a sub folder of root directory which set inside another page present in another subfolder of my application

26181684
folder	directory
but when i try to write value to this cookie on same page present inside a sub folder of root directory

26181726
width	height
they correspond to the size of each facet size really means height and then gives the width so if you are aiming for a particularl size for the whole figure you ll need to work backwards from there

26181728
perl	tcl
subdirectory exec could contain additional executable scripts the package needs typically scripts for interpreters such as the shell perl or tcl

26181734
hide	show
i need 3 buttons that can toggle between show hide text

26181734
hide	show
the toggle function show hide text is not the problem

26181752
min	max
it seems that setting max ch.create_date_time or min ch.create_date_time both return the first oldest case to be created and not the last most recent

26181816
getter	setter
in many languages a property with a getter but no setter would raise a compiler error if you attempted to set the property but typescript doesn t

26181820
min	max
you can change this sorting strategy to sort on some other item within the section say min or max value of sectionorder

26181833

26182120
getter	setter
and indeed when i inspect the property in chrome it s a normal data property not a getter or setter

26182133
background-image	background-size
use background-image to set an image and background-size 100 auto to the background image size

26182149
setinterval	settimeout
the solution we ended up does not address all the broken functionality after sleep mode in ios8 but rather just ajax requests settimeout setinterval requestanimationframe and their respective clear functions

26182149
clearinterval	settimeout	setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout
override settimeout setinterval requestanimationframe clearinterval cleartimeout cancelanimationframe

26182149
setinterval	settimeout
all of these functions need to postmessage to a webworker where the webworker will perform settimeout setinterval accordingly

26182154
lodash	underscore.js
parameter order is different than the native order or the order in libraries such as underscore.js or lodash

26182171
equals	icomparable
what the book prabably is showing is first the class declaration without the icomparable implementation and then they show you how to implement it in the same class thats why you think the book is showing 2 different classes when there are only 1 and the same.to state the obvious you cant have 2 equals class declarations in the same namespace

26182172
swift	objective-c
in objective-c we might solve this with an array of dictionaries but since you asked about swift and swift has embedded structures let s just use those and add some formatting while we re at it

26182184
width	height
i d also like to note that i m pretty confident the actual framebuffer texture object actually is five times as large as what s being drawn to it because if i don t stretch it in my draw_quad function by instead giving it the same width and height as the screen i get this

26182184
width	height
the width and height of the framebuffer is now the same as the width and height of the screen yet there s only graphics in a fraction of it which is the small portion that s actually being drawn to

26182195
popover	tooltip
shows the documentation on how this is supposed to work...quoted below may be the bit i m not understanding it s a little confusing because this all mentions tooltip and not popover but i m making a leap that since it s all in the same documentation that it s all related...

26182415
int	chars
the printf function may use a chars buffer for formatting such as int or floating point to text

26182451
fgets	getline
we recommend using getline instead of fgets

26182476
istream	getline
anyway going back to your problem a possible approach is to use the getline method provided by istream to extract a string

if you marked the tools directory as a source directory and none of its contained file types were set in the ignore files and folder setting at the bottom of the file types settings dialog idea would then copy the tools directory to the out directory

26183509
ant	maven
ultimately the ideal or best practices solution would be to build your project using a build tool like maven gradle or ant for which this type of thing would be a snap

26183509
ant	maven
maven could do it but it d be a bit cumbersome compared to ant. in any run debug configurations you can define the ant script target to run before or after the idea make in the before launch section

26183982
instance-variables	class-variables
x and y are not instance-variables but class-variables

26184054
super	implements
one other idea i ve had but isn t super fun to write is you could implements all the different httpresponse interfaces yourself and write behavior that will cache all the possible behavior of the original httpresponse object

26184082
maven	pom.xml
as some libs who put in pom.xml maven the url in that line is recognized however nothing happens in the browser

26184090
width	height
one thing you might do is to put an input absolutely positions inside the div and set it to the div s full height and width so it stretches over it

26184116
children	parent
instead of the class having the abstract superclass refer to a reference of itself for the structure of the tree i would have it use a node class that has references to its parent node and left and right children nodes

the idea is to iterate over all post and get the link and price for each one

26184310
affinity	processors
it is up the the kernel scheduler to manage this but you can potentially give the kernel some hints by setting the processors affinity

26184316
portrait	landscape
each cell will be spaced from each other according to the iphone orientation portrait or landscape and to the iphone screen size

26184316
portrait	landscape
independent of the cell s size it has to be a 2 cells per line like a 3x2 matrix while in portrait orientation and a 3 cells per line like a 2x3 matrix while in landscape orientation

so can i use d3.js functions inside dagre dagre-d3

26184357

int	boolean	int	double
classes that need values could query your helper class with the key name and this also allows you to provide overloaded methods for primitive classes int long double boolean etc so you don t have to repeat code to get the value and parse it and could instead use box.setselected props.getboolean box_selected as an example

26184908
width	height
my current approach has been to tweak scrollview content width and height constraints to see all content in ib before reverting to proper contraints for building but this gets to be a hassle

26184908
width	height
the grey content view on the left embeds the taller red blue content on the right and i am wondering if i can deduce the height so it could be device agnostic the views are square so they will take their width from the device

26184908
width	height
to be clear auto layout requires that scroll view content views define constraints for the edges and width height dimensions

26184908
width	height
in my case i would like to be able to preset the width to the device width but leave the height to be derived from the red blue content view

if you need to check the size of the next datagram call recv or recvfrom with the msg_peek flag

26185050
int	double
here s some sample code that works though it could error checking on the user s input could likely use a more effective search especially if you know your zip code list is sorted and also consider that your double array could be rewritten as a struct or class with int zipcode and double price since zip being a double wastes space and this makes functions like .length operate a little more logically for your use case with a multidimentional array it returns the total number of cells in the array whereas you would likely want it to return the number of zip codes you support

this looks pretty old but in case someone is wondering you can replace the user s identity during the authenticaterequest event in the application life-cycle with a genericidentity and genericprincipal or your own classes that implement the iprincipal and iidentity interfaces

26185244
width	height
when i use it it s zooms in and out but the scrollviewer keeps it s initial setting which seems to me that the actual width and height are not changing when i scale which i don t want to change anyway

the idea i want though is to scale the scrollviewer range as well by the same percent as the grid tying the scaled width and scaled height to

int	chars
why is it that casting int can convert chars of a symbol to int properly but character.getnumericvalue somesymbolcharvalue

26185483
int	chars
in c a chars is an int that is why most functions like fgetc return an int and not a chars

26185502
int	chars
the character.getnumericvalue method will attempt to convert the chars to an int by applying the chars s numeric meaning

26185502
int	chars
returns the int value that the specified unicode chars represents

26185502
int	chars
for example the chars u216c the roman numeral fifty will return an int with a value of 50

26185502
int	chars
if the chars has a numeric value that cannot be represented as a nonnegative int for example a fractions value then -2 is returned

26185502
int	chars
it is expected that getnumericvalue will not agree with casting the chars to an int

26185563
prepare	execute

case-sensitive	case-insensitive
but when using the and operators sorting is required and this is separate from though influenced by case-sensitive vs case-insensitive

26185647
sorting	filtering
to get a better sense of how case-sensitivity affects filtering and sorting in general run the following step-by-step example

however during updates you must update the min max values for each node which can be done using lazy propagation

26185845
inherited	properties
because i am then using ng-include to dynamically load the correct template i am creating a further child scope that due to prototypical inherited still populates correctly as it doesn t have its own data properties so reaches to the parent

26185875
int	chars
now i know i could do some kind of deep compassion of each chars in the string using .length but i want to use something that is simple that can solve this because i want to add it to a function that will be overloaded to a int so i can go back and forth between string and int comparisons

26185876
hide	show
in order to show hide this in the event of a button click you would have to essentially rebuild all the columns programatically in the click event handler including or excluding the grideditcommandcolumn as needed

width	margin	width	height	margin	height
margin is always half of width and height

26186421
swift	objective-c
and if you mix objective-c and swift code marking the designated objective-c initializers helps the compiler to enforce the rules

26186444

26186516
min	max
change around line to switch min and max

26186541
min	max
to transform a axis aligned bounding box from one node to another you need to transform the 8 vertex of the bbox not just the min and max

26186541
min	max
then parse these 8 transformed vertex and find the new transformed min and max

26186555
persistent	transient
if you plan to use persistent sessions and replication across the cluster code needs to be fixed to be serializable change that field or make it transient

26186633
subtract	add
for instance if your generators working on numpy arrays are doing things like add this subtract that transpose etc. you can pass on deltas that describe what to do without actually doing it

26186633
multiplying	multiplication
instead of having an intermediate generator say multiplying an array by 3 and yield the array have it yield some kind of indicator like 3 or possibly even a function doing the multiplication

26186670
floating-point	fractions
the fractions to float conversion is correctly-rounded and doesn t use floating-point arithmetic to compute the result so we re not depending on the accuracy of floating-point division in this check

26186724
int	boolean
the two most common inflate methods are inflate int viewgroup and inflate int viewgroup boolean

26186768
for-loop	loops
if you iterate over the threads in a for-loop loops may raise an

26186770
addition	multiplication
to tell the compiler to do the addition before the multiplication

26186796
division	modulo
once that is done use modulo to get the digits in reverse and division to get rid of the used numbers

26186848
chown	chmod
the advantage of this solution is that you don t chmod chown every time you run the image

26186875

it seems however that the delphi soap client wcf does not implement ws-addressing

26187668
int	boolean
it s telling you the constructor dectreenode string string int boolean is undefined because your class dectreenode does not define a constructor with those data types

26187668
implements	extends
you can create a class dectreenodeimpl extends dectreenode as the comments on the dectreenode class suggests and implements all the methods constructors that need parameters of type string

26187677

26188226
min	max
that is is true min foo foo is foo and conversely max foo foo is foo

26188230
udp	tcp
for instance one could poll both tcp and udp sockets or even just run two processes to handle both types of connections.

26188243
for-loop	loops
you can use an enhanced for-loop to loops through each element in the hash map like the following

26188266
move	drag
but the layout is very sensitive any small drag might cause many nodes move

26188310
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari

boost	allocator
for example my code has among many other uses of boost pool with different tags this line - notice the custom allocator near the end a boost fast_pool_allocator

26188586
boost	allocator
of course i could write my own pool allocator class but if i did this i d almost certainly just stick with boost s version 1.55 - and i would rather not take the time and energy to write my own custom allocator given that boost s version 1.55 pool_allocator worked just fine

26188586
versioning	upgrade
if so i will have no choice but to stick with boost versioning 1.55 instead of being able to upgrade

26188586
boost	allocator
i would like to know whether i can continue to use boost pool s pool_allocator as a custom allocator that can control which pools are used in version 1.56 and if so how to do so given that the tag template parameter has been removed in version 1.56 - and i would also like to know why the tag template parameter was removed in version 1.56 especially if it prevents the ability of using this allocator to control pools

26188608
shadowing	named
i don t know whether it s more annoying when you re shadowing a concrete type named

range	max
the original images before fixed size range anywhere from 2mb to 20mb the image returned max len image in the table is around 750 kb

26188652
int	chars
i know how to find single digit int because getchar gives me the ascii value of each chars in the file so i need to look for values between 48 and 57 ascii values for 0-9 but i can t figure out how to do this for n digits

26188652
int	chars
i thought about creating a chars array and when i find a digit put it in the array and then use atoi to convert the string to an int but it feels like a bad solution if it would even work

26188689
int	chars	int	boolean	int	double
when you define the method you can make the method public or private static or not static choose the return type byte short int long float double boolean chars name the method and define the inputs

26188723

26188871
int	boolean
is expected and that incompatible types int can t be converted into boolean

26188874
int	double
your key is a double but you get the value passing an int just add the cast and it work for me

26188888

the only way i can get this to work is to manually size my images using height and width properties which i d like to avoid

26188999
subtract	add
and do not add or subtract twice in your functions what you are doing currently

26189150

google-chrome	safari
this happens consistently across all pages with the same fancy box setup and occurs in both safari and google-chrome

26189375
inherited	properties
you have not even defined the properties in your controller also even if you define them directly as the changes made to the properties in the child or its child will not be reflected in the parent though it will propagate down as a part of inherited

26189375
inherited	properties
you should remember scopes except isolate scopes are prototypically inherited so in order to resolve this you can use a properties that holds the object reference which contains the properties that needs to be modified so that even if you change the value of properties on that object from grandchild it will still reflect while accessing the same on the parent because they are all looking at the properties on the same object reference

26189389
gson	jackson
serialising with for example gson or jackson should be pretty easy after this

26189456

lucy ideally you shouldn t have to run in release profiling when debugging release is meant as an app distribution profiling with a small package size and little no debugging symbols

26190086
profiling	debugging
for context debugging adhoc or release profiling are purely to id different build configurations that xcode ships with

26190086
profiling	debugging
xcode starts projects with a debugging profiling with no optimization and various other predefined config related to development debugging so symbol loading by the interpreter is possible - you re free to tweak this however you wish

26190776
chunked	transfer-encoding
however i do see this transfer-encoding chunked so my suspicion is that requestb.in doesn t support chunked transfer encoding

26190821
children	parent
so optical bounds of parent are maximum of optical bounds of his children

26190821
children	parent
you can not place textview entirely based on it s inner optical bounds because its parent can has other children with optical bounds

i want to be able to grab the parent form the one in the background with the title and control boxes and resize it whilst the children dialogs scale with it

26190918
required	placeholder
note that differently from other languages the code in each case doesn t automatically fallthrough to the next case so the break statement is not required - the only use case for it is when a case has no statement a case with no statement is an error in swift and in that case the break just acts as a placeholder and its meaning is do nothing

26190941

as of es5 with true javascript objects you can decorate properties you can find the names of but not ones you don t yet know the names of by replacing the property with a getter setter pair via object.defineproperty

26191342
put	get
in es6 it will be possible to create proxies which allow you to completely put a facade in front of an existing object intercepting get set even on proeprties whose names you don t yet know provided you re allow to replace the object with the facade

26191507
box-sizing	margin	width	margin
for border and padding you can use the box-sizing property to include padding and border in the width of the element demo or use the same technique as margin

26191507
width	margin
for border margin and padding when you don t need to set a width on the inner element remove it and the default behaviour for block elements will include margin padding and border inside the parent demo

26191576
oncreate	onnewintent
onnewintent is never called but the oncreate method is called which parse the new intent

26191672
client-side	server-side
while the signature is based on your account s api_secret which should not be revealed in your client-side code you should generate the signature on the server-side

26191700
std	ostream
the only reason that you need to write the cast is because std ostream has a special overload for which assumes that the given pointer points to the first element of a zero-terminated array of characters and will happily try to traverse that array until it hits zero

26191700
std	ostream
for all other non-character pointers std ostream already prints a numeric representation of the pointer value

26191700
std	ostream
the behaviour of std ostream is the result of a design choice for convenience to make the vast majority of use cases work easily at the expense of making your particular use case more verbose to write

26192355
post	put
i d rather have a generalized class and one subscribe-d method in which i can check the type of message sent with an enum and then act accordingly but this approach requires me to create for example a map and put data inside it and then pass this map every time i want to post something which also does not seem to be the best way to go

26192396
outputstream	bufferedinputstream
data variable is of type bufferedinputstream and outputstream is of instance of socketoutputstream

disk	ram
swapping is using disk space albeit a flash memory drive in this case as ram

26192590
union	distinct
just to add to increase the efiiciency use union all rather than union or union distinct as union requires internal temporary table with index to skip duplicate rows while union all will create table without such index but keep in mind it will skip the repeated data

26192608
width	height
if i set bitmapfactory.options.justdecodebounts to true i will get the width and height of the resulting bitmap

26192608

int	chars
c is an int and not a chars because getchar converts the input to unsigned chars and since it cannot hold negative values and since eof holds -1 the while loop will never end

26192801
int	chars
getchar returns int not chars

26192801
int	chars
so you need to define the variable that contains its return value as an int not as chars

26192819
int	chars
this tests if every part contains at least one valid chars any chars for part string and any digit for part int with as a delimiter between them

26192857
apache	nginx

26194461
d3.js	crossfilter
how can we do this using crossfilter js and d3.js

26194536
oncreate	ondestroy
1 why not just add the data module unit to the interface uses list of the form declare a private variable of the data module type in the form and create the form s data module variable in the oncreate event of the form...and then you can freeandnil the data module in the ondestroy event

26194538
osx	yosemite
with the introduction of the yosemite version of the osx operating system apple introduced a new mode called vibrancy which is a light diffusion blur to cocoa window and window components

26194538
titlebar	window
the net effect now is that either the entire window below the titlebar or only parts you want such as a sidebar will show this vibrancy effect

26194598
g++	gcc
then you have to link to the binaries that are the definitions the body of these functions as well or ask the gcc g++ is gcc module to do all the things for you

26194605
rtp	rtsp
i ve read some solutions based rtp and rtsp protocols but they are too complex for my use case

rss	feed
stackoverflow s feed are atom feed and i was not able to parse them using xml rss itself and have tried other parsers that are currently developed but still unsuccessful

26194655
int	chars
after user enters number from 0 to 65535 i have to convert it from ascii chars to ascii int that i could start converting from decimal to binary

26194657
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer is advantageous in that you store and treat both as bitstream i mean just a data without sign so multiplication devision becomes easier faster with bit-shift operations

26194662
width	height
i assume this part works because the read width and height is correct

26194675

to move to the next digit you need to multiplying your current value by 10 and then add the next one

26194803
post	get
this may sound confusing but i will post the code below when i test my add method in the doublylinked class i get a null pointer exception

26194807
textview	imageview
hence if you want an imageview to float on top of a textview make sure the imageview is defined later than the textview as children of the same relativelayout

26194815
treemap	linkedhashmap
you can iterate over the map with jstl tag but i unless the map in is linkedhashmap or a treemap the order of iteration is unspecified

26194832
hash	salt
on each iteration previous hash its updated with the current hash + new salt generated at step 1

26194841
int	boolean
mysql happens to support the above syntax because boolean are treated as int as they are in the c and c++ languages 0 false 1 true

26194849
apache	nginx
it s common and recommended to install apache or nginx on port 80 and use mod_proxy_ajp to connect apache or nginx to glassfish through port 8009

26194901
stdout	stderr
if you don t want rtorrent to do that redirecting its stdout and stderr these are normally bound to your terminal will most likely stop it from writing to your terminal

26194979
versioning	upgrade
there is something in 6.0.1 that is not working right the solution is to upgrade both xcode and your mac osx to the latest versioning

26195087
sudo	passwd
when i m logged into linux as root or sudo i thought when i typed mysql that mysql used the current username and passwd of the linux user however when i try that it just gives error error 1045 28000 access denied for user root localhost using passwd no

26195088
fadein	fadeout
i am making few info boxes and have jquery ui clip effect combined with fadein fadeout

26195100
width	height
they change their width and height proportionally to the screen

26195100
width	height
which results in different font sizes for buttons with the same width and height so i can see 10 buttons in the same frame and different text length but with completely different font size .i guess its width is the same as the text width and not the button frame.width

26195134
nstextfield	nstableview
i have an nstableview in my application that i am loading data in after the user has typed a letter in an nstextfield

26195186

in objective-c i can define a static variable but i can t find a way to define a global variable in swift

26195301
int	chars
print the first value right-aligned in an int field 2 chars wide

26195313
listview	gridview
subclass the enclosed vertically scrollable view it may be gridview or listview or the like in your case listview and override the onmeasure method as follows

26195386
width	height
my first instinct was to wrap the the alert in a container div with a fixed width and height and no padding

26195425
portrait	landscape
then view updates its height to 250 pixels when i turn the device landscape but after i turn the device from landscape to portrait it doesn t reset the height of the view back to 324 pixels

26195475
pull	push
aside from exporting importing the image as tar as suggested by others you can also run a private registry on your local network and push pull from it

26195523
for-loop	loops
create a while loops inside of the for-loop that says if the question isn t answered correctly then repeat so that way in each question the question will be asked until its correct

26195523
for-loop	loops
keep everything inside the for-loop in the while loops that you should create

26195609
min	max

moreover you are trying to plot to many lines and errorbar in one plot

26195635
hide	show
i am not referring to the actionbar hide and show methods instead i want to know how to hide and show the actionbar at the same rate the list below it is scrolled

26195687
free	malloc
in order for valgrind to work it uses ld_preload to wrap the malloc and free functions description of general function wrapping here

26195687
free	malloc
if your libc substitute doesn t support ld_preload or somehow the c library s malloc and free aren t being used at all with those names then valgrind is not going to work

26195694
post	get
warning grizzly0173 more than the maximum number of request parameters get plus post for a single request 10â 000 were detected

26195738
oncreate	ondestroy
because you have not registered your receiver you must register it at the oncreateview or oncreate and unregistere it at the ondestroy

26195754
put	get
you can still put any code you need for your own start-up such as db initializer calls inside your constructor and all that will get called once the base call completes

26195773
uiview	uiwindow
i know that you can add a uiview to a uiwindow with something like

26195781
zoo	xts	zoo	quantmod	xts	quantmod
since you seem to be using quantmod anyway which loads xts and zoo here is a solution that does not use all those nested if ... statements

26195847
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
this occurs in all browsers as far as i can tell ie firefox google-chrome opera

26195863

the difference between uiwindow and uiview

26195874
post	get
this post helped me get it corrected default url not loading with carrierwave in rails

26195891
calloc	malloc
i was shown many ways of using calloc and malloc with casting without etc

26195909
int	chars	int	boolean
and then we go to 6.3.1.1 boolean chars and int which says emphasis mine

26195910
post	get
there is no route post only a route get

26195922
folder	directory
i didn t know it was only a virtual directory after downloading the folder locally it works

26195930
calloc	malloc
if you use malloc calloc then you need to use as number of bytes to pass in malloc

26195949
hide	show
note i can t use any javascript solution to hide the loading animation and show it after image load

26195955
versioning	upgrade
after that only upgrade method is called that too when you change the db versioning

26195961
width	height
the image width is slave to its height in order to maintain the image s natural aspect ratio

26195969
prepare	execute
this query is being execute as part of a php prepare statement iterating over a multi-dimensional array which contains all of the values

26195977

show lesser interest of visiting before you hide the file

26196026
uilabel	uibutton
if the user is logged in he she will be able to change the information stored in the detailviewcontroller there will be some uibutton and some uilabel the user will be able to push and insert some text to.

26196029
aho-corasick	knuth-morris-pratt
the idea of implementing it as a dfa probably comes from the fact that knuth-morris-pratt algorithms is a special case of the aho-corasick automaton it can operate on a trie not just one string which is usually implemented this way because prefix table is not sufficient for it

26196058
getter	setter
i removed all imports and getter setter to reduce amount of lines

26196069
folder	directory
executing this command inside a directory will show the permissions and ownership of all the files and folder in that folder

26196069
folder	directory
this will recursively change the ownership of all the files and folder inside the root directory to the apache user and group

26196096
int	boolean
take the result of that shift and use the c++ operator to test against the boolean operation s cached 16 bit int value

26196098
width	height
so image s height will increase to match the new height of the text and its width too to maintain aspect ratio

26196099
lisp	scheme
this fact is heavily abused in functional languages like lisp and scheme

26196142
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
actually i want to show the modal window over pdf and its working well in ie google-chrome mozilla firefox but its not working on safari 5.1.7

26196163
hash	md5
check an md5 hash of the public key to ensure that it matches with what is in a private key

26196164
width	height
it s easiest if you follow an approach like this - all the navigation items are block full width elements and you setup the height of the wrapper to be equal to a single nav item and via javascript you play with the vertical positioning such that the one that you want comes into view rather than play with the left variable of an absolute positioned element

26196174
hide	show
you have to link each element you want to show hide in your uiviewcontroller with an iboutlet

26196189
try-catch	exception-handling
also the following code will not have any effect on the program whatsoever unless an exception-handling is thrown since these variables will be tidied up and deleted by the garbage collector as soon as you exit the try-catch block

26196223
serializable	deserialization
serializable is the writing part and deserialization is the reading part

26196223
serializable	deserialization
if you re wondering why you re calling done and not simply returning the value it s because both your serializable and deserialization could be asynchronous

26196224
disk	ram
that 1st code takes virtually no ram as it creates from the disk making it smaller by simply skipping pixels from the image

26196224
int	boolean
then you ll use the standard api to scale down to the size you actually need int int boolean

26196240
osx	yosemite
it will be quite difficult to find someone with osx lion running safari 5.1 to have an answer for your question that s almost 3 versions back with yosemite just around the corner and a world-wide usage of less than 0.5 of the browser

26196240
hide	show
a less elegant solution would be to hide the problematic iframes when overlays are triggered to be show and therefore avoid the overlap since the overlapping element is gone

26196313
integer	unsigned
i have to read 10 bytes from a file and the last 4 bytes are an unsigned integer

26196322
debian	linux
i am on linux debian 3.2

26196394
folder	directory
reason current directory folder name is match with built-in function in matlab library and gives the error - attempt to call constructor image with incorrect letter case

26196460
concave	convex
thus far i ve been able to get the bottom to look how i want using the after pseudo selector but no luck with the top which i can only seem to get concave rather than convex

26196492
post	get
then after gathering the post_id of the relevant tagged post i search the post table to get all the information about the post before outputting it to the user

26196510
int	chars
what s currently happening in your code is that because you re comparing a chars with an int the chars is being converted to an int using its chars code

26196516
folder	directory
my goal is to change to a directory that is already exist based on this string value and then plot a scatter diagram for the csv file inside this folder

26196519
folder	directory
anything under your workspace_path .codelite directory - this folder is intended to be used per-user

26196524
children	parent
any hierarchy object should have a parent could be null and a set of children both of the exact same type as the concrete implementation of hierarchy

26196528
int	chars
this takes the address of the 6th chars reinterprets as a pointer to an unsigned int and then returns the unsigned int value it points to

26196586
children	parent
if you re going to get close to your scenario then maybe the method is to set up a shared memory segment in the parent which both children have access to

26196586
memcpy	strcpy
curiously the posix standard does not list function such as strcpy or memcpy as signal-safe

26196591
fflush	gets
everything works fine until the entity gets fflush to the database and i get this error

26196592
apk	dex
instead starting from android l they will natively support multi-dex by collapsing all the dex files from an apk into a single oat file

26196675
crossfilter	dc.js
your particular question is covered by the crossfilter documentation and the dc.js faq a dimension does not observe its own filters but only the filters on other dimensions

26196675
put	get
to get the charts to respond to each other create a duplicate of the dimension construct another one with the same arguments and put the charts on separate dimensions

26196675
crossfilter	dc.js
as to your larger question no there is no documentation on the interaction between dc.js and crossfilter that i know of

26196675
filtering	grouping
there actually isn t much magic to it charts just update the dimension filtering and then trigger redraws on the charts in their grouping

26196682
for-loop	arrays
and it just skips the for-loop like there re no elements in the arrays at all

26196697
boost	allocator
you can use the allocator from boost interprocess to help you achieve this

26196711
int	double
i ve tried to cast the double as a long int and hash it with a 64 bit hash function but it produces some collision as expected

26196711
int	double
so i ask if there s a unique hash function for double between 0..1 or for array of int from size 1..4 that gives an unique index for a table of size n

26196726
oncreate	setcontentview
because of this i suggest writing setcontentview as the second line of every oncreate method after super.oncreate

26196756
bluetooth	usb
you actually can access localhost through usb bluetooth tethering if your phone is supporting this feature

26196780
int	chars
the d format specifier to scanf is a promise that the next argument is the address of a memory buffer that is large enough to hold an int usually 4 or 8 bytes but your key is just a 1-byte unsigned chars so scanf will write 3 or perhaps 7 bytes past the end trampling on whatever occupies that memory -- in this case very likely message

26196787
ubuntu	centos
i also see this problem only on my ubuntu machine and not my centos machine

26196816
move	drag
the drag should be initiated when i move the mouse instead of when i press the row

26196826
integer	unsigned
on a gcc 64-bit machine- x casts your pointer to an unsigned integer 32-bit length

26196834
geocoding	geocode
i don t have any knowledge about the geocode object but personally i would use the google geocoding api

26196846
put	get
in order to get the java class to pretend that it s the same as a c++ class you have to know how the native compiler put things together and how to translate each piece of your java class into a corresponding piece in the c++ class

26196847
post	get
by default the image is not being added to the form during your post you need to get the entire form and append the image to it before sending it

26196876
carrierwave	fog
so i m trying to use carrierwave and fog to upload files to amazon s3

26196876
carrierwave	fog
the error seems to be stemming from the fact that carrierwave fog is trying to pass an array into my string media field in my model project

26196895
button	checkbox
im new to javascript and coding in general i m trying to make a simple to do list but cant get the delete button to delete all the checkbox it will only delete the last checkbox made

26196919
typedef	struct
then i have a struct like this typedef d to be mystruct redundant as it may be but that s aside the point

26196934
button	checkbox
i am trying to make a test case to check the checkbox and click another action button but i need protractor to wait for the http call to finish and angular renders the ng-repeat first

26197005
button	checkbox
a better approach would be to write one generic handler for the delete button which looks up all selected checkbox and finds the other elements belonging to it to delete them

26197010
children	parent
i believe you are correct that you cannot change the stacking order between a parent and its children

26197036
keydown	keyup
events keyup +selector+ keydown +selector+ focusout +selector

26197036
keydown	keyup
creates object events previous line and populates its attribute keyup +selector+ keydown +selector+ focusout +selector with function

starting with early versions of java you ll find the java.util.date and java.util.calendar classes along with java.text.simpledateformat

26197344
int	chars
i m trying to pass a int value into a function that returns a chars value to the user

26197380
width	height
the symbol should have a size of 50x50 so i define its width and height accordingly

26197380
opera	firefox
even worse it produces different results in firefox and opera

26197394
google-chrome	firefox
the flickering happens on windows 8.1 on ie firefox and google-chrome and on windows phones with the 3.0 version

26197432
put	get
i am assuming i need a get method instead of this simple bit of code to say that if you are on the training-gallery page put the name of the page training-gallery on the navigation id line in the code

26197433
for-loop	loops
if i have a 5 by 5 matrix i want to take each column of the matrix at a time at each iteration of the for-loop and work on a bunch of operations and at the end of it get a vector that is labelled as v_i where i refers to the column index and also the iteration number of loops

26197516
put	get
you would get the instances of aclass are not indexableâ œ error if you sent at at put or size to instances of a class that has no indexed instance variables or has not overridden these methods

26197533
for-loop	loops
since print radius area circumference is inside your for-loop it is repeated every time you loops

26197569
int	chars
the chars strings are typedefd as listitemp for easy reconstruction to an int linked list etc if need be

26197573
getter	setter
you can write it manually like andrã s showed in his post or you can use the function to construct it from a getter and setter like this

26197582
uiview	subviews
i very rarely override drawrect in my uiview subclasses usually preferring to set layer.contents with pre-rendering images and often employing multiple sublayers or subviews and manipulating these based on input parameters

26197622
pandas	pytables
these are my versions of pandas and pytables

26197622
pandas	pytables
although i am quite sure that the issue is not related with pandas since i have observed similar behavior when using only pytables without pandas

26197735
clang	llvm
i tried not to use clang llvm from mac so i used the gcc-4.8 from brew

26197735
clang	llvm
then it works fine with make all-gcc but i also have different error with make all-target-libgcc so i ll stick to gcc approach instead of clang llvm approach

26197735
clang	llvm
my guess is that the assembler as from apple has something wrong with parameters that gcc gives because there s nothing wrong with clang llvm

26197742
for-loop	arrays
try declaring a larger arrays and incrementing the counter variable to point to the next index to insert to instead of using a for-loop

26197756
onresume	onpause
you are reading the preference on oncreate and saving on onstop so maybe what you can do it save the preference on onpause to make sure it gets saved earlier and reload on onresume instead of oncreate the latter only occurs once in the life cycle of an activity

26197777
integer	unsigned
i am trying to print an unsigned integer value from a mips register as ascii text to the console

i have found a way to change the width of a angular modal how ever i can not figure out how to set the height i want

26197855
width	height
i need the modal to be 400px width 400px height

26197895
listview	gridview
if i clear the arraylist there will be no data to show on listview or gridview so it will be empty

26197899
mouse	keyboard
it s cross platform and can control the mouse keyboard

26197955
int	double
the problem is that areacalc takes an int but you re providing a double

26197956
int	double
the parameter of areacalc should be of type double but it is int

26197956
int	double
when you pass a double it must be converted to an int but that will cause a loss of precision and the language requires you to make an explicit cast if you attempt that

26198038
post	get
if you can t get it to work let me know and i ll post a full code sample when i m home

nsbutton	nsstatusitem
in 10.10 nsstatusitem has a new button property which returns an instance of a new class nsstatusbarbutton inheriting from nsbutton

26198182
uicontrol	uibutton
i think that you should have a single big uicontrol which has different subviews like uibutton but tracks touches by itself like you did already but finds out which subview to highlight depending on the touch position

26198199
swift	objective-c
in project build settings i searched for swift compile - code generation and there in objective-c bridging header i entered the name of my new bridging file projectname-bridging-header.h for debug and release values

26198214
haskell	ocaml
in ocaml the only things that come to my mind are making s a global variable very undesirable or trying to emulate haskell s monadic interface which i fear is going to be a lot of work and end up with slow code tahts also ugly due to a lack of do-notation

26198225
opencv	emgucv
i think version of emgucv and opencv important for solution

26198230

addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
part of the class are member functions that perform the basic matrix calculations -- addition subtraction and multiplication

26198635
subtraction	addition
it appeared that both addition and subtraction worked but the program would close if the matrices were incompatible ie

26198635
subtraction	addition
below is the snippet for the addition subtraction is almost identical just - instead of + in the final loops

26198637
post	get
everything worked fine i could send and receive data via get post with my android app and also with the program curl

in lua is the function call operator except when next to a function keyword if the object is a function or has a __call method it will be called immediately

26198855
os.path	shutil
you can step into the shutil module or os.path just fine for example

26198855
cpython	pypy
in fact just like in cpython that part of the standard library is part of the rpython runtime and not seen as native python code by pypy either just like the built-in types are part of the runtime environment

26198869
put	get
and if you input i am bob you get hi bob and if you input my name is bob you get hi undefined when i put i am

26198909
portrait	landscape
the magenta view is square and pinned to the bottom left and right in portrait and top bottom and right in landscape

26198909
portrait	landscape
since self.view is always portrait there s no difference from self.view s perspective between portrait and landscape rotated left except for which way is up which is no business of self.view

26198926
textmate	sublimetext
by in there is always a .lesshst file which i rm all the time as i would prefer to use more or nano for simple stuff and i can use textmate for simple text editing or sublimetext or whatever else i am in the mood for

i also on network on the google cloud console added a firewall rule to accept udp and tcp connection to port 1011 but web page not available shows when hitting same for https

26199006
sse	avx
i am able to get a significant speedup 25x including data copy time over a naive single-threaded cpu implementation but i don t know how fast the cpu version would be using chunked multithreading and sse avx so it would be interesting to see more of your implementation or get some performance numbers

26199024
range	minimum
i am doing a problem where i have to pass an array through a function and it returns the minimum integer in the range of indexes the user inputs

26199070
stateless	stateful
to be an ejb bean must it be annotated by stateful stateless or singleton

26199106
for-loop	loops
if you make the changes in a for-loop you won t see them until the end of loops and the end of the calling function and it s calling function etc

26199106
setinterval	settimeout
you can also do this manually by managing settimeout s or a setinterval or setimmediate if supported polyfilled but then you don t have the other benefits which come from the specialty call

26199118
phpstorm	webstorm
this option is available in phpstorm v8 or webstorm v9 currently at eap stage

26199126
inherited	properties
sean parent s talk inherited is the base class of evil says that polymorphism is not a properties of the type but rather a properties of how it is used

26199126
inherited	properties
that way drawa doesn t need to inherited from drawable - the polymorphism was really usedrawable s requirement and not really a properties of drawa

26199203
public	protected
or you might make robot a cloneable class and modify the robot interface to make clone public it s protected by default

26199214
superclass	subclassing
your subclassing aimnode needs to call the designated initializer of your superclass skspritenode

26199226
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome clips things as i expected wanted them to be displayed but i think that firefox s way is correct per the w3.org link above

26199251
post	get
and i can t even get the log for the post request because of the parameter missing error.

26199271
getter	setter
the solution would be to use synchronized getter and setter or equivalent.

26199294
stdout	stderr
...would be the more compatible way to send both stdout and stderr of autogen.sh to the appropriately named file

26199340
pop-up	dialog
so i want to use the id from the table in the modal it s a pop-up dialog for getting some information but i can t get the value of the row that the user is pressing

26199347
put	get
best and fastest way to test your onsaveinstancestate is the most often used scenario orientation change orientation change will cause the activity to get destroyed completely and re-created so allow orientation change on activity a put some values in your savestatebundle and rotate the device now this will call all your methods from the start oncreate oncreateview .

26199390

switching	screens
as you can see i ve tried multiple ways to switching to the new tab as the active tab but both ways seem to only allow me to manipulate elements on the 1st now hidden tab - even though visually the new tab is selected on the screens

26199505
for-loop	arrays
here the for-loop produces the same subfolder arrays over and over

26199509
x86	64bit
the each standard oracle jre installer for windows puts everything in a subtree that you can override but defaults to or program files x86 for 32-bit java on 64bit windows and copies a few exes java.exe javaw.exe javaws.exe and a few dlls from the jre bin subdirectory to windows system32 which is conventionally in your path because that s where lots and lots of other windows programs are

26199541
for-loop	loops
above the for-loop declare a nsmutablearray called allfolders and in each loops do

26199545
noexcept	decltype
within unevaluated operands operands of decltype sizeof noexcept ... you can name nonstatic data members also outside of member functions

for example if i m making a game where i have to send x and y coordinates very often should i send it through printwriter separated by a comma or make a position class and send an instance over objectoutputstream

26199603
dplyr	tidyr
option 1 dplyr + tidyr

26199619
width	height
note i would like to have the image span the entire window at all times so javascript is needed to dynamically modify the images height and width values

26199621
width	margin
the outerheight of the button is being changed on hover active when you apply the margin s and border width s on them the other button must compensate somehow since they are smaller

26199629
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the tables work fine in google-chrome and safari just an issue with firefox

26199642
post	get
i have tried several times read a lot of so post and read the twitter bootstrap docs but i cannot get it to work as my knowledge of js is not good enough

26199649
folder	directory
change line 2 so that it shows your correct input filetypes and fwiw the . is not necessary in windows to refer to files or folder in the current directory

26199652
x86	64bit
i know linux first began supporting 64bit file sizes with off_t 32 bit vs loff_t 64bit but currently off_t is an alias for __kernel_off_t which is an alias for long long in arch x86 include uapi asm posix_types_x32.h or an alias for long in include uapi asm-generic posix_types.h

26199652
solaris	sunos
sunos solaris still had 32-bit off_t for quite a while

26199660
int	double
at first i followed an example that allowed to manipulate int and double however now i am very confused

26199679
ember.js	backbone.js
frameworks such as angular ember.js and backbone.js provide a much better structure for this type of thing than the ad-hoc code common with simple uses of jquery

26199738
int	double
we don t necessarily know what is being put into the array and thus the array must be able to accept string s double int etc.

26199744
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to remove duplicates from arrays using for-loop and conditional statement.but i am unable to create new arrays without any duplicates.there is xls having country name with duplicates i am aiming to remove duplicates and create a new arrays with unique country names

26199759
put	get
then you simple need to put all addresses and later on get the collection for each of them

26199786

superclass a new subclassing

26199843
superclass	subclassing
how does java do the type casting from type superclass to subclassing

26199873
superclass	subclassing
so if you have superclass base class and a subclassing class that extends superclass you can do this

26199873
downcasting	upcasting
the standard terminology for upcasting is widening and for downcasting it is narrowing the type

26199919
cpu	processors
this works well for a single cpu processors

int	chars
main.cpp .text+0x84 undefined reference to glutmain int chars int int chars const demoapplication

26199966
folder	directory
i would guess that declaring the bullet folder as my root makes it impossible for the compiler to find the required c++ files in my actual root directory but i don t what to do about that.

26200013
int	chars
the only thing is that i need to do this using a method that takes in two int values i and j and returns a string the chars to be drawn and thats what i dont know how to do

26200045
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception	illegalstateexception	runtimeexception	illegalstateexception	illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
reusing standard exception makes code more readable because most of java developers are familiar with standard runtimeexception from jdk like illegalstateexception illegalargumentexception or nullpointerexception and they will immediately be able to know purpose of exception instead of looking out another place on code or docs to find out purpose of user defined exceptions

26200060
button	checkbox
i have two button one with a class .add and .remove there is a checkbox that toggles on and off due to which button is pressed so if you remove with the remove button the checked gets checked otherwise the checkbox get s unchecked the problem i m having is when you reuse the .remove button it adds checked attribute but the checkbox doens t show it s checked but in the html it s attribute is there

add width and height constraint for description label and you are good to go

26200149
min	max
i have following small piece of code that uses thrust minmax_element to find out the min and max of a struct of 3 floats

26200197
int	chars
as you probably know the only reason you can do arithmetic on chars in c and c++ java etc. is that chars types can be implicitly converted into int types via their ascii value

26200232
implements	extends
thats why i modeled the client this way extends an abstractserver which implements the server code

26200237
implements	modifiers
they had to decide to include or omit the redundant modifiers and they chose to omit them. frankly it hardly matters which way they decided to implements this

26200376
printf	strcmp
from the casts that you are using it looks like your project is set to unicode project properties -- configuration properties general in that case your char variables need to be changed to wide character wchar_t and the printf strcmp and printf functions need to be changed to their unicode equivalents -- always be aware that you are probably doing something wrong when you have to use casts

26200382
put	get
the lookup depends on whether there are hash collisions for any of the existing elements in which case the elements get put in the same bucket and have to be linearly searched using the equality comparison

26200386
subobject	instances
you have two instances of info object created one as subobject of f declared as fortunes f

26200406

26200656
width	height
a with width height 45 and a stroke-width of 1 is not 45 user units wide it s 46 user units wide as the stroke pokes out inside by 0.5 of a unit and outside by 0.5 of a unit on each edge

26200668
getter	setter
i am using backbone.mutators.js js plugin to override setter and getter

26200781

26200823
google-chrome	firefox
i got a code which uses links to change divs but when i paste these codes to dreamweaver and open the html file on firefox or google-chrome they don t work

26200902
int	double
you re telling the swing table that the columns contain respectively a string an int a double etc.

26200905
super	extends
all you have to do is to annotate the super class fields as you would normally do in you entity and extends the class

26200941
int	chars
think of int and chars 4 exact same size different object representation

26200951
dbcontext	objectcontext
the objectcontext is not used anymore and we have now dbcontext

26200989
width	height
i ve saved the images at a size so that they appear at the same height when at full width 1140px but you will notice when the browser gets smaller the images don t stay the same height

26201008
post	get
nb in order to get the width of the anchor to suit the img width - without manually fixing a width on the container div - i have used one of the techniques that i described in this post

26201022
int	double
whenever you pass a different object type you declared your list of type string and you are checking for different types like int double int long etc

26201034

26201373
width	height
iphone portrait regular height compact width

26201373
width	height
iphone landscape compact height compact width

26201394
sorting	filtering
for small datasets you can say return a single json request to the client and do the filtering sorting in javascript

26201394
sorting	filtering
for huge datasets you ll usually let the server do the filtering and sorting such that you d only need to transfer a fraction of the results

26201394
sorting	filtering
for example if you want to display 10 products out of a list of thousand of products server side filtering sorting is required to keep the data transferred small

26201410
hide	show
and use show and hide of jquery

26201423
int	boolean
assume you can pack m boolean into an int somehow trivially you can do this for m 1 and that you have two instance variables i1 and i2 containing such m packed bits

26201423
int	boolean
then the following code packs m 2 boolean into an int

26201454
getter	setter
note asking here and not cr.se because i d like answers to explain how to dry getter setter in these situations rather than receive critique on a particular piece of code

26201508
filtering	grouping
in step 3 i need filtering good elements by groupid attribute using grouping - i need all good for which groupid value is not contained in grouping

26201522
jobs	cron
it recommented to run cron jobs with command line

26201593
portrait	landscape
if you want to support banner ads you ll have to reduce the height by 50 or 32 device units and move the position up down 25 or 16 pixels portrait or landscape

26201593
portrait	landscape
i also recommend having a different image for landscape vs portrait if you want to support both or you ll have to start letter-boxing

26201660
portrait	landscape
the issue is that in portrait i need only this mode not landscape mode camera preview is stretched and scanner cant recognize barcode in it

26201675
subtract	add
so the main problem is that the part where i add or subtract 1 from the number

26201803
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
press space bar x1 and it starts running press it again it stops and then it stores a value inside a container so that it can calculate an average of 5 eventually but i use the .push method in jquery to actually push it into an error called and then using a for-loop that loops through the arrays and for some reason it does it but i think personally that the .push function overwrites it.

26201807
put	get
then you override the methods get put remove containskey containsvalue by comparing keys and values only with equals method

26201855
width	height
this image slider has fixed width and height of 940 px 370 px

26201869

superclass	subclassing	inherited	subclassing
i have seen many threads inherited in java - creating an object of the subclassing invokes also the constructor of the superclass

26202179
superclass	subclassing
saying that the instance of superclass will not be created when creating a subclassing instance

26202185

on google-chrome firefox and android this works fine

26202346
super	self
i found out that changing the initialiser by making it a convenience one and calling on self instead of on super gets rid of the issue but i have no idea why

26202382
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
this should be a trivial problem but i can t find any solution to the problem that doesn t involve silly hacks like subclassing nsmenu nspopupbutton or other non-intuitive work arounds

for-loop	loops
the problem i m having is the for-loop i have created to achieve this gets stuck in an endless loops and thus crashes the application

26202564
equals	gethashcode
if you implement iequatable you still must override objectâ s equals and gethashcode

26202565
getter	setter
i think the best way is to write getter and setter functions in module.py for each global variable you want to share

26202615
rcurl	httr
the code below shows that the xpath expression works fine with httr but then doesn t work with rcurl

26202658
post	get
my suggestion please post all of the code and you will probably get a detailed answer

26202689
width	height
width and height is automatically set to auto so no need to specify them and the z-index isn t needed at all since you re absolute positioning your content on top of your video which creates a separate stacking context see this article for more info

26202689
width	height
setting top and left will put it in the upper left corner which together with the 100 width and height will achieve what you want

26202689
width	height
since the width will be forced to always occupy 100 and the height is set to auto the ratio of the video will be maintained a good thing

26202689
width	height
the problem lays in that if the width is the factor that determines the size of the video the height might some times be set to low

26202689
width	height
my proposed solution will solve this problem by always making sure the width and height is minimum of 100 just like in the original solution so it will cover the whole page

26202689
width	height
since width and height isn t set explicitly they will both be set to auto and will thus maintain the proportions as well

26202727
punctuation	words
the returned vector contains the information you need count of words and the words themselves with punctuation which you can remove easily

26202770
lxml	beautifulsoup
make sure you have lxml installed and tell beautifulsoup to use xml

26202869
hide	show
whereas you might have created a method show on the component instead so that you could do component.show true or component.show false to show hide - you instead pass it as a property for the same result

26202869
hide	show
calling will render the component visible re-rendering with show false will hide it etc

26202876
shadowing	named
when you re declaring the string with the same named as the array you re shadowing the array and xcode will see capitalizedwords as a string not an array

this script grabs the first four bytes and converts them from binary to hex before comparing them against the expected result of 52 49 46 46 aka riff

26203060
width	height
you have to say the height and width you will have the button in order to do the calculations then do not use the setposition the label to be in a cell and i do not make it so i had that manages what allowed me the cell then do the setbounds with the same height and width

26203060
width	height
this other method allows you to move the label while not change the height and width of the button you created

26203061

superclass	subclassing
in practice the instance fields may be intermingled to a degree since aligning fields from a superclass may leave gaps in the heap allocation that fields from a subclassing can fill

26203177

i was developing codeigniter app for last 2 years and since i started my mvc pattern styling from codeigniter itself now i m not a heavy command line user so at first i did had some learning curve with codeigniter but i crossed it and started developing apps with codeigniter because we don t need to configure a lot and everything was inside one zip file but now as unfortunately codeigniter is dead and i m just one person in my team i have to rely on other third party tools which are trusted by others so i decided to switch to laravel now at starting it was way way tough to migrate from codeigniter because composer and every other stuff but somehow i crossed that too but i m now confused with routing and other stuff and i ve tried many tutorials but i m still not able to see how can i migrate from application where i m managing students where they can change email change phone number updated stuff in codeigniter it was easy but i don t how to approach this stuff in routing of laravel now this question sounds way to dumb for community who is already working on laravel but if you see from my point of view it is going to affect my bread and butter

bash	subshell
the reason i used a process substitution to direct output to a subshell is to not lose the curl exit code which will be non-zero if there was an error allowing me to use bash logical evaluation to report the error or i could just capture it from and examine it - curl has very detailed exit code reporting so i can figure out what went wrong from the exit code

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my issue is that when i attempt to load a test file in no page it only works in firefox but works in firefox google-chrome and safari in the other so it is definitely an issue with the code

26204467

try-catch	exception-handling
you can turn your warnings into exception-handling using set_error_handler so when ever an warning occurs it will generate an exception-handling which you can catch in a try-catch block

26204742
int	chars
so if you store int variable s address to a pointer which is pointing to chars it is completely legal and if you dereference it it will get only one byte from memory

26204742
int	chars
assigning address of chars type variable to pointer which is pointing to int

26204742
int	double
so instead of declaring a new pointer you store its address in int type pointer then if you dereference using it there will be a big problem and result in logical error which may get unnoticed by you if you have forgot to type cast it to double type

26204747
int	double
convert the value to int before comparing and leave out the double quotes from 25000

26204775
min	median	min	max	median	max

26204817
getter	setter
it allows you to add custom setter and getter in case you want to add extra functionality and also is sometimes used to track the dirty state if an object has been changed since it was loaded from the db

26204817
public	protected	inherited	properties
what iâ m trying to get at here is that you are not a bad programmer for having public properties but rather that most php frameworks dodge around the php object model that requires properties to be protected for inherited and reflection to work in many cases

26204887
post	get
simple http method as defined earlier get post head

26204945
folder	directory
if you re using sublime text 3 you ll need a workaround to access the packages default folder and its contents as in this version most of the packages that you would normally have seen in the packages directory in st2 are zipped into .sublime-package files and stored elsewhere

26205205
laravel	codeigniter
actually in your question you have a restful controller which could be confusing for you at this time because you are new to laravel and used codeigniter so probably you are very so much used with automating url mapping without route

26205205
laravel	codeigniter
in this case for ease i suggest you to use a plain controller and that is almost same thing that you ve did in codeigniter but here in laravel you have to declare route for every action

26205240

famo.us does manage the size of the surface but you have the ability to set min and max widths and heights on your surfaces to be responsive

26206253
fgets	fgetc
you should use double pointer to character and dynamically allocate 2d array for every lines and keep getting lines by using fgets for every 1d array or use single pointer and copy whole data into single string which is dynamically allocated using fgetc

26206258
width	margin
maybe the parent of your header is not 100 and it has a left margin so when you give the header a 100 width it takes the width of its parent

26206281

button	checkbox
in my experience form elements are a nightmare to style reliably across all devices particularly checkbox and radio button

26206584
listview	gridview
in browsing the source code for adapterview and abslistview it seems to me that this is mostly useful when you set a choice mode on a listview gridview because then the view can do some more efficient management of checked item ids and they re visual state including across data set changes where those checked items may have moved to new positions but they have the same id

regarding a better ux i would also sugget to pause completely your gallery on mouseenter and restart your animations on mouseleave though a setinterval might be best suited in that case.

26207437
for-loop	loops
if you have a nested for-loop you might want to keep it a nested for-loop and nest rather than hack around that option and use a single loops

26207440

as was mentioned in the comments above md5 has for several years been considered inadequate and insecure for password hashing and a 4 character salt is far too short to be very effective

26207482
post	get
you can use a post request as an alternative to get request to send any large data that might exceed the maximum allowed query string length but to conform to rest standards it is recommended that you also send a x-http-method-override get header while doing so to tell the server to treat it as a get request

touchesbegan	touchesmoved
i solved this by using the func touchesmoved instead of touchesbegan and works perfectly and smoothly

26208010
int	boolean
instead of using a boolean array use another int array since you are filling up with elements which can be at the most 20 you can create an int array of size 20 and every time you read a number do this assuming the array of size 20 is called count

26208014
xjc	maven-jaxb2-plugin
this was actually not a bug in the maven-jaxb2-plugin but an issue or better to say a few issues in the xjc itself

26208093
sorting	filtering
but that s not matter all data access must be going inside getdata func in ngtableparams and when set up all filtering you need to call or maybe just using like in plunk you have to call you can try to type some numbers in input above and data will be updating without problem.all code related to sorting pagging and filtering is removed for clarity

unfortunately most system trays limit the height of icons to a very small size and gtk.statusicon automatically scales down the pixbuf so that both the width and height are smaller than the height limit

26208238
cpu	processors
for an x86 class cpu the field format depends on the processors support of

26208266

i need this images to fill this header entirely keep the width and height proportion

26208273
ready	each
i could technically remove the composer.json file each time i add a new feature branch and then commit it back in once i am ready to merge it into develop but that would be very annoying and easy to forget

26208279
subtract	add
i m trying to write a simple program in assembly to add and subtract numbers

26208291
hide	show
and after i navigate to that page i have a button that i need to show hide depending on the target.id. in this case being btn

26208291
hide	show
if the btn is the target id i hide the button else i show the button something like below

26208291
google-chrome	firefox
now the issue is google-chrome handles the global event perfectly but firefox throws error

26208302

uitableview	nsindexpath
the signature for that method is for an nsindexpath and a uitableview

26208416
swift	objective-c
they exist in a weird halfway state between c++ members and objective-c blocks so you ll have to move any callbacks into an objective-c file and take a block or have some other means of calling back to swift

26208488
children	parent
related question - assume i have a 3 level self-referencing hierarchy implemented as advised by richardathome - i understand when i try to find a particular category it will also get me the parent category and all children categories

public	protected
as far as i know the most of spring methods which you need to intercept with aspectj for this purpose are protected or private whereas aspectj is for public methods only

26208539
free	memset	free	malloc	memset	malloc
one note to your code aseq you are using malloc without need here you can memset values on the stack as well and malloc can be expensive while stack allocation is often much faster and you do not free it

26208543
stdout	stderr
it works in command line where the input and output streams are simply tied to the command shell but not in tortoisehg where i ve read there is no actual stdin and stdout and stderr are simply placed into the ui output logs

26208557
width	height
and from that i make a nested loop which generates a grid width of 10 and height of 3

26208576
winpcap	wireshark
tools like wireshark are proof of that have a look at the winpcap library

26208611
for-loop	arrays

26208630
submit	submission
when i submit this form it will not highlight what hasn t been answered all it does is just reset upon submission

26208640

as said in comments javascript can t do this in a loop since fadein delay and fadeout are all asynchronous

26208822
folder	directory
look for the files directory and see what the user and the permissions are on that folder you can change with the chmod command to allow it to be written to by the web server but be careful what you do or you could cause a major headache for yourself like getting your wp blog hacked

26208831
swift	objective-c
swift works exactly the same way as objective-c but is reworked in the new language

26208837

integer	unsigned
note - to avoid integer overflow problems use an unsigned type for the hash value

26209020
for-loop	loops
i thought of doing a for-loop loops that goes through level 1 searches the root linked list if a letter is matched then search that linked list but would give me n 2 time

26209021
ubuntu	linux
i m not very familiar with python though and although i love ubuntu i m also not familiar with the process of downloading and installing stuff on linux as well

26209040

since you are using fixed widths for your tables and you re floating them i would wrap them in a container set the width on that to match all three tables+margin and set margin auto on the container

26209088
comparator	comparable
if child s should not be restricted on t one can use and cast to comparable in comparator method

26209107
int	chars
i figured the negative int portion is simple but i cannot figure out the chars input

26209142

also just to clarify it s not just the max and min but each layer of maxes and mins

26209171
submit	submission
i want to make it so that on the first submit the user go to my redictet page but on the second time not just to show this echo error invalid form submission or form already submitted

26209195
post	get
it works with get post and delete methods

26209229
division	addition
as a result the processing time for addition + and for division were both around 2500 nsec

26209229
division	addition
generally the division is more costly than addition i think but not much difference in this case

26209257

i have a requirement to set a c# datetimepicker control to change in range i want it to display only hour min second and i want the minimum value to be 10 seconds

26209260
children	parent
so that narayangarh is parent and pulchowk sahidchowk and lionschowk are children

osx	yosemite
i m currently on osx mountain lion but i m probably going to upgrade my os pretty soon either to mavericks or yosemite

26209313
versioning	upgrade
however looking through the various versioning i m probably going to have to upgrade command line tools for new versioning that are released and especially if i decide to upgrade my os

26209313
versioning	upgrade
given that new versioning are released fairly often and updating is required for an os upgrade making upgrading a pretty regular task it would seem that there would be an easier smoother way to upgrade

26209391
box-sizing	margin
if i put in a margin everything goes out of the grid because box-sizing only accounts for borders and padding

26209392
box-sizing	border-box
first of all with box-sizing border-box

26209394
textarea	textbox
another problem i have is that i want the textbox textarea on my custom shape to disappear when i click on the blank paper and just the label with its content stays visible on the element

you can explicitly convert an int to a double

26209405
int	double
you can explicitly convert a double to an int

26209417
portrait	landscape
the report has both landscape and portrait

26209417
portrait	landscape
now i have read that the only way to get around the #1 limitation is to have multiple reports some portrait and some landscape and combine the pdfs later on using something like itextsharp not a problem

26209438
width	height
i get the needed height but width goes ballistic

26209452
post	get
---it would take me some more studying to get the color input defined in a global way so that you can have four_squares c color but this post has a some example info on it help defining global names

26209464
int	double
this is the primary reason why implicit conversion from double to int is not implemented in a lot of strong-typed languages

26209464
int	double
the conversion of int to double actually increases the amount of information in the type and can thus always be done safely

26209490
children	parent
the pipeline ends when it detects the eof and for this you must close the unneeded descriptors once you have dupped it in the children and the parent

26209492
int	double
the range of double is wider than int

26209497
int	double
so you could cast an int to a double or an int to a long data type

26209497
int	double
casting from a double to an int however runs the risk of you losing data

26209523
disk	ram
i found this but i am not sure if is talking about ram or the hard disk

26209585
odoo	openerp	apache	nginx

nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
is it not possible to print exception nullpointerexception or any other runtimeexception in the catch block

26218940
setinterval	settimeout
it is better to use settimeout in this case than setinterval

26218940
setinterval	settimeout
the difference between the two is that setinterval schedules the function to execute forever every x milliseconds while settimeout schedules to execute once and then never again in this case the function sets a new timeout that keeps the updating process forever

26219065
hide	show
and when the onactivityresult is called hide fragment b and show fragment a

26219150
for-loop	loops
in python 2 the eachline variable you reused in the list comprehension loops is the same variable used in the outer for-loop so you end up with it still bound to the last line in your file

26219155
google-chrome	firefox
when i open in firefox google-chrome or ie the layout of the icon in front of the download text is different

26219160
post	get
the get and the post are different requests

26219160
post	get
what you get in the post request is only what comes from the form so only the deletedattributes model attribute and only the fields that are in the jsp

26219160
put	get
you need to put again the searchresults model attribute explicitely like you did in get method

26219291

26219371
filtering	grouping
the graph api allows to get the members of a grouping but adding filtering startswith fails as when adding the filtering the api returns only directory object which don t include for example displayname property.

26219371
filtering	grouping
i then would have to get a filtering resultset of user regardless of grouping membership using user list stuff in the api all members of the grouping and then fish out using linq the correct result set..

26219371
filtering	grouping
when i add a filtering to the same api call instead of returning the members users grouping and or contacts it returns directory objects that doesn t have displayname which are not really usefull in the above code unless i would query the api again in batch to retrieve the users displayname but that looks like a lot of overhead to me

26219405
width	height
adjust the height and width of the container to adjust the dimensions of the cropped img and adjust the amount of negative margin-top and margin-left on the img element itself to choose which part of the image to crop to

i am working on a responsive design and i started using firefox responsive design view with my media queries they all work on it..but when i start using safari on iphone5s it doesn t work

26219593
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this all renders nicely in google-chrome and firefox but in safari the green is lurid and the default text un-effected by the script is a washed out grey not the black i wanted

another version of this script show hide a pay now button is show to fail in chrome dev tools around where it modifies the appearance of the button

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it actually works in google-chrome firefox and safari with horrid green but again no joy in ie

26219593

for all intents and purposes the end result looks correct in google-chrome safari slightly off in terms of colours in safari and just doesn t work at all in internet explorer

26219600
width	height
surround the img tag in a dive with a overflow wit fixed width and height and apply a width or height depending on its orientation

26219620
width	margin
simply set your desired page width and set the left margin as half of the remainder

26219666
post	get
after a couple of days of breaking my head i eventually figured out the server did not have access-control-allow-origin for simple get post requests

26219685
traceroute	packets
the way traceroute works is it sends a packets with at ttl of 1 and sees how long it takes for an answer to arrive

26219685
traceroute	packets
then traceroute sends a packets with a ttl of 2 and then 3 and 4 etc. and sees how long it takes for an answer to arrive

26219722
children	parent
but as you criticised with the other answers a dynamic solution for multiple children will be hard to accomplish while using absolute positing as each child will absolute position from the top of the parent

you can make it with divs and add display table table-cell to the elements or you can make it with with width of the children to occupy the parent div 100 width

26219788
maven	pom.xml
this library appears to use maven and has a pom.xml file with a dependency set up as optional

however when i attempt to send to a gmail yahoo hotmail aol etc

26220092
min	max
as far as i know your only option is to manually check whether the min max limits are reached or not

26220092
min	max	width	height
you can use the size property of the ui object passed to the resize event callback to access the current width and height and the option method for accessing the min and max values

26220111
hide	show
note that such function is highly eligible for some refactoring for example to extract code to hide show existing form

26220133
nfa	dfa
the dfa generated from nfa has three states

26220133
nfa	dfa
existing implementations for regular expressions often allow backreferences not so re2 and use backtracking rather than nfa - dfa and are not therefore dfa the backtracking logic adds state similar to recursive call stack adding state

26220133
nfa	dfa
dfa that come from the nfa

26220133
nfa	dfa
any larger cases will still require nfa - dfa processing

26220133
nfa	dfa
it can still be converted to dfa but if you don t backtrack not a part of your standard dfa backtracking logic adds additional state your state space will be exponentially large and there is no general simple approach to directly convert to dfa you should really construct nfa first

26220174
strtol	strtok	fgets	strtol	fgets	strtok
if you don t know the number of inputs then you can make a function that counts how many numbers were entered by counting the number of whitespace after fgets then maybe use strtok to jump between whitespace and strtol to convert that into a number

26220315
for-loop	arrays
i know that .push does not just add on to the previous arrays but the only way they had to fix that was making a for-loop

26220327
rss	feed
optionally a directive can communicate with other directives in your application this could be useful if you define a rss feed directive and a rss news item for example

26220330
implements	extends
and put them in public static class placeholderfragment extends fragment implements view.onclicklistener

26220333
jar	manifest.mf
for example home usera zipfile.zip dira dirb jarfile.jar meta-inf manifest.mf accesses the jar file â œjarfile.jarâ inside zip file â œ home usera zipfile.zipâ

26220340
integer	fractions
if it was specified as q32.32 it would be unambiguous with 32 bits of integer and 32 bits of fractions

26220363
vbulletin	phpbb	vbulletin	ipb	ipb	phpbb
importing to vbulletin from phpbb might differ from ipb or xenforo

26220368
min	max	range	min	range	max
give the user 2 input type range elements to select their min max values

26220371
division	multiplication
i would also suggest you use . and . element-wise division multiplication powers etc - that way you can pass a vector of t rather than a single value

26220375
spaces	linefeed
that means tab linefeed vertical tab form feed carriage return and spaces

26220408
nsstring	nsobject
pfuser is not an nsstring it s a subclass of pfobject which again is a subclass of nsobject

lan	localhost
like many companies i have a public virtualhost listen on http 80 with multiple proxypass rules then multiple backend sites listening on localhost or lan ips

26220615
for-loop	arrays
i don t think the original for-loop meant to iterate over an arrays as you ve interpreted it so you should re-examine the intended use and context of the original code

26220670
postgresql	mysql
i m most interested in postgresql but i would also like to know if this is the case with other rdbms that support row-level locking such as oracle sql server and mysql

26220682
int	chars
you are passing int and checking for chars

26220682
int	chars
1 is int while 1 is chars in java

26220682
int	chars
in your code menu is int not chars so your cases should be case 1 and not case 1

26220682
int	chars
are compared with int value passed as menu which are obviously not going to be equal as ascii value of chars 1 is 81 while 82 for 2 so it is totally useless in this scenario

26220695
int	double
c# follows the lead of java s type system which ranks types int - long - float - double and specifies that any type which appears to the left of another may be cast to it

26220695
int	double
unfortunately his ranking has the unfortunate side-effect that passing an int or long to a method which is only overloaded for float and double will cause the method to use the float overload rather than the double overload

26220695
int	double
incidentally even if the people choosing which implicit conversions to allow had given the issue more thought it s unlikely that implicit conversions from floating-point types double to discrete types int would have been permitted

26220702
centos	linux
i m currently installing wso2emm on a linux centos 6.5 and it seems to work correctly

26220716

wildfly	undertow
in wildfly 8.1 i found activesessions attribute of jboss.as.expr deployment tcl.war subsystem undertow that returns the number of active sessions but i could not find a way to retrieve the list of session ids it seems this was provided by tomcat in boss 5.1 and maybe undertow does not provide an equivalence

26220965
slideup	slidedown
i believe what you might need is to use here is the slideup and slidedown effects

26220965
slideup	slidedown
with this effect you will have a nice and neat in and out animation of the sub-menu with no need to use two effect functions like delay .hide which will work also but slideup and slidedown will make it shorter in my opinion

26220978
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work when i tested with google-chrome but not firefox

the webkit documentation notes that a custom height and width can be specified

26221321
width	height
however the openerp webkit module does not appear to support direct entry of page height and page width

26221321
width	height
update the openerp webkit module to allow use of paper size type 30 and to specify page height and page width for webkit

26221368

you can do it in scheme and common lisp since they are multi paradigm languages and not purely functional

26221390
put	get
i get the sense from this thread that it s not a good idea to maintain reference to an entity for too long after a put as unexpected behavior might arise

26221660
folder	dir
you might want to try something like the wordpress cartridge does which is create a symlink using the deploy action hook to create a folder in your repo dir that is linked to your openshift_data_dir

26221737
int	chars
the problem is that in your switch you switch over an int but you have chars to define the single cases

26221737
int	chars
the reason this does not instantly throw an compile error is that a chars in java is saved as a normal int

26221755
width	height
you have to get the imageviews width programmatically and then set the height

26221755
width	height
this will get your imageview s width after its been drawn and set its height equal to it

26221783
folder	directory
i cannot understand why - i ve done a full-text search on local .ivy repo cache local .m2 repo cache the whole project directory cleaned them all manually invalidated the idea cache + restarted the ide and still i cannot find any reference to a file containing 0.1-snapshot except in the target folder which obviously means something is supplying this information but i cannot determine what that is

26221783

however i just can t get anything to post

26221942
setinterval	settimeout
however in the js standards it s explicitly stated that js is single-threaded in other words even though settimeout and setinterval are asynchronous they are not actually parallel in the sense that any of their code will be executing simultaneously with any other code

26221956
hide	show
i wanna it show fullscreen but i dont know how to make it i tried using preferreddisplaymode property of the splitviewcontroller the result is it just hide the master view but didnt resize the detailview

26222006
apache	nginx
you should try restarting apache or nginx

26222054
decoder	encoder
unicode can be more than one byte wide however your aes encoder decoder expects a string of single bytes

generally putc putchar is going to have a lot of overhead per byte written since there s a whole cycle of function call potential locking of the stdio stream stdout being targetted etc

26226305
printf	strlen
on the other hand functions like printf or puts have more overhead per call than putc printf has to process the format string and puts has to call strlen or equivalent but that overhead only happens once no matter how many bytes you re writing

26226496
memcached	apcu
your best bet is to implement nginx with apcu upgrade php to 5.5 if possible for better performance and use memcached and implement nginx s native microcaching abilities

it ll make it easier if you let the for-loop do its job and assign x directly instead of ignoring loops s index with _ and manually calculating x

26226639

remember each picture represents a div and when you click on next current div hide and div with second question show up

26236743
children	parent
even if the children of that div have opacity 1 they will appear with 0.4 because their parent has that opacity

26236749
min	max
we need to define the min and max when reading the first line

26236763
superclass	subclassing
if you make the method private in the superclass it won t be visible in the subclassing or to any one else

26236763
public	protected
you can t reduce visibility go from for instance public or protected to private in a subclass.

26236770

i have managed to get the vehicle manager section to load on the left so i can create the custom post type but i can t get the meta box s to show to enter the custom information for that post type if that makes sense

26237214
children	parent
this is more efficient than byran s answer because it only looks at one level at a time rather than loading all parent and checking all levels of children via find each time

26237215
versioning	upgrade
i can t upgrade to newer versioning of python due to it policy

26237223

i was looking into expanding images to make them fill the width given a certain height

26237242
comparator	comparable
in the collections chapter about the comparator interface the book provide this example of using both the comparator and the comparable interface to sort an array of student elements but the question is about the comparator

26237292
folder	directory
it seems it s not even possible to register types from libraries not located in different directory than bin folder

26237326
width	height
depending on orientation either width or height of the target size will be smaller

26237335

translation	localization
whatever i try i don t seem to get the words to appear in the translation file using xcode 6 export for localization

26237549

then xcode export for localization just ignores it completely and nothing about cost is added to the translation file at all so nothing gets translation

26237605
margin	height
i have tried various hacks found on stack that are supposed to make columns equal the height of the row xs-container margin padding etc. and then applying some positioning to the image div but none of them seem to produce the results i am looking for

possibly the ideal here would be that all your types of rates should inherited from a common type that contains their common properties but i can t detail how to do that without further information

26237814
google-chrome	firefox
it doesn t freeze in google-chrome or firefox

26237849
comparator	comparable
it is not at all uncommon however that you want to compare instances of a class that you do not control according to an order that the target class does not support natively whether by being comparable or by providing a comparator class

26237886
public	protected
class methods and properties fields are private by default unless explicitly set to public or protected or internal

word is a define for a 16 bits unsigned integer so your program has undefined behaviour since sscanf_s expects an unsigned integer

26238671
folder	dir
and after that apc was not loading still than i looked for extension dir directive in php.ini and it was pointing to old dir than i checked php exstensions dir and found there new folder named no-debug-non-zts-20100525

26238673

if it needs to be free you can get the latest released developer edition of ibm integration bus the new name for websphere message broker here or the beta release of ibm ib v.next here

26238754
int	double
that s because math.floor takes double as an argument and int by int division is already an int

26238783
build.gradle	gradlew
by default gradlew build.gradle usually looks like this

26238791
int	double
so java is trying to help you out by making your int into a double

26238791
int	double
then you re casting the double returned by math.floor back to an int

26238858
folder	directory
i suggest making a system variable named pythonpath that contains your python install directory probably something like c python27 and the sub-directories lib lib lib-tk and dlls directory within this folder as well

26238861
post	get
you re also missing some indents on but i m guessing that happened when putting the code into your post or it probably wouldn t have ran far enough to get the indexerror when writing a file

26238873
children	parent
it means that if you delete a parent in a fk relationship sql server will automatically delete all the children

26238875
nsmanagedobject	uimanageddocument

26238946
versioning	upgrade
to clarify in order to upgrade the php versioning i adjusted

26238981
int	double
if you divide distanceinmeter kilometer_in_meters and then assign it to a double it is first divided as int eger before assigned so you get a rounded down value cast to an double

26238981
int	double
sonar does not complain because of math.floor - it complains because you casted an integer-division result which itself is an rounded-down int eger into a double

26238982

getter	setter
if you are using dependency injection container like spring or guice a empty constructor with setter and getter allows you to wire references from and to your object

26239078
integer	unsigned
a good solution is to use explicit conversion to a wider unsigned integer type in order to by-pass integral promotion and then not use signed value with bitwise operators see associated answers of my previous question

26239131
min	max
you could also use a min max value + set value and do the progress calculation if that better suits your application

26239131

the switchover to nginx really had little to do with the rewrite rule and more to do with getting away from apache 2.2 default upstream version for centos however with nginx rewrite rules are more straight forward than apache s imo

26239770
direct3d	direct2d
instead wpf uses its own renderer based if i m not mistaken on direct2d and direct3d

26239775

orb	keypoint
i used opencv s orb detector to detect the keypoint and used the normalized hamming distance as the distance measure for similarity as this is a binary descriptor

26240296
width	height
you can use viewport units that vary based on the defined container s size width and or height

26240296
width	height
vmin - relative to viewport s width or height whichever is the smaller

26240296
width	height
vmax - relative to viewport s width or height whichever is the larger

26240296
width	height
when the height or width of the initial containing block is changed they are scaled accordingly

free	malloc
possibly a duplicate of this question linkedlist - how to free the memory allocated using malloc

26240333
google-chrome	firefox
from the research i ve done on the subject 32-bit browsers firefox google-chrome etc. should be able to handle 4.29 billion elements so i don t see the data size as an issue especially as the response from the file upload contains all the elements

26240333

forks on github are great when you expect to have multiple developers pushing and pulling or when you don t have the ability to simply push a branch to the original repo and open a pull request

26240684
pull	push
typically your developers would work locally on a feature branch push that branch to the shared remote and then open a github pull request to merge that branch into master

super	implements
overriding is for those instance methods only which are visible to child class.since the super class setupanimationframes method is private it is not visible to child class and hence overriding doesn t apply here.you are implements your own method here.just remove override annotation for the code to compile

26241253
width	height
but if i set width to the 0 in storyboard and height to 10 points by some reason sdk thinks that height also should equal 0 after pressing button and invocation code above

26241253
width	height
when i set uiview s width to zero in storyboard and then try to increment it by pressing button the width is incrementing but by some reason height is equal to zero but in stroryboard it has 10 pt

26241348
stdout	stderr
if you want to differentiate between error output and normal output for a program that correctly uses standard streams stdout stderr you can do this with minor changes to the syntax

26241348
stdout	stderr
stderr to file and suppress stdout

26241348
stdout	stderr
stdout to file and suppress stderr

26241348
stdout	stderr
stdout to one file and stderr to another file

26241348
stdout	stderr
i started noticing weird behavior when writing console apps that wrote directly to stderr and realized that if i wanted my error output to go to the same file when using basic piping i either had to combine streams 1 and 2 or just use stdout

26241348
stdout	stderr
therefore if you want all stdout and stderr piped into the same stream make sure to use that like so

typedef	typename
typedef typename map key_type k

26241552
chown	chmod
in your case i think that in order for it to be able to create new files in the given directory you would want to add a -r flag to chmod or chown and call it on the directory itself rather than the children -- that way if php has to create the file it has permissions to do so

26242366
getter	setter
they support class fields which you could access via getter and setter in the usual way though i have not tested this

26242366
hide	show
this show that you can hide the member methods of the original class or record with a class or record helper

26242366
getter	setter
so in a way you would just treat access to the original data members just the same as you would in changing values from within the unit in which a class is declared by changing through the properties rather than the fields directly so the appropriate actions are taken by the getter and setter of that data

26242385
nsjsonserialization	nserror
if you log the nserror passed into nsjsonserialization it should say much the same

26242392
for-loop	loops
you can add the bounce requirement to the for-loop and remove the while loops

26244992
implements	extends
if you wanted to use the public onedrive offering and do some manual group management you can look into the livesdk which are available to all consumer onedrive accounts however the experience will require a lot more footwork and i m not sure the full extends of your scenario that you ll be able to implements but this should meet your cost management requirements

26245004
subtract	add
while the next character is a + or a - skip it evaluate an additional term and add or subtract the new value to the previous value

26245031
int	double

i have two questions about tcpclient and its underlying networkstream

26252175
tcpclient	networkstream
closing tcpclient does not release the networkstream. however also for .net framework 4.5 here says that calling this method tcpclient.close will eventually result in the close of the associated socket and will also close the associated networkstream that is used to send and receive data if one was created. i am very confused now

however that s sounds like something that should be done in your data model a relationship between dept - category classic reflexive relationship parent - children

26253226
cpu	processors
if the interface is implemented in software exceeding these timings will be simple in most cases not only will the processors gpio have frequency limits that may make timings lower than this unlikely the cpu instruction cycle time and the number of instructions needed to generate the signals are likely to prevent you getting anywhere close to these minimum timings

26253231

this kind of loops would improve when updated to range for-loop

26258900
for-loop	loops
the first loops in the answer most probably would not improve in performance but would in clarity the reader of the code would know that the code is meant to iterate all the collection and not skip some elements in the old way you could recognize the for-each pattern in the for-loop but it s tedious and could lead to erroneous conclusions probably in the body are modifying the index or the iterator about the code if not careful

26260070
post	get
in this case if a user is making a new thread at website.com philosophy and he refreshes multiple website.com philosophy screens he will get the message saying on all of them rather than just 1 for a short valid period and can even stack messages so if he tried to post twice from website.com philosophy and both failed he d get two messages that two post attemps failed rather than risking having the messages actually be swaped for the different post which can happen if the first message s redirection took longer than the second message redirection

26260099

in some cases these isr detects conditions for which a sleeping freertos task should be waked up with at least possible latency

my application supports both portrait and landscape orientation and uses autolayout

26268743
portrait	landscape
the keyboard s orientation is correct for landscape orientation but it s frame width is the same width as expected for portrait orientation

26268750
irc	xmpp
for example we might be in an irc channel together or an xmpp jabber chat network and decide we want a peer-to-peer communication to avoid eavesdropping or to share giant spreadsheet files or to play a game without huge lag

26268777
inherited	subclassing
the rationale that you included is reasonably clear naturally virtual functions are meant to be overridden by subclassing so you as the designer of the base class should make it as easy as possible for people who inherited your class to provide a suitable override

26268792
ng-show	ng-hide
i still would love to know how someone would go about manipulating the dom after an ng-show ng-hide but in the meantime i was able to produce the effect i am looking for by simply wrapping my element in another div that is position fixed and then just using text-align center to center the smaller div within that

26268863
awt	swing
make sure you are calling super.paintcomponent within the paintcomponent method before you do any custom painting see painting in awt and swing for more details

if i have a loops any loops ..lets say a for-loop for now

26268919
for-loop	loops
rewrite the for-loop below as a do-while loops

26269065

26269205
hide	show
implement the -navigationcontroller willshowviewcontroller animated method to show or hide the navigation bar based on whether it is showing the root view controller

26269226
getter	setter
since your class is a simple container for two values with both getter and setter it doesn t achieve any encapsulation and could be more simply written as

26269243
children	parent
i d say that the array must first be built into a heap using a typical buildheap function which starts at half the length of the array and calls a minheapify function to ensure each parent is at least less than its children

26269263
int	chars
the c-style cast would allow an int pointer to point to a chars

26269426
int	chars	unsigned	short
i was under the impression that a chars is the same as a short short unsigned int would be allowing any value from 0 to 255

26269464
int	chars
if not i dont understand how my code is able to print out the chars since i write it all in one line...does it assign the int letter a new value everytime there is a space

26269504
sequence	permutation
if i understand your problem correctly you need to find all the permutation of a circular sequence which can be generated by selecting a non-overlapping set of adjacent pairs and swapping the two elements in each pair

26269541
hide	show
i have been working with a jquery script that i ve found that allows me show hide the content to with jquery dotdotdot for multiple nested floated columns

26269554
folder	directory
if the file exists in the target directory it will be moved to a trash folder

express	node.js
this is in my routes product.js file in my node.js express project which is using express-myconnection

26269901
draggable	droppable
i am familiar with using draggable and droppable and registering an original container however on drop the dragged object is moved from it s origin

26269914
for-loop	loops
also don t iterate something like that and your condition in the for-loop basically creates an infinite loops which is also bad

26269920
textview	imageview
for a layout that contains textview and one imageview

26269946
calloc	malloc
a note if you use to calloc instead of malloc to allocate memory the contents will be initialized to 0

26270058
width	height
on the other hand it s also much better - in ios 8 rotation means that the screen the window the root view controller s view all simply change size they swap their height and width - and that means that if your app launches into landscape it has the correct dimensions right from the start

26270129
for-loop	loops
for example if i have a long for-loop i would like to have this progress bar as it runs through the loops

26270141
kerberos	ntlm
with respect to specifying windows authentication kerberos not just ntlm

26270188

a 2nd question is can i move the definitions of the lambda functions out of the for-loop and use them to construct the two threads then join inside loops

26270200
getter	setter
my treenodes have key left right and iteration fields as well as getter setter functions

26270213
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you name them with mixed case they will work on the simulator but not the device because the mac s default formatting is case-insensitive but the ios format is case-sensitive

26270220
stdout	fflush
you need to just write out a single # and then fflush the tty aka asking the console to pull from stdout and update

26270221
move	drag
i have tried to using drag and drop or move feature s tools in qgis but very slowly and cause no response hung

there are five standard signed int types â œ signed chars â â œ short

26270471

the override modifier is required to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method properties indexer or event.so to aceive overriding you have to use override keyword which you are using in second example

26270510
int	chars
it is entirely possible for signed chars short int long and long long to all have the same 64-bit representation which will have size 1

26270510
int	chars
edit add user657267 s link 1 sizeof chars sizeof short sizeof int sizeof long sizeof long long which also includes the specific bit size requirements though note that only the value ranges are normative

26270804
hide	show
i ve a code that show hide toggle a div based on checkbox selection

26271034
google-chrome	firefox
that means that the svg s height should be and is in google-chrome firefox 40px

26271044

put	get
the get in getlikeurls and the put in likelinks are both asynchronous

26272132
puts	gets
the puts could return before the gets which would be a problem in your case

26272132
put	get
for example the 3rd get put might return before the 1st get put in your loops

26272132
put	get	puts	gets
you could use .ajax to specify that the gets and puts are synchronous but this is ill advised because the browser will hang if any get put doesn t return in a reasonable amount of time server is offline

pop-up	dialog
this information is used e.g by browser as well and they pop-up a dialog with message server says wallyworld which is realm name

26275335
post	get
i guess the core of your issue is that when the user is redirected to the google login page google doesn t really hand them back to your application using a post i think it will simply be a get so in summary i doubt the google login will preserve your original post signature and replay it back to your application once the user is authenticated

26275335
hide	show
so one approach you can go about this is to hide the sign form if the user is not logged in and show then a message asking them to click the login link

26275365
icmp	tcp
icmp is a protocol within the tcp ip stack that exist basically to provide control troubleshooting and error messages

26275365

it runs over ip like tcp and udp do but is a network-layer protocol like ip rather than a transport layer protocol like tcp and udp are

26275365
icmp	tcp	icmp	udp	udp	tcp
icmp is a control protocol that is considered to be an integral part of ip although it is architecturally layered upon ip it uses ip to carry its data end-to-end just as a transport protocol like tcp or udp does

slider	mmenu
plus mmenu seems pretty neat - if i could only figure how it slider the way i want

26275429

pyenv	virtualenv
you should also install pyenv virtualenv so you can use a virtualenv for your project not strictly essential but virtual environments are a great idea and you should always use one with pyenv they re practically effortless

26275608
pyenv	virtualenv
one of the neat things about pyenv is the pyenv local command which specifies which version of python or which virtualenv should be used for a folder and subfolders once you ve used pyenv local in your project folder to set the python version any time you use the python command it ll use the version set by pyenv local

26275608
pyenv	virtualenv
it s not needed if you only install one version of python and don t use a virtualenv in that case you can use pyenv global to set the version for the user

26275608
pyenv	virtualenv
having installed pyenv and pyenv virtualenv you would then use it to install the same version of python as is used on your development machine the commands you d run would be something like this

26275816
width	height
what you have to do check the dimensions of the image calculate which is the limiting factor width or height then set this limiting factor on the image object and also set lockaspectratio

26275816
width	height
or set both width and height and leave lockaspectratio off

26275816
width	height
width will then be 50 of the height

26275842
put	get
i have a few thoughts and this is very subjective so your mileage ond other readers mileage may vary but hopefully it will still get the ball rolling for you even if other folks want to put differing points of view.

i have two implementations of sort one being heapsort and second one quicksort

26276285
put	get
my first try at this involved sorting the data by the column a and then looping through the data until i found the first cell with dept1 and then put this cell address into a variable but i also need to id the last dept1 value so i can get the row number for this

26276296
rar	zip
one more thing to add by archiving i mean compressing file in zip rar format to save disk space

26276335

but in a situation when parent element has no id but you still want to use queryselectorall to get immediate children - it is also possible to use scope to reference element like this

26276341
min	max
erhu_h3_btn.startdrag new rectangle false 0 min 0 max

26276341
min	max
needs to be erhu_h3_btn.startdrag false new rectangle 0 min 0 max

26276380

the jtextpanes are wrapped first in a panel that uses the grouplayout supplied with the netbeans gui builder and then in a panel that uses a boxlayout

26276955
kerberos	ldap
then you want kerberos and not ldap bind

26276958

talking about the separator for a double is like talking about whether an int is in decimal or hex - there s no such concept

26277098

26277390
udp	tcp
don t know weather the port is a tcp or udp port before checking

26277420
division	subtraction
the subtraction and division functions don t have this property largely because they have a special case for one argument since it s more convenient to have 2 return 1 2 than to return 2 and more convenient to have - 2 return -2 than 2

26277420
division	subtraction
however subtraction and division don t have this property

26277420
division	subtraction
note that a right-associative reduce puts the identity element where you want it in the division and subtraction case since you end up turning a b c d into

26277420
division	subtraction
for division and subtraction you probably want a left-associative reduce

26277420
division	subtraction
the problem of course is that for division and subtraction we really want the initial value to be placed at the end

26277424

26278021
for-loop	loops
from your code it shows that you have added click listener outside your loops so it will always set click listener for the lastly added view only as the for-loop gets executed

26278037
esapi	opensaml
it looks like that the opensaml library has a dependency on esapi 2.0.1 and what could be happening is that esapi-2.0-rc5.jar gets loaded before opensaml s dependency

26278037
esapi	opensaml
the only guidance that s really possible for someone who can t clone your environment is to try downloading the source for opensaml and build it after updating its dependency management to point to your version of esapi

26278114

if you click on connect button then the ipcamerafactory.getcamera will be called which is for connecting to the specified camera using the arguments rtsp rtp http messages in the background

26278250
put	get
parsing is done recursively as well this is why you can get nested tags and parser.parse will manage to find the proper matching closing tag because when it does parsing and stumbles on a tag it calls do_tag thing which in turn will call the parser.parse again to find the nearest closing tag and will wrap everything into a node return a node the higher parser.parse will put it on a node list and will continue to search for the closing tag

26278291
for-loop	loops
obviously there s more than 1 way to do it for example i can replace the foreach loops with a for-loop

you could use a combination of fadeout and fadein

superclass	subclassing
if i use this- privatefunctionname for non-static function it could be in the superclass base class or in that subclassing itself

26278393

the tricky part is that the height of the images in box1 and box3 are relative to the width of the viewport and makes the container larger than the browser window

26278410
ready	each
of course if in each card you use only document ready it doesn t make much sense to do it this way you should merge document.ready to one and in each js file display only alert foo

26279685
width	height
the next time you set the width and height to non-zero values any drawing you do on it immediately will be ignored even though its width and height are now non-zero and it can be seen in the element tree and hover-highlighted in the page in chrome s debugger

26279685
width	height
use settimeout or similar to delay drawing on the canvas so you don t do it immediately after setting width height or

26279685

make sure you never set the canvas to zero width height

26279847
min	max
in terms of color in order for the colormap to be scaled properly it is probably best in this case to set your limits vmin and vmax because when automatically set it will use the min and max of z but in this case they are both nan so you could use np.nanmin and np.nanmax

int	chars
since an unsigned chars can only represent the latter range it s common for read functions to use an int as their return value

26280265
int	chars
this does indeed return an int so you need to ensure that the return value is stored in an int before it s compared but cast to an unsigned chars before it s stored

26280290

i guess i have to use with recursive query but all the examples i ve found use the where clause so i have to put to get the result only for that particular row

26280439
inherited	properties
if the currentcolor keyword is set on the color properties itself it is treated as color inherited

26280439
inherited	properties
and then it appears you attached the keyword currentcolor to all of the division elements when you tried to add a border and box-shadow shown below with currentcolor but border and box-shadow were already assigned a color in div nth-child 1 and likely initiated the default mode color inherited for all properties of the division and created a change in the structure of the content block

26280460
versioning	upgrade
you just need to upgrade your .net framework to ver 4.5 in your iis 7.5 server you do that using the microsoft web installer do a search for .net and then installed the .net framework versioning 4.5 and the all the apps that target that versioning will work

to toggle the visibility of a widget use the show and hide methods or map and unmap if you don t want the other widgets in your window to move around

26280879
spaces	delimiter
i would have thought along the lines that if delimiter are non spaces chars that in the above text then all alphabetic chars serve as delimiter so maybe there should be 21 tokens if we are matching

26280892
junit	mockito
if you can use mockito in combination with junit your test could look like this

26280893
crypt	salt
actually it is the crypt function doing it so your code will include the salt as well

what i try to do in javascript is to show only specific elements and hide the others like this

26281667
for-loop	loops
the for-loop can be changes to a for-in loops eliminating the index variable i

26281707
integer	unsigned
i have solved this issue by having a few flags within an 32 bit unsigned integer

26281713
lodash	underscore.js

26281862
min	max
there are more calculations i need to do and add to the new dataframe such as the monthly min max and mean of salinity temperature etc.

26281883
folder	directory
but if you use this class in another class it is better to have the whole directory eg c programdata connors file inputfile.txt this is an example so the easiest thing to get the directory is go to the folder it is in right click on the file properties and copy the directory and add inputfile.txt

26281885
filtering	grouping
on the grouping properties you need to filtering the column with your parameter

26281889

now in order to have those views correctly rendered i need to set style attributes on the enclosing i use leaflet.js in one of those views and thus i need to temporarily set the width and height of the container to 100 for a full screen map

26281923
min	max
i would suggest indexing both the min and max price for each product as separate computed fields decimal in the index

26281926
width	height
what you could do is to reduce the timer interval or instead of opening the webpage with the activity starter just stay in the webviewer and set its height and width to fill parent which is -2 in the blocks editor and hide all the other components on the screen to be able to view only that webpage in full screen

26281930

26281935
flask	pyramid
the site will be probably be in flask possibly pyramid deployed under nginx

26281947

26282077
maven	pom.xml
to solve the problem i made sure that my maven pom.xml file imported xml-graphics-common i before i fop so that its defaults took precedence and at that point everything sprang to life

26282148
udp	tcp
in practice you may be only interested in tcp ip sockets but there are also udp ip sockets unix domain sockets and others

26282148
udp	tcp
for other protocols or levels you can use getprotoent to obtain the protocol number from its name or check the manual of the protocol - for example in the manual page of ip are described the constants for the protocol numbers of ip ipproto_ip tcp ipproto_tcp and udp ipproto_udp while the manual page of unix sockets says that for historial reasons its protocol options must be set using sol_socket too

26282148
udp	tcp
and of course the options supported by each of the protocols is in their manuals ip tcp udp unix sockets .

26282260
rpm	yum
yum install snort-2.9.6.2-1.centos6.x86_64.rpm would not work because it needed version 1.11-1.2.el6 and the current version is 1.12-6.el6 so i had to download the rpm and from

it was to create a simple calculator which can add subtract multiplying divide various numbers from user input

26282800
for-loop	arrays
i was thinking of doing a for-loop to go through the arrays and determine where in the arrays a character is stored

26282832
maven	pom.xml
the expected result is to somehow configure pom.xml so that maven plugins in eclipse can be executed cleanly

26282833
maven	pom.xml
to let maven know about the new source folder for building a jar i had to add the following to my pom.xml

26282860
jar	manifest.mf
you find that class name if you extract the jar file s meta-inf manifest.mf open the jar with any zip tool

26282902
gprof	google-perftools
in c we have a ton of options gprof cachegrind google-perftools oprofile

26282963
f2py	lapack
i see other people have asked about using f2py directly with lapack modules but here i am using a lapack function from within another piece of fortran code

26282984
implements	extends
public class tabpageradapter extends fragmentstatepageradapter implements simplegesturelistener

26282985
maven	m2e
m2e maven integration for eclipse does this the option is called resolve dependencies from workspace

26282985
maven	m2e
gradle eclipse plugin has an option called remap jars to maven projects but that seems to do this for pom-driven m2e projects not other gradle projects

26283061
children	parent
if the parent ends the children won t implictly die but live on

26283154
width	height
fiddling with width and height attributes and the styling did nothing for me

26283154
width	height
i ended up writing a function to calculate the width and height i needed on page load then writing the iframe into the innerhtml of the contain div element

26283156
flask	django
hope this helps i have a feeling that this may be similar in flask and in django

26283181
build.gradle	gradlew
you can drop that into your libs directory and amend your gradlew build.gradle file to include it

26283248
int	chars
you should use int or null in count func not chars and other types

26283254
google-chrome	firefox
that looks fine to me in both firefox and google-chrome

26283265
google-chrome	firefox
edit firefox and google-chrome 37 appear to return getboundingclientrect read-write by default

26283278
put	get
but i am not sure how and if it will work to just declare the variable and not use it anywhere within the .dll then when everything is put together it will call the courier_list from the management pack and not get confused between the two same name variables

26283289
int	chars
but someone told me that it was more easy to use a union containing an int and an array of four chars if an int is stored on 4 chars fill the int and then reverse the array

26283343
spaces	delimiter
i m trying to take user input containing a bunch of spaces delimiter 1-3 digit numbers using scanf and storing them into an int array and printing each seperate one on a new line to test but it s not working

26283351
folder	directory
however the directory usr libexec webmin folder doesn t give the clone a new name it just uses the existing directory and adds a number to the end of the directory

26283371
folder	directory
check in your .idea folder the directory dictionaries inside you will have a username.xml file mine is marco.xml for example which contains your custom words

26283434
ant	maven
jenkins runs on a per build basis via a build manager maven ant dos scripts

26283436
width	height
information from file shape radius height width color filled

26283436
width	height
default values are color white filled false radius 1 height 1 width 1

26283446
integer	radix
if x is not a number or if base is given then i must be a string or unicode object representing an integer literal in radix base

26283590
minimum	max
warning max 256 open files allowed minimum of 40 000 recommended

26283621
installation	upgrade
or you can upgrade the installation of java that maven is trying to use to run it

26283631
hide	show
when you need to show the waiting cursor use body .addclass waiting and body .removeclass waiting to hide

26283692
hash	md5
to expand on my other statement about a hash value possibly relating to multiple original values lets take a look at md5

26283692
hash	md5
md5 is a 128-bit hash

26283692
hash	md5
you will see many oss project provide binary downloads that also have an md5 and or sha-2 hash values

26283692
hash	md5
again since the odds of two files matching another is 1 in 340 282 366 920 938 463 463 374 607 431 768 211 456 the odds of a hacker successfully generating a file of the same size with a bad payload that hash to the exact same md5 sha-2 hash is pretty low

26283723
versioning	upgrade
so i upgrade elasticsearch 1.3.2 to newer versioning

26283723
elasticsearch	kibana
kibana 4 is not working and i messed up my old elasticsearch and kibana3 also

26283723
elasticsearch	kibana
problems with elasticsearch 1.3.2 and kibana 3

26283769
rss	feed
there is a tedious way to get more information from the rss feed parse the rss feed to get the link in the element once the link is received you can webscrape the url to fetch more data from it but then wouldn t recommend it

26283769
rss	feed
rss aggregrator would then search the registered websites for information and provide you in the form of feed

26283784
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
not only that but it has a show hide accordion that uses slideup and slidedown

26283784
slideup	slidedown
when i do that it ends up above or below the other page content and doesn t push it with slideup and slidedown

26283789
google-chrome	safari
this works fine in all browsers locally but when deployed to the server does not work in google-chrome and safari this is the snippet

26283795
width	margin
if you want to add some space to the left use margin which will give space without effecting the width

26283803
hide	show
however i still need to figure out the best way to do part 2 - the show hide functionality

26283869
mouseover	mouseleave
using delegate instead of mouseover and mouseleave events

26283871
width	height
the actual dimensions might be different but the width and height i am feeding to scale also tried resize method could be higher or lesser actual dimensions

26283966
ant	maven
i ve installed the java jdk maven ant android sdk bundled with eclipse and am using mac os x mavericks 10.9.5

26283976
google-chrome	firefox
the following cookie making code works in firefox and explorer but not in google-chrome

26283976
google-chrome	firefox
the alert allcookies pops up and shows the cookies in firefox and explorer but is completely blank in google-chrome

26283980
google-chrome	firefox
however if xcode is not found in localstorage the result and only in google-chrome it seems firefox works fine and leaves things in default is that the value attribute is completely erased

26284010
min	max
because of the data dependencies and the low computational requirements this is unlikely to ever give you much of a speedup in multicore - however you can do something by calculating within each chunk of the array the local min max and local region best and then compare that across chunks

26284060
swift	objective-c
it is possible to share swift style enums between swift and objective-c using ns_enum

26284060
swift	objective-c
they just need to be defined in an objective-c context using ns_enum and they are made available using swift dot notation

26284060
swift	objective-c
from the using swift with cocoa and objective-c

26284061
post	get
does get a header object getheader is a method i found in a different post here

26284084
createelement	each
rather than coding each input from the start you should dynamically create them with the js function using createelement

26284129
for-loop	loops
the for-loop condition is incorrect as i never becomes 0 inside loops body

26284145
subtract	add
hi im having a problem with my mysql trigger syntax i want it to update my copy_instock row on new transaction_id when movie is hired to subtract 1 from copy_instock then update when movie is returned to add 1 back on to copy_instock

26284148

26284206
puma	webrick
in webrick and puma it works flawlessly

26284243
hide	show
when i click next i want to hide the active button which is the first one this case and then show the next one

26284272
for-loop	loops
a while loops with len-- instead of a for-loop with i++

26284280
put	get	post	get	post	put
not using sub-resources causes us to have to put multiple get put post delete methods into the same class as we promote methods from lower level resources up to the top-most resource class

26284280
put	get	post	get	post	put
to avoid multiple get post put delete methods in the same class we could still break these into 4 different classes each with unique path annotations on the class but then if some term in the path such as containers needed renamed we would have to update the code in 4 places instead of one place

26284280
put	get	post	get	post	put
sub-resources provide an elegant solution that 1 allows each level in the path to have it s own class with single get put post delete methods 2 does not require redefining levels in the path in multiple places and 3 does not require redefining query parameters on every method

26284283
width	height
you can try to specify the width and height attributes in your image tag

26284300
int	boolean	for-loop	if-statement	for-loop	arrays
the commented out piece of code in the if-statement within the nested for-loop gives me the correct boolean statements it shows the int which aren t prime numbers when running it however the last for-loop within main seems to just show the initial values given to the prime arrays - so i assume the results from the computeprimenumbers are being overwritten somehow somewhere

26284306
width	height
then you can wrap the select in a container which you have already and style the container to look like your select box and then make the select inside the full height and width of the container so that clicking on it still triggers the action

26284377
tablelayout	margins
unfortunately using tablelayout doesn t allow you to manage margins and width as i wish.

26284386
ubuntu	linux
i want to make some modifications to my adb_usb.ini to detect android device how ever i could not find the same in linux machine ubuntu os

26284499
swift	objective-c
i m not sure of the exact equivalent in swift but the following is how i would do it in objective-c

26284521
mouseleave	mouseenter
basically i changed it from hover to mouseenter and mouseleave because your state is more dependent on the location of the mouse after you click on the close button

26284546
plot	heatmap
i have two plot a heatmap and a contour plot from the same data

26284574
hide	show

show hide it

26284662
hide	show
when i press the btnfrm1 it need to open form2 and hide the form1 when i press the btnfrm2 it needs to show the form1 again and close the form2

26284680
folder	directory
it would appear the txt file was not supposed to be in the main directory rather it went in the debug folder and worked fine

26284682
addclass	removeclass
also you should be explicit with addclass removeclass in the hover function especially if the state can be toggled elsewhere

26284704
hide	show
then i removed the hide class the first time to the popover is show

26284735
width	height
the spritenode has an explicit height set on it the height returned by and has the same width as the labelnode

26284746
width	height
similar to what ern0 said if you are manipulating height and width in your script and are experiencing slowness then changing from using jquery s height and .width methods to vanilla js could realize a significant performance improvement

26284746
width	height
the height and width properties and methods should be pretty much the same

26284746
width	height
if you want to add performance benchmarks for them too that is fine but you should get the same outcome with the width properties and methods finishing in the same place as their corresponding height counterparts

26284794
folder	directory
i have also tried to add the folder containing the source files to the gdb source path by using the directory command

26284808
spaces	delimiter
read the input file and using the spaces as delimiter default behaviour in for f use the first field as key and the second as value once the second for removes and

teamcity	octopack
teamcity procuded 2 nuget packages one by octopack for dev another by nuget pack for prod with cspkg

26284904
for-loop	arrays
the issue is that your for-loop never runs because you are calling .length on an object and not on an arrays

26284957
vb.net	vb6
in vb6 and vb.net you can just do the following to force byval on a byref parameter

26285003
int	double
first time with rand and having some problems with my functions my professor told me to put the accuracy so you would only need one function and it would input the players accuracy from the function call but i am getting an error invalid operands of types int and double to binary operator i am confused because accuracy is a number

26285044
implements	extends
or you can have your customadapter which extends baseadapter and implements its abstract method

26285252
swift	objective-c
this is the correct way to pass a closure an objective-c block to a function in swift

26285254
vtk	itk
so far i successfully compiled itk vtk and got the wikiexamples to compile and run as well

26285256
for-loop	loops
what you have in your above code is a nested for-loop - a loops inside another loops described below

26285256
for-loop	loops
you have two variables to pay attention to because you have two for loops count in the first for-loop used by the second

26285299
int	double
however cv point2f is actually where t can be int float double etc

26285302

all of it lines up correctly in firefox but the google font lato that i m using only works in google-chrome

26286796
hide	show
as per my understanding you want corresponding div2 to show and to hide div1 when li is tapped example- on tap event on item2 div1 of item2 should hide and div2 of item2 should be visible

26286796
hide	show
and you want to show div1 and hide div2 only when user taps somewhere outside the li outside any li mentioned in your question

26286806
tcpclient	networkstream
as for each client connected there is a tcpclient and a networkstream

you can return control to the browser s event loop while making sure that some code will run by scheduling that function either with settimeout or setinterval

26302051
setinterval	clearinterval

26303098
google-chrome	firefox
as indicated in the google-chrome code firefox version 32 as of writing works in a similar way

26303112
background-position	background-size
it appears there is no way to do this with pure css but for people who might want a javascript solution i ve found that filtering the background of the child setting the background-size to that of the parent and setting the background-position to the negative amounts the image is offset from the background you want to filter

typedef	struct
from my previous question groups inside struct after creating typedef struct i tried to form an interface from 5 different channel signal declarations the struct

26304358

public class loaderactivity extends fragment implements

26304415
implements	extends
i would like to generate a customized dao which extends classa and implements sampleinterface

26304417
folder	directory
to fix that you should change the permissions on the folder to make it writable or specify a different directory to which the script should create the needed file

26304450
integer	unsigned
well your loop looks fine at the first glance but the constant 1 is not a 64 bit integer so you have to cast to to a unsigned long long

26304486
children	parent
i m pretty new to xslt and did some reading but i cannot seem to find a way to grab the parent + all its children

26304531

the problem i am trying to solve is to offer the customer a list of searchable attributes from their ad installation and allow them to specify search filtering to narrow down the list of users or grouping to choose from

26304669
union	distinct
you can t really get around the need for a union if you really want both sets of rows i ve added a union all inside the main sql and a distinct outside to remove duplicates but with no extra sort operations assuming you want to do that

26304694
inherited	properties
how can i make the object inherited all the properties from the other object

26304716
button	checkbox
i also have another function that adds a class to the button if a checkbox is checked

26304722
lodash	underscore.js
assuming you intended the value of the 123 key in the output to be a hash rather than an array then without either underscore.js or lodash

26304722
lodash	underscore.js
or do the obvious rewrite using underscore.js lodash equivalents

26304727
erlang	elixir
as i understand it cowboy is a web server albeit in erlang not elixir and phoenix is a framework for building web apps but where does plug come in

26304810
hide	show
i understand that i can probably hide everything in css and then show it after my code is executed but that s not really the solution i m looking for

26304816
google-chrome	firefox
i ve used this css-only solution which works in ie firefox and google-chrome

26304816
width	height
use height width to control text and button dimensions

26304827
google-chrome	firefox
not a problem in ie9 but google-chrome and firefox seems to be affected

26304833
pthreads	fork
the pure pthreads bourne shell solution without unportable bashisms like or arrays or and without expensive fork to external programs -- works in any modern shell

portrait	landscape
for some reason when the app goes from portrait to landscape the webview remains in the same position and there is a large dark area to the left of the screen

26304899
apache	nginx
nginx doesn t use it file is ignored and treated like any other and apache config rules don t apply to nginx

26304921
hide	show
if you can support modern browsers and you need to maintain heights for some reason then you may want to use and instead of display to hide show your content

26304934
put	get
the closest that you can get is to put a script tag right after the element that you want to work with but even then the user might see the element for a little while

26304965
post	get
the point is that i want a restful auth auth service only where i post the credentials over https and get back a success plus a cookie or sessionid or whatever i need here or 401 403 or 419 error

26304996
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox both have a portable app version

26305175
width	height
this is a reference quantity and does not normally correspond to the height or width of any letter

26305224
folder	directory
the reason i still use web optimizer is because it can have different bundles for files in the same directory in comparison that cassette default one bundle per folder which does not work sometimes for example many different themes are in just one folder because they share files

26305286
plot	errorbar
another solution is to use a scatter plot within your errorbar plot like in this question

26305302
keydown	keyup
the only way i can think of without using blur change keypress keyup or keydown events is using a setinterval demo

26305338
cos	sin
at each step choose a point in the plane spanned by the first two coordinate vectors take w1 cos t v1 + sin t v2

26305351
pull	push
you could set up a private docker registry and then push to pull from that local repository

26305351
pull	push
this may ultimately be the easiest if that is something that you want to do fairly often because you re just using standard docker push docker pull commands

26305383
jslint	grunt-contrib-jshint
when i just installed grunt-contrib-jshint normally i got version 0.10.0 and had the same problem as op because 0.10.0 depends on jslint 2.5.0

26305383
jslint	grunt-contrib-jshint
when i instead installed grunt-contrib-jshint 0.9.2 the last release that used jslint 2.4.0 instead my results lit up with a bunch of indentation errors as expected

26305413
put	get
simply put you store it so that you can get at the data

26305446
min	max
i added a configuration class to set the min max age as well as a basic descriptor

26305464
gobject	dbus
i m using glib and gobject introspection in python so i d prefer a glib solution over a dbus one if possible but anything that works will help

26305464
versioning	upgrade
at this time i m unable to upgrade the networkmanager versioning shown above

26305467
direct3d	directx
the pix for windows tool in the directx sdk does not work for direct3d 10.x or direct3d 11.x on windows 8.1 windows 8.0 or windows 7 sp1 with the directx 11.1 runtime installed

26305467
direct3d	directx
given all that your life will be a lot easier if you just use direct3d 11 and avoid the legacy directx sdk and d3dx entirely

26305467
direct3d	directx
ps even back when the directx sdk was still the supported way to get direct3d headers for vs 2010 it was not available until you manually added the include path directories to your project

26305471
width	height
you can adjust the width height of the circle to your liking and whatever value you place in there will remain centered

26305471
margin	height
also note you might need to adjust the top margin to position the values according to the height of the circles if you change them

26305575
put	get
no matter what info i put in my template i couldn t get it working so i tried this answer for the template helper-

26305592

not sure what it s purpose is or why other browsers like google-chrome or mobile browsers do not require this but firefox does

26305634
ubuntu	debian
my problem is that the program works fine in my ubuntu 12.04 but gives me a segfault error when i try to run it on the debian vm

26305634
execvp	fork
the rest is just fork and then execvp call

26305647
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
if you re convinced that other issues can be fixed by using a for-loop rather than a while loops this is straightforwardly done use a while loops to read nul-delimited results from find into an arrays then iterate over the arrays s contents with a for-loop

26305712
jobs	cron
one of the daily cron jobs i defined in cron.yaml failed on my live webapp2 app

26305720

its all caused by directwrite fontfamily and font-size an easy test

26305827

and i believe that is where my problem lies each ball does not have their own dx dy thus i created a class that extends circle to try and solve that problem but my getter and setter do not seem to be accessible

26305875
gif	png
from the outset jpeg s do not support transparency gif and png can support transparency but they are not necessarily always transparent

26305875

spaces	delimiter
- selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing a given word delimiter by spaces

26305990
post	get
so far i ve only learned how to do a get and post call with ruby like so

26305997
getter	setter
while having a function be both a getter and a setter is not strange in many scenarios you are fighting against what closure compiler is trying to do for you

26305997
getter	setter
in your example cc is trying to help by obliquely hinting at the down-side of combining getter and setter functionality

26306021
spaces	delimiter
selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value containing a given word delimiter by spaces

26306021
spaces	delimiter
the attributecontains selector is for the string to be contained in the attribute value while attributecontainsword selector is for string seperated with delimiter spaces

26306024
post	get
i thought i could make a head request on the file and read the content-type header but i can t seem to do this with urlrequest and urlrequestheader since they only support post and get

26306025
g++	gcc
i m on windows 8 and downloaded mingw and set the path variable to its directory so that the gcc or g++ commands should work in command prompt

26306031
ubuntu	linux
it works fine on both but i find better support for cuda and much it is easier to install the scientific python stack on linux usually ubuntu

26306053
boost	allocator
using specialized boost interprocess allocator to make better use of the shared memory area

26306075
folder	directory
you should just get the directory for the document folder and then load your file

26306098
zipalign	jarsigner
on the other hand i could write my own target in the mdha project file to execute the jarsigner and zipalign tools

26306129

setinterval	settimeout
occasionally it will make sense for these sorts of scheduled tasks to be built into an otherwise long-running process that s doing other things i ve done it myself and in those cases the libraries mentioned in the other answers are your best bet or you could always write a settimeout or setinterval loop to check the time for you and run your process when the time matches

this is similar to shifting around but uses multiplication and division

26307679
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
i m well aware that inline is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to inlining non-specified inline-functions so the user control is almost negligible

26307681

hash	salt
in case code that hash the passwords leaks there will be no attack on all the hash at once - each has will have its own unique salt

26308243
sorting	grouping
i don t really understand the sorting rules but reversing the order of the grouping columns may be closer to what you posted

26308267
for-loop	arrays
i have encountered a different type of for-loop which i don t see or use commonly.i tried to figure it out but get even more confused in the process.it doesn t have its third argument or even a check method to break the loop.here it iterates over an arrays and prints its value.actually it encounters undefined value for a certain index but i am not telling it to break when it will encounter undefined.please help me to break the puzzle here.

26308423
hide	show
this function contains a show and hide function

26308423
hide	show
the show function will load what html i wish to display spinner text etc. whereas the hide function will hide the modal

26308457
hash	salt
a unique for each user otherwise leaking the salt will allow building a rainbow table for your specific salt to decrypt passwords so hash secretkey777 + password is not an option for me

26308481
typedef	struct
i then made my typedef struct in the monster.c file and created the function to return the values for the struct

26308508
gson	jackson
but given all of your requirements it may perhaps be better to just use tree model of jackson or gson get jsonnode or such and manually handle conversions to your liking

26308530

use a jpasswordfield instead of a jtextfield

26308756

play around with the matrix-matrix multiplication vector addition and vector reduction

26309055
linefeed	delimiter
the csv file contains carriage return 0d and linefeed 0a which command for interprets always as delimiter character independent on what you specify

26309055
notepad++	sublimetext
it would be better to use a text editor like ultraedit or notepad++ or sublimetext to do the replace in the file

26309170
put	get
you may still put bankaccount in array even if it is not pointer-type you ll still get the same results

26309237

to get the paths of the loaded ini s php --ini or php -i | grep config file

26309363
daemons	systemd
however i can t decide how to design this my service entry point has to be on the c++ side it s a systemd daemons and one might not want to compile it with the web-server feature

26309383
for-loop	arrays
i m also filling the arrays with values using this for-loop

26309390
oncreate	onnewintent
therefore instead of invoking onnewintent the oncreate method was invoked in the other words the onnewintent was never called to set the bundle and etc

26309393
width	height
if you want to store the width height in the file that method could work with a little tweaking

26309393
width	height
you could make the first two lines of the file contain the width and height of the maze and use parseint file.nextline instead of parseint file.next

26309393
width	height
a much better way to get the width and height would be to determine them from the file s actual dimensions note including the dimensions at the top of the input file for this method would mess things up

26309425
profiling	debugging
also you need to be using a distribution code signing identity and profiling for ad hock distribution and not a debugging

26309465
laravel	codeigniter
i m switching from codeigniter to laravel

26309557

int	chars
when i try to print them it prints the int value just fine but instead of printing the chars value it prints ï ½

26309703
typedef	struct
maybe i am using a typedef struct completely wrong and am about to ask a stupid question so please excuse me if that is the case

26309703
typedef	struct
now please understand that at the moment i have simplified my code for the purpose of testing this problem originally i had 3 integers in my typedef struct and was returning value after storing different numbers in each int

26309767
emacs	sublimetext
my primary editor is sublimetext but i do use emacs as well

26309789

then the next hand he gets another royal fflush

26309817
fflush	gets
then the next hand he gets another royal fflush

26309817
fflush	gets
then the next hand he gets another royal fflush

26309831
hive	hdfs
note that all hive tables metadata and data exist only on hdfs or other supported systems and not local file system

26309832
width	height
you can compute this by deviding width by height and multiplying with 100

26309835
jobs	cron
perhaps do a regex search for appengine-google as that will show up in the user-agent header for cron jobs and taskqueues

26309845
put	get
i can put a variable in the url to get the current time but im lost on the setting it to 00 00 00 utc for when the new day would roll over

26309950
range	infinity
a first thing to note is that the fourier transform pair for the function exp -t 2 over the + - infinity range as can be derived from tables of fourier transforms is actually

26309950
range	infinity
finally as you are generating the function exp -t 2 you are limiting the range of t to positive values instead of taking the whole + - infinity range

26309974
int	chars
is it doing this because of the difficulties associated with adding an int and string chars

26309990
int	chars
you can t cast a chars to an int and expect it to return 0 if it s not an int and its numerical value otherwise

26309990
int	chars
you need to split up the string check if the chars represent int and add those up

26309995
int	chars
unicode has added a large number of chars and python classifies some of them as digits even if int does not accept them

26310004
int	chars
your attempt is not failing because of difficulties of adding int to chars at least not directly it s actually failing before that when you try to convert something that doesn t look remotely like a number t into an int

26310029
folder	directory
in summary download the binary from here unzip it go inside the pgsql folder create log and data directory in there and then open a command prompt navigate to where the pgsql bin folder is and run initdb -u postgres -a password -e utf8 -w -d postgresql_root data

26310051
free	malloc
the skinny while reading entering the code it struck me that we never explicitly free the memory which we malloc when creating the various objects more detail below at the start of program execution

26310108
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
you only need to release memory that is allocated dynamically explicitly for example using the alloc function family malloc calloc realloc etc

26310115
free	malloc
malloc is much easier to implement if there is no free

26310141
free	malloc
if pastvelocities were a rather than a you would need to manually allocate the memory via malloc and then call free in -dealloc

26310157
post	get
i can t get the data to post as json

26310184
.htaccess	httpd.conf
a few apache mod_rewrite rules in either your servers httpd.conf or in a .htaccess in your htdocs directory will do the majority of what you want

sorting	filtering
if the properties of your bound type are no longer primitive then you have to get your hands dirty to support sorting filtering or searching

26315476
sorting	filtering
however if you re not aiming at a data grid view but rather at a combo box or list box and wish not to modify the underlying store while sorting or filtering you could still use a custom class derived from ibindinglistview and bindinglist of t like the one suggested above and manually call applysort or applyfilter

26315476
sorting	filtering
the implementation in the article linked in your post and the one i suggested use temporary copies of the original data source for sorting filtering

26315494
post	get
i know that if you have register_globals turned on then anything passed in a get or post gets automatically translated into a variable in php and acts as global variable but still whats the harm doing that though knowing it can override the variable

26315583
hash	salt
using salt correctly each password needs an accompanying random value salt that you store alongside the hash and use as input for each hashing

a database using a separate server to manage multiple clients such as mysql or postgresql is a better choice if performance is an issue

26316030
fgets	getline
if you want your routine to immediately prompt again in the case the key is pressed then you need to use another routine to read stdin like getline or fgets

26316050
post	get
you can pass comma separed values because when you do actually post a multi select control you get comma separated values in request so to emulate you can pass comma separated values

pull	push
my other thought process was to clone the current codebase push it to a new github account and rename it and add the proper git remote credentials and ssh keys to push pull properly

26316417
hash	salt
in the other case when in the login table it is one hash of a concatination of email password and salt it is no added security since the link to the profile table reveals a part of the hash concatination .

26316417
rainbowtable	hash
the email address in the authentication process is hash and hardened against rainbowtable attacks

26316441
pubnub	pusher
now i am looking into real time services like pusher firebase pubnub etc

26316446
put	get
if you want it contained within the max-width of your .container put it directly inside the .container without surrounding grid classes or you can put it in a .container-fluid to just get the left and right 15px default padding or put it inside nothing leave it all by itself and it will hit the edges of your viewport without any padding gutter

26316454
post	get
to get the comma separated values you then group by the values from post the ones that should have a single value per row and use group_concat to comma separate the non grouped values something like

hive	hdfs
you can also query and join data in hdfs or a hive table with other database-resident data

26317793
logarithm	modulo	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	modulo
perhaps you could multiplying the candidate number by factors of 10 and for each such product subtract it from the original number and then check whether the important digits in the difference are all zero for which you can use the modulo against a power of 10 one greater than the base-10 logarithm of the product

26317793
division	multiplication	division	logarithm
using the extra logarithm multiplication and division will likely yield a solution even slower than the string conversion and substring searching

26318079
google-chrome	firefox
my css works in ie10 google-chrome and firefox

26318084
cos	sin
because you need only calculate sin x or cos x with the maclauren series

26318084
cos	sin
because the derivative of sin x is cos x and the derivative of cos x is -sin x and sin 0 is zero we need only calculate the odd terms of the series whose numerator is alternatively cos 0 and -cos x 1 and -1

26318088
width	height
i have a header with 60px height when document width is greater than 760px

i can t get my program to read the test scores put in by the user and then take the average

26318320
width	height
if you want the element to conform to the right height and width have the right float values and respond to the text around it it needs to be a block element - which divs are

26318349
width	height
so i selected the inside uiview because it width height will be constrained to the parent view then shift selected its parent view the view it is nested inside of to enable those options of equal width equal height

26318349
width	height
add width height constraints equal to parent -- note i select the view i want to constrain and then shift select the view i want to constraint it to

26318349

coldfusion	railo
however pass a string such as checked as above you have to wrap it in de otherwise coldfusion and railo will look for a variable named checked

26318653
width	height
as discussed in that post a simple solution is not possible and several workarounds were proposed basically a custom ui implementation or using panels as renderers and playing with preferred width height based on text length

26318659
strlen	realloc
in realloc you need to give size as textlength + strlen argv i + 2

26318660
realloc	malloc
that being said if you precalculate the buffer size you can get rid of realloc and use a single malloc

swift	objective-c
kvo cannot function with pure swift optionals because pure swift optionals are not objective-c objects

26319813
swift	objective-c
swift forbids the use of dynamic or objective-c with generic classes and structures because there is no valid objective-c equivalent and so the runtime is not setup to support kvo on instances of those kinds of objects

i need to toggle the checkbox and radio button but cant work out how

26319853
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
this difference drops to 1 if we use idiomatic java specifically an enhanced for-loop for traversal probably because bounds checking is performed on the same arrays object loops dereferences enabling the just in time compiler to elide bounds checking more completely

however i can just barely use my own mouse to navigate around the computer and keyboard input is completely disrupted

26320289
sorting	grouping
this is an extremely fast and efficient way to do the task as it will barely slow down as ary grows due to the fact that there is no real sorting going on it s just grouping by a value then extracting from the hash in a given order

26320406
int	chars
to convert chars to int not by ascii value 1 to 1 you just do the following

26320472
pci-dss	hipaa
if not the sftp protocol not ftps would be the next best choice as it is pci-dss compliant secure enough for banking and hipaa compliant secure enough to transfer hospital records and - unlike ftps - the sftp protocol is a subsystem of ssh and it only requires a single open tcp port on the server side 22

loops	while-loop
this is what the wikipedia article means when it says â œweakest-precondition of while-loop is usually parametrized by a predicate i called loops invariant and a well-founded relation on the space state denoted and called loops variant.â it is not just i that must have been chosen in advance and must decorate the program there is also the choice of a number of variables of the program modified in the body of loops s and occurring in the condition e and the existence of the well-founded order between the tuples of values of these variables guarantee that the condition e is false eventually

26320811
int	double
although you are storing seconds as a double the conversion from int to double is taking place after is computed as an int

26320811
int	double
the compiler will choose the best operator overload based on the types of the operands which in this case are all int and look for a valid implicit conversion in this case int to double afterwards

26320881
width	height
since #parent-div has a height of 80 of the viewport you can use 80vh to set #child-div s width to the same height

26320908
sorting	filtering
just have a look at the plunker sorting and filtering over nested json objects and dates

26320918
for-loop	loops
you should delete for-loop and everything in loops bestslot variable too

versioning	upgrade
i think you should upgrade lastest node versioning

bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
after writing the above i found this q a - performance issue using javas object streams with sockets - which seems to suggest that using bufferedinputstream bufferedoutputstream helps

in the button s actionlistener extract the data from the jtextfields convert any strings to numbers that need converting calculate your value and display it in another jtextfield or jlabel

26321005
put	get
if i put them in i get the errors

26321023
pull	push
as i understand it observables are a push rather than a pull interface

26321031
getter	setter
so at this point this is basically sounding like getter and setter but i don t want to fully implement it in that fashion and this is to avoid having to go through 10+ if statements to determine what to do for any given user input

26321055
next	except
this is the code of a next button i have and i have an almost identical piece of code for back button except it removes the last item in the list and makes a textbox equal to that value

26321092
post	get
for instance just an example here if you wrote your java server to host a webserver you send it a protocol it understands node js would use get or post etc..

26321106
post	get
it s ugly but you could make the resource url items state and then pass in a state property when you call items.query get post

26321166
for-loop	loops
also as noted in another answer and what i missed is that you re using the same variable i in both the while loops that gets student names and the for-loop that gets scores for each student

26321176
for-loop	loops
it looks like you are doing the while loops then the for-loop then the if and back to the for-loop till it finishes all the grades

26321212

folder	directory
after this idea i eventually deviated into making folder groups and having a folder.hpp file for if i needed everything in that directory

26321235
comparator	comparable
based on your error in the comment section you need to implement the comparable interface on the rainfall class before you can use the arrays.sort method or use a comparator as elliotfrisch showed you in his answer

26321243
dbcontext	objectcontext
what would be best place to put the dbcontext and objectcontext code -

26321270
put	get
that can be expressed a lot more tightly as where that notation is meant to convey two ranges what you d get if you put together nsmakerange 1 5 and nsmakerange 10 6

26321326
post	get
ideally you d use the prg post redirect get

26321334
width	height
also make sure you don t have any other margins and padding and also make sure webview s height and width is match_parent .

26321364
int	double
you are using a double which is a floating point number but you only require int values so it would be much more sensible to use an int type

26321411
wav	riff
typically if you has a standard riff pcm wav file with no metadata attached to it usual case

26321411
wav	riff
in case you have a more complicated wav if it s riff the format infomation and data are put into different chunks along with some other chunks you may not need and the offsets talked above may not correct then you should look into chunks

26321411
wav	riff
more general riff wav here

26321451

i am not sure if i should use a foreach for-loop or count through the arrays and compare the posted uname username with values of each element of the users arrays

26321602
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the logs indicate that the for-loop goes through each action for all elements in the arrays before proceeding to the next action contained in loops

26321638

if you want chars values you can use the intstream returned by string.chars and cast the int values to chars without loss of information

26321993
int	chars
within maptoobj cast the int value to chars

26322024
printwriter	bufferedwriter

i m using eclipse to put and get items in simpledb through java

26322120
int	chars
the reason why your code is not compiling is because you are passing an argument of type int array 0 in a function that takes chars pointers

26322120
int	chars
also you are inserting a chars inside an array of int which is probably not what you want

26322124

getter	setter
first you create a class stringwrapper that simply wraps a string and provides a getter and a setter

26322629
getter	setter
in the first case you would do this in the getter setter code in the second case you should not access directly the attribute and implement thread-safe getter and setter

26322701
implements	extends
ive posted this before but the discussion spiraled of to implements other patternrs i need to seperate businesslogic from implements classes the pattern is secondary and rewriting as little code as possible this will be used in different products so it will be used as an api so only some subclasses for that specific implementation will be required as there will be databasestypes extends the api that is contained in a jar

when you write in your sub in the getter of testregistrant.testcat and in the setter of testregistrant.testcat you are implicitly using let it s as if you had written instead of explicitly using set

26323688
getter	setter
so if you write in your test sub in the getter and in the setter you should be good to go

hash	salt
add a salt to the hash

26324873
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
so for password hashing this practically means that password hashing using md5 and sha even with salting is pretty useless since those algorithms are optimized for speed which allows hackers compute 2300 million salt hash per second brute force

26324873
scrypt	pbkdf2
some well-known computational intensive hashing algorithm are pbkdf2 bcrypt pbmac and scrypt

debian	linux
in my university we use eclipse on pc under linux xfce desktop in debian

26325387
for-loop	arrays
using a for-loop and storing the arrays as the string representations of each byte would not be the most efficient thing to do and would lead to a super-large unreadable xml so perhaps you could store it off of the xml and pass a reference to the byte arrays file in the xml

26325395
google-chrome	firefox
depending on your os qtwebkit might take default settings from the desktop environment that firefox or google-chrome wouldn t if you re using kde

26325721
udp	tcp
for some requirements tcp is better for some udp

26325721
udp	tcp
tcp is a slow but reliable ensuring that data is delivered and connection-oriented protocol whereas udp is fast but un-reliable and connection-less protocol

26325986
puts	gets
i m working on a project where the program gets items from a table and puts it in a listview

currently this just prints another line with a space as the first chars instead of going back to the previous line and replacing the user inputted int with a

26326567
division	multiplication
moreover since division and multiplication have the same order of precedence you should use brackets around the multiplication

26326593
integer	unsigned
your number 9 780 321 563 842 is hex 8e52897b4c2 which fits into 44 bits 4 bits per hex digit so any 64 bit integer no matter if signed or unsigned will have space to spare

a reference to an abstract-class is just like a pointer to an abstract-class it needs to reference an object of some non-abstract subclass of the abstract-class

26327376
width	height
i had to do some simple math to know what px s to set the width and height of the blue box just want to see if there is an easier way

26327379

26327572
udp	tcp
make a note that tcp and udp are transport layer protocols and do not mix it up with network layer protocol ip

26327686
integer	unsigned
i ve read here on stackoverflow and through other sources that we should always make use of unsigned if there is no instance of a negative integer

26327702
put	get
an easy way to use get in php is to put it in a variable like so.

26327766
range	minimum
in iso c c99 int is signed and has a minimum range of at least -32767 through 32767 include

26327789
swift	objective-c
by the way if you like the objective-c typedef pattern the equivalent in swift is typealias

26327802
integer	unsigned
firstly your always in should always make use of unsigned if there is no instance of a negative integer is overly strong

26327802
integer	unsigned
proper memory management is important for achieving good performance but this is a completely independent matter not in any way related to the question using signed or unsigned integer types

26327802
integer	unsigned
thirdly even though unsigned types formally perform better in integer arithmetic and even if your code performs massive amount of work with those integers switching from signed to unsigned is unlikely to produce any notable improvement in performance

26327839
integer	unsigned
whether to use signed or unsigned integer types can go either way with respect to performance but unless you really need to optimize a particular bottleneck that you have measured to be a bottleneck you should always be choosing the types that convey the intended semantic not a type that somebody told you is faster

26327839
integer	unsigned
so if you want to search for use of signed or unsigned integer objects you should search your source code not the heap

26327864
google-chrome	safari
the code works fine in safari and google-chrome

26328297
int	boolean
when you essentially use check as a boolean array it doesn t have to be of type int

26328297
int	chars
int occupies 4 bytes whereas chars only 1 byte

26328297
free	malloc
it is a good practice to always free the memory chunk that you allocated with malloc regardless whether free is necessary or not in this case no because your program just exits at the end of sieve calculation. perhaps until you become really fluent with c

26328309
folder	directory
in visual studio for the file you want to be copied to folder under bin mark the copy to output directory property of the file as copy always

26328389
int	chars
and output of int chars version are in op.jpg

26328417
free	malloc
if some_function allocates the memory with malloc it will be the responsibility of the caller to make sure that the memory is later free

26328484
min	max	range	min	range	max
i think this prevents any value from being a 0 and makes sure value is inside the min and max range

26328497
int	double
gives compiler error c2782 msvc2012 that the template parameter value_t for the operator is ambiguous int or double

although opencv can easily read the input of a webcam is there a way of creating a virtual webcam so that can be fed into a usb expecting program such as skype hangout etc

26328506
for-loop	loops
the statement in the for-loop overwrites the variable results evry loops run

26328597
put	get
in amqp any inside single vhost any queue can be bounded to any exchange so any amqo user that has access rights to read from queue can get message from queue and read it and possibly put it back when using manual acknowledge and not ack ing received message

26328601
implements	extends
i have an abstract class foo implements otherthing and a class bar that extends foo

26328626
integer	unsigned
â 4.7 2 of c++11 states if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type . this means that if the input integer is not negative the normal bit truncation you expect will arise

26328660
post	get
i want to change my login post method to get the value from usertype and pass this value in a tempdata

26328661

multiplying	add
you could multiplying with 2.0 to resolve the ambiguity or add a third template parameter to the operator definition

26328710
width	height
from here your views will layout correctly on any device since the layout is dependent on the width and height of the view bounds

i would suggest to utilize a library such as underscore.js or lodash because later you might add more sort conditions or change them and using the library will greatly reduce the noisiness of your code and save you development effort

26329047
int	double
as programming in scala a comprehensive step-by-step guide states in scala there are not basic types values just objects int are int instances and double are double instances

26329047

this is my assessment class where i declare my variables getter and setter

26329259
x86	64bit
changing your exe s platform target to x86 is required there is no 64bit version of managed directx and the dlls contain native 32-bit code written in managed c++

26329262
packets	multicast
ideally the first application opened would start sending multicast messages every x seconds and when the other one gets started would call a method for receiving the message or packets

26329262
packets	multicast
my current idea for fixing this is to make each application send the multicast packets for 10 seconds if no one responds then listen to multicast packets for 10 seconds if it doesn t receive anything start sending again and keep the cycle

26329262
packets	multicast
it stays listening for incoming multicast packets and i don t know how to stop or pause it

26329265
min	max	aggregate-functions	sum
the group by clause must list all the columns used in the select list to which no aggregate-functions like min max avg or sum is applied

you could then loops through them using a for-loop with a temp char variable so you don t have to initialize all of them like that

26330252
multiplying	add
then in your while loop loop through the int array and add all the 0+all the even indices and multiplying by 3 and add all the odd indices

26330258
filtering	grouping
and added css class filtering on each of the grouping

min	max
unfortunately on the top level one has to use min begin_at and max end_at as there re no aggregate functions for the range-based union operator +

26330309
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
because as it says in the javadoc the constructor of objectinputstream reads the stream header written by the constructor of objectoutputstream at the peer

26330309
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you need to construct the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream at both ends preferably

both sdwebimage and afnetworking uiimageview categories implemented their own ram cache using nscache for performance

for persistent storage caching though sdwebimage implemented their own and afnetworking argued that one should rely on the built-in nsurlcache for that

26332763
nsurlcache	nscache
so bottom line there s probably a good argument to implement a nscache mechanism if you want silky-smooth scrolling but you might be able to get away with relying on nsurlcache for persistent storage caching

integer	unsigned
sizeof returns the size in bytes as an unsigned integer of type size_t

26340301
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
size_t is an alias for one of the unsigned integer types unsigned int unsigned long long unsigned short etc.

26340301
integer	unsigned
which particular unsigned integer type is implementation-defined

26340301
integer	unsigned
so if your size_t is a 32-bit unsigned integer then it is impossible to create an object bigger than 2 32 bytes on your system

26340301
integer	unsigned
conversely if you can create an object bigger than 2 32 bytes then size_t must be bigger than a 32-bit unsigned integer big enough to be able to store the size of any object you can create

26343320
min	max
record the max and the min

26343320
min	max
if these are in an object then you can make a nested hashmap for example mapping manids to maps of sessionids to maps of userids to max min where max min might be the object which contains the max min value or they might be the values themselves - that s up to you and what you need

26344535
listview	gridview
i asked around and it seems like i forgot that the default panels in gridview and listview - the itemswrapgrid and itemsstackpanel contain a firstvisibleindex property that could be used to get the object and then call scrollintoview on the list control which in turns takes a scrollintoviewalignment enum you can use to say you want the scrolled-to-item to be the first visible aligned to the leading edge

26345446
post	get
i am trying to scrape a website which was probably written poorly so when you initially perform a get request on their page it responds with 5 entries in a mixture of html javascript jquery because it s the visual part of the page and if you want to get more entries you click a button which internally performs a post request on the same page along with the pagination value which is like the page you want like if you want entries 6 to 10 you give a value of 2 to pagination value and if you want entries 11 to 15 you give a value of 3 and it does this asynchronously and appends the data to the end of the previous result set

26345446
post	get
also i can assure you that there is only one after method and everything else is html so basically 2 lines of jquery the first line and the last line so i assumed i would just blindly remove the first and last line and then parse it again but the response object that i get from the requests library which i use to perform the post operation returns it as one long line of data so i cannot do any readline on it to seperate the first line from the second line from the last line it s all just one line to me

26345465
put	get	post	get	post	put
in this page you can only add response headers and access it with a request method such as post get put etc

folder	directory
unfortunately this is not a complete fix for your issue as exporturlbase does not store the entire url just the url relative to the domain ie exporturlbase reserved.reportviewerwebcontrol.axd... not www.yoursite.com reserved.reportviewer... however once you can change this you can create a directory in your inetpub folder with new config and redirect the link through that folder to use that config

for-loop	arrays
it s still a bunch of function calls but that s not a problem but you have the advantage over a for-loop of not having to declare the indexing variable and you re modifying the existing arrays rather than replacing it

26348905

26349172
listview	gridview
until that is perfect but i want to show those values in a widget listview or gridview and after tapping an option do another action

26349172
listview	gridview
but don t know if listview or a gridview could be more useful for what i need

26349202
for-loop	loops
you cannot create a for-loop that relies on user input to go to the next step of loops if you don t pause the for-loop to wait for the input

26349220
for-loop	loops
instead of a for-loop use a while loops

26349236
int	chars
i am converting an array of chars to binary int

26349236
int	chars
i am converting the int back to chars so i can concatenate them

26349266

26349338
leaflet	proj
i have many markers 10 000 to show in a leaflet proj targeting mobile

26349346
linefeed	delimiter
this uses null as a delimiter instead of a linefeed so filenames with linefeed will work

26349368
bash	tcsh
ulimit is for bash users if you use tcsh the command to use is instead limit

26349387
division	modulo
i know it gets the correct number of digits because it prints the same number of zeroes as there are digits in the number so something must be wrong with my use of modulo or division here and i can t quite seem to find it

26349416
width	height
basically you set top and left to 50 as the op did but offset the form s container with negative margins on the top and left equal to 50 of the div s height and width respectively

26349416
width	height
i will stress that the height and width of the form must be specified not relative

26349421
ostringstream	std
for the output parameter you can pass an std ofstream in order to write the output to a file or you can use an std ostringstream to write the data into a memory structure that can be converted into an std string

26349438
stdout	fflush
if you do not want to have a line break after your prompt instead of adding a newline to the end you can call fflush stdout to ensure that you fflush the buffer printint it to the terminal

26349498
width	margin
i would use js to calculate the current width of its parent .my-block and then find the next smallest multiple of 56px size of the small boxes when accounting for padding and margin to get the new size of the .inner-block

26349593
slug	permalinks
i renamed a page in wordpress along with the permalinks the slug also changed and now i can t find it on my site

26349611
width	height
the definition of center_crop says it will set the width height of the image to be at least the width height respectively of the view minus padding

26349629
put	get	integer	fractions
see wikipedia for more detail but that should be enough to understand that 5 100 is a fractions value and if you force swift to put that into an integer the best you could possibly get is 0 or 1

26349629
int	double
if you want to handle rates that aren t an even multiple of 100 you probably want to set rateint to an int without dividing by 100 then set another variable like ratefraction to a double with the value rateint 100.0 then multiply that with the other two values then if desired round and cast back to int at the end

26349629
integer	fractions
but for someone who doesn t even know what an integer is numbers without fractions values is probably clearer

26349629
integer	fractions
the fractions 5 100 is between 0 and 1 so it s going to round to one of those two numbers if you try to force it to be an integer

26349633

26349754
for-loop	arrays
explantion in the for-loop you will add all same index elements in different arrays with each other and save it in same index at result arrays

26349770
uicollectionview	uitableview
it sounds like what you are asking for is a way to use uicollectionview to produce a layout like uitableview

26349770
width	height
the first part is for the collection view delegate to calculate the correct cell size by taking in the collection view s width and using the sizing cell to calculate the cell s height

26349770
width	height
this will cause the collection view to set the width of the cell based on the enclosing collection view but then ask the sizing cell to calculate the height

26349770
width	height
it is part of flow layout s essence that it positions things that have a size rather than fixes a width and lets them choose their height

26349923
width	height
one is that your iframe has a width of 1200px and a height of 670px

26349923
width	height
this also now allows you to set your width and height on the canvas element to 100 and use top left bottom right properties set to 0 so that it will fill the same space as the iframe regardless of the size of the viewport

26349923
width	height
you can even use a css trick similar to the one used in bootstrap s responsive embeds to create an element that has proportional height and width yet scales with the overall design

26349929

swift	objective-c
essentially i d like something like this from apple s official documentation but in swift instead of objective-c

26350220
swift	objective-c
java tends to be much more verbose than swift so i doubt what i m asking is too broad it is more likely that i don t know how to use the objective-c messagecomposer object because the documentation that i linked to above is unclear with regard to usage in swift

then in that div display the cropped part of that same image with normal opacity using the values of x y width and height

26364405

it would be quite reasonable to make them available via getter and setter though and certainly if you had fields that you wanted to be readable by the subclass but not writable then a getter would be appropriate

26364405
superclass	subclassing
the superclass is abstract so you d expect the subclassing implementation to fill in some of the gaps

26364408

if you would want to have a message based communication just as in udp but coupled with tcp features like reliable in-order delivery congestion control and also additional improvements features on top of it like multi-streaming multi-homing in-built mtu discovery then sctp should be your choice

26364809
sctp	udp
however if you have legacy nat systems in your network then you may need to go for encapsulating sctp in udp

26364819
width	height
when i control drag it gives me the option to set a static height width or aspect ratio

26364819

in any case limiting outer dependencies is always a good thing to do so you can always add zeroes to the number being divided by numerator that is the same as multiplying by a power of 10 you should choose a power of 10 according to the precision you need that will make the division output an integer number

swift	objective-c
note that you need to be careful about your objective-c code if you take the second approach switching lat and lon to non-optional properties of type nsnumber -- while the swift compiler will prevent you from assigning nil to non-optional properties the objective-c compiler has no qualms about allowing it letting nil values sneak into your swift code with no chance of catching them at runtime

you dont specify enough to know for sure if this is a helpful answer but if you have a large nsstring from the server and then are creating a copy as nsdata such as with datausingencoding to send to nsjsonserialization then that is going to be a lot of unnecessary copying

i don t have good practice in javascript but i can give you demo of how to generate arrays of dict using for-loop

26368461
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
take a look at nsurlconnection and nsurlsession

26368461
nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
the nsurlconnection and nsurlsession classes manage the async services for you and are more efficient than doing it yourself

26368541

26368632
int	double
conversions from int uint long or ulong to float and from long or ulong to double

26368632
integer	unsigned
the slightly longer answer is that you are adding two different types a 32-bit signed integer and a 32-bit unsigned integer

26368632
integer	unsigned
the domain of an unsigned 32-bit integer is 0 0x00000000 mdash

26368644
post	get
this post could get you on the correct path for domain level rewriting

26368653

26368706
cpu	processors
i have processors intel xeon cpu e3-1230 with 4 cores

26368706

26368863
google-chrome	firefox
everything looks great on windows google-chrome or android firefox

26368910
mouse	keyboard
but windows is a keyboard driven interface as well as mouse

rss	feed
i ve been trying to create a form to create known issues for our tech support group for rss feed however it does not seem to be creating the xml

26369022

you can change the result type a bit unsigned long long int or double or long double but ultimately you won t be able to compute a large number of factorials in hardware

26369046
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i tried all sorts of combinations of in viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear.

26369047
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
i figured the variables that are allocated by the user using calloc malloc realloc is accessible to other functions because they are in the heap as the article says

26369074
google-chrome	firefox
using json.stringify appears to produce illegal strings in both firefox and google-chrome latest

26369082
getter	setter
every property in a sencha component automatically gets its getter and setter functions you only need to call seticoncls on the button to change the icon

26369089
vmware	virtualbox
if you are using something other than virtualbox vmware kvm etc

26369093
bmp	pcx	tiff	bmp
i don t understand why this border bleeding has occurred especially given that it does not occur when i convert the tiff image to either a bmp or pcx image

26369127
google-chrome	firefox
it is also unique to google-chrome i ve only tested on firefox not ie firefox doesn t scroll the parent window

26369127

however it breaks the slick slider i have on my homepage and the isotope masonry arrangement i have on my blog page

26369303
ienumerable	iqueryable
i overrided the dynamic.cs class to suppor ienumerable select instead of iqueryable which now will support my cast

26369321
google-chrome	safari
specifically a web page viewed in mobile safari in ios 8 or the ios version of google-chrome no longer displays the auto-generated poster frame for an html5 video

26369321
google-chrome	safari
the auto-generated poster frame displays fine in desktop safari and google-chrome

26369329
hide	show
what happens is that your javascript code selects all elements with the class teammemberphoto and puts a hover function on it that just hide -all- elements in the whole document not just the ones within the div that have the class teammembercircle and show all elements with class teammemberinfo

26369339
wildfly	jboss
since jboss 7 jboss 7.x and wildfly 8.x don t have support for cluster timers

26369429
oncreate	onstart
in the onstart or oncreate method

26369472
getter	setter
and as always with ember use the getter and setter

26369490
addition	modulo
i assume some sort of loop would be needed in addition the modulo

26369554
rsa	aes
you should however use a hybrid cryptosystem mixing aes and rsa instead

26369559
oncreate	setcontentview
in the oncreate function below the setcontentview add this line

26369618
width	height
so for example if i had a polygon that is a rectangle of width height 1 the vertices could look like

26369632
width	height
the width is taken from the screen width or height in landscape

26369650
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox and google-chrome

26369687
width	height
this view is quite complex to auto layout correctly since each view would need to have width height and spacing in-between adjusted

26369691
hide	show
i m sending json object from node layer to dust template based on object value i want to hide show data

26369758
width	margin
also keep in mind that when you do margin 10 you re adding 10 margin to both the left and right side of the media-body div totaling 20 of the width

26369781
getter	setter
in a computed property if you implement a setter you must also provide a getter

26369804
factors	matrix
you ve created a matrix in which the factors levels of wool and tension are now just row and column names of the matrix you re feeding to image

26369811
getter	setter
i d like to if possible define a javascript object that has a few properties along with getter setter for those properties but i don t want others to be able to add new properties to objects without extending the object definition similar to how one would define a class in java c#

26369829
stdout	stderr
i m trying to process both stdout and stderr from a subprocess.popen call that captures both via subprocess.pipe but would like to handle the output for example printing them on the terminal as it comes

26369829
stdout	stderr
all the current solutions that i ve seen will wait for the completion of the popen call to ensure that all of the stdout and stderr is captured so that then it can be processed

26369829
stdout	stderr
the current implementation of this just process stdout first and stderr last which can be deceiving if the output was originally alternating between both

26369829
stdout	stderr
the need to differentiate stdout from stderr is a must as shown in the example output

26369833
jobs	cron
i have a requirement to run one or two cron jobs if one is not enough for the day light savings every year

26369875
versioning	upgrade

qtimer	qthread
this would be in my opinion the right and without memory leaks way to use a qtimer in another qthread

26370058
google-chrome	firefox
for me the sold text sticks outside the image on any browser when the viewport becomes wide google-chrome ie and firefox

26370073
integer	unsigned
i found the maximum values mathematically by hand for which the results generated by my program would be valid before integer overflow to be 65535 for signed ints and 92681 for unsigned ints

26370073
integer	unsigned
despite this integer overflow occurs as if the ints were signed and not unsigned

26370111
postgresql	mysql
since postgresql doesn t have an order by field some_column zebra hipo like mysql does - you could try to use order by bang

26370122
hbase	aerospike
after due research i am considering redis for this task over the likes of aerospike hbase cassandra etc

26370124
setinterval	settimeout
when you call settimeout setinterval or process.nexttick you will add given function to this list and when the right times comes it will be processed

26370177
chmod	mkdir
mkdir bolt chmod a+rx bolt

26370181
hide	show
it does not hide any previous order it has show

26370254
javadb	hsqldb
i am sure hibernate hsqldb javadb should all work on a mac

26370288
post	get
where the number in the identifier matches the post id so that all get s generated fine

26370291
width	margin
if you know the number of links li s then you could give your ul a specific width then use margin 0 auto

26370295
express	node.js
during my explorations of the 8.0.5 iteration of webstorm i ve setup a vanilla node.js express ejs project to which i ve made no code changes

in my game using lua and gideros studio i want someone to draw a straight line from mousedown to mouseup

26370338
put	get
rather than hardcode the paths to get the values i want to walk the tree get each node and put them into a variable then substitute the name for the variable to get the values

26370345
google-chrome	firefox
this happens both in firefox and google-chrome

26370352
put	get
you could use the following ide paintcodeapp to put your button and other staff and get generated code for xamarin forms

26370399
int	chars
most probably id in your table is a varchar chars nvarchar column whereas websecurity.currentuserid is a int type

26370405
post	get
earlier post warned that it was a private function and may get removed

26370411
width	height
in my example below i set the w and h variables to the window width and height

26370425
min	max
the fisrt category second category etc are kinds of stores where the product was sold so for the statistics sample i use here to get all the prices i need max min etc i need to get exactly the strores that sample is conformed

26370433
post	get
then simply add it when you save you can get the relevant value from the url that the form post to and add it there

26370437
button	checkbox
after click on delete checkbox near initial form and submit button - i have same number of forms in formset and same number of initial forms but those which have been deleted now are without value and without delete checkbox checkbox is enable in admin panel i assume it s widget render

26370484
ssl	https	qsslsocket	qnetworkaccessmanager
the warning is result of openssl functions being resolved at runtime by a call to qsslsocket supportsssl static in qnetworkaccessmanager supportedschemesimplementation that returns supported schemas --- http and if ssl supported https

26370494
post	get
i see there some js and http get post requests and it type and more

26370506
youtube	vimeo
so the best way is always to use a streaming service and there is no cheaper streaming server than youtube or vimeo

26370599
put	get
however i would recommend leaving modify out of the class definition as mtl does since it s really more desirable to just implement get and put

26370608
google-chrome	safari
i ve come across a strange artifact in google-chrome works fine in safari

26370614
portrait	landscape
the whole app is made for portrait orientation only but i d like the video to play on landscape as well

26370629
hex	binary
i need the data to be a hex string representing the entire binary

26370648
post	get
i have this editable html table that i ve got working so you can click the cells and edit the text however i can t get it to post the values as well

26370652
getter	setter
but if i do it like this the getter and setter has to convert the values from object to corresponding data type

26370682
int	double
for example would seem like it should yield 100.0 and it would be correctly computed if both operands were promoted to double but the compiler will instead convert the int 1111111100 to float yielding 1111111040.0f and then perform the division yielding 99.999992370605469

26370728
rank	max
if you delete note the rank of the deleted row and update the row with rank of max to the rank you just deleted

26370751
mouse	keyboard
use of directinput to handle keyboard and mouse is not recommended use the win32 messages instead

26370774
pbkdf2	hash
good password hash algorithms like bcrypt or pbkdf2 have a cost factor from time to time you have to increase this cost factor because of faster hardware then you need the exact same procedure as you need for the migration

26370785
folder	directory
this time however a folder was not created in this directory with these dlls

26370826
google-chrome	firefox
also use console - google-chrome firefox right click on a page element and select inspect element you will see console on the top menu of the window that appears

26370859
border-color	background-image
i couldnt use border-color so i used background-image linear-gradient to bottom somecolorhere 0 anothercolorhere 100

26370930
maven	m2e
normally when you import an existing maven project into eclipse using m2e should analyse the structure of the maven project and create eclipse project with .classpath and .project files automatically

26370930
m2e	pom.xml
i think that your m2e did not process the pom.xml correctly you were probably missing folders etc

26370976
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
i am creating a simple calculator that will eventually have many different tasks addition subtraction multiplication etc etc...each of the tasks will have 2 functions first and second

26370994
maven	pom.xml
our maven pom.xml file mentions -werror flag which is very valuable flag

26371073
hash	md5
md5 uses the merkleâ damgã rd construction so if two prefixes with the same hash can be constructed a common suffix can be added to both to make the collision more likely to be accepted as valid data by the application using it

26371073
hash	md5
both produce the md5 hash 79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4. 38 the difference between the two samples is the leading bit in each nibble has been flipped

26371073
hash	md5
if you just want to find any two inputs with the same md5 and don t care what that hash is the collision attack is for you

26371073
hash	md5
note that this complexity is only slightly less than the data complexity of storing every possible md5 hash output without storing the string that generates the given hash which may be very long 2 128 2 7 2 135 this is 10 27 tera bytes which is several orders of magnitude greater than the entire hard disk capacity of the entire world

26371073
hash	md5
you can compute md5 hash for incremental inputs in a loop until you find an input that produces the given hash

26371079
children	parent
where i am having trouble is iterating the children out since there are multiple children to each parent since that is a list of lists of dictionaries that is tied to 2 different lists of dictionaries

26371081
post	get
here s the data i get via post

26371100
freebsd	debian
but if i m cloning the repo on a debian tried multiple versions or freebsd 10.0 then i m getting the following

i m thinking that i have to somehow include the for-loop in the while statement to make the validation process properly loops back and ask the user to re-type input in the required format

26371133
reportlab	xhtml2pdf	pillow	reportlab
this will automatically pull in all of html5lib pypdf2 pillow reportlab and six if you don t already have them then install xhtml2pdf and then you re done

everything works fine in google-chrome but when i use firefox 32.0.3 firefox does not recognize the background image

26371176
hide	show
in the mobile version the menu bar in every page should show a d and hide c see the code above

26371181
width	margin
i was expecting width 100 will mean 100 of the windows but clearly it s not when i add a margin to it

26371195
maven	m2e
i want to make sure that i have the latest stable version of m2e because i might be experiencing problems importing maven projects using m2e

26371201
keystore	jks
the library requires jks keystore which is absent in android platform

26371219
margin	height
second your padding-bottom amount needs to be the sum of the height of the element it is trying to go to the bottom of and any padding border margin offset it may include

26371249
width	margin
width 100 does mean 100 of the document your example but you also set a margin which is what s limiting the width of the element

26371254
createprocess	rootkit
it should be physically impossible for createprocess to report a pid that taskmanager does not see unless there is a low-level trojan rootkit that is hiding the pid

26371262
jobs	cron
this is causing a major headache for my database etl jobs that are cron d to run at specific hours

26371278
put	get
the new assertthat requires matching against a single object so you d have to put them into an array or something in order to get it through

26371280
x86	64bit
i m passing full strings without any environment string but in the final result linkiconpath is being changed to programfiles myfolder myicon.ico which means that windows explorer being a 64bit application is searching for myicon.ico in c program files myfolder myicon.ico instead of c program files x86 myfolder myicon.ico

26371307
post	get
i want to add the text inside the plot using annotate or geom_text i know there are duplicated post in this but i don t manage to get it correct

26371324
for-loop	arrays
or use an arrays and a for-loop

26371433
children	parent
something which is absolutely positioned is removed from the document flow and as a result the parent #testimonieswrapper is not expanding to accommodate the children

26371529
domxpath	domdocument
here is an implementation of your query using domdocument and domxpath

26371547
disk	ram
the idea is you create a disk backed by your ram

26371547

26371627
initializer	class-method
any methods that initializer a class-method that begin with a + should never reference self as self will not exist at that point

26371653
min	max	minimum	max
the code selects all the elements in the same column finds the min and max calculates the step value and calculates how many steps above the minimum the current element is

26371688
post	get
i already tried to use a get instead of post or to change addrole to void type and anything other but i can t get this to work

26371693
getter	setter
if you dont want to have setter in your bean and only use fields and getter you can use visibility checker of objectmapper to allow field visibility

26371697
put	get
implement methods to put get reset

26371702
post	get
in that case i noticed that a get query has no origin header and a similar post query has origin file

26371751
for-loop	arrays
i want to store structs inside an arrays access and change the values of the struct in a for-loop

26371768
decoder	encoder	mongodb	bson
i think i ve found the issue mongodb-hadoop has a static modifier on its bson encoder decoder instances in core src main java com mongodb hadoop input mongoinputsplit.java

26371768
decoder	encoder
when spark runs in multithreaded mode all the threads try and deserialise using the same encoder decoder instances which predicatbly has bad results

26371794
width	height
now i am trying to set width and height of that area ike this -

26371807
width	height
but even if an element has been given its own layer transitions on non-compositing properties width height left top etc still cannot be accelerated because they occur before the compositing stage eg

26371850
width	height
the octopus now can be seen all time whole with this width height 100 settig

26371889
nstextview	nsscrollview
the nsscrollview is just enough to fit the nstextview

26371889
nstextview	nsscrollview
as the user type in more text the nsscrollview should grow along with the nstextview until reaching a maximum height then start showing the vertical scroll bar

26371913
getter	setter
the method i ve found useful is using getter as well as setter

26371937
post	get
i need to change the method box from get to post here is my code so far

26371961
getter	setter
generally you will want encapsulation on your datastructure type with private member variables and public getter and setter methods that access those values

26372018
csv	tsv
in your updated version it looks like they re actually a tab -separated list of valuesâ â but that s just a dialect of csv known as tsv which the module can also handle just fine

26372054
punctuation	words
so calling scanner.next will return the next words or punctuation from your file separated by whitespace

width	height
on the form there are hidden fields un width height that also need to contain the username and some numbers in addition to the username field containing the username

26372327
zlib	libz
â means that the prerequisite you re missing is libz aka zlib

26372327
libxml2	libxslt
that being said if you don t have the zlib development files you probably don t have the libxml2 or libxslt development files either because i don t know of any platform where installing those wouldn t have pulled in the zlib files as well

26372364
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to vincent versioning 0.4.4 with

jndi	jta
i ve tried jta local_resource i ve tried using a unit name in my code the same as in my persistence.xml but also with the war name prepended as the log suggests the jndi name might be that

26372636
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in google-chrome and firefox so i don t think it s a browser-specific issue

26372643
comparator	comparable
for most cases you can implement an exception comparator logging only the first occurrence or compare to a template although i guess stack traces are not comparable in this case

26372646

info.plist	ipa
modifying info.plist invalidates the signature on the ipa

26372754
int	chars
otherwise set v equal to the int value of the chars at position you can either use the int parse method or just an if ternary because there are only two options

26372763
folder	directory
in hadoop 1 if we want to cache a file at user foo file bar name.avro the distributedcache will copy this file into a local cache folder and create the same sub directory accordingly

26372763
folder	directory
now the same codes in hadoop 2 will put the file directly in the root folder without creating any sub directory

26372770
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtcp
and it seems that rtsp rtp rtcp can be used for both uploading to server and playing at the client

26372770
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtcp	udp	tcp	udp	rtp
however since the rtsp rtp rtcp based on tcp udp so getting through the router would be a problem

26372770
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtcp
so we tried to stream the video source from the android client to server by rtsp rtp rtcp and serve these streams by http

26372770
rtsp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtcp
is it posssible of my idea streaming by rtsp rtp rtcp and serving

26372783

suppose i have a naive matrix multiplication kernel to multiplying n x n matrices

26372950

i know this issue is probably somewhat common with the new update and is most likely an easy fix as well but i recently upgrade from xcode-6 beta to the full versioning and many of my subclasses have errors

26372957
width	height
as a start set the offsets to top 0 and left 0 with 100 for the width and height

26372980
multiplying	add
you probably want to add a constant value instead of multiplying

26372992
post	get
you can get all the handles you need from uiautomation just use the post message function like this

26372997
post	get
the problem that i am having is that the module.php that is supposed to get the post variables and insert them into the database has multiple functions for different forms

26372997
post	get
or maybe set a post variable outside of the form in javascript and use a link for get variables

26373025
put	get
should be enough if it does not work you need to get errors read the errors and fix the command works so put the username and password in odbc.ini and give it a try

26373056
google-chrome	firefox
but when the code is online it does not work in firefox and google-chrome

26373056
google-chrome	firefox
in both firefox and google-chrome if i go back to step 1 and try again it all works fine there are no session lost issues

26373056
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the major pieces of my code are below along with some log tracing where you can see how the session id is lost in firefox and google-chrome and not in ie and safari

i know that realloc would be much easier to use but i am trying to do this only using malloc

26373194
multiplying	add
then when storing in the database multiplying to whatever integer accuracy is needed but before truncating as an integer add + - 1 10 to compensate for truncation errors or + - 51 100 to round

26373207
integer	fractions
the problem is that by the time you pass a value to round the horse is already out of the barn integer division chops off the fractions part so math.round gets a clean 1 which it happily returns

26373281
hide	show
here s an example that uses jquery to show hide an alert as different transitions occur

26373311
apache	nginx
apache nginx serves a static files css js html pages and etc

puma	unicorn
for self purpose we are need not much thus we are satisfied with basic tools for development such as embedded file server in webric or puma or unicorn

26373337
implements	extends
usually the standard pattern for implements a tkinter application is to have some root object called application or something which extends tkinter.frame and which then goes on to create all the widgets which define your interface

26373615
hide	show
i could just use two tablix and hide show one or the other based on conditions but i m hoping for another method

26373635
puts	gets
you could create a macro that puts this all together and gets a little fancier it ultimately depends on your use case and how you want to input data or whether that is even necessary often it is not as there are logical rules that determine the relationship between sheets which can be constructed in to code syntax etc.

26373639
versioning	upgrade
after talking to you via email it looks like the root issue here is that you haven t successfully upgrade your dsp to the latest versioning

versioning	upgrade
we are releasing dreamfactory versioning 1.8 on bitnami tomorrow so you should upgrade to the latest versioning

26373646

26373809
implements	extends
most of the pieces of code that i actually need to run do not have much in common besides the fact that they need to run on the edt or in a swingworker so extends swingworker or implements runnable is not going to help

26373810
put	get
the reason that you put all of the information about the table into the model is so that ruby can use that information to automatically get rows out of the database and put them into those model objects

26373963
hid	keyboard
i have two keyboards one is standard usb keyboard hid the other is a gpio keyboard

jtextfield	jdatechooser
this assumes that the database column is text and that date is actually a jdatechooser and not a jtextfield which i suspect it is.

26374063
hide	show
using jquery s show and hide methods are essentially the same as just saying display block and display none in css which as i just mentioned can t be transitioned

gridview	sqldatasource
i have a query in sql that creates another column named as gsc where it sums up the value of cash charge gift and discount in tbldaily table.the result is passed to a sqldatasource in asp.net where it is used to load the gridview

26374194

26374194
button	checkbox
when he she checks the 01 01 2014 - 01 05 2014 checkbox rows and clicks the recompute button

26374194
button	checkbox
the checkbox in the gridview and recompute button act like the tool to insert and delete data in tbldiscount and signal summing and deducting the discount from the gsc gross sales chargeable in the gridview data

at the second for-loop it says subscripted value is not an arrays

26374441
post	put
the main difference between post and put

26374441
post	get
usually you should get 201 created response code to post request coupled with location header pointing to url of newly created resource

post	put
you need to contain uuid in put post payload

26374441
post	put
put and post both transfer representation to rest server in order to change append resource state

26374681
ubuntu	linux
i work under linux ubuntu 12.04 64 bit and qt 4.8

26374689
int	boolean
i should also mention that i am doing this to simplify the process of searching through this content later using eea.facetednav in which i don t know how to have a boolean search interface return results based on if the int is 0

26374705
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
in ejb if any of the method which is continuing a transaction if throws a runtimeexception like nullpointerexception then it cause the transaction to roll back and in trace you will be shown transactionrollbackexception

26375061
for-loop	loops
if you are iterating using a for-loop or using while loops with iterator it will not get into the iteration if the collection is empty

26375084
google-chrome	firefox
the css i have used works well in google-chrome and firefox

26375087
getter	setter
then add a localcache instance to your class and you can have much simpler getter setter

26375121
for-loop	loops
you could also use the above in a for-loop if you prefer by not declaring an action as the third parameter of loops such as

26375137
int	double
i tried a pointer to an array of int and a double pointer to no avail

26375141
int	double
i am trying to cast an int value in a struct to a double

26375157

26375233
post	get
i think you are using get request ideally it should be post request

26375273
subtract	add
now we will subtract maximum upside limit cross to the upper portion of the superposition wave form and add minimum downside limit cross to the lower portion of the superposition wave form

26375273

26375317
hash	md5
note is fine as it s generated by md5 hash which won t contain any character that leads to sql error injection

26375425
google-chrome	safari
likewise in google-chrome or safari inspect element does the same thing

26375442
comparator	comparable
from here you can rely on the fact that bigdecimal implements the comparable interface so it has a comparator method

26375442
comparator	comparable
so you can implement comparable for track and then just delegate to the comparator method on bigdecimal

26375525
folder	directory
so i made two folder physical directory and kept each a.h and a.m in separate folder

26375550
width	height
change width and size to some thing big for example width 23 and height 5 -

adding a password for remote access git push pull won t solve the root cause of the problem root access by others

26375651
postgresql	greenplum
the database is built on top of postgresql similar to other databases like netezza and greenplum

26375684

you should based you calculations on known values like the components width and height you should also provide some idea of the preferred size you would like your component to be under optimal circumstances for example.

26375750
swift	objective-c
also concerning the ios apis they are written in objective-c and adapted to work in swift

26375750
swift	objective-c
there is a great inconsistency between data types used by the ios swift apis they use the objective-c data types instead of the native swift ones

26375750
swift	objective-c
from my experience i started developing and learning swift this month it s best to stick to objective-c for now

26375756
int	chars
if you tell the compiler you re using a chars instead of an int during static analysis it will know the bounds of the variable is between 0-255 instead of 0- 2 32-1

26375861
swift	objective-c
this is not building code in swift or objective-c - it s using c# which is then ahead-of-time compiled into native code

26375862
try-catch	exception-handling
wrap your code into try-catch block and throws exception-handling on every error

26375964
post	get
well if you want the php to get something you ned to post something

26375983
bindparam	bindvalue
you can either use bindvalue or bindparam before calling execute or you can pass an array of parameters to execute

26375983
bindparam	bindvalue
it s common to use the array argument to execute if you already have your parameters in an array and use bindparam or bindvalue if they re in different variables

26375989
children	parent
just call the following method to get all children of a parent

26375990

jar	war
when i remove javax.ws.rs-api-2.0.1.jar jar from my webapp war lib directory i am able to access the rest end points

26376183
calloc	malloc
if speed is a concern you might special-case the common small sizes by declaring a local array and use loc instead of a malloc -ed or calloc -ed pointer for small arrays of size 8

26376183
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	calloc	malloc
of course you should always test against failure of calls to malloc calloc realloc etc..

26376209
gtk	drawingarea
i am programming a tool that has a custom canvas in it derived from gtk drawingarea

width	height
after the copping image i don t save the cropped image but i get the data in which x y width height are there

26376436
hash	salt
aside from the fact that storing a password in a table is a horribly insecure design you should only be storing a hash of the password plus some random salt and the fact that it doesn t make a lot of sense to define your own weak ref cursor type rather than using the built-in sys_refcursor unless you really need to work with ancient versions of oracle and that returning a cursor from a procedure seems like a really odd way to do a login rather than writing a function that returns a boolean or some indicator the problem is one of naming conventions

26376520
google-chrome	firefox
if there isn t diacritics or if it s in antoher browser ie9 google-chrome firefox the handler isn t called

26376537
umdf	wdk

if you have a portrait layout in your layout folder and and landscape layout in your layout-land folder then android will need to destroy the activity and recreate it with the new layout

26385101
width	height
in your css transitions change the references from width to height as that s what you re actually animating

26385127
google-chrome	firefox
actually that problem happen because socket.io starts in firefox with xhr-polling transport method and immediately after it switchs to websocket instead google-chrome starts directly with websocket

26385143
google-chrome	safari
this is a known bug in safari unsure about safari 8 and older versions of google-chrome

26385144
min	max	range	min	range	max
make and model are both custom fields and min price and max price obviously need to use some sort of range function to return results within the price range

26385252
free	malloc
if you want to read this entire file in to memory you will need to use the heap malloc free

26385261
width	height
the pixel height is larger than the pixel width

26385261
width	height
the pixel width and pixel height are saved in image properties

26385261
width	height
i can only get a proper measurement if i remove the scale of the image or manually change the pixel height and pixel width to an equal number

26385261
width	height
as a workaround i was thinking of writing a small macro that saves pixel height and pixel width then removes the scale of the image then measures major and minor axis length in pixel and then re-applies pixel height and pixel width to the measurements

26385275
postgresql	mysql
so the answer is no you cannot do that at the moment but you can access the mysql server from within postgresql instead

26385291
post	get
once you ve created an email column on post you can loop over the post s and get the user s email

26385294

the css i have works great in google-chrome safari but fails for firefox

26385334
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my children elements align properly in google-chrome and safari but in firefox they are aligned at the bottom and don t seems to have much bearing on the location of the text

26385334
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari have a different way of calculating the baseline

26385338
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as the question suggests i ve created a static website with rack which works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox development and production but it won t load properly in safari not at all in development partial load in production

simply set the margin and width and you get what you need

26385376
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works for me in firefox safari and google-chrome in all versions i ve tested

26385379
width	height
then anytime you want to draw a texture with id texid width w and height h at position x y of your window

26385382
google-chrome	safari
when i test on mozilla it s ok but with google-chrome or safari the event is not trigged.

26385400
post	get
i have been using afnetworking to send post calls to my own server with ease but this is the first time i have tried sending an nsdata object through afnetworking which is where i think the problem lies and am not exactly sure how i need to adjust the call to get it to work

26385498
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
you re decreasing it by 10px in the margin and then you increase the height and width of both stackpanel and windowsformshost

26385498
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
but due to margin this manually setting of height and width doesn t effect on the stackpanel and only increases the size of the windowsformshost and it goes out of the edges

26385498
width	height
also set the height and width in c# they ll effect now

26385500
int	double
the columns contain multiple int data string data and also double data

26385517
folder	directory	folder	dir
in your ide when you develop against specific version of java simply mark directory relevant to your java version as source folder because by default ides will only recognize src main java as source dir

26385547
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
if you run it in google-chrome firefox safari and opera everything works fine

26385740
ant	maven
use ant instead of maven for compilation

26385746
mouseout	mouseleave

26385826
sudo	passwd
i was able to sudo from java and with the above no passwd is required for that application

26385838
gridview	repeater
my alternative approach uses a repeater and does compile but the repeater itself handles the itemcommand for each button preventing the page itemcommand events from bubbling up to the gridview

26385838
gridview	repeater
each button raises the correct event but the events never reach the gridview because they are handled at a lower level by the repeater

26385839
centos	linux
i need to download files in bulk each 0-2.5 mb from an url to my server linux centos can be any other too

26385877
width	height
now your image is created you can pull the height and width using img.height and img.width which are obtained once the image loads

26385888
jlist	jtable
the approach works best with view components that minimize rendering using the flyweight pattern jtable jlist jtextarea etc

26385977
portrait	landscape
there is no such layout that does this automatically i might recommend a gridview or tableview and a layout file for each different configuration portrait landscape 7 10 inch screens etc this way you can set the number of columns

26386028
button	checkbox
i have three radio button i want my gui to be uploaded depend on the checkbox i click

26386028

26386051
for-loop	arrays
when i use a for-loop i can do inplace replacing in an arrays

26386087

since the fixed position in general is not all that stable on touch some more than others google-chrome works great it is still acting up in safari ios 8 in situations that used to work in ios 7 therefore i generally just use js to detect touch devices including windows mobile

26386114
hide	show
the below assumes that your show and hide functions do work the way you use them

26386123

this will allow you to store the int in a variable which you can then double and print back out via your printf call

26386131
getter	setter
you have to follow java bean naming conventions when you declare fields and corresponding getter and setter methods

26386143
int	boolean
description of my collection each document is a list of fields som of strings some of reals some of int some of categorical boolean

26386182
mongodb	bson
i can t give you a more elegant php solution but the reason why this is causing a problem is because bson and hence mongodb uses null terminated strings arrays etc

26386183
width	margin
you will need to reduce the width of the block-grid li items and then add a margin to take up the extra width

26386286
exponent	modulo
so now i have e public key exponent and n modulo as bytes

26386375

udp	tcp
in both tcp server and udp server once the socket is created using the particular socket type it is bound to the port using bind system call

26390150
udp	tcp
the procedure of binding is not necessary in either the tcp client or udp client because it does not matter in whatever port the client communicates

26390150
udp	tcp
till this point it is same for both tcp server and udp server

this relies on the fact that if would be very hard to find a hash collision two secrets which when combined with the other players salt and the move that would create the same signature

26390934
hash	hmac
technically the hash function needs to have collision resistance and second preimage resistance to work well in this scenario - the former often implies the latter and most hmac functions available in a modern crypto library have these properties at least from a practical standpoint of no known attacks better than brute-force

26390945

int	double
i did consider the loss of resolution between float double and int between solutions but it didn t seem to make a difference other than the encountered overflows

26394395
min	max
is that if t is for example 64 bits then the max will be rounded when converting to your usual 64 bit double - assuming 2 s complement the same is not true of the min of course

26394395
int	double
in c it would be something along the lines of -- assuming t is long long int and f is double and that these are both the usual 64 bit values.

26394395
min	max
if the t is constant then the construction of the two floating point values for min and max will i assume be done at compile time so the two comparisons are pretty straightforward

26394395
min	max
but you do need to know that its min and max will fit in an ordinary integer long long int say

java operates for arithmetic operations from left to right and solve first one which have higher precedence in your question and have similar precedence so java will used left to right association it will solve s c first then multiplying by c then this term is subtract from s because + _ have lower precedence

26394540
document.write	window.open
if you want to further experiment i would suggest to look at those methods that deal with different dom environments window.open document.write iframe.contentwindow cross-frame-access to see whether you can get any of these to spawn a second environment which runs in parallel reliably

26394564
int	chars
primitives in java such as chars and int are passed by value in java

26394597
simctl	xcrun
however in xcode 6 the command xcrun has new subcommand called simctl that allows me to manage ios simulator including resetting the simulator and installing the application

26394611
spaces	linefeed
a better way to write this assuming you re not interested in trailing tabs or spaces would be since both cr and linefeed are whitespace

26394643
draggable	droppable
you may need to have the draggable s position set manually cased on the ui object s position at time of drop in relation to the droppable target

26394696
for-loop	arrays
here s the answer to your second question get the fields you need from your mysql table mysql_fetch_assoc get the number of rows in your fetched arrays create a form and a select element and then create a simple for-loop to go through each row and create an option variable in each iteration

26394898
implements	extends
create a menuactivity class which implements all the logic for common menu items and then extends this class from all of your activities rather than extends the standard activity class

26394919
int	double
to answer your question directly you need to change the return type of compareto from double to int

26394919
tostring	compareto
add override annotations before both tostring and compareto

26394934
int	double
compareto method returns an int and not a double

26394947

getter	setter
so i m trying to make a code generator that will generate setter and getter methods if you input variable names like int nums or string words etc

26395063
public	protected
in c++ there are inheritance access specifiers for each inherited class just like there are member function access specifiers inside every class private protected public

26395063
public	protected
public inheritance + protected member function protected member function

26395063
public	protected
protected inheritance + public member function protected member function

26395067
prng	random
prng s seed which may include truly random values

26395089
put	get
once you get that from your corporate site you can probably put in some logic to redirect to the corporate site if it doesn t match where you re expecting

26395090
put	get
get is used to obtain a value for an attribute and set is used to put a value to an attribute

26395094
getter	setter
as the above comment states getter and setter encapsulate hide inner details of your class

26395094
getter	setter
for example in the simple case you describe instance variables are exposed via getter and setter

26395094
getter	setter
keep in mind also that getter and setter need not always be provided

26395105
folder	directory
i then moved and replaced the curl.dll file in the downloaded folder with the curl.dll file located in my php ext directory

26395111
put	get
i ve done different images to get but with three different arrays to put in random position doesn t work

26395114
getter	setter
so getter and setter are both accessor methods

26395114
mutators	setter
therefore setter are an example of a mutators method

26395122
getter	setter
some benefits of using getter and setter known as encapsulation or data-hiding

26395122
getter	setter
the fields of a class can be made read-only by only providing the getter or write-only by only providing the setter

26395123
getter	setter
the second reason is you can have getter without setter effectivly making the variable read only

26395140
getter	setter
however the same logic says that getter and setter should generally be avoided unless there s an actual need for them and there very seldom is such a need

26395229
folder	directory
now in your case you got to figure out a way to connect to the repositories check your settings.xml located in the .m2 folder in your user directory and check if you can connect to the internet central maven repositories
