getter	setter
i ve been reading the tutorials and i m right now designing the model s architecture and since i m new to objective-c i m not sure if the standards are like java where you have public setter getter and private attribute

23520030
getter	setter
if the standards are so declaring private properties are done in the file interface but how do i syntetize a setter getter and how do i call them from outside is it like

23520049
post	put
and if you need to post put you can use jquery like this

23520063
int	double
the arraylists are either arraylists of int or double

23520063
int	double
however it will read their values no matter whether the value is a string int double or null.

23520066
appdata	uninstaller
redo those steps with just clearing appdata and no uninstaller and it works again once

23520096
getter	setter
you can create a private property and create public setter getter method of your own

23520119
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
everything is working fine but the viewdidload viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods are not calling from the begining

23520147
getter	setter
however if you want to hide the implementation of your code you can declare a property in the .m file and provide setter getter to the outside world just returning the information you want to be visible

23520147
getter	setter
by synthesizing a property the getter setter will be automatically implemented and you don t need to do it yourself

23520154
width	height
i have an image that is being resized programmatically based on the current height width of the container

23520211

in this example each object in the mydata array has a property named prop which has a child property named subprop that is a date value

23520280
post	get
first make sure that the rest client you are using is trying to send the date by get and not by post

23520292
firefox	safari
note firefox only supported elliptical borders in 3.5+ and older webkit browsers safari 4 incorrectly treat 40px 10px as the same as 40px 10px

23520293
getter	setter
this will automatically define a setter and a getter and you don t need to synthesise your property as of xcode 4.4

23520314
accessor	properties
a properties is essentially a promise that a class provides certain accessor methods

23520314
accessor	properties
so if you want the accessor to be public declare the properties in your class s public interface in the header file and be done with it

23520358
sorting	grouping
using sorting and grouping probably similar to what you did in hyperion you can mostly accomplish this in ssrs using expressions

23520368
getter	setter
another option is having a setter and multiple getter one for each part of the field you need

23520378

subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
i m trying to make a calculator that can do 5 processes which are to add subtract multiplying divide and square root values that users input

23520526
stdout	stderr
this makes it mix stdout and stderr together in the result instead of treating data on stderr as an error

23520563
onresume	onpause
other than that it s good to pause any running processes in onpause and resume then in onresume

23520627
google-chrome	firefox
i encountered similar problems in both google-chrome and firefox though it may not be the solution for your issue

23520646

23520715
accessor	properties
understand that declaring a properties causes the compiler to create accessor for you

23520715
getter	setter
public getter private setter can be handled as indicated below

23520715
getter	setter
there is no need to create your own setter and getter prefer using an attribute as it saves writing setter getter

as it is passed up the stack it may be processed by various modules and layers ip arp udp tcp as well as things like tap devices

23520767

23523015
put	get
i can get rid of the attributes and name the property back to customerid so it matches the db table and it will insert into the table but it will always put in 0 as the key which makes sense just because it is the default value for the int but does not help me when it has to be an autoincrementing primary key

if however all values that you re aggregating are null and you want to return a 0 instead of null you can use ifnull or the more common coalesce to show 0 as the sum instead of null

23523724
coalesce	isnull
isnull is a valid sql server function ifnull is the equivalent in mysql but all major databases make use of coalesce which returns the first non-null value in a set ie coalesce null null 5 would return 5

23531803
children	parent
i m unsure how to handle patching of properties that are arrays...for instance my parent object has multiple children

23531803

what you are trying to achieve would require a unique product package and upgrade code for all software packages to allow a side by side installation of v1 and v2 of the software however you need to be very careful with how you choose to allow side by side

inherited	subclassing
you need to read up on inherited and understand how subclassing works

23531912
superclass	subclassing
once you ve stored a reference to a subclassing into a superclass typed variables a into b in the above code while you haven t changed the referenced object in anyway you have lost the immediate knowledge that the reference is in fact to an object of the subclassing - all you can immediately state about a reference stored in b above is that it refers to an object which is at least an nsdictionary but may be of any subclassing of nsdictionary

23531912
getter	setter
back to properties a property is two methods assuming read-write you can have read-only properties a getter and a setter which combine to provide an abstraction of a variable - you can read and assign to them using dot notation in expressions

inherited	properties
you should read up on objects object references inherited and properties

background-color	transparency
an additional comment if you interested because your images are pngs and have a transparency you could create the same hover effect with just one image instead of two and fade background-color in and out although you would need to crop the images a bit as they all have a transparency border around them

23532550
background-image	box-shadow
and another approach would be css image sprites set all of the images on one image and then use background-image clipping to show the parts that you want although you possibly wouldn t be able to have a glow effect although you could do something with box-shadow

23532575
int	double
the difference is the conversion of int to double in the first code the vectors contain unsigned int the product is in int arithmetic but the accumulation uses double in assembler this adds the cvtsi2sd instruction to your code

23552980
np-hard	np-complete
therefore all np-complete decision problems are also np-hard

23552980
np-hard	np-complete
if a decision problem is np-complete the optimization version is np-hard because if you have a solution to the optimization you can also use it to answer the decision problem

google-chrome	firefox
this depends on the browser though as ie 10 seems to play just fine while firefox and google-chrome throw the error.

getter	setter
that means that if i separate gui and database processing in two class files and use encapsulation iâ d end up with hundreds of setter and getter methods one for each field

23553368
getter	setter
note that i have used setter and getter for this purpose and found out that it can get really hard to manage

23553874
int	chars
a compromise if you can t redesign the tables that i think will work is to add a persisted computed column with value try_convert int c.answer_text1 or its best equivalent based on what you know about the actual data in the table - perhaps the int value of only columns containing no non-digit chars and having length less than 9

23553904

i know one of the reasons this is because a heap s children must less than or equal to the value of its parent so 81 violates this rule as but i am not sure on the other answer

23553934
getter	setter
of course the class properties are usually private and accessed with public setter getter

the glibc authors realised that this behaviour causes leak checkers such as valgrind to falsely report leaks in glibc when a leak check is done at exit

packets	pcap
makes me think that you are working under the wrong assumption that a single pcap packets contains the serialized bytes of one single object

23554223
packets	pcap
it is theoretically possible to write a tool that de-serializes objects that were serialized using protocol-buffers from a pcap dump provided that the dump contains the full communication between both peers packets were not truncated by the tool that generated the dump etc

sorting	filtering
perform your query with the inequality filtering and just return the items in the wrong order and let the client-application worry about sorting them

23554430
sorting	filtering
if your inequality filtering only removes a small fraction of the entries option 2 might be much faster as it doesn t require any o n sorting but if you have a huge database of entries and only a very small number of them will match the inequality definitely go for option 1

put	get
you can sort of get there with polymorphic_path though for some reason that will try to put at the end of the url when using custom parameters

addition	multiplication
proposition when implemented in logic gates using the usual algorithms an integer multiplication circuit is o log n times slower than an addition circuit where n is the number of bits in a word

23555455
multiplying	addition
so we must show that a gradeschool multiplying circuit is o log n times deeper than an addition circuit

23555455
addition	multiplication
this solves the multiplication phase of the gradeschool algorithm leaving just the addition phase

23555471
getter	setter
in particular __get__ and __set__ should not be confused with getter and setter like the java concept

23555482
bower	npm
what happens is that when i run the npm install -g bower or sudo nom install -g command or bower becomes a loop with errors but unfinished performs rollback and start again i guess

23555482
gruntjs	yeoman
also happens to be set to download other dependencies such as karma mocha chai i do not know if will be dependencies of bower but the problem is not only that but it happens to try to install any dependencies exam yeoman gruntjs etcâ

expression-blend	silverlight
apparently i needed expression-blend sdk for silverlight 4

23555800

cdr	cons
i recetly watched a sicp lecture in which sussman demonstrated how it was possible to implement scheme s cons car and cdr using nothing but procudures

23556063

i am trying to make a second hand that rotates each second like in a clock.i am not clearly understanding what glpushmatrix and glpopmatrix does in opengl .when should i use it and where should i declare it .is it before drawing an object of after drawing an object.also does glpushmatrix push the matrix of all the objects in the viewport as a whole or does it push just the matrix of a specified object

google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie and firefox but google-chrome doesn t work

23556275
bower	npm
between npm bower and component i couldn t find all of my dependencies in any single package manager

23556275
bower	npm
to make this work in the browser in all cases use bower s --require feature to alias all dependencies to their npm expected names while loading a shim that gets the globally exposed version of the dependency

23556275
mocha	node.js
as long as the file that require s each test suite isn t in the test directory itself running mocha to run the tests in node.js will still work fine

23556429
yacc	bison
in fact you should always return 0 from an pattern if you are working with yacc bison because that s how you signal the parser that it has reached the end of input

23556431
put	get
put these lines to get maximum

23556431
put	get
put these lines to get minimum

23556437
prepare	execute
if you use prepare statements parsing preparation is done only once and cost to execute statement is only disk write which is enhanced further if you are within active transaction because server can batch that write by delaying it until transaction commits

23556549
switching	screens
however after a user logs in i want to switching to the main activity of checking the gestures but instead the app just refreshes to the login screens again

23556558

as it turns out if i put my finger close to parent s 0 0 coordinates the view doesn t get displaced

23556573
jobs	cron
i know we have cron jobs in php

23556597
restrict	shared
the problem is i want to restrict the shared documents to view only no download option

23556642
min	max
the average max and min will be 2 but the sum will be

23556642
min	max
the average max and min will be 2 but the sum will be

23556687
put	get
you will get like bellow snap shot sample out put after run the code

23556717
jobs	cron
then use some free cron job server on the web like or just do a web search for free online cron jobs

23556748
restrict	shared
i think you d want something login-based - have a simple registration procedure with which you can connect the email to a user let the client choose their own password give the user rights to access the page shared the link either use encryption with email or do it with the user account restrict multiple sessions

23556803
int	chars
first you should access its pixels with type uchar unsigned chars instead of int

23556803
int	chars
and when cout you must explicitly convert to other types like int in order to print it correctly because cout will work weird when printing unsigned chars when its value is larger than 127

23556810
addition	multiplication
of course integer multiplication is quite complex compared to addition but quite a few amd cpu can execute a multiplication in a single cycle

23556810
addition	multiplication
other cpus take three or four cycles to do a multiplication which is a bit slower than addition

23556810
addition	multiplication
so yes multiplication is in the same speed class nowadays but no it s still not exactly as fast as addition on all cpus

23556817
button	checkbox
there documentation mentions checkbox but not radio button

23556835
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
trying to obfuscation a secret in installed applications is a futile effort as the secrets can always be recovered using the abundance of reverse-engineering and debugging tools

google-chrome	firefox
i found that in google-chrome or firefox console

23556887
folder	directory
what those three lines do is upload all the changes you have made to the source of your octopress blog the jekyll project to the source branch of your github repository note that this will include everything in the root directory not just the few files found in the unrelated source folder

23556910
min	max	range	min	range	max
it doesn t change the range of values for p and q but i think it leads to a more accurate estimation of p and q since the actual min and max differences may be excessively high or low biasing excessively towards one side or the other

23556997
width	height
knowing the rough size of a word here i discarded areas that were too small below 20 pixels width or height or too large above 100 pixels width or height to ignore objects that are unlikely to be words to get the results in the above image

23562293
for-loop	loops
however it is not quite behaving as i was hoping when called at the moment currently when the user clicks the filter button all of the system.out.println statements are displayed in the console so clearly the while loops is being entered but i don t see anything displayed in the gui which i think would indicate that the for-loop at the end of the while loops is not being entered.

as a starting point i took the following project which works by extends the shellbolt class to implements r integration as well as an r library to handle communication between the java and r sides

23563258
width	margin
the style issue is a bit more complicated it s the combination of width and margin messing up the slider s calculations - you d need tweaks all around but removing margin and aligning the width 90 up a level is the biggest impact

23563258
width	margin
add width 90 margin 0 5

23563857
maven	pom.xml
this shaded module is described by my base-shaded module which basically only contains a pom.xml which configures a dependency on base and the maven shade plugin

23563904
rainbowtable	salt
to prevent rainbowtable attacks you should add a random salt to the hashing scheme but this means that you cannot verify the password with sql alone

23563904
hash	salt
you would have to read the salt of every row in the user table and calculate the hash for comparing

23563904
hash	salt
first you have to find the hash and its salt by the given username afterwards you can verify the password for this single row

23563909
hide	show
i want to hide it until another button is pressed where another javascript function is called to show the form

23563953

please bare in mind that i haven t put in any validation stuff etc but will do after i can get it to post into the database thanks in advance

23564082
children	parent
i have im my current workspace the parent module and the children each as a maven module

23564120
min	max
semantically the min and max functions degenerate to a check whether the collection contains a nan

23564120
min	max
since there are more appropriate ways to check for the existence of nans collection.find _.isnan it would be great to maintain a semantically meaningful min max on collections

23564120
min	max
filtering nans before calling min max

23564120
min	max
however this approach seems to depend on whether i m interesting in finding the min or max

23564145
centos	linux
i have a test server hosted on amazon ec2 on linux centos

opensips changes c and m lines of sdp accordingly but when packet goes to voip switch its rtpproxy server also changes sdp

23564301
voip	rtp
so peer1 is sending packets to hout hosted rtpproxy server and peer2 sending rtp packets to voip switch s rtpproxy server

23564307
width	height
now the problem arises when i crop the image greater than 225 px in width and 225 pixels in height

23564346
min	max
what about bringing an implicit into scope that would allow you to have new min max methods on the list

23564358
width	margin
since width of ruler-mark-short and ruler-mark-high can be changed dynamically by javascript i can t use margin or left in pixels

23564358
margin	text-align
so i have to use something like margin 0 auto or text-align center but non of this works

23564385
put	get
so probably use it to get a value and put that into another field manually

23564429
min	max
another option would be to wrap any ungrouped columns in an aggregate function like max or min

23564433
ng-show	ng-hide	ng-show	ng-class	ng-class	ng-hide

note your class b could make the protected member public like this

23564743

img is an inline element by default and it occupies its very specific width height

23564758
prepare	execute
so add escape sequence to seprate it into pieces and execute using a prepare statement

23564779
width	height
400 200 2 target width target height 240 x

23564779
width	height
here as android devices have different sizes in terms of aspect ratio width height you may want to check how the new height fits within the screen height

23564779
width	height
if the height doesn t meet what you need or if the height happens to be out of bounds of the screen or if the new height doesn t meet a minimun height you want then you do the inverse calculation by setting a height and calculating the new width allways respecting the aspect ratio

23564807
width	height
as berak commented you are not using cv size correctly whose first parameter is width and second height not the other way around

23564818

make foo public instead of protected

23565149
children	parent
so to check if a parent div with id delay has children div you can just put as a target

23565227
children	parent
note that jquery s pseudo-selector first projects a collection to its first item while the css selector selects all nodes that are the first child of their respective parent in fact css3 provides the generalisation of nth-child an+b where a and b are integers such that iterating n over non-negative integers produces the index of the target elements among all children

23565242
post	get
however the item being queried is a select so i would prefer using get instead of post

23565257
ssl	https
i am looking for a detailed explanation of the relationship between http protocol and ssl certificate and also between https and ssl certificate

23565278

23565445
gson	jackson
moving from jackson to gson eliminated this behavior

23565449

23565686

folder	dir
also when you are working in wordpress you have to work only in themes folder and plugins folder you can simply implement it root dir where is you wp-config but i am sure it will not give you the result that you are trying to achieve

23566007
post	get
in the get request action method you can populate this list and render the view and in the post action method you can exclude this property during model binding so that only the selected item property will get bound

23566009
post	get
when i try to go to this same post on my android app however using the asynctask post-method at the bottom of this page i get an error 400 oauth2 error

23573868
hide	show
using requeststart sync requestend to show and hide a spinner is not wise

post	get
post to one of netbeans mailing lists where you can get answer from developers

google-chrome	firefox
when the page initially loads in just firefox primary browsers used by the client base are google-chrome ie and firefox it shows the broken image icon

23574165

change them to classes and you ll need to do some tree traversing to get the reference to the correct form elements to show and hide

23574165
hide	show
also your css class names show hide aren t very semantic

23574167

equals	gethashcode
in other words i can see why in any situation where you will perform gethashcode on an object you will almost certainly need to know how to perform equals too

23586253
equals	gethashcode
also the definition of equals is part of one of the requirement for implementing gethashcode correctly if two objects are equals their hash codes must be equals too

23586288
min	max
as alexey romanov has already pointed out the notion of incomparability would require the max min functions to take a partial order

23586288
min	max
unfortunately alexey is also right in the point that a general max min function based on a partial order does not make sense think of the case where the partial ordering only defines relations within certain groups but the groups themselves are completely independent from each other for instance the elements a b c d with just the two relations a b and c d

23586288
min	max
we would have two max min

23586288
min	max
in that regard one may even argue that formally max min should always return two values nan and the respective valid min max since nan itself is also an extremal value in its own relation group

23586288
min	max
so as a result of partial orders being too general complex the min max functions take an ordering

23586288
min	max
so when trying to come up with an implementation of an ordering to fulfill our desired min max behavior it is clear that we have to violate something and bear the consequences

23586288
min	max
the implementation of min max minby maxby in traversableonce follows the pattern for min

23586288
min	max
now to our actual problem at hand the min max functions

23586316
int	chars
but the second arg is chars not int

23586348
int	chars
a chars is really just an 8 bit number so a single chars alone is no different than an int except that it can only store smaller numbers

23586372
equals	gethashcode
what it boils down to is separating gethashcode from equals did not get enough point to warrant it being separate interfaces

23586374
equals	gethashcode
the reason the has been added to the .net framework is to allow you to customize the logic to hash-based containers in cases when you cannot modify the class with a different override of equals gethashcode say it s in someone else s library or you do not want to change the default implementation for any other reason - for example for backward compatibility

23586374
equals	gethashcode
this is the primary purpose of having this interface you give it to hash containers and they use it instead of the equals gethashcode logic that comes with the object

23586374
equals	gethashcode
it is hard to come up with a scenario when an externally-supplied equals would be useful by itself without gethashcode

23586397
int	chars
the compiler is casting the chars to int on the fly so the error msg makes sense at least to someone used to interpreting c compiler messages

23586407
int	chars
as for why the warning message refers to int rather than chars it s because printf is a variadic function

23586407
integer	unsigned
in this special case arguments of integer types narrower than int are promoted to int or to unsigned int

23586407
int	chars
so even though the expression b is of type chars the actual argument that s passed to printf is of type int

23586407
int	chars
specifically it s the result of converting the value of b from chars to int

23586544
int	chars	int	double
int types shorter than int short and chars in their various forms are promoted to int and float values are promoted to double

23586544
int	chars
in this context using a format such as c to print a chars or d to print a decimal int is probably best

23586544
integer	unsigned
corresponding unsigned integer type and the value is representable in both types

implements	extends
you can implements multiple interfaces but you can only extends one class

google-chrome	firefox
doing it with google-chrome extensions is pretty simple but firefox add-ons are a little bit confusing

23586571
min	max
one way that i thought of is to make 12 circles by ylim c 1 12 and represent each angle distribution by a rectangle with min and max distribution values as coordinates for that rectangle so first column or first angle will be represented by a rectangle with ymin 1 and ymax 2 xmin min of column 1 and xmax max of column 1 etc.

for some reason there was a java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel for version 6 but none for version 7 specifically debian and ubuntu distributions

23593210
redhat	fedora
i am not sure if the same is true for fedora and redhat

23593237
integer	unsigned
if you treat the byte as an unsigned integer then you get the range 0-255 which is valid for all the cp- and isoo-8859- charsets

23593237
int	chars
ascii chars are in the range 0-127 and so appear valid whether you treat the int as signed or unsigned

23593284
16-bit	64bit
string array the storage for a string consists of elements of a fixed size 8 bits 16-bit 32 bits 64bit

23593299
post	get
fill into the link the app id of your newly created page tab and run this link in your brwoser you will get a site with the prompt from the first image i cited in the first post

23593313
width	height
the idea here is to place the glyph inside a span element which is inside an outer span element so that the outer element has the desired background color and has its width and height set to match the dimensions of the visible part of the glyph obtained experimentally

23593336
folder	directory
that would attempt to change the directory to a name250 directory contained in the root folder

23593381
maven	pom.xml
within the amdatu project we don t use maven we develop with bndtools so you would have to provide the proper metadata pom.xml yourself and then import the bundles into your own maven repository

23593402
width	height
in addition you set the iframe s height width to 100 but give no reference for that 100

23593424
uicollectionview	uitableview
a nsfetchedresultscontroller works with uitableview s or uicollectionview s

23593437
operands	scalar
operands to the || and operators must be convertible to logical scalar values

23593443
width	height
but when i use a.copyto b i always get image with width height and content of a even if b was bigger

23593470
post	put
put the post url in and then scroll down to open graph warnings that should be fixed

23593514
width	height
and no width nor height in the options in the js

23593525
post	get
my problem is no matter how much i move around in the code i just cant seems to get the correct title date to appear above the correct post

23593544
children	parent
this will make sure that the object is not destroyed at the end of your function but will not leak either because when the parent gets destroyed the children get automatically destroyed too with the qt parent child hierarchy

23593562
operands	scalar
i would guess that you meant the scalar first operands as rather than the vector

23593579
maven	pom.xml
but i don t know which project should be involved in the pom.xml of my maven project

23593611
uiview	subviews
my question is is there anyway to add a uiview as a subviews to uiimageview

23593618
put	get
when i get the json file first i put it into the instance do some operation and then put it into the database

23593629
width	margin
you can use data-role content on your data-role page and the elements will no longer fill the width of the screen but have a nice standard 20px margin all around

23593812
hide	show
i have created the following javascript function to hide or show charts and then calling it from a text item

23593834
for-loop	loops
it does not seem efficient to reinitialize it again with a for-loop as i did outside loops

23593847
width	height
this means that without any width height constraints a uiimageview will display the image at its normal size but not so with gpuimageview depending on your other constraints it could have a 0 width height

23593847
width	height
you can either add additional constraints on the gpuimageview to constrain its width and height to match what you expect or you can subclass gpuimageview and implement intrinsiccontentsize to return whatever you expect it to be

23593850
flask	django	bottle	flask
try for example bottle and flask microframeworks and django a fully featured framework for web application development maybe tornado an http server but with enough of a web framework in it to be usable and to be very instructive - just reading the documentation on how to get started with these projects to get to a hello world page will lead you to lots of concepts you probably had not thought about yet

23593874
for-loop	arrays
simply reuse the arrays and reinitialize its values using another for-loop

23593878
post	get
i can throw pretty any string in a http post at that example and i only get valid demo objects

23593894
for-loop	arrays
also for the for-loop if pr is an arrays the condition should be something like

23593895
for-loop	arrays
you had greater than operator and thus the condition fails so the control flow does not go inside of your for-loop hence the arrays obviously won t be populated and thus leading to this error

23593916
for-loop	loops
i would also generally suggest using a foreach loops instead of a for-loop as it tends to simplify the code you don t have to worry about maintaining the counter or creating fence post errors etc. here s a brief example - i m guessing a bit at what the actual data is that is available to you hopefully you can extrapolate it to what you actually have

23593937
int	boolean
i would be inclined to use the mysql shortcut that treats a boolean as an int

23593948
portrait	landscape
in the portrait layout for smartphone devices or just any screen that fits that size there is only 1 pic and it is not the pic that is displayed on landscape view or on desktop pc s

i have installed xorg and some other needed xorg packages and when i run startx i get three windows and a litte clock with some green blue colored borders and i can move the widows with drag and drop

23594101
width	height
i have an window panel with fixed width and height say 500 400 in which an image will be shown.image s width height is 200 700

23594101
width	height
but image covers full width height of window violating image s original width

23594106

i can put them into an array and even sort them by one particular column but sorting them by one and then by another if the first column has numbers are are the same is totally beyond me if any of this post makes sense

23594283
versioning	upgrade
recently we are upgrade angular versioning from 1.0.8 to 1.2.16

23594290

a missing environment variable caused the code to get wrong gcov version and therefore .da files were serached instead of .gcda files that belong no newer lcov versions

23594317
prng	random
two approaches discussed in this post for generating random numbers for multiple threads are either to seed a seperate prng for each thread from dev urandom or to seed one prng from dev urandom and then seed each thread s prng from that one

my problem is i have the footer sticky and i did that so that when you click to the next page id the footer is still there except i don t want it to show when #page1 is selected

23594401
textview	imageview
also the imageview can become part of the textview compound drawable to reduce the controls count

23594403
width	margin
you can use data-role content on your data-role page and the elements will no longer fill the width of the screen but have a nice standard 20px margin all around

23594419
width	height
as said in javafx documentation if a group is used as the root the contents of the scene graph will be clipped by the scene s width and height and changes to the scene s size if user resizes the stage will not alter the layout of the scene graph

dictionary	map
it is very similat in dictionary deleting adding entries might invalidate internal structures that define order of iteration for example you deleted enough entries so hash map bucket size changed

23594596
versioning	upgrade
if a security problem is discovered then your distribution would fix it and ship an upgrade python versioning which may get automatically installed

23594706
portrait	landscape
for my portfolio the thumbnails are going to be alternating both landscape and portrait oriented images

23594706
portrait	landscape
a simple way to solve this would be to manually crop portrait images to fit landscape style

23594706
width	height
my major constraint is that i want the page to stay responsive as well as have my images keep their aspect ratio so a width 100 and height 100 is out

23594741
maven	m2e
the problem is that m2e requires one eclipse plugin for each maven plugin that you use it s actually a bit more complex than that but in practice there is an almost one to one correspondence between eclipse plugins and maven plugins for your project

23594741

you should also uninstall m2e so that it doesn t try to manage your maven project

int	double
problem is that double can have values like 1.5 which in case you want to change into int could be 1 or 2 or is just you re mistake in coding

23595072
int	double
to solve it you can cast double to int which cuts to full number

inline	inlining
since inlining happens towards the end of compilation when all the source code have been parsed and placed in some sort of ast abstract syntax tree or similar form whether the function is before or after the point of usage typically doesn t really matter - of course if the call is to a function that isn t part of the ast the source code is not available the compiler has no choice but to not inline it

better is to nest your view models and give them access to eachother parent knowing about the children or vice versa

23596074
width	height
the mpmovieplayercontroller s view is not the same aspect ratio height to width as the movie

23596074

inherited	properties
the way that i understood wpf renders data grid columns when autogeneratecolumns is set as true is if the structure is being generated against classa which inherited from classb the order of generation is classa and then classb with the order of declaration of the the properties in classa and classb containing the data

23596589

since i set the height of the child div to 90 in order to compensate for the total of 10 vertical margin i expected the div to vertically centered within its parent div

23596609
margin	height
tried using padding instead of margin with the same height - no changes

23598000
int	chars
have the int to be the array key and the chars to be the value

23598015
for-loop	arrays
the problem is that the draw function goes through your for-loop and then uses the end result for the value of color which is the last value in your arrays as the color that it passes into your function

23598015
for-loop	loops
in other words your gui is basically frozen or locked while the for-loop runs so the intermediate values even though they are considered inside loops don t have any affect on whatever is being drawn on the screen

23598030
spaces	delimiter
it s because you are using an spaces as delimiter but your csv file is using commas as delimiter

error-handling	exception-handling
and there are different levels of care for error-handling whether with or without using exception-handling

23599368
error-handling	exception-handling
the basic assumption with exception-handling is that you as a programmer intend to write robust error-handling code and if you do handle all errors appropriately then the overhead of exception-handling will pale in comparison to the error-handling code catch-blocks and destructors and you will probably have a smaller and faster program than an equivalent c-style error-code implementation of the same amount of error-handling

23599368
error-handling	exception-handling
i m not exactly sure why llvm banned exception-handling if i had to be blunt i would say it s because they aren t really serious about error-handling as far as i can see from the code i have seen from that project

23599368
std	ostream
and then many of its classes like std ostream or std ofstream have too much run-time overhead both for construction destruction and for read write performance

look at the post i linked to see appropriate ways to get the first three elements of the ip address

23599903
express	node.js
anyway if you use the express engine with node.js it sets up the skeleton for your app using a public folder which holds only the static content that users will be able to access and when i say static content i mean .html .css .js files etc. if there s something you don t want to show the user unless they have authorization to see it you can serve that resource up from another location and simply render it and send it off to the client side

23599903
express	node.js
using jade with node.js express is a great example of this

width	height
for example if your scroll view spans the entire screen you could give your content view a width of device width and a height of 600

23601036
getter	setter
i m aware that you could create a getter and setter function instead or use one object to reference another object but what i d really like is some kind of workaround that allowed me to define a variable as a reference to the property of another object and so far it seems this just can t be done

23601055
children	parent
it selects elements that are a direct child of the parent the .checkbox elements are not direct children they are descendants of #check_section here on so they are but in your fiddle they are not

packets	pcap
the pcap driver stores packets for you in a queue so you will not miss them if they arrive while you process previous packets depending of course on the size of the buffer you stated when you created the sniffer

23604332
packets	pcap
be that as it may you should probably create the thread in your got_packet function which will be called by the pcap driver every time a packets is sniffed and give it the address of a different processing function like so

put	get
jtable get selected row value i want to make it so when u click on a row it will get the row number and put it into a variable

23607197
setinterval	settimeout
you can think of raf as a settimeout that will trigger once the next time screen is available not a setinterval that will call again and again each time

23607231
for-loop	loops
the biggest differences are that a foreach loops processes an instance of each element in a collection in turn while a for-loop can work with any data and is not restricted to collection elements alone

23607231
for-loop	loops
this means that a for-loop can modify a collection - which is illegal and will cause an error in a foreach loops

23607252
maven	pom.xml
the problem is that because the maven release updates the pom.xml to bump the version to the next snapshot release the first step of the chain is triggered again

23607322

23607434
google-chrome	firefox
i don t understand this as i am testing on google-chrome and firefox

23607438
width	height
if i had the actual size of image i can do this but it seems that i can not bind to actual height and actual width of image in viewmodel

23607470
width	height
you have to define the width height of the small div.the property max-height just sets a limit to the height not defines it

23607581
children	parent
the trick was go back and select the parent element with repeated siblings in this case .container and then select its children

23607603
width	height
of course you can force your images to fit a specific width and height as proposed by rockstar using css however that will result in ugly disproportionate images

23607632

oncreate and ondestroy - bracket the entire life of the app

23607804
oncreate	ondestroy
when it is first loaded the oncreate is triggered and when the app is disposed of ondestroy is triggered

23607804
oncreate	ondestroy
the system can stop the app without calling the ondestroy and can restart the app triggering an oncreate event

23607804
onresume	onpause
onresume and onpause - bracket the period that the app is in the foreground and interacting with the user

datediff	difference
the mysql datediff function only takes two 2 arguments and always returns the difference in days

23608640
put	get
even if you get that right the fact that you have put a fork call in a handler for an asynchronous signal sigchld will likely open another can of worms if your main process uses multiple threads

23608640
children	parent
if you want to treat sigkill specially then you can use a protocol on the pipe whereby the parent process sends a termination message advising the children of its termination status on all normal terminations and on catchable fatal signals and leaves the children to infer that the parent was killed by sigkill in the event that the read-side of the pipe delivers an eof without a preceding termination message

post	get
the root cause of the problem was retrieving data based on an access control list not part of the code here which varied based on request type get post etc

23611737
post	get
when calculating this was a post request with one set of access and when reading it was a get request with a different set of access and was returning a different and invalid set of results

23612112
getter	setter
the property declaration is an atomic thing containing a getter and a setter

23612112
getter	setter
if you would allow this then apparently the getter and setter are seen as different things

23612123
hide	show
then build a convenience method to show hide it with animation.

23612128
multiplying	subtract	multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	subtraction	subtraction	multiplication

atexit	main
however after main ends i get an exception telling me a mutex was destroyed while busy thrown from dynamic atexit destructor for mutex

23612201
versioning	upgrade
this is what angular-strap originally did but the recent versioning upgrade to 2.0 completely removed those dependencies and does it all in angular and it is a much better product for having done so. this is the same method that angular-ui took from day 1 and that continues today

23612236
post	get
you have set it up like it should be using get but when you want to post it is a bit different

23612356
width	height
the table is in the background in #eee and is the proper height width it fits to .container but the cells overflow the table height when the image is larger than its parent cell and setting max-height and max-width for the image has no effect - it just sizes to its original size

out of debug mode the program ran too fast and those width and height variable didn t have their values updated

23612549
jobs	cron
cron jobs run independently of each other

23612549
jobs	cron
if you want two tasks to be executed either sequentially or simultaneously put them in the same cron job - there is no reason to create two cron jobs in this case

23612737
centos	linux
i struggled with this turned out we had forgotten to intall gd on our linux centos server

23612746
ceil	floor
the small detail here that you round down the minimum if you do any rounding and round up the maximum ditto given floor and ceil functions could add a smidgen of space that suits graphical purposes

23612747
width	height
if i inflate this item and show it in my listview the imageview does not fill the parent i.e it just stretch till the width but it won t expand till the view height

23612773
google-chrome	firefox
here is the code it works in firefox and google-chrome

23612781

whenever you need to map a set of chars to their int index in an ordered set you can simply subtract the index of the first value in the set in this case 1 and thus avoid any library functions

23612896
argv	chdir
i checked the line of the code that is chdir dirname _server argv 0

23612903

you could add a custom attribute with the index of the image and then when you need to check which image it is get the value of that attribute and then subtract the count on the correct index in the array

23613332
ng-view	ng-include
so i need to load the main app via ng-view and submenu for this app via ng-include in the header

23613332
ng-view	ng-include	ng-view	ng-controller	ng-include	ng-controller

23613379
post	get
the root cause of the problem was retrieving data based on an access control list which varied based on request type get post etc

23613379
post	get
when calculating this was a post request with one set of access and when reading it was a get request with a different set of access

23613401
post	get
you are using the same id to get post and authors

23613405
margin	height
images typically will display as inline-block by default which adds line-height into the mix of an elements padding margin height

23613443
build.gradle	gradlew
considering that supporting library projects via ant or gradlew involves one line in a configuration file project.properties or build.gradle one would think that this would not be a major challenge

23613468
multiplying	division	multiplying	add
to add more precision to floating point numbers i have to go through a bunch of c# classes and wherever there is a division operation multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 1000

23613487
invokerequired	begininvoke
how you do that depends on the technology wfp dispatcher winforms invokerequired begininvoke

23613520
post	get
using live http headers in opera i can see that submitting the form is causing a get rather than a post even though my javascript is attempting to post

23613523
vsto	netoffice
note i am using netoffice as a wrapper for the office automation to bypass version issues but that shouldn t matter in this particular case because it maps directly to the vsto

23613554
hide	show
if tabs-1 is selected then hide tabs-2 and tabs-3 will be hidden and tabs-1 will be show but if i trigger and after that it will not react if i for example click on tabs-2 because tabs-1 is still opened #tabs-1 .is visible it is caught in this block

23613562

i searched on the internet but i couldn t really find something useful and simple like loadstringfromfile int idfromresource chars buffer

23613718
width	height
you will not be able to specify exactly on 5.99 vs 6.0 in screens since different devices will have different width height and pixel densities

23613785
width	height
css scaling creates artifact deal only with canvas width and height unless

23613785
width	height
- in your case your setup code would be with no css width height set

23613866
min	max	range	min	range	max
the only fix i can find is to directly change heatmap.2 itself to accept additional arguments as this seems to be hardcoded in my case i want to add a min and max range for the color key

23613937
put	get
however when i try to do a put request i get the following

23613939
children	parent
i have a pure css drop down menu that is working great but i want to have a drop down arrow on the parent menu items that have children to show the user the menu has choices options

23613939
next	except
this puts a drop down arrow next to every menu item except the ones with children

23613956
spaces	delimiter
this will work for all the lines in your example data with fields delimiter by a single spaces with the exception of matching double quotes in the third field

in this case use tolower or toupper

23613972

it either returns a positive int found or boolean false not found

23614063
getter	setter
head is an instance of a class that has setter and getter for it s properties see example code

23614107
put	get	post	get	post	put
and for those requests which methods get post put etc. can be executed

23614107
post	get
according to w3c options call is not required if you are implementing only simple methods get post head

23614107
post	get
so where you set your access-control-allow-methods if it is try changing it to get post and based on the standard if the browser follows your browser doesn t need to fire the options call

23614128
hide	show
try putting that arrow on every single item and then using the selector you created to hide it on those items it shouldn t show

23614138
put	get
i ve added getbar and when i put in the url into either my browser or fiddler i get a 404

23614192
hash	md5
and i use a md5 hash on the byte array of the bitmap to find changes.

23614192
hash	md5
it seems like compression or whatever is not exactly the same so the md5 hash check fails.

23614274
pull	push
you can however branch off of your master branch and push pull this branch so you don t end up stepping on any toes

23614290
width	height
so i have the coordinates of each line height and width of the corresponding symbol

23614360
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari
the site works perfect in google-chrome firefox ie10 and 11 several linux browsers opera safari from macs pcs and linux boxes

23614385
for-loop	arrays
in to a for-loop that counts through all the indexes and uses objectatindex to fetch each object change it and save it back to the arrays

23614386
folder	directory
these dll files are in your installed qt directory in bin folder

23614400
folder	directory
under configuration properties - linker - general add the folder lib release from where you extracted libcurl libcurl-7.19.3-win32-ssl-msvc lib release in the additional library directory list

23614460
for-loop	loops
the most substantive difference between the for-loop and the foreach method is that with the former you may break out of loops

23614511
post	get
i am able to get the particular values to display in my page which is a razor but upon post

23614526
post	get
then i took your json string as we didn t really get to see the xml source when i wrote this post and converted it to php arrays

23614534
portrait	landscape
one was limited to landscape only what i wanted and the other contained both landscape and portrait

23614550
hide	show
i would recommend to use two pictures and show hide the pictures instead of using a background-image for the hover

23614555
rvm	chruby
i am using chruby not rvm

23614557
boost	stl
like the stl boost etc

23614598
i2c	spi
most of the cortex m3 m4s that i m aware of offer usarts i2c and spi with multiple also offering sdio which should cover most needs

23614616
button	checkbox
to do that i need a combination of checkbox to define which elements to include and then radio button nested under each check box to define what version should be used for the selected element

23614677
textview	imageview
they are on different linearlayouts because the way i populate the screen is by doing a for-loop to get the imageview and textview in place

23614694
width	height
it should give me file names of images width height and the total pixel count

23614715
filepath	unc	folder	dir
a symbol server served via http has the same structure as a symbol server served via a unc filepath so the simplest thing to do would be to use symstore.exe to store the files in a folder somewhere and then use a simple http server which exposes that folder via http even running python -m simplehttpserver in the symbols dir would work

23614749
folder	directory
the script being called is moving files from d data report to another folder in the d directory

23614845
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome this returns auto as the value for top but in firefox this returns the pixel value however if you look at the inspector in firefox the top value doesn t show up in the computed pane

23614897
disk	ram
there always was and always will be something like big data that big that it does not fit into ram and it does not fit on disk and it can t be computed on 1 computer in finite time

23614921
int	double
the following code is slower when a is declared as a double as opposed to an int

23614988
put	get
if you use a scriptprocessor to cut out the empty places you have to either put something there or just remove the silence but then the retuned sample is to short and you stil get gaps

23614990
free	malloc
if you have to deal with malloc free pointer in some part of your code and you can not modify malloc parts then try not to mix that part with your new delete part

23615031
google-chrome	firefox
the following seems to work in firefox google-chrome but not in internet explorer 11 - where it does not want to display the facebook share button.

23615058
int	chars
additionally if you are looking for the hex value of a chars or an int is also important as they are not the same

23615094
google-chrome	firefox
though we can see this page on firefox and google-chrome

23615112
min	max
in other words i need to calculate min s and max s for each block of id and then rescale each row by taking its value subtract from the min group value and divide by min-max

23615112
min	max
i found a way to get min s and max s from this dataframe but is too cheesy

23615169
setinterval	settimeout
first of all i think you want to be using setinterval instead of settimeout

23615214
width	margin
if your width is 100 of it s container margin 0 auto

23615235
getter	setter
it not only allows the elimination of excessive setter and getter but you can also create arraylistâ s or any other collection to hold each field dynamically

23615269
int	chars
passing an int to convert to a byte object will create a bytes type with a sequence of nul chars aka x00 with the length of the int passed

23615288
rally	lookbackapi
rally lookbackapi will give you historic data

23615309
hive	oozie
i am trying to use hive with oozie using hive action

23615309
hive	oozie
the oozie workflow is supposed to load data from one hive table to another

23615327
getter	setter
getter and setter should be only for properties declared in the class

23615339
mouse	keyboard	inherited	subclassing
a solution will be to create an item abstract serialize d class that all the relevant subclassing must inherited keyboard mouse motherboard etc. and a list of these items

23615354

how to allow both landscape portrait for tablets only

23615382
portrait	landscape
portrait for phone landscape for tablet android-layout

23615405
getter	setter
i donâ t have magic getter and setter so the view script includes get method statements like that refer to functions in the entities

23615438
min	max
show min max and average weight of dogs

23615445
migrate	upgrade
you have created the original amazon ec2 instance with a 32-bit image - these are only available for the few instance types you mentioned and can not be upgrade to 64-bit instance types i m afraid you need to reinstall on a 64-bit instance type and migrate your data across

23615501
libxml2	libxslt
brew install libxml2 libxslt libiconv

23615522
portrait	landscape
i have a script in my functions that adds a class to the featured image based on whether it is landscape or portrait

23615522

it works by measuring the height against the width of given post thumbnail and appending the class from attachment- into horizontal-image attatchment-

23615523
.when	each
i m using android studio with multiple flavors using gradle each with a debug and release type organized as described here on the bottom half .when i try to start the debugger i get this error

23615566
onresume	onpause
if the hardware back key is pressed onpause is fired for activity b and onresume is fired for activity a

23615566
oncreate	ondestroy
however if the back button on the actionbar is pressed ondestroy is fired for activity a followed by oncreate and onresume

23615585
inherited	subclassing
a bit late in the game but i think a more elegant way would be creating a subclassing that inherited from the class mysimpleclass and implement its constructor to suit your needs

23615590
int	double
in the case where a is a double however t2 must be converted to a double int + double gives double before the addition

23615590
int	double
this means that the type of the addition in operation 5 is also different it can be an int or a double addition

23615590
int	double
ignoring the obvious aspect that a double will usually be twice as large as an int this means that the computer needs to do something different at this point

23615593
for-loop	arrays
your problem is with you are running a for statement and adding a string arrays from the split of the first strarrays15 arrays to the combobox items each time the for-loop runs

23615603
mpfr	mpir
both have an integer class and they are similarly named mpir has mpz_t mpfr has mpfr_t

23615634
google-chrome	firefox
you can do this in both google-chrome and firefox

23615643
getter	setter
also the name variable in the pet class can be set to be protected if you want the child classes to use it without the getter setter methods

23615651
onresume	onpause
activities and or fragments register for those events when they are in the foreground onresume and unregister for those events when they are not onpause

23615651
onresume	onpause
if you decide that you do indeed want to force the user to have to deal with your notification even though your ui is in foreground and you just want a differently-configured notification you will need to track for yourself which activity is in the foreground again via onresume and onpause

23615734
hide	show
i need to show hide more than 100 options in single select dropdown list

23615761

width	height
use this code to set image-view width and height same as screen parameter

23615815
swrl	owl
this applies whether the inference is based on owl axioms or swrl rules

23615832
hide	show
or you could just hide all of the tables and then just show the one you need

23615833
min	max
to shown min max and average weight for dog you ll need to iterate as well over your list and keep a count of all those

23615836
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven you should have an entry like this in your pom.xml

23615853
post	get
i changed the post code to submit a request to app app_link_hosts with my link in order to associate it and i get back this error response

23615853

spring mvc can use a variety of view technologies such as freemarker velocity thymeleaf and plain old jsps

23615864
cobertura	sonar-runner
i was using sonar 4.2 and sonar-runner 2.3 and cobertura plugin

23615892
pull	push
the push model works well for non-blocking channels and pull model works well for blocking streams

23615942
width	height
with the transform you also have to keep the li fixed width and height so that the other buttons aren t affected

23615943
width	height
it ignores layout width and height

23615943
width	height
now it looks acceptable - width and height just as the supposed to be

23635975
width	height
the dimensions of your view are wrong you don t want to draw the image in the width and height divided by 2

23635975
width	height
so if you had a width and height of like 10 then your new width at a 45 degree angle would be between 14 and 15.

i used it because the spaces delimiter is easy to work with but you may consider sending the integer values themselves and using a fixed-width parsing on the reader side

23636401
hide	show
but that requires you to understand what classes are being applied during a show hide process

23636441

i am using slidetoggle to show hide a submenu but whenever i toggle the submenu a bit of extra space is added to the bottom of the containing element

23637381
for-loop	loops
as a studied we don t have control over the do-while loops when it executes for the first time and everything which can be done with do-while loops can be don with while or for-loop assuming

23637392
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
apart from the above the usage of maven-surefire-plugin for integration tests is simply wrong cause maven-surefire-plugin is intended for unit tests and not for integration tests so better is to go with maven-failsafe-plugin for integration tests

23637454
for-loop	loops
however if you need to use for-loop or you have too much data to store them in a list you may create an empty vector before loops and then use in loops

23637474
for-loop	loops
might as well say i didn t find any practical use of for loop...everything which can be done with for-loop can be don with while loops assuming

23637476
getter	setter
getter and setter are used to help encapsulate your class in case the act of changing a variable has side effects that could mess up the class s inner workings

23637476
getter	setter
in the case of a boolean that is intended to be changed by outside classes and has no side-effects from changing the boolean as in your example above i wouldn t bother with a getter and setter

23637586
button	checkbox
i know this might seem primitive but i ve been trying to implement it for a whole day maybe because i can t fully comprehend how to use the api i m using datatables 1.10.0 i have a table with pagination feature each row has one checkbox in it i need to have a check all button that would check all the checkbox in all pages the problem is that it only checks the checkbox in the current page and leaves the other pages unchecked this is supposed to be easy but i couldn t figure it out

23637588
button	checkbox
the idea is that when a checkbox is checked an item is chosen and then when a total button is pressed the sum of the checked items is printed

23637598
move	drag
i developed a scrolling script so when the user drag the parent object i move it and it looks like scrolling

23637735
google-chrome	firefox
but the issue doesn t occur in non ie browsers like google-chrome firefox

23637740
udp	rtp
to identify rtp traffic you d either have to know what udp ports would be used by the traffic and filter based on that or you d have to look at a few fields in the udp payload and try to guess whether it s rtp traffic and be willing to live with non -rtp packets passing the filter

23637740
udp	rtp
wireshark has a fairly weak heuristic to identify rtp running atop udp

23637740
packets	pcap	sip	sdp
as for h.264 wireshark recognizes that based on the sip sdp setup traffic which means it involves more complicated packets parsing than can be done with a pcap filter and more importantly involves keeping state information which is impossible with pcap filters

23637786
put	get
i put a code example to get an idea of the type of code to which i refer

23640973
min	max
to do the max replace min with max with and 999999999999 with 0

however when looking at debug view panel i m not able to look at any datatype not only qt but also int double etc the whole panel is blank

23640997
multiton	singleton

23641008

the best design pattern is to have a a second daemon process or cron job that handles message delivery

23641008
daemon	cron

23641026

23641188
post	get
when there s two matching actions overloads where one is a get version and the other is a post the url should be the same and so the get or really first version is returned

23641188
post	get
mvc5 introduced attribute routing as a first-class citizen but from what i ve seen this edge case where the get and post versions of the same action have different urls and you want the post version in particular has not been covered

23641188

if your post action is named something like createeditpost then you can very easily do url.action createeditpost and get the right url

i have tinymce inserting post into a database where they ll be subsequently pulled and put into a webpage

23641257

what is apparent and perhaps troubling is that the rsa crypto provider uses triple des in cbc mode for the symmetric crypto algorithm underlying the rsa pkc which you think is really providing the encryption

23641309
tripledes	aes
see this person s frustration around trying to change the symmetric algorithm to aes for example change microsoft config file encryption method from tripledes

however if the two buttons are radically differents and provide a different design i mean more than just changing the background use setvisibility might be a better way rather than change width height margin padding etc

width	margin
the parent wrapper element is fixed with a width of 100 and the child .footer element has the margin

23641653
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
as others have mentioned use box-sizing border-box in order to include the border in the element s width calculations

23641653
width	margin
the element therefore has a width of 100 of the window thus explaining why the margin wasn t behaving as expected

23641653
width	margin
usage of calc allows you to subtract the margin from the width

23642198
subtract	add
as far as the unpacking goes maybe you could let the function take an argument for whether to add or subtract and then apply it twice

23642204
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you want to use objectcontext instead of dbcontext you need to get t4 templates that generate objectcontext based context

23642210
folder	directory
i d opt for a libraries or third-party folder outside your project directory preferably version controlled

23642211
trie	tree
trie radix tree

23642252
inject	interceptor
this means the transaction interceptor will not intercept such invocation therefore you have the possibility to inject the service to a field hold by itself and invoke it on the inject service instead of this forcing the invocation to that method be intercepted by the transaction interceptor please try the following implementation

23642278
post	get
and if i type to all fields i get post

23642506
maven	pom.xml
when i build my application i fetch the tomcat-websocket-api jar file by using the following maven dependency in pom.xml

23642506
jar	war
i found that if i remove the dependency on tomcat-websocket-api as shown above from the pom.xml file and instead i manually copy the jar file tomcat-websocket-api-7.0.53.jar from the tomcat installation and build my war against that jar file then i can connect to the websocket without a problem

23642510

i m writing an application where i use express node.js and mongodb using mongojs

23642541
rss	feed
simplepie for the rss feed

23642565
screens	tablet
my app only support small screens and normal screens and don t support tablet

23642606
screens	mdpi
display resolution 1024x600 and screens density mdpi are related but independent concepts

23642606
screens	tablet
grossly oversimplifying you generally provide different resources for different screens sizes when you want them to be different in phones and tablet for layouts and different resources for different densities so that the system doesn t need to scale them which could cause artifacts for images

23642613
gmail	hotmail
i m begginer in this and i found with this problem...i wan to send email from my localhost to a gmail account this last can change for a hotmail but first i want to prove for a gmail account

23642855
awt	swing
also take a look at painting in awt and swing for details about how painting works

23642861
hash	salt
moreover i understand that migrations are really meant to manage changes to table schema--like the addition of an attribute or field for records in the table...or to manage changes to the type of data itself like upgrading plaintext passwords to hash salt passwords

23642894
maven	pom.xml
i have attached relevant files here i am a complete maven novice so i have included the directory layout in list the pom.xml and the output of mvn clean install both standard and extended with -e for stack trace

23642899
width	height
note by the way that you can still call resize width height on a swingnode even if it overrides isresizable to false

23642903
width	text-align
this is the basic layout text-align right would work if i could somehow force the wrapper div to constrain to the image width but currently it breaks past this

23642908
range	median
i am basically wondering how i can store the users inputs and put them in order from least to greatest to help them find median mode or range

button	checkbox
if a radio button is ticked with the value of yes a set of checkbox will pop

23643029
punctuation	words
split then store words on spaces and punctuation

23643031
folder	directory
you re not dealing with folder you just recursively copying files into the target directory

23643040
mouseup	mousedown
my first guess would be to use an atom and two new channels for mousedown and mouseup

23643141
width	margin	width	text-align	margin	text-align
sometimes text-align center won t work you can use margin auto if it has a width

23643170
for-loop	loops
this loops at the second for-loop rather than finishing

23643206
src	attr
using attr you could also give the image in each div a src only on click saving the load bandwidth as well

23643233
chunked	transfer-encoding
on the first hit from a client rather than responding to the client with those headers varnish is dropping the content-length header and adding transfer-encoding chunked to the response

i am wondering why brisk detector detects much less keypoint than the orb detector

23657711
orb	keypoint
i can indeed detect a little more keypoint but the difference with the orb detector is still really important

23657711
orb	keypoint
brisk seems not to compute all the detected keypoint in descriptors 752 keypoint detected by orb detector 708 descriptors computed by brisk descriptor

postfix	dovecot
im still a noobie when it comes to webservers using dovecot and postfix i have created a webserver before to control the mail but just set up a email alias etc

23657782
postfix	dovecot
so is it possible for instance that when a user register s through the website and gives the alias wanted that some sort of php script will import those details from the form or site maybe into a sql table that then the server can pick up if the table has been updated and then will use that info to automatically create the pods for dovecot and postfix

23658087
for-loop	arrays
i know that you can for-loop an arrays but i m unsure if it can be an arrays of objects rather than values in less

23658142
imperative	declarative
because sql is a declarative language rather than an imperative or procedural one you cannot know how many times a function invoked by a sql statement will run â even if the function is written in pl sql an imperative language

23658160
button	checkbox
i have implemented many web pages which accepts user inputs text input checkbox drag and drop etc the user need to click some save button to save all these changes

23658812
hide	show
then show hide the views as needed based on the data

23658814
isotope	masonry

23658830
post	get
when i attempt to post to sessions i get the following error

23659801
svg	vml
i don t see where you have attempted to add an image but this would be possible only inside a series tooltip because this is the only place in the chart that renders html the rest is svg vml

23659815
width	height
first determine the if the image is vertical or horizontal then simply grab the picturebox height or width respectively and determine the width or height respectively of the original image s aspect ratio given that value

23659842
punctuation	words
the only thing that changes is how we parse whether or not the words has a white space character punctuation or letter after it not any other character like or anything like that

23659860
portrait	landscape
it d be great if we could optimize the image areas to fit either portrait or landscape images of a fixed ratio and tell the client to only use photos that fit

23659860
portrait	landscape
however i ve not been able to find a perfect solution for both landscape and portrait

23659860
portrait	landscape
when i get portrait nice and centered landscape doesn t look right and visa versa

23659861
google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome firefox but on ie there appears scroll

23660072
typedef	struct
more important though is to understand the syntax of 3 things 1 struct definition 2 struct declaration and 3 typedef

23660072
typedef	struct
here is an example that first defines the struct and then typedef the struct

23660072
typedef	struct
note also the typedef can be combined with the struct definition and this is what you are doing in your code

23660072
typedef	struct
note well in the syntax above since you have started with typedef then the whole statement is a typedef statement in which the oldtypename happens to be a struct definition

23660072
typedef	struct
it is not the variable name as it would be in the syntax without typedef in which case you would be defining the struct and declaring a struct variable at the same time

23660072
typedef	struct
or you can use an unnamed struct type in a typedef

23660094
int	chars
i understand the difference between a chars logical and complex data classes but i m struggling to find the fundamental difference between a numeric class and an int class

put	get
i am using the oracle jersey client and am trying to cancel a long running get or put operation

23660395

notice that if you add or subtract 1 from a regular date then business days are not taken into account

23660496
width	margin
you just need to remove the offset classes because an offset is done by increasing the margin which in return increases the element s width and renders the total width of both the sidebar and the dashboard bigger than the total width and thus being pushed down

23660507
rss	feed
i am on a php news crawler project and want to pull rss news feed from nearly a hundred of news websites using wget version 1.12 to capture whole rss feed files all in one directory without hierarchy in local server regarding

i have a couple of div elements with different ids that i have been trying to show hide through a function passed into javascripts onclick method

entity-relationship	diagram
further steps involve translating entity-relationship to relational diagram and basically implement it as a database for a database application in which user can search and browse stuff through an interface

23660839
entity-relationship	diagram
here s the entity-relationship diagram i came up with

23660874
ienumerable	ilist
since you don t actually need your traces variable to be an ilist here you should type it as an ienumerable to avoid the needless overhead of populating the results of your query into a list just so that you can iterate over that list and populate a new list

23660887

a java abstract class can have different types of data members to define the access of it such as protected private public

23660949
int	double
there are multiple classes that are grouped together as numeric classes the 2 most common of which are double for double precision floating point numbers and int

23660949
int	double
r will automatically convert between the numeric classes when needed so for the most part it does not matter to the casual user whether the number 3 is currently stored as an int or as a double

23660949
int	double
sometimes you may want to specifically store a vector as int if you know that they will never be converted to double used as id values or indexing since int require less storage space

23660950
integer	unsigned
there is also another aspect the default type for numeric constants is a signed integer i would like to go for an unsigned integer type of arbitrary size

23660975
put	get
in future you are unlikely to get help unless you put in the effort to create a sample dataset

getter	setter
as a getter it goes straight to the underlying options object but as a setter calls the widget._setoptions function

23661028
width	height
the problem is when i create a new module the width and height mixins are repeated

23661100
libreoffice	uno
uno python bindings allows to run python scripts inside openoffice libreoffice like basic macroses

23661114
width	height
i m using ckeditor 4.4 and i tried to use acf to force the image2 plugin to set width and height as css properties in the style attribute instead to use the corresponding tag attributes

23661114
width	height
with this the result is simply that width and height are no more set neither as attributes nor in the style the image cannot be resized and the image properties dialog no longer include the input boxes related to image size

23661122
width	margin
it s reducing the width of the header and making it align to the center using margin auto

23661123
put	get
if you use asynchronous code in a function for example with settimeout then the asynchronous code will be put on hold until the rest of the code has executed and the browser get the control back as javascript is single threaded

23661127
postgresql	mysql
the setup for postgresql and mysql are very similar

23661141
int	chars
this converts the string to a chars array converts them all to int returning an in the process and then returns the sum of them all

23661196
inherited	properties
6. be aware that all web.config properties from folders above application 1 or 2 are inherited

23661310
hash	salt
you should salt your password and then hash it

23661310
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
passwords that use md5 or sha1 are no longer secure - you should generate a unique salt for each password and use bcrypt to create a strong hash

23661335
put	get
what s going to happen when you pack is you re going to get something that looks like and now you want to put another h into the head of the first sublist

23661339
move	drag
to make this work well the icon must be undraggable if you click the mouse on the icon and then move away you want this to mean i didn t mean to click rather than i want to drag the icon

23661347
gtk	cairo
i am used to using cairo with gtk and c but am finiding myself confused

23661415
justmock	typemock	moq	typemock	moq	justmock
moq works fine but other frameworks like typemock or justmock windows install programs will not work

23661496
int	double
so for example __tg_promote2 0.0f 0 would be double since adding a float and a double result of promoting int gives a double

23661496
int	double
this is where __tg_promote2 comes in to determine that when we have one float argument and one int argument both should be converted to double

23661531
versioning	upgrade
for other reasons we cannot upgrade the server. however by default when i added the ado.net entity data model to my project visual studio added a reference to ef versioning 5

23661542
ember.js	backbone.js
you can use any client side framework of your choice to interact with your api controllers knockout angular ember.js backbone.js or you can use straight up jquery

23661542
put	get	post	get	post	put
instead of a controller with many different methods index getsingle getmany list dosomethingelse doanotherthing etc. the api controllers usually contain only methods that correspond to the http verbs get post put and delete

23661562
folder	directory
so i deleted it and created a sym link of the classes folder in the home directory of the project to the android.proj folder

23661625
getter	setter
i work on a java project that requires me to access all private object fields through getter and setter methods from the same class

23661640
hide	show
one by hard coding the css to hide the second column as show here and in this code

23661640
hide	show
another way is to add some code to hide the columns in the placeholder that are hidden in the real table as show here and in this code

23661655
folder	directory
i ve installed node into a custom directory in my home folder called local per these instructions

23661727
mousemove	mouseout	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove
as a result elements that rely only on mousemove mouseover mouseout

23661763
int	boolean
the set is defined as a function from int to boolean summing two sets won t return a set object the union means that one element should be either in one or in the other set but always expressed as a function

23661769
hide	show
each of the 4 top level components hide show themselves based upon the application state

23661774
getter	setter
there does not appear to be anything to color getter and setter differently

23661782
google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome but not on firefox

23661782
hide	show
firefox hide the menu but it fail to play the animation and show the menu back

23661802
stdout	stderr
you just have to move the function with stdout and stderr as an argument to the .on error event like this

23661886
hide	show
this function successfully hide show each object manually

23661886
hide	show
however i want to set this to an onchange function to show the black one and hide the white one and vice versa with the click of a button

23661993
tinyint	varchar
the types of the fields vary from tinyint 1 varchar 256 varchar 512 varchar 1024 and varchar 10000 so something like db

23662015
width	height
as far as i know calling measure 0 0 on a textview causes the view to set its measured width and height to a minimum required by current font text size

23662023
int	boolean
if you add something that acts as a boolean value say int isvalid you will be able to clear that variable make it 0 for the next time you run through the loop

23662082
google-chrome	firefox
the solution i adopted is that i m using firefox for developement and i validate everything is fine only after gwt compiling on google-chrome once in a while for the pauses

23662082
google-chrome	firefox
in addition it runs curiously faster on firefox than on google-chrome under windows

23662090
portrait	landscape
the example is working fine in portrait orientation while in landscape the uilabel grows too much in height

23662118
plot	errorbar
i have a matrix m of data and a matrix e of errors that i want to plot with errorbar against an independent variable x

23662123
addclass	removeclass
delegate the events and then use an addclass vs removeclass function

23662123
width	height
also should set the width and height of the overlay and then have a class to display as block

23662149
children	parent
i guess we can assume the target node had n-1 children before the drop since jstree doesn t allow dropping a node into its parent

23662172
oncreate	onstart
however onrestoreinstancestate was called only when oncreate and onstart were also called

23662172
oncreate	onstart
and oncreate and onstart were not always called

23665810
post	get
to get the count of the answer -type post by a specific user related to a question related to each tag we first need to join to the question to get the tags and then join to the related answer

23665810
post	get
this is nearly identical to the first query except that we add another join to post table to get the child answer -type post so we can get a count of the answer -type post and we are not restricting the question -type post to those from the specific user.

23666565
int	double
as far as i m aware so long as the spacing between two double is less than 2 then int values stored as double should be exact - and though 10 14 is pushing it this should be an exact int since 10 14 2 46.507 2 53

it sounds like what you want is to segment the 10k data points into 1k buckets -- the value of each one of these buckets may be any statistic computation that makes sense for your data sorry without actual context it s hard to say for example if you want to spot the trend of the data you might want to use median percentile to summarize the 10 points in each bucket

23666731

23666962
width	height
by setting a viewbox you let the browser know that you want the image to be contained within a certain bounding box and then when you then adjust the width or height it will be re-scaled accordingly

23666962
width	height
the viewbox attribute takes four space-separated values x y w h where x is the x-coordinate of the left side of the bounding box y is the y-coordinate of the top of the bounding box and w and h are the width and height of the bounding box

23666989
min	max	range	min	range	max
i wanted to set the x axis range at 50 centered at a particular value spotvalue and i wanted to set the y axis range to be between the min and the max of the data the lineseries is displaying

23666991
mouse	keyboard
after a while i am getting no such device error and camera and all usb devices such as mouse and keyboard are frozing

23667047
google-chrome	safari
i have a static text file on a server that contains backspace characters ascii code 08 and when i navigate the file s url in google-chrome or safari the browser downloads the file to a folder instead of viewing the file s text in the browser window

i am thoroughly mystified as to how to get the board -- a height width bytes-per-pixel array of char -- integrated into the scene graph

23667102
google-chrome	safari
its happening for both safari and google-chrome

23667107
min	max
first of all you use a in order to then just use it as key - value but those are really min and max so it s misleading

if you don t have to worry about ie7 or less you can skip adding the .thumbnail altogther by setting the box-sizing property to border-box

23667212
box-sizing	margin	width	margin
box-sizing controls how margin and padding affect the width of an element

23667212
width	margin
the default is content-box which works the way you are used to an element has a width lets say 100px and margin and padding extend off of that

23667212
width	margin	width	border-box	margin	border-box
when setting the property to border-box the width includes margin and padding

division	multiplication
native avr arduino does not have multiplication or division functions much less native floating point handling

23667472
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	division	multiplying	add	division	subtract
division is much harder to calculate with subtractions can t go too far find remainder - if a float then calculate fraction from remainder which in itself is oodles of add multiplying and subtract

23667472
integer	fractions	division	multiplication
somehow the float library is more efficient in multiplication with all the fractions overhead than integer division

23667522
int	chars
is a string i.e a null-terminated chars array casting it to int doesn t give the result you expected

23667532

if you want to count the distinct values try doing a union all first

23667743
getter	setter
you could either take advantage of the color property support of the component or supply your own color property which could set and retrieved through the use of setter and getter

23667743
inherited	properties
each class is going to need it s own color properties which independent of the other otherwise the inherited is going to get in the way and the parent will want to use the value of the child

23667746
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
bit shifts should be faster than a multiplying or divide instruction - especially if as ekriirke has already said that native avr arduino does not have multiplication or division functions

23667760
versioning	upgrade
lets say in case 1 you upgrade to db versioning 2

23667772

23668035
mouse	trackpad
in this example the value of deltay will be positive when the user rolls the mouse wheel away from them or the trackpad equivalent and negative otherwise regardless of the system-wide natural scroll setting

23668043
for-loop	loops
i need to have a for-loop in a 2d list except i would like loops to keep going until the end of the file when the length is unknown

23668054
for-loop	arrays
now to save to the second table you will either do put s within the for-loop or aggregate the results into a list arrays or similar for a bulk put

23668074
put	get
you also need to put those variables inside .click handler in order to get the updated value of these textboxes currently you only retrieve the value on page load which is always equal to 0

23668077
post	get
it happens because that s how the http protocol divides the elements of a get or post transaction

public	protected	getter	setter
or protected properties with a public interface that supplies getter setter

23668477
inherited	subclassing
edit because of how multiple inherited is structured each subclassing will implement the method from the first class it inherited from

23668481
google-chrome	firefox
if the loop is very tight time-budget-wise there will simply not be any room for the browser to do other tasks such as gc - for google-chrome this task seem to be secondary versus firefox which gives this higher priority likely to get more performance out of its engine

23668512
int	chars
when i try to execute this stored procedure im getting this error database connector error implicit conversion from datatype chars to int is not allowed

one option is to create an abstract parent servlet class that you can extend then expose the logic for handling exceptional behavior in a protected method or variables which you can access from your public servlets

23669002
versioning	upgrade
this is because when you upgrade the old versioning of firefox or when the firefox browser gets upgrade

23669787
int	chars
is it possible to implement a hash table that uses an int as the key and returns a string array chars as the value this is to retrieve a certain tuple in the database by id

23669811
implements	extends
2 java interface can extends multiple interface also java class can implements multiple interfaces which means interface can provide more polymorphism support than abstract class

23669811
implements	extends
one example i can remember of this is writing gui application in j2me where class extends canvas and implements commandlistener to provide both graphic and event-handling functionality

23669816

the c function validate_passwd_pbkdf2_sha256 in the file you pointed calls hex_to_rawdata salt_str salt sha256_digest_length before it hash the password

23670180
128bit	64bit
i think 128bit stuff on intel is not as fast as the 64bit stuff so i avoid it

23670192
google-chrome	firefox
when you debug a php project xdebug stops the code execution of the current page and eclipse ide by default pops out a perspective with 2 views containing the internal eclipse ide web browser and the a view with the current html output if you don t like the internal web browser you can use any other external web browser you got installed in your computer such as gogle google-chrome chromium firefox etc.

slideup	slidedown
slidedown will transition an invisible div to become visible whereas slideup will transition a visible div to become invsible

23671133
maven	pom.xml
method 2 in the maven pom.xml file

23671140
rtp	sip
it might exchange keys for srtp within the sip messages so rtp will be secured too but srtp itself is not using tls but the symmetric keys exchanged within the sip dialog

23671140
udp	tcp
and dtls is just tls with datagram instead of streaming with tls you use sip over tcp and put a tls layer on top while dtls can be used with udp

23671149
int	boolean
so all we need to do is apply each set to an int to get a boolean and or the result

all i did in the size inspector was change the width height of the image to 1 1 rather than the true size of the image which is 128 128

23671243
apache	nginx
otherwise we recommend using apache nginx to do the redirect

23671278
getelementsbytagname	clonenode
for this you can first clone the div element using the clonenode method and then the getelementsbytagname method to get all input elements inside it

23671285
width	height
pixelwidth and pixelheight are the original width and height of the source image

23671285
width	height
x and y are calculated according the ratio between the original pixel width height and the actual displayed width height of the image on screen

23671389
getter	setter
this is called auto properties and is very usefull to reduce boiler plate code if you have empty getter setter like in your example

23671389
getter	setter
with auto-property you can no longer access the backing-field directly as it only exists after compilation which can cause a very minor performance drawback if the getter setter is not inlined by the jit

stdout	stderr
i have a program that creates a subprocess within a thread so that the thread can be constantly checking for specific output conditions from either stdout or stderr and call the appropriate callbacks while the rest of the program continues

stdout	stderr
it works reasonably well but i would like the thread to exit once two conditions are met the running child process has finished and all of the data in stdout and stderr has been processed

23677526
stdout	stderr
the difficulty i have is that if my last condition is as it is above if not ready and proc.poll is not none then the thread never exits because once stdout and stderr s file descriptors are marked as ready they never become unready even after all of the data has been read from them and read would hang or readline would return an empty string

or is this an issue specific to trying to read from the stderr stdout of a subprocess

your serializable step presently is something you seem to already have defined and you re asking about how to do the deserialization

23682224
serializable	deserialization
there are a few serializable deserialization options available for scala

23682224

23682266
post	get
i ve built a test client page and i m trying to post to a web api that i ve built but i get the following error

23682302
children	parent
there are other options to solve this issue such as navigating up from a leaf child object or down from the parent object but those are far less efficient both in terms of database queries and application processing than being able to query a repository of children by the id of the parent they belong to and their path within the parent s object graph

23682421
getter	setter
you d have to post your class definition for us to be certain what the problem is but i m guessing that you didn t define attribute getter setter for your objects

23682421
getter	setter
to access these variables from outside the scope of the class definition you must define attribute getter and setter with are methods that expose these variables to the outer scope

23682421
getter	setter
this is such a common pattern that ruby has provided helper methods for defining setter and getter for instance variables attr_reader attr_writer and attr_accessor

23682421
getter	setter
attr_accessor generates both setter and getter methods for the instance variables named

23682483

post	get
just because you send a request in json does not necessarily mean you are going to get a reply in json unless the webservice is coded to always return json or if the webservice allows you to specify the desired reply format with a query string parameter in the url itself or in the request s accept header or a parameter in the post data

23683056

23683125
xcodebuild	xcrun
replace the 2nd xcodebuild command with this which utilizes xcrun

23683125
profiling	debugging
for inquiring minds the reason i m not just using xcrun in the first place is because even if i specify a prov profiling and signing identity xcrun will use the embedded profiling and signing identity in the project based on the configuration debugging appstore release etc that i specify

23683152
hide	show
this true false show hide logic worked really well for me but it s mostly useful as a toggle

23683176

firefox safari and ie all seem to behave but i cannot seem to figure out what is or is not happening in google-chrome and opera

23683824
width	height
since you re constraining the label s width the intrinsiccontentsize honors that width and adjusts the height

23683824
width	height
so what happens is that the cell s layout is only calculated once in which 2 is based on the static width in the xib file and this results in the wrong label height

23683827

first you need to hide all the other .slideshow img elements not being show when your page first loads

23684374
post	get
i will delete my previous post on the same matter when i get a solution

23684377
width	height
obviously you can adjust the width and height arguments of position_jitter to your liking although i d recommend since height jittering will make your plot inaccurate

23684443
width	height
once you know what it does the - version is more concise and it visualizes the dataflow graph edges from width and height to the temporary area edges from area and depth to volume

ng-app	ng-controller
i think the issue is that your angular.js gets loaded before it could see any ng-app ng-controller attrs as the html is loaded through jquery

23684537
int	chars

i have re-ordered the classpath enteries in manifest.mf so that it loads first jar where the class and method is available.so this is my conclusion now..order of jars matters in manifest specially when two jars contains same class with same method and same package indeed

inherited	properties
i was thinking of creating base controller class with a applicationdbcontext properties and usermanager properties which follow the pattern demonstrated in the accountcontroller and then inherited the controllers that need these properties from that

23685068
implements	extends
you are extends basicdbobject which is internally implements dbobject so you are fine in that context

23685131
goto	break
somewhere between the i label on line 3 and the goto command you need to add code that will break out of the loopâ likely an if statement with another goto inside it that points to a label after your current goto

23685195
accessor	properties
as a jquery object supports the .length properties and the accessor it could be seen as an array of html elements though it is really not

23685353
sudo	passwd
note you don t need to be root to run this however the script will perform certain tasks using sudo and the root passwd will be requested during the script execution

23685376

without ocra this works fine with my script as i simply have my script search for a certain file folder name that is located in its present working directory and process all the .txt placed within and output its results into another certain file folder

23685428
imageview	picasso
i d just load the image straight into an imageview and use scaletype attribute centercrop in the layout without the intervention of picasso because in low specs devices you could see a little lag between the conversion of scaletype

23685468
put	get
with all of your items set to dockpanel.dock top this would put the items out of order but by grouping the controls with panels and specifying dockpanel.dock bottom for the bottom group you can get the desired result

by definition the matlab for-loop evaluates its argument expressions only once at the beginning of loops to pre-compute a range or arrays of values for loops index variable i to take on inside loops passes

23690537
for-loop	loops
this is also why assigning to loops index variable inside the body of a matlab for-loop has no effect where in c or java it will allow you to jump around and alter the control flow.

23690537
for-loop	loops
beyond convenience i suspect one of the reasons matlab defines its for-loop the way it does instead of providing you the c style syntactic sugar over a regular while loops is that it s tricky to get the index variable right due to floating-point roundoff

23690537
min	max	range	min	range	max
you can only do this if the range min max and step are defined ahead of time for all passes which isn t guaranteed with the more flexible while -loop form

creating private fields and then using the ide to automatically generate getter and setter for all these fields is almost as bad as using public fields

23696563

the completely meaningless getter setter code is at times longer than the real logic in a class and you will read these functions many times even if you don t want to

to resolve issue you have either to make product extends and implements method in vehicle or maybe use equals method instead overriding default implementation

23700597
google-chrome	firefox
this problem only seems to happen in firefox and not google-chrome

23700604
installation	upgrade
i upgrade from osx 10.7 to osx 10.9 and afterwards my installation of aws no longer worked

23700626
int	chars
instead you can perform the obfuscation by first converting the chars in question to a 6-bit int

23700710
heroku	openshift
i had my app the same code that wasn t working on heroku working perfectly on openshift with websockets and everything in only 2 hours

23700718
disk	ram
since the files are all bigger than ram this translates to actual disk usage

23700767
width	height
but i want to use a shape drawable which doesn t have an intrinsic width or height

23700767
width	height
i tried specifying the width height

23700809
width	height
so you need to get the actual device width and height first

23700809
actualheight	actualwidth
you then get the actualwidth and actualheight which are always 800 and 480 and then multiply by the scaling factor

23700809
portrait	landscape
so there you have your device dimensions now and you re not wiring into the game logic itself unless your logic needed to be based off of the possibility of a mid game landscape to portrait switch

23700824
button	checkbox
i have a simple form with three checkbox an input box for the starting keyword a submit button and a textarea for the results the variations on the input

23700970
draggable	droppable
i want to be able to drag a draggable into a droppable

23700970
draggable	droppable
then when i drag in another draggable prevent the user from dropping it on the previously dropped draggable but still drop it on the droppable

23700970
draggable	droppable
i though the best approach to detecting if a draggable is over a dropped draggable is to make the draggable droppable too and set the accept parameter to false so it accepts nothing

23700976
ienumerable	ilist
if you still would like to show nothing - you might need to switch from ienumerable to ilist to have count property avaialble fo usage

23700978
onkeyup	onkeydown
i tried return false in both onkeyup and onkeydown attributes that are listed in pf user guide

23701006
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome firefox just fine

23701066
hide	show
instead just render whatever dom you want for idle screen into a hidden div in the main layout and use jquery to show hide it while user is idle

23701099
google-chrome	firefox
however on firefox sometimes and google-chrome i get

23701102
restrict	shared
disable policy network access restrict anonymous access to named pipes and shared

23701143
gridbaglayout	boxlayout	gridbaglayout	cardlayout	cardlayout	boxlayout
then instead of adding these panels to a cardlayout where you need to swap panels you can add the panels to a panel using a boxlayout or gridbaglayout

23701161
int	chars
a chars is usually an eight bit wide int which happens to be representable in the programming language as an 8 bit chars you can also assign numbers to chars like

23701203
folder	directory
however for best practices i would not get in the habit of storing files in your root directory instead use environment.getfolderpath ... to get the path of your user s personal folder my documents or the application data folder for you application

23701230
rss	feed
the website provides an rss feed which you will use to fetch the most recent articles

23701339

23701411
centos	linux
i have the solution for making connection to mssql when your machine is linux based i would specifically say centos

23701443
width	height
arrays created in this way have a fixed height width

23701445
try-catch	exception-handling
nothing in my application log indicates a problem and enclosing the call in a try-catch block didn t turn up any exception-handling

23701489
onresume	onpause
you still need to implement onpause onresume

23701602
width	height
after years i found a little tool that does exactly one thing displaying the height and width of a flash file

23701622
int	double
i am using not using int to store the position of the snake or apples i am using double

23701639
public	protected
and i notice that updateprogress is protected and workdone totalwork are both defined as public final readonlydoubleproperty

23701707
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried it in google-chrome firefox ie edge

23701764
post	get
the firs it that your route is listening for a get request but you re using a post request in your ajax call

23701773
width	height
and also placed the height width within the html

23701800
daemons	systemd
linux systemd generally do not cache address translations at the os level unless you are running nscd name service cache daemons and even then there is no form of pushing updates to applications using dns translation

23701942
for-loop	loops
you can use a for-loop to iterate 5 times with an additional condition in loops like so

23702004
temp	tmp
it looks like the setting of temp tmpdir tmp in your environment points to an nfs directory which sometimes causes an error when the temporary directory is removed

23702011
portrait	landscape
but when i rotate to portrait it went portrait even though i told them to use landscape only

23702017
for-loop	loops
i was thinking about a do while loops i could wrap around the entire for-loop but i would still need a way to break out of the for

23702035
drawimage	todataurl
if you are just drawing the same truck but want to redraw when the page is resized instead use todataurl method of the canvas to pull the image of the canvas then resize the canvas using .width and .height instead of css because you will stretch the image then use the drawimage method to draw that data url back to the canvas or just plop it into an img tag

23702037
switching	screens
the only solution i know of is switching to full screens mode where rendering may be beam synchronized

23702073
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade the ide to a later versioning but am concerned it might causes problems with an older app server

23702074
google-chrome	firefox
earlier it was rendering properly in the google-chrome but not in firefox and ie

23702102
hide	show
i called fragmenttransaction.hide and fragmenttransaction.show methods to hide and show fragments

23702102
onresume	onpause
advantage of this option is that i keep the code clean and simple as i don t need to override any special methods like setuservisiblehint or onhiddenchanged and i can handle everything inside onpause and onresume which are already implemented

23702145
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in google-chrome safari and firefox

23702162

you need to set the onclientclick property in the rowdatabound event where you have access to the bound row values and can concatenate your message to include whatever data you want

23702363
post	get
i geuss the undefined problem you got there is because you re accessing the request body - a request has a body with parameters if it s a post request get requests has only a url and headers

23702363
post	get
try changing your client side ajax call from type get to type post and update your nodejs

23702398
width	height
i searched all over the internet for hours but have not found the solution to this little problem i m facing make a little script to keep dynamic height relative to width

23702538
width	height
when i first open the page that loads the above xaml the list renders a 180w 180h space for each image at the full size available given by the grid dimensions 180 width and auto height

23702538
width	height
then once the image has loaded the image area is scaled down to width limit of the grid 180 and its height is scaled proportionally 120

23702542
stdout	stderr
it is unlikely that a subprocess closes its stdout stderr before its shutdown therefore you could skip the logic that handles eof for simplicity

23702557
rss	feed
there are rss and atom feed but i can only access the most recent 50 messages with them

23702585

it seems like devise warden is getting involved and throwing rejection logic before cancan may get involved

23702797
devise	cancan
stackoverflow configure devise cancan for guest users

23702804
put	get
note you can get sideloading to work even without the above fixes but you won t be able to actually put the book in the ibookstore without them

23702813
post	get
i ve read various post on how to get around this and it seems the simplest would be to pass the id in as a query string instead

23702818
folder	directory
i am attempting to use shell globbing to grab all nested matchin folder except for ones in a particular directory

23702818
folder	directory
the folder to include will vary so i need to explicitly exclude the foo directory

23702836
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
applications running on amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk are not using amazon ses automatically rather simply use the smtp facility available for the underlying regular amazon ec2 instances and smtp on amazon ec is indeed throttled and has less reputation with other providers see email changes

23702836
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
the latter implies that you can configure your os to also use amazon ses as the outbound smtp destination in an ec2 instance directly however while customizing and configuring amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk environments is possible even down to using custom amis usually it is much easier to target the ses smtp endpoint from within your application instead

23702836
email	dkim
details and authenticating email with dkim in amazon ses is also available

23702836
dns	spf
set up spf sender policy framework dns records

23702967
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
so you can save it in a variable and then when you come back to the previous view controller in viewdidappear or viewwillappear

23702976
free	malloc
be sure that if you use new that you also use delete or if you use malloc be sure to use free

23702976
free	malloc
the runtime libraries can use different implementations where trying to combine new and free or malloc and delete may lead to leaks

23703068
innodb	myisam
with myisam it s not quite as granular or scalable as the options you have with innodb

23703116
hide	show
i m trying to hide the first month week day tabs that are above the view of the calendar as show in the image below not the lower tabs

23703120
for-loop	loops
this is because when you loops over with a for-loop it only takes the keys as well

23703126
knitr	latex
i am only starting to work with knitr and latex so i m not sure how i would achieve such a thing

23703139

it contains a fingerprint of sorts identifying the application in its specific current form similar to an md5 hash though i have no idea what is actually being used so as to be able to detect tampering later

23703141
textview	imageview
inside listview item what i m trying to do is to place an imageview over a textview while the textview must fill it s parent here s what i did

23703141
textview	imageview
imageview height must be fixed but i can t do then for textview

23703246
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
when accessing the web page you can see it here yourself loads fine in google-chrome and firefox new versions at the least but in safari latest version the task stream dart component content directly under the translation tasks header doesn t work and hence displays the configured text loading... while not actually doing anything

23703338
getter	setter
the setter and getter is not one of them

23703338
getter	setter
you can vote for the feature request idea-28206 allow customization of generated getter setter

23703338
getter	setter
engineer dollery is correct that there are some plugins for inserting customer setter getter

23703342
int	chars	int	boolean
string int chars exception and boolean are all in the java.lang package

23703355

23703371
width	height
i have a web app cordova that i ve designed to a specific width and height

23703406
width	height
the width is right but the height only goes about half way down the page

23703408
cos	sin
where cn is a constant for which sin cn and cos cn have been pre-computed and are available in a table and if following gal s method cn has been chosen so that both sin cn and cos cn are closely approximated by floating-point numbers

23703408
cos	sin
i don t understand why this makes sense cos h however it is computed will probably be wrong by at least 0.5 ulp for some values of h and since it is close to 1.0 this seems to have a drastic effect on the accuracy of the result sin x when computed this way

23703408
cos	sin
then the two quantities cos h - 1.0 and sin h can be approximated with polynomials that are easy to make accurate as they produce results near zero

23703408
cos	sin
f | cos f | sin f

23703416
public	protected
the difference i see is using public instead of protected and also using override that should help you figure out if you are not properly overriding the method

23703446
portrait	landscape
set the orientation by checking weather app in landscape or portrait mode

23703459
cvs	svn
it is as a result of this intentional decision to permit the storage of folders and making them the first class entity in svn s system rather than the content of your source code files perhaps encoded as diff files as you see in cvs and mercurial which do not track folders at all and which can not generate equivalently broken working copies that leads to working copies becoming effectively invalid and no longer updateable which is the root of the problem i describe above

23703461
icollection	iqueryable
this doesn t work because the navigational properties do not implement iqueryable they implement icollection

23703523

get requests are fine and return all the post as expected

23703588
post	get
i can t however get new content to post

23703603
int	double
the type of casting i understand is casting int to double

23703672
int	double
int and double are siblings and not in the same hierarchy so you can say

23703672
superclass	subclassing
each subclassing know about its superclass as well

23703699
jboss	glassfish
jee applications should be hosted on ee servers - like glassfish tomcat ee or jboss for name a few

23703715
int	double
strictly speaking going from int to double isn t casting but conversion

23703718
google-chrome	firefox
try pulling up your developer tools in google-chrome or firefox and check out the console while doing a page reload see if you get a 404 on the image get request

folder	dir
there are two techniques function dir or a folder object

23703949
folder	dir
most answers use dir rather than folder objects

23703956
folder	directory
the trouble is i don t see what test or action i can take to distinguish between user did not grant permission which warrants me showing the please grant permission panel again and the this folder does not exist state which warrants me ignoring the directory and moving on

23703983
nsoperationqueue	nsblockoperation
alternatively you could use nsblockoperation for the asynchronous code and set its completionblock for the response-finished code and add it to an nsoperationqueue

23704028
post	get
note i ve attempted to use but it fails on the callback and seems to use get while the documentation explicitly states post

23704030
tax	shipping
mijireh error total must add up correctly to the items discount tax and shipping costs

23704073
textview	imageview
set the textview height same as imageview since your using relative layout for the listview item layout the item height will be the maximum height of its inner child

23704073
textview	imageview
if the imageview height is not fixed then you can set the textview height from your adapter getview method

23704123
fadein	fadeout
background my script extract below shows word repeatedly quick fadein variable fadeout and records the elapsed time between appearance and keypress

23704245
hide	show
note if i don t press menu button i can show hide the sidebar every time i want by dragging the top screen

23704316
oncreate	onstart
i assume there must be a way to stash some reference to that specific instance of activity class in some global public place during the onstart or oncreate methods using this or some context and then use that in the static method to make the calls

23704334
width	height
that statement sets the graphic context in x and y resolution width and height respectively

23704336
post	get
very old post but i ve been looking into ways to get pdftk installed on the amazon distro which is what the op is using

google-chrome	firefox
we have this site that is a node backbone based site and for some reason the site is working perfectly fine on google-chrome but is not fully functioning on firefox

23704419
google-chrome	firefox
however the problem is that our home route never actually is getting hit in firefox whereas it gets hit in google-chrome

23704419
google-chrome	firefox
another difference from google-chrome to firefox is that if we watch the network in google-chrome all of the resources we load in our index.html file are properly loaded

23704448

this is pretty simple to do with matplotlib by setting the backend to agg however i m having some serious problems doing this with mayavi

23704892
mayavi	matplotlib
the 3d rendering provided by matplotlib is insufficient for what i need so any suggestions for working alternatives to mayavi would be appreciated as well

23704893
setinterval	settimeout
you should go ahead and use the setinterval or settimeout method but make sure to unref them so they don t hold up the process that would otherwise exit unless that timer is the main execution for the program

23704896
put	get
get obj_out_old.courseid and put into objectives.courseid

the problem you are describing can arise if you configure your server for tcp and udp but then have your client only connect via tcp

23710531
udp	tcp
if you re wanting to take advantage of the host discovery but only need a tcp connection thereafter then it is advisable that you run a separate server for udp discovery

tax	shipping
it came down to a change in the way shipping taxes are rounded which came in when i updated to woocommerce 2.1.7 - paytrail would throw an error if the shipping + shipping tax included fractions of a cent

23710591
tax	shipping
to test and as a short-term fix i first turned off the shipping tax

23710591
tax	shipping
when that passed i turned the tax back on and adjusted the shipping rates so that adding the tax would evaluate to a value with maximum 2 decimal places - i.e â 4 75 + 24 shipping tax â 5 89

23710724

when a parent process dies all of its children processes are moved under process init with pid 1 in the process tree

23714489

i noticed that giving both the picture and div a class and defining the mouseenter and mouseleave events of the class is a better solution

23714730
portrait	landscape
i wrote a wee conditional script that detects if an image if portrait or landscape and adds a class for either

23714730
portrait	landscape
my problem is each img tag is outputting the exact same result and my test images are a good mixture of landscape and portrait so something isn t right

23714758
uitableview	uisearchbar
my issue is that when i scroll uitableview my uisearchbar acts as a uitableview cell and scrolls like any other cell

23714772
width	height
i assumed that you were trying to find width and height of the image

23714819
int	chars
first ord converts a chars to an int then fromintegral converts it to cint

23714819
int	chars
on the other side fromintegral converts a cint to an int then chr converts the int to a chars

23714829
width	height
what i tried to come up with was a wall of diamond patterns each with the same width height place them such that the first row had 11 diamonds the second with 10 the third with 11 to create a solid wall with each diamond of a different shade

23714832
width	height
centering a div of unknown height and width

try using hide instead of fadeout for the first-child element

23714857
google-chrome	firefox
and all bowser like google-chrome and firefox shows perfect but not ie

23714860
superclass	subclassing
you have a superclass and a subclassing

23714864
postgresql	mysql
we will be using django with either mysql or postgresql

23714898
uicollectionview	reloaddata
when i call reloaddata method of uicollectionview it cause all visible cell to blink

23714961
getter	setter
for activerecord you will probably have to create getter and setter methods manually for these properties and map it there like

23715010
translation	localization
localization can also be based purely on the translation of the attribute-name if you are using activerecord

23715048
int	boolean
however even if i apply line-spacing settings via styleddocument.setparagraphattributes int int attributeset boolean my jtextpane does not display the art correctly

23715113
google-chrome	firefox
we ve noticed google-chrome + canvas is not as performant as firefox + canvas

23715123
ada	pascal
i have found so many bugs in c c++ code by converting it to pascal or ada

23715170
ionic	angular
i m using ionic on top of this but not relevant to this question as it is just built on top of angular cordova

23715210
for-loop	loops
the brute force way to do this is to go over each object with a for-loop and add its weight to some total then go over loops again and see whether each object should be chosen according to some random probability function

23715231
int	chars
but getting error cannot convert int to chars in line 18 that is -

23715285
width	height
modify the height width of the element accordingly and change the margin-top for the spacing

23715300
postgresql	mysql
indeed that would create more rows but mysql and postgresql can easily that amount of rows

23715333
jar	war	sbt-assembly	xsbt-web-plugin
you can make a war file using earldouglas xsbt-web-plugin and use sbt-assembly for fat jar

23715333
jar	war
generating jar and war from the same code base

23715407
int	chars
obviously the number on the button is just a chars and not an int as i intend it to be

23715525
joptionpane	jcomponent
your question is answered very well but is possible to create a lots of jcomponent without additional effort then is possible quite easy to put together bunch of jbuttons and jcombobox together both answers by hfoe and camickr into one joptionpane

23715538
width	height
don t use position absolute -- it breaks the flow and relationship between elements which means they can not show any response to each others width height changes

23715555
put	get
while i can re-use its calculations about which groups of items get put on the same rows i will need to calculate new y offsets

23715583
width	margin
you have declared the width with a fixed 800px and margin 0 auto will center that container with 800px in the screen

23715583
width	font-size
this way the maximun width will be 80 times the base font-size 16px resulting in 1280px

23715583
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
note if you are not using box-sizing border-box if you add padding to the class which already has width 100 the padding will be added as an extra to the element s resulting width which will cause it to go beyond the max-width and in small screens you will be able to side scroll your pages not good

23715589
post	get
post for creating content entities and the related guides get on content entities and get on views-generated lists

23715589
post	get
get s work great but i haven t been able to get any post to work i ve posted the issue on the drupal.org site too

23715589
post	get
i m using postman in chrome for testing and again i can get a basic page and my own content entity just fine but with post i always get a return code of 200 ok never 201 which is what i should receive according to the guide and the nodes don t get created

23715599
width	height
if there is anywhere between 1-3 divs in the container they should be centered with a max height and width of 160px

23715626
udp	tcp
since its not realtime game i decided to use tcp instead of udp protocol but its another discussion...

23715684
width	height
set tile s width and height and always add the next tile to that position

23715786
getter	setter
try to add getter and setter for field id too

23715788
onresume	onpause
and is it actually bad to leave broadcast receivers registered between onpause and onresume

23715820
width	height
the size of the images is set dynamically so that the height is fixed to the 25 of the parent div width and the width is auto

23715825
for-loop	loops
my check_urls function has a for-loop and each loops has one mysql update query

23715858
typedef	struct
in c as distinct from c++ you either have to provide an explicit typedef or continue to use struct tag

23715858
typedef	struct
in c++ you can use the tag name as a type name without the struct prefix without the explicit typedef as long as struct cfg_struct or class cfg_struct has appeared somewhere

23715882
width	text-align
if not try to play with width and use float left and text-align center

23715890
put	get
i ve run into this on pretty much every ring-based web tutorial i ve tried so either i ve got something configured weird i updated and reinstalled lein blew away my .m2 and rebuilt etc or something has changed in the myriad dependencies that get put together to make the classpath

23715892
button	checkbox
you can add button checkbox ect.

23715918
for-loop	loops
also i ve used a for-loop and not jquery each loops on the sections elements because a for-loop is much faster due to the lack of function callback an each function has

23715941
background-position	background-size
you can use css2 3 - with corner-radius for newer browsers or even just an overlay image image can be cropped and background can be scaled moved via css background-position and background-size accordingly

23715951
pow	sqrt
i did however see an sqrt function which means you can implement your own pow also this

23715974
int	double
if your triangles have int side lengths then you should represent them as int not double - and square the side lengths using not math.pow x 2

23716037
superclass	subclassing
class clusters group a number of private concrete subclassing under a public abstract superclass

23716037
nsstring	nsdata
other examples of class clusters include nsstring nsdata nsarray and nsdictionary

23716037
nsstring	nsdata
based on the above explanation i understand why nsstring and nsdata might be implemented as class clusters

23716037
cfstring	nsstring
after all an nsstring instance s storage requirements might be different based on whether it was initialized with a c string or a cfstring

23716072
std	ostream	ostream	istream
use std ostream write to write the data and std istream read to read the data

23716106
min	max
except in mysql sqlite which are lenient about the group by with sometimes indeterminate results most rdbms require every non-aggregated column max min sum count etc that appears in the select list to be in the group by

23716129

there is other tricky ways with floatting hudge height negative margin overflow

23716203
int	boolean
you re setting which implicitly casts the boolean produced by the to an int

23716203
int	boolean
the int representation of the boolean true is 1 therefore

23716215
getter	setter
i have a situation where i would like to create a class which accepts many arguments and has setter and getter in the fewest lines of code possible for maintainability

23716217

23716220
folder	directory
i mean i have several folder in resources directory such as

23716221
vmware	esx
if they re running on different vmware esx server hosts then disable the windows firewalls on both hosts as well

23716221
vmware	esx
i won t go into the details of the vmware virtual network editor in vmware workstation or similar tool in esx but if you re running both machines on the same host using host-only networking then you ll need to familiarize yourself with how this works

23716232
put	get	post	get	post	put
now when i manually put json data inside text box and click the button on that html form edits are done successfully in the database but when programmatically from my c# code i send the same json data payload and make a post request edits are never done successfully rather i get an html response body through fiddler that says status code success 200 but unable to complete operation some parameters couldn t be recognized

23716232
post	get
and the post request body that i get after appending arguments string to json string looks like this

23716262
keyevent	keyrelease
if you are using the java robot class s keypress and keyrelease methods to script the keyboard then you probably want keyevent.vk_f1 and its siblings in the keyevent class

23716272

23716758
int	boolean
you are setting flags as string and int while boolean here should suffice

23716827
fadein	fadeout
but you got to know that the fadein and fadeout will not

23716838
division	modulo
i think i would try to precompute some table of bit chunks and then using modulo and division both supported operations would do n lookups into the table

subtraction	addition
the majority of precision loss is in the addition and subtraction operators when the operands differ significantly in magnitude

23716956
subtraction	addition
in the above case the culprits are the subtraction in b - a and the addition in

23716970
nsstring	uifont
you just created new instance of uifont not an nsstring instance

23716987
int	double
recently i figured out that math.pow takes only double double args and i wonder why there is no overloaded functions with other types combinations such as int int or int double atc .

23716987
int	double
problem is that if you know that you use power with int int calculation is much effective and you don t need to take care of problems with double variables

23717011
int	double
you can of course implement your own method to take int power as is done here the accepted answer makes use of exponentiation by squaring which can also be applied to the double int case

23717021
folder	directory
i m trying to copy files from network folder to my local directory

23717380
qtabwidget	qsplitter
now the problem starts when the qtabwidget is set in a qsplitter layout along with some other layout.at startup construction the above method does not seem to work for instance i have something like this

23717383
int	double
another guess is that x is being instantiated as an int or a double because if it was instantiated as a std string the compiler would complain about attempting to convert a std string to an int by returning it in graph vertex member function

23717390
put	get
i want to take my get variables and put them behind the url like folders

23717390

23717678
width	height
i tried getting the width and height comparison from js and android and it is the same width and height for both

23717684
equals	compareto
generally equals will delegate to compareto - this means that in equals you ll have a line like

23717684
comparator	comparable
consider creating an implementation of comparator for use with treeset this way you avoid having to make raceentrant implement comparable

23717684
comparator	comparable
treeset will automatically re-order it s elements as they are added removed based on the supplied comparator or comparable

23717704
interpolation	splines
let s assume you want to do a splines interpolation

23717748
versioning	upgrade
i was using 1.8.2 pdfbox versioning then upgrade it based on comment here

23717764
int	double
also you should use int where appropriate as not all of the numbers should be double

23717845
put	get
for example if you put our new ngelementready directive on an element that also has ngif and the condition of the ngif evaluates to false then our ngelementready directive won t get loaded

23717878
spaces	delimiter
if your intention is to treat sequences of spaces as a single delimiter then use

23717941
cpu	processors
you definitely don t want multiple threads on a core as that ll slow things down as threads start contending for cpu time instead of working so probably your core count would be your ceiling or maybe core count - 1 to allow one core for all other tasks to run on so in your case maybe 3 or 4 cores tops if i remember core counts for i3 processors right

23717953
google-chrome	firefox
i guess ultimately i m not even sure if firefox or google-chrome is doing the correct thing

23718010
google-chrome	firefox
see it at this fiddle works for firefox and google-chrome

23718014
scheme	racket	haskell	scheme
i really liked chris s implementation in haskell higher-level and makes use of existing procedures instead of explicit recursion it works for empty lists and it s not too difficult to translate to scheme it s more verbose in scheme than in haskell though. here s yet another option using racket and srfi-1 s span procedure take a look at chris s answer to see an explanation of how this works

23718123
qtabwidget	qsplitter
if things are set up properly the appropriate size adjustments should naturally occur due to the default behavior of the qsplitter and qtabwidget s internal layout managers

23718124
getter	setter
ok i am confused and new to java about getter and setter

23718187
hide	show
i have looked an several nganimate tutorials but nothing i could find deals with the before after animate scenario where i need to show hide the div before after it gets animated

23718241
getter	setter
in the code above the list i use to iterate is of objects asociados which is just a bean with it s corresponding getter and setter

23718267
versioning	upgrade
shiny has upgrade datatables from 1.9.x to 1.10.x since shiny 0.10.2 and you can use the options listed at if your shiny versioning is higher than 0.10.2

23718304

these are the vendor-prefixed properties used by different rendering engines of browsers gecko blink webkit trident etc

23718498
post	put
depending on what options the user selects i need to able to put post delete on both endpoints

23718498
post	put
i know the approach above is incorrect as xcode crashes after i post or put

23718498
post	put
do i create put post delete x 2 endpoints 6 rkentitymappings

23718832
width	height
a brief description of my classes - there is a base class called object which defines x y position and a width and height there is an entity class which inherits from object and adds velocity components and a character class which inherits from entity and adds movement functions

23718842
for-loop	arrays
use the for-loop to print the arrays members

23718851
free	malloc
you probably want to malloc your string return a to it and then free it in the calling function

23718860
stdout	fflush
alternatively you could pass in sys.__stdout__ unmolested stdout of the test or other file descriptor to the popen call and later fflush it into sys.stdout stringio.stringio instance created by nose but it looks less clean compared to a simple print statement

23718913
min	max
plot.getaxis x .setrange max min

23718956
for-loop	arrays
in the for-loop of your generatepermutations1 method you re overwriting the same arrays for each permutation you generate

filtering	grouping
written in haskell and using the library functions grouping length filtering head and map

23720092
haskell	scheme
a function that groups elements of a list together as long as they are equal can be defined as follows sorry i m using haskell syntax because i m not very familiar with scheme but it should be easy to translate

23720092
filtering	grouping
map filtering and head are even more standard then those and i m sure they are part of schemes library as might be grouping

23720115
hide	show
javascript determines the user category based on the user s previous answers and show hide applicable non-applicable input fields in the form

23720521
keydown	keyup
you can see the printout on every keydown and keyup of the modifiers in console including command and alt

23720552
post	get
if you really need to store the json style string of tags you could do that as well in post but to use that to get tag statistics is probably going to add far more complexity than necessary and separating your data into relational tables is a much more effective way of doing things

23720568
robobrowser	beautifulsoup
you could use beautifulsoup to parse this or use robobrowser which combines requests and beautifulsoup together with a dedicated form handler to make a browser-like framework for navigating a website

platform-tools and the platforms android apis directory after that you have the following folder in your sdk location

23720620
ready	each
afterwards i am ready to execute the getb method but the point is that i need to the hashmap in which i put all the data using geta method whereas i couldn t figure it out how to reach this hashmap from the getb method because these methods are unique and only this hashmap is related to each other

23720636
concave	convex
the contours might be convex and concave depending on the object so the solution needs to be generic on that part

23720637
integer	unsigned
my solution was to make sure the integer types for the fields i was referencing were both unsigned

23720637
integer	unsigned
so if you are referencing a primary key in another table make sure that primary key is an unsigned integer type

23720637
integer	unsigned
then when you create your foreign key make sure the column you are creating it on is of type unsigned integer as well

23720638

can i find the height width of each div so that they fit in circle

23720764
public	protected
but if you do not want to use persistent data storing and you also do not want to close your app and backup your data in this way there are other possibilities to make this hashmap to be visible throughout your application maybe visibility between classes appropriate method to do it is to set it as static and public or protected

23720784
folder	directory
the thing is i have 8 imagebuttons so the image must have a code to load up different images from my directory which is the images folder from root

23720784
int	chars
chars values cannot be converted to int

23720785
flask	django
django and flask both let you use template languages which let you manipulate and customize html pages

23720789
width	height
i would rely more on the actual width and height properties of the jpanel rather then magic numbers

23720853
folder	directory
because you declared your main class to be in package stitching what you should need to do is actually navigate to the folder above the root package in the bin directory then execute java stitching main

23720872
imei	udid
i figured out that you can calculate the udid with sha1 hash of serial + imei + wifimac + bluetoothmac and with the sha1 hash of serial + ecid + wifimac + bluetoothmac on the verizon iphone 4

23720906
int	chars	int	double
for example a function with a single argument or return value that is a chars short int long float double pointer etc will exercise a certain range of compiler code generation and likely be passed in a register if possible

23720911
public	protected
if you want to access the sportist members in fudbaler member function you need to declare them protected only accessible in this class and child classes or public generally accessible

23720913
folder	directory
in my application to move a file to a specific directory i need to know public folder path in controller action

23720933

implements	extends
if your vector2 vector3 and vector4 classes all extends basevector and implements the multiply method then this will work

23721281
width	height
when i increase the height of the imageview the logo increases its size but almost as if it was taking the height and using it as a width

23721281
width	height
i feel like what its trying to do right now is use the height as its width and the only time when its width is the value i put in is if the height is also the same value and even then there s some extra unwanted padding

23721316
width	height
despite all kinds of change in the css settings i can t get the full height of the image but full width is working

23721316
width	height
i have tested to change the width of the image but i still get the height of 345 px

23721321
build.gradle	gradlew
regarding using the build.gradle file or the dialog well probably yes but i m already used to the gradlew file and never even look at the dialog but i m just old school

23721338
getter	setter
basically i m trying to implement a getter and a setter for my mutable array

23721338
getter	setter
the getter gets called fine however the setter is apparently only called when i directly set the array equal to something using

23721383
division	multiplication
division and multiplication have equal priority so parenthesis are necessary

23721454
width	height
the 100 width in this case as it is an image will take all #start available width and proportionally adjust it s height at least in most browsers

23721454
width	height
image then will use it s real height and get masked with the #start width since any overflow is hidden

23721454
width	height
for a standard height full width image you may use

23721454
width	height
to get a full width and full height image masked you ll need to absolute - position the wrapper of the images

23721460
qthread	qobject
make your worker a regular qobject not a qthread

23721496
apache	nginx
i use apache port 8000 with nginx port 80 to serve static files

23721498
width	height
because the game window can be resized the image needs to be rescaled to a specific size this is easy with the width of the image which is just windowwidth - 128 however the height is harder to pull off because the bottom of the image is supposed to disappear off of the end of the window

23721498
width	height
currently i am trying to use the resolution of the image and the width it is to be drawn as to calculate a scale which is then used to calculate the correct height for the image like so

23721498
width	height
when the window size is 1024x768 this always seems to return 1024 as the height and 896 as the width which is correct

23721510
tesseract	leptonica
i solved it by installing the dev packages for tesseract and leptonica

23721534
google-chrome	firefox
i am using absolute pass and it works for google-chrome and firefox

23721573
config	ini
it uses hashes and by default is configurable read more at session.hash_function php ini directive or session.save_handler however if the existing config options don t match your uuidv5 needs you need to add it to php s core code or via a php extension

23721598
children	parent
i want to select all rows from table test_parent where parent contains children with both properties a and b so this would be record with parent_id 2

23721602
pull	push
if you want to achieve this the only way i know in this moment is without push pull method

23721616
folder	dir
index.php sets the current working dir to you application root the folder containing composer.json init_autoloader.php etc.

23721624
short	base
you can have a table input build the full path of the file you want to read or you somehow build it later knowing the base dir and the short filename pass the filename to the excel input tick that box and specify the step and the field you want to use for the filename

23721659

23721823
document.write	window.open
i tried using javascript document.write and window.open in various ways but it eitherappends the new page to current page or nothing happens

23721867
zoo	performanceanalytics
later on i need to convert the dataframe to a zoo object since the package performanceanalytics needs this as input

23721878
int	double
note in the program above the explicit double i is unnecessary because pi is already a double and multiplying an int by a double produces a double

23721907
width	height
change height and width of the images from 32 to 32px

23721956
ravendb	couchdb
flat files are a great way to get up and running quickly with structured logs but using a data store more suited to structured storage couchdb ravendb or seq will make it much nicer to view and correlate events based on property values

23722020
ddms	adb
check ddms perspective for attached devices or use adb devices command

23722080
trie	tree
a very efficient data structure to use is a trie or a radix tree

23722081
hide	show
i think adding the image to the background of the jpanel will be best because i also want to have a button which show hide the grid lines - the borders of the jlabels

23722114
tostring	getter
you can make getter settest tostring by generating aspectj or java files sql based on jpa annotations inserts updates based on enums and so on

23722119
itunes	entitlements
the app is sandboxed and the entitlements give it access to itunes apple events but i hadn t added quicktime player entitlements

23722134
matplotlib	scipy
and with respect to signal processing numpy scipy and matplotlib are a very good choice

23722147
range	minimum
this gets more complicated if the range isn t linear the servo moves more near maximum and less at minimum for example

23722148
versioning	upgrade
as for upgrading them you can upgrade any report by opening and resaving the report in a later versioning

23722150
post	get
you may call a separate function from within the oncreate function and with the help of post method we can wait until all necessary start up life cycle methods get completed

23722172
tostring	getter
you can make getter settest tostring by generating aspectj or java files sql based on jpa annotations inserts updates based on enums and so on

23722197
implements	extends
other solution is to require that all supported types extends certain base class or implements interface

23722201
entity-relationship	diagram
oo class diagram is more abstract and has more features than entity-relationship diagram

23722201
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship diagram is kind of implementation of oo diagram

23722301
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
haskell sasl dialect or scheme lisp dialect if you know java algol dialect is harder than learning a new dialect of the same language family i.e

23722301
lisp	scheme
learning ruby when you know java or common lisp if you know scheme

23722301
scheme	racket
i know racket has arrays like that but not scheme

23722309
zoo	xts
note if it s important you can wrap as.zoo around it but xts objects are zoo objects so it s probably not necessary

23722356
ienumerable	icollection
do i have another method to override to make it return an icollection instead of an ienumerable

23722376
post	get
xhr other origin is blocked because of security reason as an instance attacker can post behalf of a user using get request consider the fact that it is not possible because of lack of cookies

23722826
matplotlib	scipy
matlab s real value isn t in the base package which is more-or-less matched by a combination of numpy scipy and matplotlib but in the various toolboxes one can purchase

23722826
matlab	simulink
another feature of matlab that doesn t have an easy-to-use python equivalent is simulink especially the mature real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation and embedded code-generation

23722858
joptionpane	jdialog
i have used a joptionpane as an error message which is invoked by a wrong user input on a jdialog

post	get
i am trying to post a file bigger than 1 mb and i get this nginx error

23723048
min	max
you refer to the current group using current-group which you need to calculate the max and min dates to count the quantity and to print the nodes

23723092
portrait	landscape
i have a vc in portrait which presents another vc that can either be portrait or landscape

23723092
portrait	landscape
the problem is that when i return back to the original vc that presented it it is also shown in landscape until i rotate it and then it stays in portrait

23723092
portrait	landscape
in my vc that could either be portrait or landscape i have

23723096

23723188
post	get
you will get instantiated object on your api post method personviewmodel member

23723196
hash	salt
i had concerns about security but i figured that forms auth on a basic asp.net website with a hash and salt password has been sufficient for quite a number of years so i shouldn t have any issues with it here

23723203
maven	pom.xml
or any later version make maven downloads the ojdbc14-10.2.0.3.0.pom only and in that pom.xml you can read

23723203
nexus	artifactory
moreover i think you should avoid installing the jdbc jar in your corporation repository manager such as artifactory or nexus as a single artifact because if it was installed it would be still distributed alone even if to people in your organization only and this represents a otn license agreement violation

23723211
for-loop	arrays
could i maybe make an arrays of labels and then just access them via a for-loop

23723212
folder	dir
as of now i m stuck figuring out as to how to implement or create a folder within the openshift data dir which will store these uploaded images

23723215
memcpy	memset
if i eliminate the memset then the first memcpy runs at about 1.5 gb sec

23723236
stdout	stderr
just add both std cout and std clog for stdout and stderr respectively

23723271
children	parent
in storyboard i m trying to do let views controllers become parent children from each other although i don t know if this is possible

23723274
for-loop	loops
the problem i m having is that something goes wrong within the for-loop and the second time loops executed it seems to cache the first values and output parameter returns dbnull

folder	directory
open .iml file insideyour project folder that contain project source directory

23723636
memcpy	memset
as you have already seen when you eliminate memset datasrc 0 n the first memcpy is even slower because the pages for the source must be allocated as well

23723660
getter	setter
synthesize used to be necessary to create getter and setter but now we also have so-called automatic properties

23723660
getter	setter
when you don t use synthesize the compiler will create an instance variable to hold the property value and will generate getter and setter anyway

23723698
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i need to get all table fields list along with checkbox when a particular table name is selected in dropdownlistfor

23723707
ant	maven
for example in java there is such thing like maven or ant which downloads all required dependencies

23723709
for-loop	arrays
i guess i could use a for-loop to go through each cell of the data arrays and check whether this element has a y length longer than the shortest y of all cells and randomly remove samples

23723749
tostring	getter
you can make getter settest tostring by generating aspectj or java files sql based on jpa annotations inserts updates based on enums and so on

post	get
if i m understanding this correctly by default curl makes get requests but the request type can be changed to post by doing

23723771
for-loop	arrays
for arrays you better stick with a regular for-loop or you could use some nice arrays helper methods offered by some of the frameworks jquery for instance

23723785
put	get
but if i make a put request i get the following response

23723785
put	get
my get request returns json so i don t understand why the put request is not

you are actually facing a very specific blink webkit bug in their scrollwidth implementation regarding the body element

23723806
rtos	isr
you don t need a rtos in order to wake up from sleep a cortex m4 what you need is to use and interrupt isr you should refer to the manufacturer manual you may wake up with a timer isr or a button gpio depending of the sleep-hibernation modes of your particular chip

23723809
ant	maven
it is a dependency management designed to be used with ant and it is fully compatible with maven repositories

23723809
ant	pom.xml	ant	maven	maven	pom.xml
you will probably need to convert your pom.xml into ivy.xml ivy project descriptor using convertpom ant task and then use ivy ant tasks ivy resolve ivy retrieve to get all your third party jars from a maven repository

23724419
google-chrome	firefox
on google-chrome firefox etc it works fine

23724432

23724554
distance	mercator
distance units will of course depend on your projection in this example spherical mercator which is meters

width	height
so to calculate that value for your external images you just need to divide the width or height in meters of the image by its width or height in pixels

23724572
getter	setter
the getter and setter is for an nsmutablearray as a private variable

23724666
spy++	sendmessage
explore the functions postmessage sendmessage setforegroundwindow and also explore spy++ tool

oncreate	setcontentview
afterwards each activity sets its corresponding layout in its oncreate method via setcontentview

23724784
guava	lambdaj
in other case you can either try guava or lambdaj

23724874
folder	directory
since you have installed lua in your home directory instead of under a system folder usr the loader does not know where to find the lua dynamic library files when you run the program

postgresql	mysql
note if postgresql contains geometrical data please make sure that you are using myisam as the database engine in mysql

23724982
width	height
i get the screen resolution with the wmic desktopmonitor get screenwidth value command for the width the height is the same thing

23724995
int	chars
php expects the second argument of strpos to be a string otherwise it is converted to an int and applied as the ordinal value of a chars as states the documentation

23725003
for-loop	arrays
the variable li in the for-loop is an index not the actual element in the arrays

23725011
oncreate	setcontentview
you need first call setcontentview inside oncreate before to initialize variables

23725037
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid is being called before setcontentview which inflates the layout

23725041
post	get
you re probably going to get a mmap malloc exception on account of having to read the file into memory to post it to your server

23725043
post	put
i wanted to just put this as a comment on your original post but don t have enough reputation yet.

23725097

this base class also overrides equals and gethashcode defining 2 entities to be equals when they return the same value for gettype and have the same id value

23725297
for-loop	loops
unfortunately i don t think a for-loop will be possible as this is a wordpress loops i m dealing with

23725339
post	get
when i build the site all post get post layout but instead of the date specified in front matter defaults i get the date specified in the names of the post initially

23725357
post	get
with that said typically you should post these values back to the server and then redirect to a new actionmethod thus the acronym prg for post redirect get

23725367
post	put
this code fragment that you have put on your post cannot reproduce your error

23725376
ng-app	ng-controller
in second html ng-app and ng-controller are ignored

23725378

if you click on it it should show some lines and hide them after 3 seconds but if you click on the button before the 3 seconds are over the lines should hide as well

23725453
children	parent
set layout_weight attribute set on your message_text_server textview object in both bubble layouts to tell parent container how you want it to distribute available space to its children

23725522
hide	show
i try to use a toggle-button to show and hide a row of my table

23725544
submit	submission
that i believe will keep my form submission from setting the blank field to null and the submit failing on the implicit nullable check

23725569
int	boolean
anyval is the base type for primitive types int boolean byte etc

23725569
int	boolean
in java these are the keyword types int boolean byte

23725569
int	boolean
in your example you return 1 else false so the compiler looks for the common type between int and boolean finding anyval

23725588
nutiteq	mapsforge
what i d suggest to try is to convert .osm file to .map file using osmosis and then use mapsforge library to render a map like shown in nutiteq wiki page

23725590
post	get
form_for accepts a post method by default.here the edit action is get method so your form_for should look like this

23725696
implements	modifiers
just uncheck the add override modifiers field at the bottom of the select members to implements dialog

23725701
np-hard	np-complete
i believe this problem is np-hard because it can be used to solve 3-sat a known np-complete problem

23725709
addition	multiplication
my issue is determining whether the multiplication or addition operator was pressed and then calling the appropriate method

23725773
put	get
i ve tried to put logs inside it but it never executes i get tired of waiting for it

23725849
uninstall	upgrade
another way of looking at it is that in situations like these people add a and not upgradingproductcode to the uninstall condition on the ca that removes the app pool so that it doesn t delete the app pool on an upgrade because it may just have been created in a new location as in your case

23725874
hide	show	oncreate	ondestroy
you get empty activity when ondestroy oncreate dont calls when activity hide and show again

23725874
onresume	onpause
became a dead code for case onpause - onstop - onstart - onresume

23725882
multiplying	add
add an onclicklistener for your each buttons multiplying divide etc

23725887
prepare	execute
trouble writing output already prepare 2014-05-18 18 24 40 - dex loader unable to execute dex multiple dex files define lcom google ads adrequest errorcode

so the problem i m having is i can t get the image that has just been selected in the uiimagepickercontroller to be displayed in the uiimageview my imagepickercontroller was initiated by a button in my previous view controller spviewcontroller rootviewcontroller i am using storyboards i thought if i put in the uiimageview then connected it using an outlet reference it would display there this doesn t seem to be the case though

23725947
width	height
i m trying to get the width of an image after a change in the height and i only have the url the image is not in a tag in the html so i tried this code

23725947
width	height
or at least how to get the aspect ratio or width and height of the image url

23725961
fullpage.js	skrollr
i m using skrollr in an attempt to create a fullpage.js -like effect plus parallax

23725986
width	height
so what you need to do is get the width and height of the original image and create a destination bitmap with the width and height reversed so the width becomes the height and vice verse otherwise the destination bitmap should be the same as the source bitmap

23726013
width	height
first box is with fixed height and 100 width

23726013
width	height
second box is with variable height dependent on browser size and if possible 100 width - dependent on height

23726013
width	height
third box is with fixed height and 100 width

23726038
subtraction	addition
that will work if you also implement all possible operators for operations like addition subtraction etc but requires much typing and duplication of code

23726060
portrait	landscape
it shows the page ok in portrait mode but when i rotate it to landscape it just zooms it instead of regrouping

23726064
int	chars
override keypressed int key chars c in basicgamestate

23726095
pdostatement	bindvalue	bindparam	pdostatement	bindparam	bindvalue
as i said we didn t want to modify the entire code base to add this functionality so we overwrite the default bindparam and bindvalue methods of the pdostatement object do our caching of the bound data then call parent bindparam or parent bindvalue

23726111
gridview	formview
i have set up the webpage in a 3 tier architecture such that when i choose to edit a particular record from the gridview it gives me a formview populated with the details of the record i selected in the gridview.when i click the update linkbutton after changing some details on the formview the gridview is displayed with a blank record of the selected row.i need this row on the gridview to have the data

23726130
post	get
for the non-valid key use the mmc plugin on the server side to get the thumbprint and then post this into something like notepad++ and inspect it - ensure no dodgy characters etc. then remove spaces and then paste it into the web.config

23726157
versioning	upgrade
the only option that i ve come up with is to create an intermediate versioning using silverlight that migrates the data to a new format and then to later upgrade the application to universal

23726176
post	get
i ve been trying to call an external function with the getprocaddress function but everytime i call the function it crashes the console ive been looking but in every post i get the same final solution but when i try it in my dll it crashes the app

23726189
hide	show
you can use switches hide show and ng-repeats

23726259
post	get
use post instead of get to force the 100 continue header in response if needed

23726268
admob	inmobi
integration of inmobi into admob should be pretty simple

23726268
admob	inmobi
in short you should download inmobi sdk and adapter for admob from inmobi website urls are in the admob docs add downloaded sdk and adapter as libraries to your project make corresponding changes in androidmanifest.xml add inmobi s activities other inmmobi stuff described in the inmobi docs and enable inmobi option in admob console

23726268
admob	inmobi
you should not use your inmobi credentials all is done through admob credentials

23726290
width	height
a brief description of my code structure so far i have a base class called object which defines x y position and a width and height there is an entity class which inherits from object and adds velocity components and a character class which inherits from entity and adds movement functions

23726323
int	chars
the method would ignore any int or symbols and only output chars that appeared in the table

23726393
folder	directory
note that phonegap wants www folder for its build scripts therefore i create following directory structure

23726402
int	chars
the trick is that chars are a kind of int as each chars as actually an int value associated through the unicode chart a is 97 b is 98 and so on

23726422
post	get
your express server will act as a mule to save read validate and delete data based on the get and post request you make from the front end

23726454
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is a software pbx and it s free

23726454
freeswitch	pbx	asterisk	freeswitch	asterisk	pbx
it s a sip channel that you can easily connect to any software pbx such as freeswitch cisco telephony softare and yes asterisk

23726454
asterisk	pbx
if you purchase 5 channels you can have 5 inbound calls to your asterisk pbx system

23726454
asterisk	freeswitch
b use mod_skypopen with freeswitch to provide skype connectivity to your asterisk box

23726454
freeswitch	pbx	skype	pbx	asterisk	freeswitch	asterisk	pbx
it works by starting a number of hidden skype clients and tunneling their audio in out to the freeswitch pbx which you can later use to connect to asterisk via sip

23726454
skype	pbx	asterisk	pbx
summary connect skype to an asterisk pbx and control your calls from there via scripting or using the asterisk manager api

23726455
width	height
when i select a row the selection looks ugly because the text cell height are the same size as each other but are different to the image which is dynamic depending on the width of the image s grid column width

23726487
keydown	keyup
by the way the ctrl + v or command + v is covered with keyup keydown event

23726493
int	chars
primitive data types such as chars bool and int have some memory

23726553
post	get
i managed to get this working i post the solution here for others

23726655
int	double
the d format is used for scanning printing int s not double s and trying to use it to read double s will result in garbage being stored in your matrix

23726679
post	get
only time i ve seen this happen was when a controller create action was being sent as a get request instead of post as it should be in rest

23726716
keyevent	keyrelease
do a similar thing in keyrelease -- check the keyevent object s key code and act accordingly

23726748
versioning	upgrade
is this as simple as just installing the new app versioning or do i need to do a backup and restore move upgrade data files etc for the databases i wish to preserve

23726795
int	chars
so far neither has been allocated any memory on the heap although they do exist in memory in the exact same way a chars bool or int exists in memory

23726848
ostringstream	std
in my project i use a class class called message which inherits from std ostringstream to print out human readable information of other class types

23726883
libevent	epoll
whatever the way you choose for interacting with os select or as suggested in the comments libevent epoll kqueue or even boost asio if c++ is an acceptable solution asynchronous mode will allow you to process everything in a single thread if implemented correctly and nothing blocks the main dispatching loop

23726893
addclass	removeclass
please note that i have used the attr method for resetting the class attribute s value if you want to add remove certain classnames you can use the addclass removeclass methods instead

23726911
std	ostream	ostream	istream
the only reason to derive from std ostream or std istream is to create a stream properly set up to use a suitable stream buffer

23726965
ati	nvidia
still i m curious why it didn t work with 32 bit on my nvidia but on an ati

23727004
post	put
chances are you should not use put in your request but post

23727005
listview	gridview
in my windows 8 application i have multiple listview inside a gridview with horizontalscrollmode enabled

23727010
put	get
thus two options either put the command on the items in itemssource more flexible since they can have different commands or do a relativesource binding back up to the view grab the viewmodel via view.datacontext and get the command from that

23727015
int	chars
the meta lesson is that the built-in operators in c++ acting on int really only operate on int and wider but not on any of the shorter types bool chars short and similar considerations apply to passing int through an ellipsis

23727035
puma	unicorn
hence if i change the search path using one connection the others won t be affected so this could work with unicorn because each request has it own connection but it will not work with multi-threaded servers like puma

23727103
put	get
get all events in that city put them in a set

23727126
jtextfield	jlabel
i have have a jlabel a jbutton and a jtextfield

23727126

i need to put the jlabel in cell 0 0 from the jframe origin and then put a jtextfield 1 0 and finally put a jbutton 0 1 on the second line

23727129
vim	emacs
alternatively you can change the editor git uses with this command replace vim with your preferred editor emacs nano etc

23727137
int	boolean
the usual arithmetic conversion is applied that is boolean value true is converted to int value 1 and it is not equal to the expression of the left operanf because internal binary representation of the left operand differs from 1 as showed the output of your first code snippet

23727170
subtract	add
i m pretty sure it is but if it is not what should i add subtract to make it correct

23727172
rspec	capybara
i have the following rspec test which works fine in the default selenium driver but it fails in the capybara webkit driver

23727175
put	get
let s say you put 70 textview s in an app s layout - you ll get this warning

23727232
stdout	stdio	stdout	stderr
this is how i finally got it to work i wrote a thin wrapper that launches powershell.exe and redirects stdio stdout and stderr

23727232
stdout	stdio	stdout	stderr	stdio	gets
my program is simply executing powershell.exe with the same arguments the same stdio the same stdout and the same stderr that it gets

23727241
hide	show
i need to show hide the divs on selected value i was previously using it with javascript but stuck with bootstrap

23727308
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you re still in viewdidload this certainly isn t going to be the case and i think this mostly will not be the case in viewwillappear

23727331
post	put
i ve put up a post with a little more detail and a working script but here is the basic idea

23727372
listview	gridview
i don t remember exactly but i think the easiest way might be to replace a listview with a gridview

23727398
scrypt	pbkdf2	pbkdf2	hash
that said you should use a password based key derivation function pbkdf such as pbkdf2 present in the standard java api bcrypt or scrypt to store password hash

23727405
ubuntu	debian
the default directory apparently we were also surprised moved from var www to var www html for htdocs in debian and ubuntu copied this change

23727413
express	node.js
node.js and the express generator are really handy and simple to understand

23727419
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint
4 a 64-bit linux os such as ubuntu 14.04 or the latest mint but not restricted to them

23727473
post	put
invoke setid within post put method in your controller class you have the id in your path

23727473
post	get
in this way you ll get an entity od data object you re using with an id filled out in your post method in controller

23727550
inherited	properties
later when they give an example of inherited they remove the gender properties for clarity i assume so i am not sure what the line does in the first place

23727595
for-loop	arrays
be mindful that arrays indexing begins at zero but your first for-loop starts looking at 1 while the second starts at 0

23727611
width	height
basically the parameters from left to right are height width x of the top left and y of the top left and by keeping the x and y both greater or equal to zero your circle will always be visible

23727653
d3.js	crossfilter
the d3.js and crossfilter parts of the code seem to be talking to each other since the brushing functionality works so i m wondering if i don t have the css referenced correctly

23727670
post	get
i think having a type-ahead function which looks up the existing entries as i type and in case no match is found i would just post the new position to the position table and somehow get the newly created id hereof and store this in the employee record

23727684
try-catch	exception-handling
to do this you should wrap the method that throws the exception-handling or subclass in a try-catch statement

23727692
setinterval	clearinterval
the setinterval method continuously evaluates the specified expression until the timer is removed with the clearinterval method

23727700
inherited	properties
you must not set the properties directly on the object if you want to inherited it s value from the prototype

23727727

23727772
udp	tcp
here are some factors that influence getting a successful connection either udp based or tcp for p2p

23727814
for-loop	loops
for-loop inside that while loops is to go through each snippet and call convert method on key and value of that snippet

23727817
rspec	capybara
when attempting to visit a page using capybara and rspec i get the following error

23727833
folder	directory
first you need to create an application in iis and point the virtual directory to your application folder c inetpub wwwroot services bookservice

23727834
alloca	malloc
there is a common function although i believe it is not a standard c function called alloca that is an alternative to malloc that allocates from the stack

23727834
free	alloca
with alloca the data is automatically free when the function returns and resets the stack

23727853
width	margin
you can add a width value but to centre it you have to also add margin 0 auto

23727869

strstr	strcmp
i can do that easily if i select all the user agents and depending on the exact_match i can perform strstr function or just strcmp

23728065
put	get
now when i try to extract to put information in this iframe i get something along the following error

23728084
min	max
whilst i thought that this would be a straight forward exercise i do not really understand why i do not obtain the result i wish for some reason the following data.table command only flags the overall min and max and not per id even though this is indicated

23728145
ember.js	backbone.js
compare this to ember.js and backbone.js which have custom classes that you have to export to import from json ndash

to show hide the div i ve decided to add remove the class hidden and use css display none

23728445
ddms	adt
for me updating the ddms from adt plugin did the trick

23728445
ddms	adt
before that for saving time i only updated adt plugin nothing else like android ddms traceview etc

23728455
width	height
your class will now have access to the variables framewidth and frameheight as width and height respectively

23728461
ddms	adt
for me updating the ddms from adt plugin did the trick

23728461
ddms	adt
before that for saving time i only updated adt plugin nothing else like android ddms traceview etc

23728465
width	height
you need to declare the board the class should be capital b object in the main class and define getters for width and height like this

23728500
cdr	cons
the algorithm is right here in wikipedia you just have to adapt it to only return bã zout coefficients the car part of the returned cons -cell will be x and the cdr will be y

23728518
debian	linux
i rent a server linux debian with 24gb ram with glassfish 3.1 running on it nothing else installed

23728538
width	height
if i m understanding you correctly you need to give the div element a percentage width and auto height

23728539
try-catch	exception-handling
you have unhandle exception-handling here try implement try-catch for it

23728542
ioexception	filewriter
constructing the filewriter is throwing an ioexception and because it is outside your try-catch block it isn t being caught

23728548
switching	screens
the thing is that when i start the game after i click play in the menu the song starts to play but the screens stays black and it won t switching to the game s screens

23728558
int	chars
i have written a code to pack two chars to an int

23728566
inherited	properties
viewa and viewb have different properties and inherited the id properties from the view class

23728575
post	put
i envisioned a possible race condition in which the original poster removes access to the post for a user just as the user post a reply in which he would be able to post a reply despite the poster disallowing him access so i put lock in share mode so that other sessions would be able to read but not modify it

23728601
gif	png
the system allows the user to upload photos which can be jpg gif or png

23728630
prng	random
this is an excellent method but the prng in random is not cryptographically secure

23728640
strdup	malloc
edit rather than using malloc you could use strdup so you don t have to worry about checking the input length

23728640
free	strdup
alternatively you could strdup each word that goes into the array and then free up the array elements when you re done

23728670
maven	pom.xml
then i changed the maven pom.xml file to the following and it worked

23728675
google-chrome	firefox
works fine on google-chrome and firefox

the second api call to get the post is never even made while the first call to get just the topic is made

23728720
versioning	upgrade
well it depends how you are processing the upgrade process and how well you have designed and planned in advanced for minor major versioning upgrade

23728720
versioning	upgrade	installation	upgrade
now i ve done this in the past the old school way...i don t think much has changed when i was doing desktop development...i had a web service running somewhere with two endpoints that exposed the latest versioning of the application and another one that exposed a packaged versioning of the latest application installer the application installed on the end-user s desktop would call this service every time the user starts the application if an upgrade was available the application would start a separate process the updater that would handle the versioning migration and installation

23728737
submit	submission
my end goal is to allow the user to fill out and submit the form therefore submission it to the mysql database sending an email to admin and the user with their selected elements and then populating their responses within their account dashboard area

23728797
post	get
get the other textbox values also and post like below

23728827
min	max
because i am trying to create a responsive website using min and max width using the media queries

23728879
put	get
put code in that method to get the graphics object g to draw your image

23728879
public	protected
note that the paintcomponent graphics g method should be declared protected not public

23728938
screens	tablet
for tablet screens col-sm- my menu structure should cover complete 12 grids

23728938
screens	tablet
screens resolution i.e higher than tablet i.e col-md and col-lg in bootstrap language should only cover 11 grid with offset of 1

23728938
screens	tablet
my all menu logo and brand logo and the text all should go responsive when i change my viewport to smaller screens upto tablet screens

23728938
screens	tablet
my all menu with the brand should stay in one line in all tablet screens and the screens having higher resolution than it

23728938
screens	tablet
for tablet screens my column mark up should be col-sm-12 no offset value

23728942
spaces	delimiter
i believe the spaces should be tab delimiter this is coming from an apiary api get request

23728976
inherited	properties
say i have in my viewmodel a properties like this my viewmodel inherited from bindablebase

23729040
folder	directory
i want to delete all folder and files inside which less than 7 days from today and there is one directory that i want it to skip

23729049
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work fine in google-chrome but encounters serious issues in firefox

23729079
mongodb	bson
mongodb stores the date isodate as an actual bson repraesentation actually a timestamp that the date type will be serialized into

23729079
serializable	deserialization
the mongodb driver for perl supports datetime and datetime tiny for serializable and deserialization

23729093
width	height
this solves the problem because imageview can define the exact width and height of the bitmap through layout_width and layout_height

23729095
min	max	range	min	range	max
pass the sliderconfig into the filter to find the current min and max set on the range slider

23729101
move	drag
so the mouse has to move acordingly to my finger touch and drag

23729135
min	max
function such as avg count max min sum stddev or variance must

23729161
client-side	server-side
for example html ui client-side script javascript client-side scripting css styling php server-side scripting sql backend

23729165

i need help googling also put me at no clue thus i ll post here for guidance and assist

23729213
freeglut	glew
i built the freeglut 2.8.1 and glew 1.10.0 and have them installed in my system

23729223
width	height
the resulting width and height of the window are

23729226
jdom	dom4j
an alternative is to use an api which already includes such utility methods like dom4j or jdom

23729291
int	chars
i m new at c and now i m trying to extract some digits from a file to a int but the problem is that although i can extract them from the file and pass them to a chars array i cannot convert them to a int i don t know why so here is the code

23729405
int	chars
nextint only reads the next int from the input stream and leaves any other chars on the stream

23729493
post	get
article_comments_path maps to the index action get and to create action post

23729519
for-loop	arrays
to go through all the elements of an arrays or a list interface implemented by arraylist it is better to use the enhanced for-loop

23729651
disk	ram
probably windows file cache is already speeding up your i o activity here so the ram disk isn t giving you an additional speedup

23729651
disk	ram
if you re doing nontrivial processing outside the i o you might not see significant if any speedup from the ram disk because the file cache would have time to do the actual physical i o during your other processing

23729651
fflush	gets
and since you say there s a maximum of 10 mb that gets written over and over again that s small enough that it could easily fit inside the file cache in the first place and your actual physical i o throughput is pretty small if you write a file and then overwrite its contents with new data before the file cache fflush it to disk the os never has to fflush that first set of data all the way to disk

23729651
disk	ram
your i o might already be mostly happening in memory due to the cache so switching to a ram disk won t help because physical i o isn t a bottleneck

23729651
disk	ram
a ram disk isn t necessarily going to be a big speedup

23729670
width	height
when i manually set my height and width it all gets cut off

23729685
for-loop	loops
instead of using a while loops it is easier to use a for-loop

23729695
put	get
if you change the attribute position as if you put time textview first and message textview second then time textview get space as it needed then remaining space given to the second textview so for this reason its working fine when you changing attribute positions

23729736
spaces	delimiter
although delimiter are recommended when the value contains spaces as per the font-family section in css 2.1 they are required only in rather anomalous cases when a font family name contains two consecutive spaces

23729826
multiplying	add
if yes then add one column with only column to check and compare the actual value and multiplying value

23729844
chown	chmod
still no luck with chmod or chown

23729874
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
while debugging with fiddler the trace shows that crossdomain.xml and clientaccesspolicy.xml not found in

23729910
min	max
you can only extract top min max element from priority queue

23729930
onchange	onblur
onblur or onchange event of textbox you validate this

23729944
width	height
in the code sample below getwidth and getheight refer to the width and height of the jpanel on which i m placing the text string

23729997
inherited	properties
uses string parsing to interpret the expression and it restricts your access to variables functions and objects to just those which are properties of the object or properties of any scope objects which happen to be available further up the prototypical inherited chain

23730002
width	height
note this width height will override session preset width height if different

23730026
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
basically i want my application to respond to screen rotations changing the screen orientation my project uses both uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

23730026
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
therefore i have followed the answer in here up to the point where it subclasses both uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller

23730034
16-bit	64bit
any char can be to the compiler various lengths depending on the compiler settings including 7 bits rare these days 8 bits what most people think it is 16-bit getting more common especially with unicode i have even come across machine compiler combinations that would store each char in a 64bit locations

23730124
post	get
then there s an input space for entering the username you want to edit this is an html form method post that verifies the information and if the username doesn t exist you get an error page

23730144
viewdidload	viewwillappear
move the assignment lines in viewdidload to viewwillappear

23730199
int	double
for the double to be aligned in the second element of a hypothetical array the first int and the entire struct must be aligned to the same strictness as double

23730251
int	chars
this is signed int overflow because 0x80 equals 128 and if char_bit is 8 as you say then signed chars only goes up to 127

23730275
int	double
sizeof unsigned int is 4 and double is 8 and thats why the output is 20 on my machine

23730307
folder	directory
use django-admin.py collectstatic or go to django contrib admin static and copy the admin folder which contains the static files and paste them into your project s static directory

23730343
for-loop	loops
you ll need to re-code loops to use a traditional index based for-loop

23730347
spaces	delimiter
you could just use csv reader with the delimiter set to spaces and then just loop it where len 4

23730361
google-chrome	firefox
i have a in my page and want to print it by landscape style in ie firefox google-chrome

23730413
express	node.js
if you want to implement a fallback do it in node.js for different files or with express for different requests

23730424
setinterval	settimeout
also a settimeout here is the general usage instead of setinterval since the function calls itself and hence every instance scheduling the next instance is sufficient

23730434
int	chars
java switch case will work only with primitives byte short chars and int enums from java 5 and string from java 7 data types only

23730434
int	chars
byte short chars and int primitive data types

23730446
int	chars
a switch works with the byte short chars and int primitive data

23730446
int	chars
primitive types chars byte short and int discussed in

23730561
rss	feed
i know it will be needing rss feed from different news website but i want to know the procedure of making the app means the blueprint of the app

23730583
for-loop	loops
each step has for loops for loops inside a for-loop

23730583
for-loop	loops
but the biggest one is below code which has many for loops inside for-loop

23730630
folder	directory
if you are using phonegap 3.4.0 then there is staging folder where you can find your www directory

23730630
src	attr
#elementid attr src images first.png

23730710
put	get
i want app1 only have put authority which means only put message to q1 or q2 and app2 only have get authority to only get message from q1 or q2

23730737
int	chars
it will only work for constant literal or final marked variables from primitive type byte short chars or int

23730737
int	chars
since java 5 it also allow constants variables of the respective wrapper classes of these primitives byte short chars and int and also support enum s and since java 7 it supports constant string variables

23730749
min	max
now i require first and third to start as min heaps and second as a max heap

23730749
min	max
i need to perform this cycle max - min and min - max an unknown number of times

23730749
min	max
this is preventing me from turning a min heap into a max heap

23730779
int	chars
count the number of each letter of the alphabet found in a chars array and store these counts in an int array

23730779
for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop to examine each character in the character arrays

23730779
int	chars
if the chars is a letter of the alphabet increment the int array in the position of the ascii value of the chars minus 65

23730794
post	get
hi i am trying achieve the text sharing on facebook i have created the app on facebook with the necessary informations after completing these procedures i implemented facebook share on my app whenever i am trying to post message on facebook using my account which i have been used to create the appid it has posted on facebook but it won t if i tried to post the message using some other facebook account the account gets logged in but it won t post the message on the wall.please any one help me to get out of this problem thanks in advance

23730834
min	max
3 with max priority and 1 with min priority

23730834
min	max
when i run this demo it doesn t give thread with min priority to execute as many times as to threads with max priority

23730863
addition	multiplication
you could just extract your sum function to sum the price for each row individually instead of just summing the quantity this should be ok mathematically due to the distributive property of multiplication over addition

23730909
versioning	upgrade
really i don t want to upgrade this system the newest versioning guessing it s time consuming as i m also using es-head and bigdesk

23730950
int	boolean
type mismatch cannot convert from int to boolean

23730975
getter	setter
it should just point to a list on the bean with getter and setter

23730978
int	boolean
in java this doesn t work since it has a boolean type that is not an int and an int cannot be directly converted into a boolean

23731002
int	boolean
the original version of c didn t have boolean so everyone used int instead

23731002
int	boolean
but java is stricter about what s a boolean and what s an int - you actually need to use a boolean expression such as to check whether the loop should continue

23731041
memcached	apc
i have configured varnish for my website and its working as site performance is excellent but does anybody know that there is any varnish monitoring tool to see what content are getting stored in varnish and what are hits misses something similar to memcached or apc monitoring tool

23731096
submit	submission
i am using jquery submit for submission this code

23731128
draggable	droppable
i want to be able to drag a draggable into a droppable

23731128
draggable	droppable
then when i drag in another draggable prevent the user from dropping it on the previously dropped draggable but still drop it on the droppable

23731128
draggable	droppable
i though the best approach to detecting if a draggable is over a dropped draggable is to make the draggable droppable too and set the accept parameter to false so it accepts nothing

23731184
google-chrome	firefox
your approach seems right it gives the right width in both cases the problem is that the svg component is rendered different in firefox and google-chrome in google-chrome use the 100 of available width and in firefox use the minimum width to display the content

23731209
post	get
i recently wrote a very simple app but when i tried to post it to google play i get the error

23731212
post	get
to get the raw post data use

23731217
gradle	android-library
if i insert the line apply plugin android-library and try to sync project with gradle files i get the error

23731231
viewdidload	viewwillappear
use the code below in any view controller viewdidload or viewwillappear method

23731238
spaces	delimiter
if you have your column values seperated by a delimiter like or . or spaces you can use a group by query like below

23731243
folder	directory
so far i ve come up with this below to loop through the folder but i m now stuck trying to convert the directory path into a variable containing the file name

23731255
for-loop	loops
decrement in for-loop although this sometimes yields a small improvement in code performance most programmers are used to for loops that increment

23731280
versioning	upgrade
as vim 7.4 has been released it s the easiest to upgrade to that versioning

23731293
post	get
so i m trying to get my value from a select tag in html i m working with the post method

23731301
sudo	passwd
i am at beginner level and i need to use sudo su - and passwd in one command line in script for two different users

23731301
sudo	passwd
and i am using command sudo su - user -c passwd

23731302
getter	setter
of-course you will have to take care of the basic oop concepts like data hiding keeping the fields private and exposing them properly public getter setter

23731340
sorting	filtering
the features will be the same filtering sorting

23731492
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

node-webkit	nwjs
the three viable options i have run across so far are nwjs formerly node-webkit brackets-shell and electron formerly atom-shell

23731538
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
instead of subclassing is worth to know that there are also delegate methods in uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller that make you handle rotations at runtime

23731559
width	height
how can i find the height width of each div so that they fit in circle with a little space between each other

23731559
width	height
the width and height of each circle are the same as its diameter which plus the little splace is equivalent to the length of the sides of the polygon formed by their positions

23731559
cos	sin
then use sin cos to compute the position on that side

23731595
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller ask their child view controllers which interface orientations they support

23731613
marionette	underscore.js
you re using marionette so you re using backbone and that implies that underscore.js is available

23731656
gulp-compass	gulp-ruby-sass	gulp-sass	gulp-compass	gulp-sass	gulp-ruby-sass
if you only have .sass files and no .scss you need to use gulp-ruby-sass instead of gulp-compass or gulp-sass

23731773
width	height
normalized view system which has the screen centre at 0 0 but height is relative to width depending on the screen ratio

23731786
access-token	jwt
you use the client id and one private key to create a signed jwt and construct an access-token request in the appropriate format

23731813
rsa	dsa
the ssh client allows you to selects a file from which the identity private key for rsa or dsa authentication is read

23731823
uiview	catransition
you can animate the transition by using uiview transition or catransition if you want to get fancy

23731873
super	self
super basetemporalfield self

23731963
tinyint	boolean
when i add the tables to the model all the columns with the type tinyint are mapped like boolean

i just used a model variable to show hide the dialog and removed the

23732049
uicollectionview	uitableview
a nsfetchedresultscontroller is made to wotk with uitableview s or uicollectionview s

23732067
put	get
you might also want to define a max-width or put a col-sm-8 col-sm-2-offset in there get them into your specific sized box or force your two rows but it hopefully it gets you started

23732101
client-side	server-side
you are trying to mix client-side processing with server-side processing

23732101
client-side	server-side
the bottom line is you can t mix server-side and client-side code in that way

23732106
post	get
the problem with your code was that in the last loop the j loop you get to j users.length - 1 before queries for others users were finished so the response is sent with the number of post queries finished until that moment

23732136
children	parent
parent a overflow auto has 2 children columns with a good sizing overflow to default is needed so menus that are too big continue to be visible and do not cause another scrollbar to appear except on the parent

23732136
children	parent
so if one of the children b have a bigger child c it will cause overflow on the parent a

23732210
width	height
the csv have 4 values price size width and height

laravel	yii
it turns out the autocomplete using laravel s form text works different than with yii s cjuiautocomplete widget

23732486
777	tmp
you need to create tmp folder make it grand 777 access and add tmp folder path it to file system configuration

23732487
hide	show
if you put your showing hiding logic or an event hook or a scope variable or an input parameter in your loading function i m leaving this for personal preference just do something when it hits zero and when it hits one - it will show hide the loading screen

23732545
width	height
i want to draw square on image not the rectangle when i perform mouse move operation to top left bottom right direction its height and width will be increase in same length

23741128
maven	pom.xml
for our example iâ ve put a dependency in this bundle pom.xml file that has nothing to do with our actual code it isnâ t needed but i put it there to show you how maven would behave if you had dependencies for this bundle others that java.lang that are already included in any java runtime environment

23741128
folder	directory
now download the felix osgi framework and copy all those jars plus the jar file in your bundleâ s target directory to the felix framework bundle folder

23741469
textarea	textbox
unless my visitors are using modern browsers with support for html 5 i cannot set a max length to textarea which means my query returns an error when the data within the textbox is too large

super	self
because you should not pass self as paramter to __init__ of super

23746377
free	malloc
however it was also sending the characters from my filename variable in the loadfunction function which to me is strange that the memory address was accessable to sendmessage when it was malloc ed free and set to null way before the function call to the dynamic sendmessage was called

23746771
free	malloc
the parent allocates storage for the arguments via malloc and the new thread is responsible for calling free

23746771

if you are trying to do a view in portrait view but basically show a landscape view portal that is not squished then i would suggest doing a layout where the preview is behind your other layouts

23748372
g++	gcc
i m using gcc g++ 4.8.1

23748411
margin	height
in my experience it s because the line height of the percentage and the line height of canvas are different and the percentage needs extra padding margin left

for-loop	loops
there s a php for-loop which i wrote inside the while loops to display 2 listings each time the while loops cycles instead of 1

23748803
cobertura	maven-surefire-plugin
the only way i was able to work around that was to instrument the byte code as part of my build by binding the cobertura instrument goal to the verify phase and also bind the default-test execution from maven-surefire-plugin to the verify phase so it doesn t get executed as part of the test phase on every cobertura goal execution

23748855
eloquent	revisionable
i created the package revisionable which in its first incarnation was a class that you extended from your model which itself extended laravels base eloquent class however over time there were plenty of requests to change this into a trait so people could use revisionable and be able to extend their own base class

23748867
post	put
now this is the funny part isn t executing anything at all i was thinking well just put the button inside the post however the page refresh itself and executes which i don t need then i was looking how to set a cookie for that pop div but i have a limited knowledge in ajax

23748884

23749504
initializer	class-method	std	ostream
if you may need to store any type but later during retrieval only need to perform certain operations on the value for example streaming the value to a std ostream adding it to another such value ... you can capture those operations as pointers to function template instantiations or by initializer a class template in which the operations are overrides of base class-method such that your container can store a pointer to the base class and dispatch using runtime polymorphism

23749517
google-chrome	firefox
the program utilizes around 4-5gb ram causing both firefox google-chrome and chromium to crash not responding aw snap

23749517

i have a form and i just want a simple jquery message box that displays all the users input before submission and confirming to submit

23749649
int	chars
you have initialised level with chars values 7 1 9 8 but your setlevel method is comparing them with the int values 7 1 9 8

23749684
children	parent
now an interesting property of this construction is that the parent is always at math.floor index 2 so the children are at and

23749684
int	double
or directly return int math.floor double index 2

23749822
integer	unsigned
i have different specializations of a template function for different unsigned integer types

23749895
actionlistener	changelistener
no you can t add an actionlistener or even a changelistener to a buttongroup but it s trivially easy to add actionlistener to jradiobuttons and if you create them in a for-loop as is often done then there s no need for duplicate code

23749908
integer	unsigned
18.2 6 the type size_t is an implementation-defined unsigned integer type that is large enough to contain the size in bytes of any object

23749908
unsigned	short	integer	unsigned
so it doesn t say explicitly whether the implementation-defined unsigned integer type will be one of unsigned short int long long long

23749908
integer	unsigned
the fact that 18.2 6 exists and specifies an implementation-defined unsigned integer type may be seen to override 18.2 2 s default of following c so any answer for c can t be trusted for c++

23749918
post	get
in story.js the get function executes however the post function does not

23749923
post	get
speaking specifically the http methods get and post always keep working in the same way the client submits a http request to the server then the server returns a response to the client and the application will try to ensure that this occurs the synchronizationcontext of asp.net was designed for this

23749926
post	get
you could perhaps read this post to get a few pointers on how to solve it

23749969

23756183
hide	show
this will be simple solution to hide or show the model view

23756188
google-chrome	firefox

23756397
pygtk	pycairo
but you have to eliminate whatever pycairo gtk or pygtk module which

23756427
vagrantfile	hosts
not sure if it s intended behavior or bug but setting forwarded_port in a vagrantfile with a docker provider does nothing on the hosts boot2docker machine

23756427
vagrantfile	hosts
unless i m missing something you have to either provide your own hosts machine with another vagrantfile opening the correct ports or modify the one provided by vagrant

23756427
vagrantfile	hosts
here s the base vagrantfile for the boot2docker hosts boot2docker vagrantfile

23756427

postgresql	mysql
main reason for that - browsers do not have real sockets to connect to databases like mongodb mysql postgresql and so on

23756719
decoder	encoder
neither decoder nor encoder knows time-stamps by their own

decoder	encoder
these timestamps could be taken from extractor from camera or generated by app but decoder encoder just passes through these time-stamps without changing them

23756777
build.gradle	gradlew
am not sure about your environment or tool setup just make sure that your jenkins build is configued to build using gradlew gradlew based build tool only they will parse build.gradle file and generate a manifest with proper fields or if u r using some other build tool update the androidmanifest with appropriate api level values

there is a maven project that i must rename so i will have to change it s artifactid property value in the pom.xml file

23757061
lambda	first-class-functions
maybe one day jvm will have first-class-functions so then invokedynamic can be changed to use them instead of generating a class for every lambda thus improving performance. what retrolambda does is that it processes all those invokedynamic instructions and replaces them with anonymous classes

23757077

i use the print to file checkbox in the print pop-up dialog

if it uses malloc to allocate memory it must use free to deallocate it and in case of operator new delete is required

23757167
free	malloc
if we have two std vector which both uses magicallocator but with different states meaning that one uses malloc and the other operator new and we don t swap the allocators upon a.swap b the allocator won t match the memory allocated for the elements in the two vectors after the swap - which in terms means that the wrong free delete might be called upon deallocation

by the way i ve tried keeping it as a single state and doing an ng-switch in the person.html and using ng-include to include the template which explicitly sets the controller.

23757970

for easier use you can abstract the injection in container or at least has one super class that recieves the injection

23758005
inherited	subclassing
mens has one method called toon which ofc is inherited by its subclassing

23758005
inherited	subclassing

if you have common functionalities between the two classes go for extends a base class else stick with implements an interface

23758289
button	checkbox
you have single radio button you probably want to use checkbox instead

23758290
setcontentview	findviewbyid
use setcontentview first and then findviewbyid

23758311
inherited	properties
uitextview inherited from uiscrollview so you can set the textview s frame to bounds of the superview but adjust the contentsize properties to stringsize

23758313
draggable	droppable
perhaps something internal to the draggable and droppable interactions that i missed

23758353

23758629
x86	64bit

post	put
but since you are using post and put - this would work

23758783
width	font-size
...which means that the font-size will be 4 of the viewport width

typedef	struct
i have defined two different typedef struct datatype_2d_1 and datatype_2d_2 both of them have basically two double numbers as members but they are differently defined

23758831
post	get
although it won t fix the problem you form submission method should be post instead of get

23758872
folder	directory
this is actually a solution that was build from answers to these questions check if path is a file or directory copy entire content of a directory and create file if target folder does not exist

23758878
for-loop	loops
each foreach loops creates an enumerator object so using a regular for-loop might speed it up a little but this might be a very minor improvement

reflection.emit has a number of classes that are used to build types at run time and adding properties configering their getter and setter and building methods and event handlers all at run time which is really powerfull when it comes to metaprogramming

23759049
post	get
first in order to get the token you need to send a http post request to api.cloudcontrol.com token using basic authentication using the email and password of your cloudcontrol account

23759049
post	put
furthermore you might also need to set up some other headers for put or post requests like

23759056
min	max	minimum	max
i have the repeating structure of xml and i want to use the max and min function present in the xslt 2.0 to fetch the maximum and minimum dates

23759127
post	get
if the form action is same page that is the php codes for validation and all are on the same page you can echo the post get values to corresponding fields except passwords

23759127
post	get
otherwise store post get values on session variables or as cookie and then echo these values as field values for corresponding fields except passwords

23759158
webclient	httpwebrequest
i even found something like webclient uses httpwebrequest under the covers

23759169

post	get
a web url is exposed and we want to get and post requests to it in order to receive

23759280
firefox	safari
note firefox and safari close the notifications automatically after a few moments 4 seconds

23759282
post	get
i always thought that you couldn t use post and get at the same time but according to this and this answers it should be possible

23759305
post	get
you then need to change to since your form is set to post or change your form to submit via get

23759313
treemap	treeset
generally comparator is used if you dont own the class but you have to use it a treeset or treemap because comparator can be passed as a parameter in the conctructor of treeset or treemap

23759313
comparator	comparable
you can see how to use comparator and comparable in

23759336
post	get
also sometimes it would be good to make use of _request which contains data from both get and post so you have proper data from request everytime

23759343
qstandarditem	qtreeview
i am using model view concept in my qt program where delegates are used to edit qstandarditem s in the qtreeview

23759343
qcombobox	qitemdelegate
for the qcombobox delegate i re-implemented the following functions of qitemdelegate

23759343
qcombobox	qstandarditem
this is done by storing the qcombobox s selection index into the data of the qstandarditem

23759343
qcombobox	qstandarditem
when i selected an item from the qcombobox the combo will be closed the signal gets emitted the model updates all the relevant qstandarditem text

23759362
min	max
this is because a want to make the min and max prices be real from the database table with product prices

23759362
range	minimum
so as we see here the only array key that looks like what i need is #default_value but it s not actually the one it doesn t make any visible changes to the form and i also tried #value key as on the code but it sets default slider range values just moving the knobs not making minimum and maximum values

23759362
min	max
so the question is how to do it and the second question is that perhaps there is any setting in the module to set that min and max values automatically i coudn t manage to find anything in the settings

23759368
post	get
in http you can t use get and post at the same time but you can make a post request which has a query string as part of the url

23759368
post	put
since the form is post the data from the inputs will be put into the body and not the query string so will appear in not

23759395
post	get
also use _post or you can even use _request you can use _request for both get and post variables

23759413
post	get
i also moddified the httphandler post method so i can get the code and return it so now it looks like this

23759419

my rss feed observatorulph.ro rss.php shows all articles in the database even if there are articles programmed to be published on a future date time

23759422
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu the location was changed to

at now drag event fires on every mouse move but i need to trigger this event only when i drag my element on grid option grid 100 100

23759660
avassetimagegenerator	avplayerlayer
i tried different apis like renderincontext and drawviewhierarchyinrect and i can get all the uiscrollview contents as image but not including the avplayerlayer .i can t also use avassetimagegenerator as it returns a video frame without current user edits

the ini file keys-at-same-level order information is lost in the file objects representation so unless you open the config file as a text file and load a list of key orders you won t be able to reproduce it

23759723
post	get
as patrick stated in his answer a get can be applied too instead of post this will take all the values and literally places them inside the url

23759723
post	get
and hit the submit button it goes directly to something.php wheter it s post or get

23759726
queue	fifo
i understand that the messaging works on a fifo basis and that before msmq on vista that a message failing would block other messages hence the retry message queue

think of a famo.us view as a grouping of other famo.us renderables surfaces you could however pass a variable to your settingsview constructor which is then used to set the width and height value of the surface it contains

23764569
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome give priority to the download attribute but firefox gives priority to the http header content-disposition

23764587
google-chrome	firefox
i m developing with asp mvc jquery ajax with json and everything seems to work fine with firefox and google-chrome

23764587
post	get
the get request with ajax was solved already but the post request is having problems with internet explorer

23764587
google-chrome	firefox
but for some reason the post request works fine in firefox and google-chrome

23764587
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox and google-chrome the json.stringify works fine and send that string to the controller and the model binding detects every parameter sent

23764587
google-chrome	firefox
the products class is a view model of two other models as the code shows but that s not the problem because on firefox and google-chrome every parameter from json is populated with mvc

23764642
put	get
get 4 locations of all corners of the current map and put it together in list of point in the bound

23764676
for-loop	arrays
but judging from the fact that both p and v arrays got the last value it looks like that you are running update method in a callback in the for-loop so when the update method is run the key is already changed to the last key

23764696
hide	show
include all of the necessary conditions and show hide changes in that method

23764730
button	checkbox
the checkbox inputs aren t being replaced with button elements the labels are only styled so that they appear to be button

armadillo	lapack
i have already builded a successful solution in my own computer with visual studio 2013 with armadillo and lapack blas

23764761
armadillo	lapack
with this method i could run a console application with armadillo but without the use of lapack blas uncommenting the respective line in config.hpp

23764779
folder	directory
i deleted the web application from the deployment directory in o.j2ee drs folder

23764782
folder	directory
copy the appropriate files to the ext folder within your php directory

23764847

i have a django view login that allows me to get a session for a user using post data from an android app

23764907
width	height
first impression is that this image will match_parent in both height width fill the screen

23764918
setinterval	clearinterval
or you can use setinterval which starts a repeated timer and clearinterval which stops it

23764943
width	height
give your second div a child div to wrap the content that has the same height but a bigger width

23764963
children	parent
for example in each of the label scenarios below the owning form is known by either looking at the children or the parent elements

23764987
width	height
the reason for this is that by default when test reached it s width it will word wrap whereas within the y-axis it will just increase the height of the container if allowed

23764988
google-chrome	firefox
if the executable for firefox or google-chrome etc is in your path you can get away with

23764998
interpolation	splines
you could use splines interpolation

23765040
filtering	grouping
all filtering and grouping by are working fine except the 3 based on user.id ex

23765048
post	get
if you post some of your code you may get a more thorough answer

23765075
versioning	upgrade
knowing why you can t upgrade to either versioning will make it easier to make other suggestions - if you are relying on behavior that was fixed as part of another bug it might make it contradictory for you to want bugfixes but not all bug fixes

23765100
portrait	landscape
but when i display it when the ipad is already in landscape the size of the view is portrait and positioned off to the left

23765106
mocha	sinon
in order to test i m using rewire sinon and mocha

23765107
freebsd	linux
i was looking through some recent additions to the linux kernel which added code to support 1mb pages for armv6 and armv7 freebsd also has support built-in since 2013 but it is also limited to armv6 and armv7

23765186
for-loop	arrays
when i treat arr as a normal arrays the for-loop is never executed

23765208
versioning	upgrade
if you want you can wrap them in an #ifdef so that if you ever upgrade to an sdk versioning that has them natively the native macros will be used otherwise the compiler will keep using your manual ones

23765216
put	get
this means that if you get an http 200 ok for your put you can read the object right away

23765239
put	get
because each get or put operation invokes a separate remote

23765263
build.gradle	gradlew
after updating your build.gradle file you should sync project with gradlew files which is in the toolbar as not doing it might result in errors and things not working correctly

23765281
portrait	landscape
in both case landscape and portrait

23765297
arduino	teensy
if you move up to the arduino due the arduino zero or the teensy 3.x â all of which are arm based â then you can look into espruino which is a version of javascript for arm but you will still have to port it to the arduino hardware

23765309
width	margin
the container div takes up 100 width even if it doesn t require it all so i can t get it centered with margin 0 auto

23765339
getter	setter
these properties will then be available to access via getter and setter methods which are created automatically for you as of xcode 4.4 i believe

23765361
post	get
i would like to get the first post of each user from a group of users

23765384
debian	linux
if you use debian or a derived gnu linux distribution you can use update alternatives to set what is currently being run when you type java

23765411
width	margin
if #contentbox doesn t have a fixed width you can add margin 0 auto to a.content which do have it

23765441
width	margin
you need fix width for margin to get worked

23765463
pentaho	olap
i created my cube olap in psw and i have published in into pentaho ce 5.0 successfully

23765574
int	chars
when your program tries to read a chars after the last available chars the file i o system returns a special value eof which is outside the range of chars it is for that reason that chars reading routines such as getchar return an int instead of a chars

23765622
translation	localization
basically i d like translation to do the language resolution and then get out of the way and return the map of localization for my options

23765632
for-loop	arrays
i created a for-loop to iterate over the results but not sure how to store them back into an arrays

23765717
express	node.js
i am using node.js express and jade to output the category and type

23765721
client-side	server-side
think like this all apps script code you write runs on a google server server-side but the interface is obviously shown on your computer client-side

23765721
client-side	server-side
the apps script environment has a client-side script that we do not have access or control of that receives the information on how to build the interface you defined in your code server-side

23765721
client-side	server-side
for very simple situations like disabling or setting the text on a button or label there s a clienthandler that can perform basic operations on directly the client-side without requiring a network trip to the server-side to run your custom code

23765756
disk	ram
depending on the amount of ram installed on your server you also may end up paging to the hard disk at times which will really kill application performance

23765797
google-chrome	firefox
and now firefox and google-chrome both provide the same response to the tr.width

23765806

.htaccess	httpd.conf
but no matter what i change to my .htaccess or my httpd.conf my files are not deflated

23765843
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i ve verified that the ifmodule condition is indeed firing whether i put it in the proper .htaccess or the httpd.conf

23765871
fgets	fread
alternatively instead of using fread you could use fgets to read each line one by one and replace the foreach loop with something like

23765984
folder	directory
choose the server you are using localhost in my case and explicitly setup the directory mapping in the symfony project folder

23766010
httpresponse	request	httprequest	httpresponse
httpcontext context httprequest request httpresponse response

23766076
tilemill	mapnik
your best option would be to export mapnik xml from tilemill modify it to support epsg 4326 and then serve the tiles from something like tilestache

23766103
express	node.js
i m using node.js bootstrap 3 and express

23766187

23766298
google-chrome	firefox
i got it working in google-chrome v34 and ie v10 but firefox v29 has all the css animations running on the same timeline so new divs start mid animation

23766336
ubuntu	linux
i am using ubuntu linux libre office and mysql workbench

23766351
hide	show
when the user touches a cell another cell should hide show

23766351
hide	show
as it is now i can show and hide the cell at the row but it is without animation which isn t acceptable

23766364
post	get
as another solution you can change ajax call to be post request and get data in your controller from this- request- data

23766447
put	get
whilst i m getting the results see the var_dump below i can t figure out how to put a loop in to get the names as there are many embedded arrays and everything i try either returns an error or array

23766468
folder	directory
i have a image slideshow project for which the user is expected to choose an images folder which the form takes in a picturebox and slideshows the project runs and allows me to select an images folder after which it then throws an argumentexception meant to be thrown if the directory does not exist

23766482
getter	setter
you could create a bean of your data with all the getter and setter and apply validation on your bean

23766482
getter	setter
to pass arrays you need getter and setter like this one

23766497
google-chrome	firefox
i have not found any pattern with browsers it has happened on google-chrome ie firefox

23766502

this is a com object which does not behave like most vb vba vbscript collections

23766508
inherited	subclassing
to address the issue of subclassing standard library classes while overriding methods and wanting the overridden method s documentation comment members can be commented with the inherited documentation tag

23766523
pickle	dill
if you use dill instead of pickle dill can correctly identify the class definition and correctly associate the class instance with itâ hence an instance can be pickled without issue

23766523
pickle	dill
this works in dill because dill can pickle the class source instead of needing to pickle the class by name reference as pickle does

23766541
for-loop	arrays
but it appears that the combobox1.items.add takes object so i was wondering if there was a way to make each string in the arrays into an object with a for-loop

23766545
width	height
i tried adding width 100 and height 450px to the code as was suggested elsewhere but that didn t change anything either

23766552
width	height
i guess i can prepopulate the coordinates of each numbered box and the width and height of each box in a javascript array and then based on the select list i can dynamically change the corresponding css elements for the box div

23766616
width	height
add constraints for the width and height of the document view

23766616
width	height
add constraints to every child of the document view so that document view s width and height can be calculated

23766631
gruntjs	grunt-contrib-jshint	jslint	grunt-contrib-jshint
it turns out i was using gruntjs s grunt-contrib-jshint at an older version before version 2.5.0 where jslint allows multiple indentation

23766631
gruntjs	package.json	gruntjs	grunt-contrib-jshint
changing the package.json i had for gruntjs to grunt-contrib-jshint 0.10.0 fixed this problem

23766792
width	height
using f12 tools i can see the element and the top left height and width properties are properly set

23766798
min	max
next step is to summarize everything into lets say executioninfoaggregation using linq extensions such as average min max count for various interesting data

23766827
getter	setter
i have readed much about getter and setter in php

23766827
getter	setter
setter and getter takes 3 times more time

23766865
int	chars
if pos is less then the length of line it means there s an invalid chars in there somewhere that doesn t belong in an int

23766894
width	height
visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero

23766894
width	height
an empty inline-block will have a height and width of 0 the width is based on the contained elements

23766900
put	get
you can put the essential parts of this code into a method so you get something like this

23766920
width	height
create a button inside of the parent set the width and height as you see fit set layout alignparent to bottom and right

23766920
width	height
create an edittext set the height to the same as the button set the width to match_parent set the layout alignparent to bottom set layout aligncomponent to right left

23766920
width	height
set height and width to match_parent set layout aligncomponent to bottom top

23766944
jobs	cron
also i don t know if you are familiar with it and it may be overkill for your situation but the whenever gem provides a nice dsl for working with cron jobs

23767090
ng-app	ng-controller
you re using ng-app instead of ng-controller

23767100
openshift	wercker
i m using the wercker continuous integration delivery platform to test and deploy a bitbucket repository on a node.js openshift server

23767100
wercker	environments
wercker loads in the bitbucket repository builds it tests it in the node.js environments and passes it without any issue

23767100
openshift	wercker
wercker also indicates that the deployment passes without errors as does openshift

23767100
openshift	wercker
neither wercker or openshift indicate that there is a problem but for some reason i m simply unable to access that domain without error

23767148

23767152
mouseover	mouseout
i need to make those texts bold larger on a mouseover event and return to normal on mouseout

23767176
jobs	cron
or one cron job which spawns taskqueued jobs for all the other urls

23767182
min	max
setting the form min and max size settings to the current size was a good work around for me

23767223
superclass	subclassing
it looks like you re basically replicating the behavior of your superclass s constructor in the subclassing s constructor

23767223
superclass	subclassing
what you must do is call the superclass s constructor from the subclassing s constructor

23767233
post	get
i m trying to post an entity address with a manytoone instead of onetoone as in example relationship to person as explained in embedded entity references in complex object graphs but i get a jackson error

23767255
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
now viewwillappear viewdidappear will be called whenever a controller is pushed popped from the stack

23767265
installation	upgrade
one of the reasons why this happens is because the action removeexistingproducts is being executed after the installation package performed the upgrade

23767293
terminate	timeout
block the calling thread until the process whose join method is called terminate or until the optional timeout occurs

23767393

is that they use a backgrounding which is the same as the springboard backgrounding

23767418
springboard	backgrounding
onces the springboard backgrounding is changed

23767423
inherited	properties
you should either test for the class type of the object returned by or have both objects inherited from an class that implements the common methods properties you need

23767440
short	base
i m doing this exact thing in an html5 app but we also have multiple dynamic slugs in our angular router so our server is configured for scenarios that fall short of a valid route and scenarios that deep link past the base route of our html5 app

23767509
inherited	subclassing
setupemail class is inherited from activity it s a subclassing of context itself

i tried doing a nested for-loop inside a while loops with this method the y arrays works but not the x arrays i sort of understand why its not working but i dont know how to fix it

23767774
cos	sin
one approach could work with the formula for a circle + -râ² xâ²+yâ² with r being the radius but i think a approach with cos and sin would be easier

23767774
cos	sin
i would then take that input and add 90â to it so that you can start to the left of your ship important for cos and sin to work

23767793
apple-touch-icon	favicon
i have no idea how to get only these items favicon icon apple-touch-icon and title of a website

i have a layout that contains inside it imageview and textview this use this layout like a button

23767877
google-chrome	firefox
but in firefox and google-chrome it doesn t it shows this instead

23767944
getter	setter
make x and y accessible only through setter and getter

23767962
range	minimum
because the first result also has a hyperlink the only difference between the two is that the first result has a minimum and separator markup element while the second does not my target link will always have a single price and not a range

23767973
switching	screens
also when i switching to fullscreen the console prints info starting display 1440x900 which is the correct screens size of my display

23767999
ivar	subclassing
for me it is impossible to use the default protected ivar from the class extension in the subclassing like said the the accepted answer when the class extension is in the .m file

23768021
width	margin
make the spans inline block to hold their width with a margin fix to keep them on the same line

23768046
onclick	onfocus
also the onfocus event would be more appropriate than onclick because it handles other scenarios such as pressing the tab key to change the active input

23768113
bash	tcsh
i used to write csh scripts myself but i ve found that sh and bash are much better for programming though tcsh still has a few advantages for interactive use.

23768277
google-chrome	firefox
you can even hack a js-validation with the build in tools in google-chrome or firefox will easily get around your validation

23768277
onchange	onblur
you might check the js onchange triggered each time the value changes or onblur field lost focus so you can assume that the user has finished to type in his values attribute

23768296
width	margin
since .container-fluid fills up 100 of the screen width the extra margin space causes overflow issues

23768328
maven	pom.xml
i use maven and in the pom.xml i had a section

23768410
google-chrome	firefox
it works just fine except with select tags in ie 10 and 11 google-chrome and firefox work fine every time i click on the carat to drop the drop-down the select loses focus and triggers the onblur handler which then hides the edit control thus preventing me from editing a value

23768423
getter	setter
and inside your bean add a boolean value with getter and setter

23768771
uipangesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer
the uiswipegesturerecognizer has no properties for customizing the speed of a swipe and the uipangesturerecognizer has a velocity property but no way to set a required velocity so i set up a custom gesture recognizer based on this tutorial

23768775
jndi	jta
when deploying on application servers you should benefit from their own jta data sources and transaction manager support so locating the jtadatasource through jndi should be your first option

23768797
int	chars
if you happened to enter a floating-point literal while reading into an int the stream will still parse as many chars as it can as long as those chars can be used in the data type to which you are extracting

so i have to build a simple compiler for a simple language i used haskell s alex and happy to build the parser and it is printing the right ast s already so next step i haveto do is to translate that data structure to another one that represents the program in three address code

23769094
fadein	fadeout
finally i would like to remove the class for the first animation fadeout and add another class fadein

23769152
portrait	landscape
if i set a view deck controller as the appdelegate window s root controller when the app starts in landscape orientation on an ipad the center view is displayed in it s portrait orientation size and not resized to landscape

23769157
min	max
when a filed is empty i dont want to evaluate its min and max constraint

23769167
equals	compareto
a treeset breaks the set contract by using compareto instead of equals to determine object equality

23769203
build.gradle	gradlew
if i were in your shoes i would be looking at gradlew s ide integration hooks and drive the build process from your java code using that plus a suitable build.gradle and related files

23769203
ant	maven
otherwise what you are proposing is to not use any of the existing build automation options for android gradle ant maven plus the eclipse build process stuff but instead build another one

23769213
post	get
if you need directly get some request parameter you can use for post and for get

23769274
sin	sqrt	cos	sqrt	cos	sin
the problem is that you have to compute slow functions like cos sin sqrt

23769274
cos	sin
instead you can obtain considerable speed gain and reasonable accuracy for small angles which is the case if the time step of your simulation is reasonable small by approximating sin and cos by taylor expansion expressed just using norm 2 instead of norm

23769334
children	parent
parent are rendered before their children and siblings are rendered from eldest to youngest

23769343
width	margin
play with numbers but i d suggest a width of 31 and margin 1 or possibly width of 32 and margin .5

23769351
udp	tcp
2 parse proc net tcp and tcp6 udp udp6 unix if you care

23769355
sorting	filtering
i would separate mandatory filtering with and optional ones with - and let the backend do the dirty sorting

23769389
getter	setter
i added the recipient_ids getter and setter in addition to the association getter and setter that i had before

23769442
min	max
another option is to replace 0 values with max value then keep the same code to get min by row

23769467
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i m trying to accomplish this by using a plain uinavigationcontroller that uses a custom uinavigationbar subclass like so

23769467
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
uinavigationbar -pushnavigationitem never called when new controller is pushed onto uinavigationcontroller stack

23769473
onclick	onchange	post	get
i have read some post and it looks like an onclick won t work in the option list on a mobile device but i can t seem to get onchange to work either which a few people have suggested

23769487
put	get
you need to put your loops into the run method of an extended class mythread and creates 4 mythread instances and get them started

23769556
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it s roughly 4x faster and 30x in firefox and i can even make a custom prototype apply2 that does in most cases run 2x as fast as apply the idea taken from angular

23769574
width	height
alternatively you could use the display width as basis for the height and the radius calculation

23769587
width	height
a better method is to restrict the width and height of the view volume in the projection matrix.

23769589
n-gram	words
this pattern will match exactly the specified n-gram and invert true will return the complement of the matches all the words that did not match the specified n-gram

23769653
inherited	properties
todolistmodel inherited from list with properties todolist that return the underlying data

23769654
for-loop	arrays
i made a for-loop that would iterate through each string in the arrays and got the value from it

23769673
implements	extends
the collection construction means a collection of objects who s classes extends the wordfilter class or implements the wordfilter interface in case wordfilter is an interface

23769757
maven	pom.xml
if using maven these are the dependencies you need in your pom.xml

23769827
margin	height
you are just setting the margin top to 2 which is a percentage of the page height

23769834
public	protected
the paintcomponent method should also be protected not public and should have an override annotation above it

23769834
for-loop	loops
i was wrong about the for-loop business -- keep your for loops where they are

23769873
for-loop	arrays
the arrays then goes through a for-loop to display a table

23769889
fadein	fadeout
fadein fadeout sets the elements to display none after outfading

23769889
fadein	hide
a workaround would be to hide the element before fadein but more propper way is to set display none initially in css

23769963
for-loop	loops
create an iife in your loops to save the value of i for each iteration of your for-loop

23769969
post	get
i haven t been able to figure out how to manage simple http post requests and get their body

23769973
mouseleave	mouseenter
i have some issues with mouseenter mouseleave function

23769990
button	checkbox
it works when user clicks on browser close button but it doesn t work when checkbox clicked

23769992
subclass	abstract-class
further information you might need to know is that measurementtype is an abstract-class that instantiates a subclass based on a string that is passed to it so it definitely creates a subclass and intialises everything

23770013
post	get
i ve looked through many of the related post google results and attempted to implement and adapt their solution for listviews to expandedlistviews but i have not been able to get any of them working

23770064
try-catch	exception-handling
catch block cannot catch any exception-handling outside of block 1 so yes you have to make one more try-catch

23770071
button	checkbox
i want to enclose the pair of checkbox and the radio button here

23770169
width	margin
set a non-100 width on .main-menu and then add margin 0 auto

23770203
button	checkbox
take a look at how to write an action listeners and how to use button checkbox and radio button for more details

23770290
put	get
you put the audio you want to play in a html5 element and get the basic user interface for audio playback

23770306

23770349
qgridlayout	qwidget
i have a qgridlayout with 3 3 qwidget

23770349
qvboxlayout	qwidget
in each qwidget i have a qvboxlayout

23770378
pull	push
git push gave me a message saying i needed a git pull so i did this

23770379
google-chrome	firefox
looking at it in detail a fix would be to change the word-spacing for google-chrome only to -2px this also fixes firefox for me but it already works for you of course

23770379
google-chrome	firefox
though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in google-chrome which is worse than extra space in firefox ie

23770391
width	margin
as long as you set the left margin of the linearlayout to compensate for the width of your image assuming the image width stays the same this should work no matter what the size of the screen is

23770392
versioning	upgrade
vob feature levels should be raised only after all client hosts have been upgrade to the corresponding clearcase versioning

23770407
google-chrome	firefox
provide explicit expiration times but does not provide specific algorithms. the implication is that the cache provider firefox internet explorer google-chrome has discretion

23770435
voip	sip
i m very new to voip sip and all of that so i feel like i m missing something simple

23770458
put	get
put another way when you do auth check and auth user those seemingly static calls get replaced with actual object instances from within the ioc container so auth check becomes with being derived from within the container

23770472
min	max
i m having a hard time figuring out the query combining min and max

23770491
stdout	stderr
you should use the communicate to wait for the process to finish and get the stdout and stderr handlers

23770491
stdout	stderr
another possibility is that it s printing out to stderr instead of stdout

23770492
nsjsonserialization	nsurlsession
use nsurlsession and nsjsonserialization to retrieve and parse your json then use github s mantle framework for mapping that json to your objc classes

23770500
put	get
i ve tried to put this code which was found here into my class code but i couldn t get it to work

23770543
filtering	grouping
the outer query only orders the filtering and grouping results

23770563
dictionary	map	nsjsonserialization	nsurlsession
use the built-in nsurlsession and nsjsonserialization and then use github s mantle framework to map the json dictionary to your custom objc objects

23770604
google-chrome	firefox
this is the behavior for both google-chrome and firefox as of now

23770729
getdate	dateadd
have to use dateadd day -20 getdate to get 2014-05-01

23770737
getter	setter
these wonâ t be directly accessible from the controller but we will eventually set up some getter setter methods on â serviceâ to be able to alter these â privateâ variables when needed

23770772
folder	directory
maybe you have your code and test files in the same directory or maybe your spec folder is named something else

23770806
width	height
i have no idea what i m doing wrong here as per every webpage this is what should handle the width and height correctly

23770811
move	drag
for example double tap to zoom in to some set zoom value then drag around within the cameraview to move the preview to the bounds of the entire data being captured by the camera that is outside of the preview after zooming

23770814
rsa	3des
i used rsa and 3des for this

23770815
put	get
this is mainly because other people will be using and changing this code and it may get confusing if they have to always put the first to be displayed last on the variable list and update the html as well

23770817
hash	md5
one is a list of md5 and sha1 hash from files from a computer i have lista

23770817
hash	md5
the other is a list of md5 and sha1 hash i have downloaded form nsrl listb

23770817
hash	md5
its a compilation of md5 and sha1 hash from files included in many different applications

23770821
put	get
note that changing the select columns in the top line was just for aesthetics you can put them in any order and will get the same data but this will be the easiest to read

23770832
width	margin
as others have said block elements can be centered by using a width and a margin 0 auto

23770832
width	margin
so the above piece of code sets a width on the #cssmenu element and the css applies a margin 0 auto centering it

23770843
google-chrome	firefox
all selections work perfectly fine with firefox driver google-chrome driver and even html unit driver

23770866
equals	gethashcode
make sure it implements gethashcode and equals correctly

23770870
innodb	myisam
further a fulltext index is only available in myisam not the innodb transactional engine so if you ever want to migrate the table this would be a barrier to that

23770872
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
the rootviewcontroller would be a uinavigationcontroller subclass that hides its uinavigationbar and has the correct left and right navigation buttons in its navigation item

23770872
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
your actual view controllers would push and pop on the child uinavigationcontroller that has no uinavigationbar

23770878
for-loop	loops
replace your foreach loops with for-loop like below

23770889
min	max
something like this ought to do i think to find the min of the max for each customer

23770925
ng-show	ng-hide
alternatively you can use combination of ng-show and ng-hide

23770956
for-loop	loops
loops can be simplified to a simple for-loop

23770968
ada	pascal
this type of issue arises in a number of languages that permit nested function definitions including ada and pascal

23770975
stdout	stderr
although it prints to the screen i am not sure how i can verify that it is actually printing to stdout vs stderr

23770998
put	get
now if i leave the js in index.php but put the form on ajax_form.php i get a problem

23771022
cpu	processors
system model precision m4700 processors intel r core tm i7-3740qm cpu 2.70ghz 2701 mhz 4 core s 8 logical processors s installed physical memory ram 16.0 gb os name microsoft windows 7 enterprise version 6.1.7601 service pack 1 build 7601

23771091
move	drag
i made a gui application but i am stuck with a workaround algorithm to drag move ui element relatively to another surface screen canvas etc.

23771091
move	drag
the trouble with this algorithm is that the mouse cursor position is definitely fixed relatively to the element and if i try to move drag the element clicking in another position part of the element the whole element move so that the mouse cursor is positioned at the initial position which is not the behaviour i want i want it to have the behaviour we mostly know like when we move an icon on desktop or a window on the screen etc.

23771104
versioning	upgrade
the documentation defines the privileges required for a user that can create the tables at install time upgrade the tables for a new worklight versioning and use them at runtime

23771120
width	height
this only happens when using a height or width smaller than 113

23771126
post	get
file uploads must be and you can t mix get and post like you re doing

23771184
int	boolean
the arguments you pass to perform_async must be composed of simple json datatypes string int float boolean null array and hash

23771186
implements	extends
bar extends foo and overrides a method that foo implements

23771226
width	margin
you can specify a width for the content div and then center it using margin 0 auto

23771259
superclass	subclassing
the superclass constructor must finish successfully before the rest of the subclassing constructor begins

23771259
superclass	subclassing
only then will subclassing variables be initialized so during the superclass constructor a in bar is still null

23771259
superclass	subclassing
this curious situation arises because a method called by a superclass constructor is overridden in the subclassing so a subclassing method is called before the subclassing is itself initialized

23771259
superclass	subclassing
the best thing to do here is not to have the superclass constructor call a method that gets overridden in a subclassing

23771272
superclass	subclassing
the constructor for the superclass must complete before anything is done in the subclassing constructor

23771305
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome i don t see this bug in firefox when i type in one of the text fields or select something from a select list the fields remain blank

23771381
int	boolean
now i need to use json_encode and i want the id to be int and pass boolean but they get string types after json_encode

23771433
factors	matrix
to achieve zoom effects let s say by factors f just multiply the diagonal matrix by this factors only for the two first row

23771458
implements	extends
use an empty or nearly empty interface or abstract class where the regular space and special space inherit from an abstract space class and both the space class and the border class implements the interface or extends the parent abstract class

23771474
int	boolean
you could loop through the array casting each value with the key of pass to a boolean and each id to an int like so

23771516
put	get
to get started i put together a skeleton for the mass-request module

23771596
xrange	enumerate
you should also use for x line in enumerate lines instead of for x in xrange 0 len lines

23771602
children	parent
no requirement to handle edge cases like parent with no children or badly formatted list structures assume data is correct format

23771602
children	parent
number of parent and number of children total and per parent are unknown

23771602
children	parent
number of children can differ between parent

23771668
macbook	bootcamp
ok so i m having trouble installing my android sdk on my macbook pro 2012 64bit running bootcamp

23771688
post	get
i know i have some kind of context problem and found several other post discussing the topic but couldn t find the information i needed to get my code working

23771691
onresume	onpause
you need to create a broadcastreceiver in your activity be sure to register it in onresume and unregister it in onpause and notify it via a broadcast providing an intent

23771692
width	height
tableview s height toolbar width

23771725
children	parent
you re wanting to prefix the children with their parent s name

23771783
post	get
zillaofthegods here s my solution i d use only 1 query to get all the post i want to display and then use php to do the heavy lifting

23771813
folder	directory
i re-downloaded again and put it into a different directory path another folder and it works

23771847
width	height
this only started doing it when i changed the width and height in the copy method to copy that of the viewports width and height which is what it needs to be

23771847
width	height
it didnt do this when it was set for the layers width and height though

23771892
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the way that i have setup the app is that the homeviewcontroller is the first screen that is to be displayed and within the viewdidload and viewdidappear it checks to see if the user is a current user

23771894
jar	war
jpa entities as a shareable jar not working in a war file unde tomcat 7.0.27

23771900
post	get
i was able to find similar post for matching elements in a collection but it does not get the unmatched elements for a map

23771911
width	text-align
ul will take the width of the longest link and will be centered from text-align center

23771919
mouseover	mouseout
i have tried to work around it by putting my desired function on the main div mouseover but when the mouse moves from the background div to the foreground div there is a mouseout and mouseover event called simultaneously which makes my function run twice when i only want it to run once

23771919
mouseover	mouseout
and there are even more complications because the foreground div has nested elements as well which once again trigger a mouseout and mouseover combo

23771942
ant	maven	haskell	ocaml
ie java can use ant or maven or any number of other options cdt will automatically create a makefile ddt creates the necessary dub xml configuration files haskell creates setup.hs and projectname .cabal ocaml uses ocamlbuild

23771952
width	height
as you can see the issue is because i am not supplying the image s width and height and hence before it load i am seeing this weird layout which is not good

23771952
width	height
the issue why i am not supplying a width and height is because this is responsive such that when i resize the width of the browser then the width of the card also changes and hence supplying a constant width and height doesn t work

23772012
for-loop	loops
if you want an easy way to return from the outer function from inside loops you re better off with a simple for-loop

23772043
put	get
use a debugger or put some print statements after you get the i value

23772048
post	put
i m sorry i can t put the images in the post but not enough reputation yet

23772098
hide	show
right now i have my cookie code before my checkbox show hide function

23772099
entities	entitymanager
breeze can store any collection of entities exported from an entitymanager into any local storage mechanism available on the client but understand that you are storing the entire serialized collection of entities under a single key you are not storing individual entities into a store by their key

23772102
implements	extends
this is different from the possible duplicate in that it focuses on efficiency o 1 ops and implements the data structure itself not extends java s

23772103
put	get
on get we need to put the item at the right-most side of the list

23772149
versioning	upgrade
so i had an older versioning of the mysql .net connector i upgrade to versioning 6.8.3

23772183
mouseover	mouseout
i like that the tooltip changes on mouseover to whatever you rollover but once you mouseout of that area or the imagemap i want it to go back to showing the tooltip of whatever area has been clicked

23772200
gridview	listviewitem
the problem i am having is that each listviewitem has different width based on the number of elements in the gridview

23772227
background-color	transparency
instead use the transparency background-color

23772254
border-color	background-color
how can i override this to brown like background-color #f0713a border-color #f0713a

23772354
pop-up	dialog
i ve got an applet that pop-up a dialog to enter credit card details

23772397
pickle	dill
klepto also leverages dill so it can pickle pretty much anything

23772451
jobs	cron
the most common in the lamp stack is it to use cron jobs to call scripts possibly php in this case scripts

23772534
portrait	landscape
an easier way to to this would be to delete your controller s view in the storyboard you can copy and paste it into the xib file if you want and instead make its views one each for portrait and landscape in a xib file

23772548
many-to-many	one-to-many
i am actually simulating the many-to-many relationship by having two one-to-many relationships with a junction table which is pretty standard practice

23772599

in fact you could implements a generic button class and then extends it in order to have cleaner code

23772651
mouse	keyboard
for instance what are the exact drivers required to ensure that the mouse keyboard and the display monitor do not turn off they are all dell products also i obviously need scsi disk for sata hd

this code will show the image when the viewer clicks once on the button and when they click again within 3 seconds of the first click the image hide

23772765
post	get
in order to get the earliest post per user your second match needs to somehow specify each user explicitly

23772770
opera	google-chrome
it happens when there are multiple lines and applies only to google-chrome and opera

23772783
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
create a for-loop to loops of the char arrays

23772908
g++	gcc
sudo apt-get install python python-dev libatlas-base-dev gcc gfortran g++

23772912
starttls	smtps
generally port 465 is for smtps smtps over ssl tls where the ssl tls channel is established first whereas port 587 is used for smtp+starttls where there s some plain smtps traffic before an upgrade to ssl tls via starttls

23772925
shadowing	named
there are two or possibly three different things going under that named at different times and either shadowing or overwriting each other

23772968
accelerometer	gyroscope
you could reimplement one based on accelerometer and gyroscope data

23772970
switching	screens
however the data switching appears when they start clicking on pagination sorting on that search result screens

23773014
int	double
how can the program tell if it has to save the value of a const as an int or double etc

23773021
bindparam	pdostatement
bindparam is a method on pdostatement

23773061
int	double
still 234 in this context has type int as it always does and not double

23773066
pull	push
i am trying to figure out decent but simple tool which i can host myself in aws ec2 which will allow me to pull data out of sql server 2005 and push to amazon redshift

23773067
hide	show
i want to show a slider module on home page but hide it on rest of the site

23773069
google-chrome	firefox
okay so i have below that works in google-chrome firefox but not in ie 9

23773180
build.gradle	gradlew
first of all you have to select the build.gradle file and not the project while importing into android studio and for the gradlew home you have to give the location of the installed gradlew file in my case it was c androidstudio plugins gradlew

23773180
build.gradle	gradlew
also do not forget to change the gradlew version and sdk build tools version in build.gradle file and change version of gradlew in wrapper-properties

23773199
hide	show
with this solution a timeout starts when the user clicks and within 3 seconds from then if he clicks more meaning at least a second time then it ll hide dom otherwise no more clicks it ll show it

23773201
post	get
you can set the drop down by setting model.selectedproduct on the get and that value will be populated with the selected value on post

23773208
laravel	codeigniter
i would definitely recommend getting familiar with composer though and eventually making the jump from codeigniter to laravel

23773220
ubuntu	linux
i am working on an ubuntu linux machine with python 2.7

23773222
width	height

it finally works in ie9+ firefox and google-chrome

23773234
folder	directory
it seems like it thinks my root directory is in the wrong folder and i honestly have no idea even after googling for a few hours on how to set it to the right directory

23773242
folder	directory
iis express was apparently either trying to map the controller s view folder to that directory or the virtual directory it set up somehow ended up pointing to this folder

23773253
inherited	properties
for each item iteration ng-repeat creates a new scope which prototypically inherited from the parent scope but it also assigns the item s value to a new properties on the new child

23773256
post	put
you can set a breakpoint on your controller methods that handle the post delete put

23773256
post	put
same thing in your browser at the point where you call the post delete put presumably in a jquery request

23773310
stdout	stderr
to get anything other than none in the result tuple you need to give stdout pipe and or stderr pipe too.

23773352
awt	swing
java at least through swing not sure about awt can use both opengl and directx for it s rendering pipeline having said that there are some additional benefits to using opengl bindings directly one would be the inclusion of 3d capabilities

23774781
avr	microcontroller
as someone mentioned llvm is not a bad way to go in some respects it is a non-trivial research project to add a language but what you get is the llvm backend for the targets that llvm supports which the avr is not one if i remember correctly arm and mips are so you could use your llvm base tool to generate code for microcontroller other than those used on the arduino

23774781

however if i can somehow get and set the internal state of the hashing class itself i could persist the state between chunk post and compute the hash like that without having to go back to the database at the end to read the whole thing again

thanks to doctoror drive and this post i was able to get the result i wanted

23783441
width	height
i have set all of my views padding to 0 0 0 0 and used wrap_content params for width and height for no avail

23783560
width	height
which is causing them to take up the full width and height of their parent div

23783566
children	parent
if the children are set to match_parent that would mean make them as large as their parent

23783566
children	parent
this situation is resolved by making both parent and children 0 pixels high

23783582
width	height
so i need something that captures on fly the width and height and calculate the position of the div.

23783681
implements	extends
it is not possible to extends an existing type to make it implements an interface short of adding implements imyinterface to the top of the code for that type that is

23783681
implements	extends
therefore the best option that you have would be to create a new class which wraps the core value extends it by implements the interface and then overrides the ctype operator to make it simple to convert between the core type and the wrapper type

23783701
width	height
only bad thing about it is that you require fixed width and height ofcourse you can format this to javascript and get the height and width of the element but the trick is the same

23783725
min	max	range	min	range	max
using x - min x max x -min x to an interval of 0 1 so that i can do the frequency distribution of out of range values for 6 parameters on an uniform scale of x-axis

23783725

then i select the min and max from all the 6 parameters to determine the defect interval range

int	double
when you write where z is double -typed and w is int -typed the runtime definitely has to compare something

23784297
int	double
it will not compare the double value with the int reference

23784297
int	double
instead it will unbox the int and will compare the int value obtained after unboxing with the double value

23784400

23784563
width	height
one way to do this is to place scroll view over your view controller s view and add the buttons on the scroll view.you have to add constraint on the scroll view to be fixed on each side without width height

23784563
width	height
place the buttons in the view and set fixed width height on that view.center the view and it will keep his size with the buttons inside on both screen sizes

that said to obtain the width and height for a png file you can load it into a bitmapimage instead of image and query the pixelwidth and pixelheight properties for the bitmapimage

23784726

again be aware that this is the only place in your code where you re going to be dealing with pixels all width and height properties including actualwidth and actualheight only set after the control is fully rendered are measured in device independent pixels

your button and textarea are inline elements with a combined width of 100 - however this doesnt take into account their padding margin or border all of which adds additional width- as such you need to set box-sizing border-box for them to take this into account

23785834

a numeric literal beginning with 0 is interpreted as octal number in c and as 100 in octal is 64 in decimal this explains what you observe

23787035
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	add
that will take 7 multiplying it by 7 and then write the last digit of the answer down and then multiplying it by seven and add the first digit of 7 times 7 and so on - so if you do it three times write it down you get what i wrote up there as a multiplication

int64 is a datatype that represents an integer a whole number not a fractions and is coded on 64 bits in memory

23787261
width	height
this isn t a perfect solution because unless your font is perfectly square the pixel height will usually be greater than the pixel width for each character

23787261
width	height
maybe a fixed width font has a ratio ie if pixel size of font is 6 height is 6 2 that you could take advantage of but i don t think you can set the height of a font directly

23787261
width	height
the other option would be to just assign the size of the label to the pixel size directly using a hack like giving it a blank image to make it register pixel size as width height values

23801353
client-side	server-side
you are mixing up server-side razor commands and client-side javascript

23802286
min	max
usually i do a min max to get the id s on the table and then do a random number between them then select those records in your case would be just 1 record which tends to be faster than having the database do the work especially on a large dataset

int	chars
if number is string interpreted as number the number.charat i is a chars from 0 â â 9 if you represent the chars s as numbers it would be 0 â â 9 moved to the code of 0 something like 0 â â 0 + 9 so for getting the exact digit as int number you should subtract the code of 0 from the chars

23803736
width	height
the overlay is just an absolute div width and height 100

23803745
hash	md5
the session id is a 32 byte long md5 hash value

i have a delphi database application with a lot of users over the network that stores pictures in a table but i realize it is not good storing pictures in mysql and therefore resolved to creating a directory in the same location with the exe file where pictures are stored but the problem is if there are updates by any users to the pictures folder i need to copy and distribute

23804520
int	double
now what you are doing wrong is that you are storing this double type value in an int type variable now to rectify this either you should declare your variable side as

accessor	ivar
rewrite your class to provide accessor - int numberofitemsinmap -mapitemforkey etc. which directly access the ivar

23804853
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
change the accessor to no longer copy use an ivar for the map manually write your own getter to return a pointer or reference to the map if you use a pointer you can declare the accessor as pointer properties anyway but then use operator new to create it in your constructor

23804858

note there is no database manipulations in getter and setter as well as no complex business logic

23805078
sorting	filtering
1 when i add rows 100 livescroll happens but problem with row-editing row-expansion but filtering sorting works

23805078
sorting	filtering
2 when i remove rows livescroll works with row-editing row-expansion etc but filtering sorting dont work

23805621
hive	hdfs
if your source system is rdbms then you can use sqoop to import the data into hdfs or directly into hive

23805627
getter	setter
so program it so that if the key exists in the table return that first else go for getter setter

23805689
maven	pom.xml

23805723
hide	show
i came across this which may be a good start as it displays the last char entered and show the rest of the password is masked but doesn t hide it after a set time so you would probably need to implement an event to hide after set time check it out here

23805747
button	checkbox
from diagrampage when i click on browsers back button it should take me back to mainpage and with all the things saved like whatever checkbox i did check on mainpage previously and all

i think the best solution here would first be to create your own custom views like textview imageview and whatever you want then override the touch methods and then call your activity through a listener to notify the event

23805859
luabind	luabridge
use dedicated bindings such as luabridge or luabind

23805885

23805952
width	height
for some width or height values the size of the self.map does not get set

23805952
width	height
so self.map.origin would have the newxvalue and newyvalue but self.map.size would not always have the same width and height value

23805952

23806115
getter	setter
the properties themselves have to prefixes put_ etc. they have names getter method setter method but no prefixes

getter	setter
method table generated from type library receives prefixes to distinguish between getter and setter hence the prefixes

23806174
sorting	filtering
i am using grid.mvc for filtering and sorting

23806175
ubuntu	debian

although the post method is not the only one that can contain a body for instance a put request can as well some testing reveals that only contains data in case of a post request - it is empty in all other cases

23827448

springboard	multitasking
springboard and therefore the multitasking bar runs as the user mobile while your app runs as root

23830092
springboard	tweak	springboard	multitasking
my first idea to resolve this is to hook mobilesubstrate into the multitasking bar and since ms tweak can run as root detect when the user kills your app and kill it yourself as the root user because springboard simply can t do it

23830531
hash	md5
from this i think hash values may be same when generated by md5 but if this function accepts file as input then hash values are calculated differently i dont know if this is a php side issue or really os level issue but if i go on with using md5_file for generating hash of file i dont get different hash

i want to implement the getter and setter for this property on my own

23830596
getter	setter
the most interesting part is that if i remove the getter then the setter compiles fine

23830613
codeigniter	yii
there are lots of mvc framework that do this out of the box - codeigniter or yii would be a good start

23830629

i have to record voice in ogg mp3 format using android mediarecorder

23830629
mp3	ogg
the android documentation specifies in mediarecorder.outputformat class about the formats but do not speak anything about which output format equals mp3 and ogg

23830882
int	double
i m working on a bubblesort that s supposed to take a random array of numbers and return them but i keep getting a possible loss of precision error when compiling that tells me math.random is returning a double and i need an int

23830913
int	double
don t forget to enclose it in the parenthesis before downcast to int otherwise it will converted to zero always because math.random returns a double value with a positive sign greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0

23830914
getter	setter
if you have no getter or setter and no explicit synthesize but just let everything be synthesized automatically then nowadays a property named prop gets an ivar _prop

23830914
getter	setter
but if you provide the getter and setter yourself and no explicit synthesize then nothing happens automatically in particular the ivar is not auto synthesized you must declare the ivar explicitly

23830914
getter	setter
this is partly for backwards compatibility and partly because if you are providing both a getter and a setter the compiler assumes you are in and want full control

23830914
getter	setter
the getter setter could be a front to something else entirely

23830914
getter	setter
there are two solutions assuming that you want to keep both the getter and the setter

23830914
getter	setter
you can name the ivar anything you like and you can refer to it in your getter and setter i like the syntax

the full getter and setter can be built if you do need logic built within

23831102
width	height
by viewing the code on the developer console i can see that the generated width an height is set to 0 just changing this values to a viewable size does not take effect xd

23831107
getter	setter
in this case you don t need setter for b and c and you have a getter for them which neatly calculates the value

23831110
mouseleave	mouseenter
i guess if the worst comes to the worst i could do it all manually with classes mouseenter mouseleave and domattrmodified

23831145

23831441
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
next you need to add mousedown mouseup and mousemove handlers to the parent control - not the piece control

23831447
width	height
there is also the possibility of simplifying the problem by making size height and width unsigned which will prevent ever getting into a negative state

23831457
width	height
you can put it to your layout.xml and set your own width and height and align whichever you like

23831467
g++	gcc
g++ gcc 3.2.3 mingw special 20030504-1

23833451
google-chrome	firefox
this does not occur in firefox and google-chrome

23833451
pop-up	dialog
so what i think is happening after this dialog box pop-up it returns focus to the text box and then focus returns back to the dialog box which creates this infinite loop

23833476
getter	setter
i am having a hard time implementing a property in c# that only has a getter in the abstract base class but where i need to introduce a setter in one of the derived classes

23833476
getter	setter
my objective is that the two classes textelementstatic and textelementreferencesource should have a text property with both getter and setter while the class textelementreferencetarget should have a text property with only a getter

23833476
inherited	properties
i know that i could separate the two objectives her providing one inherited text properties with only a getter and then introduce a settext method in the itextelementupdatable interface

23833476
getter	setter
another similar question but without any answers i ve been able to use c# - what should i do when every inherited class needs getter from base class but setter only for one inherited class

memcpy	malloc
i m not sure what you re trying to do with memcpy but you can not assume that everything you want to memcpy will have been allocated using malloc

23833647
realloc	calloc
also you need to be aware of calloc alloc and realloc too

23833651

nsoperation	completionhandler
if you are using completionhandler based requests implementing operation-based solution is pretty trivial it s the typical concurrent nsoperation subclass implementation

23837970
nsoperationqueue	nsurlsession
it s a pretty significant amount of work required because nsurlsession doesn t provide a maxconcurrentoperationcount -style feature on the session to say nothing of other nsoperationqueue goodness like dependencies completion blocks etc.

folder	directory
im doing this consulting my directory folder when i save images and not consulting database

to be sure you can put a breakpoint in the post function

23838942
post	get
in a non-threaded environment the post are selected by post_id as post id would be auto incremented and thus could be ordered simply to get post from newest to oldest or vis versa

23838942

mongodb	rethinkdb
if you got only 100gb of data and you need flexible easy to implement db engine i would stick to mongodb alternatively take a look rethinkdb which have a very similar model and way better in my personal opinion clustering data center replication implementation

23839037
min	max
you can specify a min and max value to get a random array index within the bound

23839039

getter	setter
the only time you ll need to write just inside your opening implementation yourviewcontroller block is if you define both a custom getter and setter method for _checkbook

23839189
oncreate	onstart
note that i have to save the fragment instance on oncreate because when the code reaches onstart the reference for this fragment was null this issue is not important for the time it has something to do with the navigationdrawer so i need to manually save the instance of the fragment

23839191
addition	multiplication
the emulated version is much more expensive than a multiplication and an addition because what fmaf does is not exactly equivalent to multiplication followed by addition so it would be incorrect to just implement it so

23839219
pem	pkcs#12
i created a service account converted the pkcs#12 file to a pem file then referenced the service account email address and pem file in my driver

width	height
by doing so you should know that you have to take the total width and height of the texture into account because uv values are in the range 0 1

23839421
children	parent
the only part that didn t work out of the box was the checking unchecking of child parent nodes when their children parent nodes are clicked

23839442

clang	llvm
i ve found bugs in llvm before funny template business that made clang segfault and they ve been responsive in fixing it if you give a nice and clear example of the fault

23839532
getter	setter
i ve read from that it is always good practice to use getter and setter rather that accessing the variable directly from outside the object so that would eliminate the need of returning variables by reference

23839534
getter	setter
i have an interface where i define a getter and setter that should accept anything in a typed way no object as type

23839599
udp	tcp
there is no such thing as an empty request in tcp there is in udp

23839603

for-loop	loops
move location++ at the end of loops or use a for-loop

23839641
width	height
i was thinking that if i had the width and the height that i could do

23839660
width	height
you can use css to set the width of the image and as long as you don t set the height it will scale automatically maintaining its aspect ratio

23839667
folder	directory
it usually makes sense to save them in the project s root directory so if you have a filesystem like myhomedir projects web sweetwebsite containing html js and css subdirectories you might want to save your project as ... sweetwebsite sweetwebsite.sublime-project just so you know at a glance what files folder are probably in it

23839697
post	put
i quickly put together a version which i will post to the jira issue

23839716
build.gradle	gradlew
if necessary i can post my various gradlew files build.gradle settings.gradle ...

23839736
linefeed	delimiter
no i guess as sas has to read all the data from a delimiter file - it has to read every byte from beginning to end to 1 process the column delimiter and 2 determine the obs delimiter cr linefeed characters - droping the unneeded columns wouldn t be much of an overhead

23839764
width	height
if the aspect ratio of the image you want to put inside an image control is not 1 1 and you set the aspect ratio of your image control to 1 1 width 20 and height 20 you will have a deformed image

23839764
width	height
so the best approach is set the width 20 but don t set the height let it calculate that automatically

23839912

google-chrome	safari
when a google-chrome user hits my site on an iphone or ipad the browser type as reported via javascript or request.browser using mvc always reports safari

23840090
google-chrome	safari
i think this is because google-chrome or any other browser running on an apple platform must be built on top of safari technology as per apple requirements

23840127

cos	sin
it has good accuracy maximum deviation from sin cos on the order of 5e-8 and speed slightly outperforms fsincos on a single call basis and a clear winner over multiple values

23840144
width	height
the only reason i can think of on why you are trying to set divider position is not to increase or decrease the height width of one side of the divider

23840149
int	double
this would maybe simplify things since you can directly check and read int double values and sum them up

23840188
popover	tooltip
bootstrap tooltip and popover support html values for the data-content attribute when data-html true

23840215
put	get

23840225
getter	setter
you need the getter and setter to translate the data from rest strings to your object but everything coming from a user has to be viewed with a weary eye

23840276
put	get
i believe this is the issue because whenever i put the same function into the disney brdf editor i get correct results

23840289
width	height
to center it on that point simply remove half of its width and height

23840305
for-loop	arrays
so i wrote a much more convoluted function that splits a word s letters into an arrays and then passes each arrays ele thru a for-loop that consists of 92 if elif statements that when a char is matched then runs a sed replace sub

23840325
getter	setter
you can solve them by using getter setter properties but that would be ugly

23840325
inherited	properties
edit also another alternative would be to turn them into classes that inherited from arraylist and set the capacity properties

23840333
width	height
assuming the canvas contains colored rectangles here s how to calculate the width x height of the colored rectangle containing the specified x y coordinate

also the wikipedia article on uname clearly states that the system name for all solaris systems is sunos

23840933
setcontentview	findviewbyid
your button is in your fragment_main.xml file but in your mainactivity you setcontentview r.layout.activity_main so in your mainactivity you can t by findviewbyid to get a button object button is null so your program throw a nullpointexception

23840937

because the native dimensions of a video are not known until the movie metadata loads a default height and width of 150 x 300 is allocated on devices running ios if the height or width is not specified

23841018

23841330
post	put
any class methods such as scope methods defined your post model will also be callable from that relation so that is where you should put your refinements unless those refinements pertain to the community or communitypost in which case you would put them on the community or communitypost models respectively

register the receiver in onresume and unregister it in onpause

23849889

then 2 new javascript arrays are created which take their values from the other 3 arrays as shown in the for-loop the 3 arrays are included in googlemaps functions which was the main thing causing problems before

23861634
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
the latter catches all runtimeexception s unchecked-exception as well as the checked exceptions you expect to catch

23861634

-- decrement but returns the value of the variable before it was decrement shifts to the right by the right operands which is 0 a.k.a

int	double
the multiplication expression converts int 3 to double exactly and the multiplication is performed as double

i ve created two directives in angular each one utilizing jquery ui s draggable and droppable

23862909

the only real difference with the two events is that the draggable stop event fires once when the draggins stops while the droppable drop event first for each droppable item that the drag item has dropped over

23862909
draggable	droppable
here s some context the app is a color browser where the draggable item is a loupe and the droppable items are small color swatches in a grid

if we only specify the width of the image the height will be auto calculated

23863711
profiling	debugging
so for the debugging we don t need to create new provisional profiling manually

23863711
profiling	debugging
it is better to use team provisioning profiling with bundle id which is created and managed by xcode for the debugging process

23863736

children	parent
the component parent width is set and the children are inherited

23863826

i also got correct output by flushing stdout after stdin and ofp by a single fflush stdout

23864189
stdout	fflush
if your read output of combparenthesis with a pipe duping stdout never write to stdout in any over place or be sure to fflush it

23864189
stdout	fflush
edit in fact i have just realized that your code could work even with intermixed printf elsewhere in the application provided you fflush stdout before copying it to fds 1

23864242
.when	each	put	get
on clicking on each link in this each of them are redirected to another domain when i have fetched all the links and tried to get the redirected url then the below error was getting so i took one url and put it on browser it it is not redirected how can i get that redirected web urls .when i have tried to print the status code of the url using the just below code it was returing 404 stsua but the contents were printing does that mean i will not be able to fetch thoose redirected url

equals	gethashcode
if you implement equals and gethashcode you need to implement both or none then here are the rules you should follow

equals	gethashcode
if the two objects are equals equals returns true they should produce the same hash code from gethashcode

23865189
equals	gethashcode
you can turn this rule on its head and say that if the two gethashcode methods returns different values equals should return false

equals	gethashcode
if equals returns false it is perfectly valid though usually very unlikely that gethashcode returns the same value

equals	gethashcode
likewise if gethashcode returns the same value it is perfectly valid though again usually very unlikely that equals returns false

i want to make a control which inherited from textbox and which has a label inside which sticks to the right side of the text box and which text is not user-editable but rather is set by a properties

23875108
inherited	properties
in that stylesheet the default value for the color properties on an a element is a shade of blue not inherited

23875108
inherited	properties
the default value for the properties on the p element is inherited so it pulls in the colour from its parent element

23875173

23875264
post	get
hope anyone can post an example of how to get returned parameters from my php thanks

23875288
stdout	stderr
maybe lftp starts a process that do not exit and maybe probably the maven-exec plugin loops on stdout and stderr to print all relevant messages before to exit

int	chars
basically getnbits gets an array of chars which are 0 s or 1 s and returns an array of int each element is a 0 or a 1

23875311
for-loop	arrays
if i try to print the arrays result as i am creating it in the for-loop using printf d result i it will return 000011110000...

23875320
int	chars
and you need to read in the chars into an array no just an int

23875320
int	chars
note that although 5320 can fit into a single int the chars 5 3 2 0 require 4 bytes to hold them plus a byte for null termination

23875419
exponent	modulo
little wonder you get errors the exponent is normally shorter than the modulo which is always the same size as the key size

23875419
exponent	modulo
you are switching the modulo and the exponent around

23875428
put	get
i m not sure why you re using the from in your query but if you actually put that iri into to the public endpoint s default data set name graph iri field you don t get any results

23875469
free	malloc
note if you use malloc above you must also use free to release the

23875478
prepare	execute
i am suspicious of the port being 0 and socket null as well as the fact that there doesn t seem to be an execute after the prepare

23875478
prepare	execute
i do have execute as far as the php is concerned but interestingly enough it doesn t seem to show up after the prepare

23875484
google-chrome	firefox
i implement with my simple method with javascript but it really cost a lot of time even i did some optimization on that for a short array of 1000 strings it cost about 8s for firefox and 12s for google-chrome

23875506
ant	maven
also i would recommend you write a maven script or ant script to handle packaging and deployment instead of using eclipse

23875553
exponent	modulo
the difference is that i was not sharing the modulo and exponent but the whole public key encoded in base 64 without the -----begin end public key----- header footer converting it back and forth to the appropriate classes in the end device

23875575
multiplying	add
in this i want to end up using the 4 from the multiplying method as a value then use the add method to add whatever value i give it to the result of the multiplying which is four

23875598
subtract	add
the factor by which the performance of the two compositions differs is 11x or 19x if the imperative run time is taken to be the overhead of the add function itself and is subtract from both results

23875639

you should get your post action like

23875690
ctime	strftime
so gfortran followed this recommendation after testing revealed that strftime with the c specifier generated strings in the same format as ctime as long as the program is in the default c locale

23875690
ctime	strftime
unfortunately as you have found out strftime in msvc libc doesn t generate a ctime -like string for the c specifier

23875707
width	font-size
they have much different length however both are supposed to have fixed width of 100px hence the second menu #menu2 should have smaller font-size to fit the space

23875765
int	chars
convert.toint32 does not convert the numeric string value but the specified unicode chars to the equivalent 32-bit signed int

23875771
versioning	upgrade

post	get
i am wondering if i need to build an array inside the while loops so that i can get that ultimate random order at the end instead of just the first 15 images from post 1 in random order and then the next 15 images from post 2 in a random order which is not what i am trying to do

23898743
for-loop	loops
as for the generation itself you can use a simple while loops or for-loop

i get items with their pubdate publish date values as string convert them to date object and put them to my db

23898880
folder	directory
for this add a top-level sconstruct file in the same folder as your project_x directory and call your sub-projects like this

23898888
fontfamily	font-size
using the same example if a header does not have a fontfamily font-size color or margins specified in a widget it will take these values from another app s css file which may or may not be the same rules as the contributing project s file

maybe you want to redirect stderr to stdout and then pipe to tee command

23899098
folder	directory
no just create another .py file in the same directory as the dejavu folder

23899128
inline	inlining
to trigger inlining enable optimization in your compiler settings gcc -o2 and put your functions to the .h file as static inline

23899144

it s pretty easy to store gui state for dynamically changed added objects using put get serializable etc methods

23899181
google-chrome	firefox
i see this behaviour on firefox and google-chrome

23899208
width	height
the size is divided in height and width

23899208
width	height
calculate height width for each of the images and then you can calculate the ratio between the sizes of both images

23899258
multiplying	division
do i really need to do integer division and then multiplying it back and see if it s equal

23899265
stdout	stderr
generally there is no stdin stdout stderr streams

entities	entitymanager
since breeze is not hooking them up i have attempted merging them back in but i believe the entities are in the entitymanager cache they are just not properly related

23899310
implements	extends
theâ datainputstream â is a byte stream class that enables you to read primitive data from a stream.â datainputstreamâ extends filterinputstream which extendsâ inputstreamâ and it implements the datainputâ interface.â datainputâ interface defines methods that convert a sequence of bytes to primitive values.â datainputstreamâ supports all of the methods of its superclasses but it is the methods defined by the datainputstreamâ interface that make it unique

23899363
int	double
your algorithm is correct but be careful that you cast or assign your values to double before you perform the division otherwise you will get int division which will always result in 0 if imageb is smaller than imagea

23899443
min	max
a better approach is to set min to 0 and max to data.length with the pointinterval set to 1 like this

23899444
accessor	properties
you can add logic to get and set accessor of your fooparentid and barparentid properties but agree with servy that it s a poor design

23899444
inherited	properties
i don t understand why would you need to have both barparent and fooparent just have 1 properties of type iparent and then communicate with it using methods that this interface provides utilizing all benefits of inherited and polymorphism

23899481
super	extends
pecs is a tiny bit of an oversimplification but it makes a great mnemonic pecs producer extends consumer super means that a variable or parameter for a generic wildcard type that uses extends can only be used to produce values you can safely only read from it you can t add to it

23899490
int	double
and the compiler will generate an implicit conversion note not a cast of the int value 2 to double before passing it to the sqrt function

knitr	latex
inside the plot generated in a chunk in a knitr latex document i want to position a text string with a reference to a particular figure elsehwere in the document something like see fig

23899828
min	max
you can then do a second query with an in clause for the appropriate ids or could formulate a where clause using the min and max ids from the first query.

23899833
temp	tmp
everything else works all the data but the image isn t storing the name just showing some temp dir name like tmp phpix7kcy

23899847
width	height
my code needs to be responsive so i used width height

23899848
width	height
a rect s width and height can be negative

23899848
width	height
structure cgsize represents the dimensions of width and height

23899848
width	height
the height and width stored in a cgrect data structure can be

23899848
width	height
can standardize a rectangleâ that is ensure that the height and width

23899884
for-loop	arrays
so to copy the pixel data from the one dimensional arrays to your two dimensional arrays you would need a compound for-loop

23899887

23900203
getter	setter
in such cases it s nice to be able to define a property with a getter setter pair

23900203
getter	setter
if the property name is included in attributes or publish the getter setter won t get used

23900203
getter	setter
there s no way to reject an attempt to set a property in a setter nor does there seem to be a way to have a getter run when the value is retrieved

as there are thumbnails of every slider the best way is to load 3 sliders at the beginning with lazy loading manner show 1 and hide another 2

23900386
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you can simply always return yes if you want the main point here though is that this method is called before the switch starts and therefore definitely before viewwillappear and viewdidappear are called

23900409
ussd	smpp	pdu	smpp	pdu	ussd
once you had the decoded message in the server and you d analyzed the various flags in the pdu for the message to know that it s a ussd message you d then need to remove the message from the queue process it figure out what the command meant then send it to an application server that would then decide what url to call or what soap endpoint to pass it to and many other factors as well as taking any response converting it back to smpp then re-serializing it and sending it back down the signalling channel to the original device

23900713
g++	gcc
gcc provides both driver programs gcc g++ to compile and or link c c++ setting appropriate defaults but options mean c++ can be compiled using gcc as well as c often being valid input to a c++ compiler

hide	show
my intention is to show and hide panels as needed and use layout after each change to keep everything nice and neat

23900814
hide	show
as the script has become more complex that has ceased to be practical so it was my intention to always hide everything each time so i did not have to worry about keeping track of what was being displayed at any given time and then just show the panel that was needed at that point in execution

23900822
spaces	linefeed
note especially that in the case of the unquoted variable the resulting would not show the linefeed because echo sees four separate words that it just joins with spaces

int types to int so chars becomes int for example

23902840
int	chars
the problem is that when you convert a chars to an int it is possible that the significant byte ends up offset by for example 3 bytes from where you thought you stored it - since a value like 0x33 might be stored as 0x00000033

23902840

for-loop	loops
i want to know that is there other ways trick to iteration that don t need to use for-loop or while loops above thanks in advance

23907000
keydown	keyup
the short answer is that keyup and keydown are used to identify the physical keys pressed not the value which those keys correspond to

23907000
keydown	keyup
you ll see that you are correct with regard to the key ranges in keypress but both a and a are achieved by hitting the same physical key same key code in keyup and keydown

23907031
oncreate	setcontentview
your activity s oncreate s code should be implemented in oncreateview of the fragment off course you ll have to change some stuff like inflatting the view and returning it instead of calling setcontentview r.layout.id

23907031
onresume	onpause
implement it also for onresume onstop onpause etc

23907051

a fairly simple way would be to salt a basic forward-only i.e sha md5 etc. hash of the three parameters against a secret key kept on the server and never exposed to users in any way

23907230
equals	compareto
equals method is intended to check whether two objects are equals while compareto is intended to set a relation order between elements whether one is greater then the other other is greater then the first one or none of this is applicable which is typically means that objects are equals

23907230
equals	compareto
unless you have a very good reason you should override both equals and compareto

23907230
equals	compareto
an example of very good reason is bigdecimal class where equals compares both value of the object and its scale while compareto compares only values

23907336
stdout	stderr
so the script would go in the background detach stdin stdout and stderr maybe even attach itself to init instead of the current bash

23907472
d3.js	crossfilter
i am learning d3.js and crossfilter

jgit	egit
note that may not be fully supported in egit jgit which has still issue with smudge clean filters

the reason you see more cores than a single being busy is very likely due to the node.js with express more efficiently offloading operations to other workers through async code

23907633
pem	pkcs#12
when i try to use the pkcs#12 certificate openssl_error_string returns could not sign data error 0906d06c pem routines pem_read_bio no start line openssl_pkcs7_sign

23907664
free	malloc
first i try to malloc and free a big block memory then i malloc many small blocks memory till it run out of memory and i free all those small blocks

23907664
free	malloc
but i ve already free everything i malloc the memory should be empty

23907703
getter	setter
always use getter setter methods so you can add aditional check to avoid access violation which would occur if you try accesing common data before you have assigned external connection to common data class

23907746
hide	show
i make my first steps with angularjs and use a toggle button bootstrap ui and directives to show or hide an input

it depends on which rdbms you are using i know that sql server will not allow this because you need to perform a summary operation min max average etc on each field that is not in the group by clause or add the field to the group by clause

23907962
libstdc++	libc++
should make clang to default to libstdc++ instead of libc++

23908020
gridbaglayout	miglayout
same effect but this approach is less verbose unlike in case of gridbaglayout and i personally think that miglayout is easier to use

23908056
squash	merge
you didn t squash your commits together before you merge so you will still see all commits

23908071
for-loop	arrays
i have an inkling that this happens because the function refreshlist creates a new list every time the arrays todolist is updated and the listitem.appendchild only runs once in the for-loop

23908074
screens	tablet
however when i run it on a tablet it takes up 1 10th of the screens

23908106
width	height
the two units we will use here are vh viewport height and vw viewport width

23908106

23908327
superclass	subclassing
in your subclassing you are hiding the variable defined in the superclass

23908327
superclass	subclassing
as a result even if you use the value field elsewhere in your subclassing the superclass field will always have a warning since the field is never read

23908327
superclass	subclassing
i suspect you need to remove your value field from your subclassing and provide a getvalue method in your superclass to provide access to it

23908356
int	chars
in your case the struct consists of a chars pointer and an int

23908373
for-loop	loops
so what i did was that i inserted a certain number of elements to a linked list and iterated through it using the above mentioned three methods 1 using advanced for-loop 2 using iterator 3 using simple loops and get

i suggest you to create another filtering that checks if the user is an admin or client and then add the shared route to a new grouping

23908571
google-chrome	firefox
the input text is not filled before ajax request completed in ie and google-chrome but it is filled in firefox

23908581

23908645
hide	show
i want to hide them and show only on mouseover

23908653
nunit	mstest

23908670
public	protected	getter	setter
so class needs to be public and all properties needs to be virtual public at least protected along with their setter and getter then when dbcontext will instantiate this entity class for you it will instatiate it as an instance of class deriving from your entity class

23908776
gesturedetector	motionevent
3 you override genericmotionevent motionevent event and pass it to your gesturedetector

int	chars
by definition chars are just small int so chars variables and

23908808
put	get	post	get	post	put
if you decided to use full set of rest request methods get put delete post then you must handle them by decorating on the controller method to tell the compiler which method will be processing which type of request

width	height
you can also add height and width properties to define size for your button and attributes like align absmiddle to position image in middle of the button

23908972

width	height
take into account the width and height of the window screen

23909649

i would recommend you override the equals and gethashcode so that the comparison is as you d expect

23915129
bufferstrategy	bufferedimage
in my code i never specified that a certain bufferedimage is supposed to be used for the bufferstrategy which changes the buffers by itself i guess but the code still somehow works

23915156
put	get
if you have not overridden them the hash table will compare the mydate objects to see if they are the same instances which they will never be in your code because they are new instances created each time you do a get put call

23915512
hide	show
i want to understand can we hide show few portlets at runtime on action of other portlets

23915529
getter	setter
now as the fields increase i have to use those getter from first object and setter from second object to assign values for each field in second object.instead of doing all those assignments individually is it possible to have a function which can take all the fields of first object and set it into second wherever the name of the field matches

23915541

width	height
i created a maze that gets the height and width values from user

23915781
multiplying	multiplication
it is normal for this operation to produce the mathematical result more often than multiplying a single-precision decimal constant does but again this has nothing to do with the rounding mode and everything to do with the actual operand of the multiplication

23915782
width	height
just implement a static method in your uitableviewcell class that is able to calculate cell height basing on provided string and a width

23915798

relativelayout will move the textview to align it parentleft when you make the first imageview gone

23916090
textview	imageview
if this is not what you intended and you want the textview to remain centered when you move the imageview then the solution is even simpler set the imageview s visibility to invisible not gone

23916094
google-chrome	firefox
here is a simple dart code that works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox but throws an exception in ie10

23916107
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout instead of setinterval

23916401
onresume	onpause
if i launch and close the activity enough times there eventually comes a point where for some reason upon launching onpause gets called immediately after oncreate skipping onresume which is then followed by onresume being called twice in a row

23916428
maven	pom.xml
the temporary workaround for me was to adequatly declare dependencies in my pom.xml using maven and use the make function of idea which i guess calls the android tools and build the stuff appropriately

23916428
maven	pom.xml
however i hit the same wall all over again the make command produces class defined in multiple dex files i guess that removing duplicates here does not work either just in case i was not clear the same project with the same pom.xml builds successfully with maven but encounters the error when using make

23916441

23916877
scatter	graphing
also if i create a scatter plot in excel manually insert chart scatter i get a time scale chart with x axis options to select minimum maximum major unit and minor unit whereas the graphing from phpexcel appear to be a category value type since you can only select interval between tick marks and interval unit

in this todo app which is in angularjs i need a help in hiding the button using ng-show and ng-hide derivative

23917005

23917025
children	parent
i have a parent class that hasmany children with the mapping

23917025
children	parent
which works fine except it triggers multiple calls to select children when they are accessed off the parent

23917025
children	parent
but it gets output to objects as parent with id 123 appearing twice which is correct but both have four children with id 1 which is wrong it only has one child

23917028
spaces	delimiter
first the awk s default internal field separator fs will work on spaces or tab delimiter files

23917031

you can hide and show them respectively

23917142
wordpress	joomla
this kind of code exists in many frameworks and cms s for example wordpress and joomla etc

23917142
wordpress	joomla
now this difference may seem trivial at first but if you were to use a framework like wordpress or one of the cms s like joomla for example this can and does cause problems when you move your site to a live server

23917142

23917362
rtsp	rtmp	rtp	rtmp	rtp	rtsp
for live streaming your best options are rtmp rtp rtsp

23917380
super	extends
generics allow a super class to enforce a specific type in a child class instead of allowing any class that extends a certain class

23917380
implements	extends
in your code you want subclasses to implements methods given their exact relevant types a carfixer would take car s a jetpackfixer would take jetpack s but you want to enforce that these types extends vehicle

23917516
mouse	keyboard
just process the commands in the game loop as you do with keyboard mouse network whatever

23917521
centos	linux
i am using linux centos to schedule a job

23917673
google-chrome	firefox
it gave the same result both in google-chrome and firefox browser

23917673
width	height
anyway in find the exact height and width of the viewport in a cross-browser way no prototype jquery the way to get the height and width of the viewport is explained

23917730
width	height
side note it s better to apply display inline-block while changing display from block for aligning items horizontally - if you apply display inline like you ve applied to the the element will not accept width and height properties.

23917758
google-chrome	firefox
i can only view the latest update after cleared my browser history. google-chrome version 35.0.1916.114 and firefox version 29.0.1

23917759
unsigned	short
in short it s because the method needs to convert a signed int which all java int s are to an unsigned quantity

23917763
put	get
but i don t know how to get two substring from string double dot separated and dot comma separated and put it into a 2 d string

23917775
hide	show
so clearly there is some way to hide it or move it so it doesn t show up in some way but i ve yet to find anything online that show a way within windows 7 or a programmatic way to do so

23917798
width	height
width 80 height 80

23917861
int	double
the union conversions involving int float or long double seem like a far better way to let c take care of worrying about the sign exponent and mantissa than doing it manually with shifts and rotations

23917861
hex	binary
at that point you can convert it to a hex or binary string put it an a packet and reverse the process on the other end

23917861
int	double
why not just put the float or double in a union which automatically stores in ieee 754 representation and then simply use int or long representation

23917900
mdpi	hdpi
actually i caused it myself by creating a drawable icon called ic_tab_debate.png in all drawable folders mdpi hdpi ... but also creating and xml file in the drawable folder called ic_tab_debate.xml

23917921
getter	setter
what i would like is to have an unmodifiablecollection class which wraps my actual collection and only makes visible the getter but not the setter

23917995
folder	directory
because of this my assemblies are no longer in the same directory as the fr-ca folder and will use the default reference no matter what the culture is

23917995
folder	directory	post	put
do i need to create a fr-ca folder in the main directory and put a post build event to copy the resource files there as well

23917998
clang	llvm
this repository has a bunch of up-to-date samples of using llvm and clang as libraries

23918054
printf	strlen
and so you can allocate this much space for each int field pass this to printf and then use strlen on that to get the actual length of the whole string

23918104
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
when i open this page in google-chrome ie firefox and opera the audio does not play most browsers automute the volume as well

this identifies one of the four rotation quadrants that are possible for a device relative to its native orientation landscape portrait landscapeflipped and portraitflipped

23918166
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
i have a uipageviewcontroller with multiple uiviewcontroller each one containing a uitextfield

23918224
floating-point	integer	integer	unsigned
your code is the correct way to convert a machine floating-point quantity which conceivably might not be in ieee format to the same-size unsigned integer with the same representation

23918224
floating-point	integer	integer	unsigned
now in terms of the letter of the standard this problem bites you worse if you use bit-shifts and masks to extract fields because the value you get out of the conversion from a floating-point value to the same-size unsigned integer that you hope has the same representation is unspecified n1570 6.2.6.1p7 which is less nailed down than implementation-defined but more nailed down than undefined

23918224
floating-point	integer
i can think of only one thoroughly obsolete context where it wouldn t work some arm-based systems in the early 1990s had third-party floating-point coprocessors that were big-endian opposite to the main cpu s choice for integer values

23918245
width	height
i have #content width set to 800px and the height set to auto

23918251

i ve also enabled browser button setting for all browsers ie firefox google-chrome and safari

23918251
google-chrome	firefox
browser icon shows perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but in ie 8 9 the icon doesn t show up

23918275
getter	setter
if you do write these variables down i would recommend you never modify the variable directly instead use setter and getter that suit your model

23918278
matlab	simulink
the simulink works great but my vision is to have a matlab v.7.10 script run the simulation for several trials without me having to run over to the computer between drops

23918343
post	get
when i run the post request i get a 404 response but i can see the image has uploaded to the blob in the app engine console

23918346
width	height
use css height and width

23918348
folder	directory
i have tried changing the publish profiles to use the same directory that is the drop folder on the build server but all that happens is that it ends up erasing that folder and all of its contents

23918353
for-loop	arrays
in that case you can fill the arrays as a function of thread number and rely on the fact that chunks with static scheduling are assigned in order of increasing thread number c++ openmp split for-loop in even chunks static and join data at the end

23918361
many-to-many	many-to-one
and lets say the user entity is linked in a many-to-one relation to a company entity and in a many-to-many relation to a group entity using a collection groups field

23918361
getter	setter
if i try to mock it i assume that since the entity gets hydrated i will have to mock each of its setter and getter methods

23918368
hide	show
i want a toggle action button to show hide the extension s panel

23918368
hide	show
the problem is that inside of handlechange where the toggling logic should be i can t tell if the panel is supposed to show or hide

23918385
getter	setter
i considered making a class that wraps around the type with properties that would act as getter and setter

23918389
wordpress	phpbb
in php how most systems phpbb wordpress etc do it is there is a base include file that is included at the start of each php page

23918429
concave	convex
your path outline defines a concave shape but polygon shaped bodies must use convex shapes

23918429
concave	convex
you can either change the path to be convex or you will have to split it up into multiple bodies connected with joints in order to form a larger concave shape made out of individual convex bodies

23918456
versioning	upgrade
i m using versioning to support a zero downtime upgrade experience

23918487
min	max
the only issue now is if the input dataset has a lot of min and max values the binning method will exclude many of those values and the resulting graph will misrepresent the dataset

23918493
box-sizing	border-box	width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box
you should use box-sizing border-box on elements that have width or height 100 and that the parents have padding in order to make them take up 100 of the width or height minus the padding

23918610
equals	compareto
i ve also tried with compareto and equals functions

post	get
when i click posts_path link i get an error uninitialized constant postscontroller post app controllers posts_controller.rb line 17

23918654

23918660
width	height
edit i tried setting the height and width of the image to that of the richtextbox but it covers about 80 of the richtextbox

23918664
subclass	abstract-class
you should change your teaches interface into an abstract-class so that it can have its own instance variable courselist that each individual concrete subclass can access

23918666
client-side	server-side
it doesn t need any visibility attributes because it is always hidden - and you can assign values on client-side and read them in server-side code

23918712
hide	show
so use to to show hide the dropdown for example during the mouseenter event you declared

23918719
tortoisegit	svn
i successfully used git-svn to download the svn to my local git repo using tortoisegit

23918720
aggregate-functions	sum
above function works fine but when i try to invoke this inside aggregate-functions say sum

23918783
width	margin
it gives you a fixed margin of 30px around each tile and the width of each tile flexes to accommodate the width of the parent

23918794
for-loop	loops
anyway within the inner for-loop the same object reference gets modified and added to the list al1 when the if conditions both inside and outside loops satisfies

23918814
treelistview	objectlistview
i m trying to display this json data into a treelistview in the objectlistview libary

23918870
portrait	landscape

23918915
onclick	onsubmit
i have it totaling the quantities up but not a working onclick onsubmit function that can alert you to reach the minimum order quantity before submitting the form

so every time as i enter gruntjs it gives that error..but i downloaded uglifyjs

23918984
client-side	server-side
it s perfectly fine for asp.net to spit out js becuase it s rendering it but the client-side processing of js which is where you are trying to call a server-side method knows nothing of asp.net

23919015
hash	md5
then it does some md5 hash calculations concerning login and pass inserting it to db

23919039
min	max
now add a second form to the project make sure both forms are created and switch focus between the two forms repeatedly also try clicking the second form then click the custom drawn caption bar of first form this should result in some flickering and the close min and max button showing up

23919057
children	parent
i understand i can easily start with the parent and append the two children but in this case i need to do it this particular way

23919061
button	checkbox
i created a cocoa application when it starts a popup windows shows up 2 checkbox you can choose any one or none of them then click yes or no button to finish

23919103
put	get
without using a listactivity you can get rid of onfinishinflate and the call to its parent and simply put all your click listeners in your oncreate method

23919108
for-loop	arrays
if we check for-loop like above then when i goes to 4 then it satisfies for-loop check as and enters for-loop but there you are doing - ok but will become like which definitely causes arrays index out of bound exception

23919124
width	height
i wrote following macrodef to get both image width and height

23919129
post	put
i saw an example of this on a forum a while back where the developers put the contents of the post in a data-content attribute for some reason

23919130
hash	md5
if on the other hand you meant to test the md5 hash of just the utf-8 encoding of the filename then don t apply urllib.quote and the webpage inadvertently exposed an error in your approach

23919152
width	height
warning - if you want to use the height width properties of an image for example then document.ready is a deal braker

23919168
getter	setter
using the dart mirrors library how can i find all corresponding getter and setter for any class mirror

23919168

23921240
versioning	upgrade	g++	gcc
if you are stuck with gcc g++ 4.2 you will indeed either need to upgrade the compiler or need to downgrade rcpparmadillo to an older versioning

23921240

or upgrade your os versioning

23921240
ubuntu	centos
newer rhel centos have newer compilers but i d actually recommend ubuntu s lts versions

somewhat orthogonal to changing the login check route but re-reading your question it says that you want to use the login path for different actions depending on get post

23921316

23921489
viewdidload	viewdidappear
using viewdidload and viewdidappear is related to the view controller and not the application

23921497
width	height
i send to my php file the axis x y and width height but the cropped area is wrong

23921500

however the box on the right should be further down compared to the surroding boxed this can be solved by appling a margin to the top of the element equal to the height of the middle element

we use ave to see which rank are greater than the median for each group and we select where those are true

23921614

it turns out it s because the return type of the getter doesn t match the argument of the setter

23922088

23922347
client-side	server-side
in other words client-side validation jquery javascript cannot replace server-side validations

23922355
folder	directory
also to check if a folder contains a folder down the line that has a 5mb file well the only way i could figure out was to run a directory listing on each folder and check if it has any of the whitelisted folder within it so that s what i did in my script

23922378
for-loop	loops
also if it s not optimized by the compiler this may also cause the first program to operate slightly slower which might be noticeable in your for-loop you are talking about depending on how long loops goes on for since the compiled code will need to pass the parameter to the function and pass the return value back to main adding a few extra instructions which would be executed in every iteration of loops

23922408
client-side	server-side
regardless of if you decide to do any client-side validation you ll always want to do server-side php validation as well because you should never ever trust user supplied input

23922428
udp	tcp
if you want more control over the number of packets that are sent use udp instead of tcp

nullreferenceexception	targetinvocationexception
despite the fact i like this method and its implementation when say propb is null dynamicinvoke just throws nullreferenceexception wrapped by targetinvocationexception

23922505
versioning	upgrade
as usual comprehensive automated testing will be a big help. if it fails either because the dependency is just broken or because the dependency brings in an incompatible versioning of a transitive dependency abandon the upgrade report the problem to the owners of the dependencies and try again after they ve released a versioning which fixes the problem

23922505
versioning	upgrade
if it s necessary to upgrade more than one dependency all at once perhaps because two dependencies both depend on a third dependency of which there can only be one versioning in the system that s fine although it s a bigger change and thus riskier

23922506
folder	directory	folder	dir
where dir is the folder directory

23922506

i have written a css print stylesheet solution that should solve 80-90 of this problem occurring for sites that require the icons glyphicons from bootstrap to show up when printing without requiring the user to turn on print background images in their browser and this solution will work in all major browsers google-chrome safari firefox ie

23923720
width	height	background-image	background-position
the issue of background-image background-position and width height properties being used exclusively to position and size sprite images is solved by replacing with the properties content url clip rect margin-top and margin-left along with some overrides

23923720
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but this only solved the problem in google-chrome and safari with no indication from the community that firefox or ie would be supporting this webkit property any time soon

23923720
width	height
i setup an excel sheet to do any sprite modifications as long as the formatting above is used and we only need 3 variables to replicate this process -img path width and height i will update with exact formula in those cells if people request those details but for now here is the result after a bit more clever replace all commands in notepad++ to remove spaces between integers and px and adding some carriage returns .

23923720
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome behave similarly the image is moved by limiting printable area edges but the clip remains in the spot is was designated so wrong or no icon is shown

23923904
uilabel	uitextview
the other option was to use a uilabel for read-only text but you miss a lot of great functionality from uitextview

23923922

if we use entity framework as orm thinking of calling savechanges after each record from xml is inserted updated in entities in for each loops and call save changes outside of for-loop

orientdb	neo4j
regarding the two other choices i am adding here are here two comparison maps between neo4j and orientdb detailing the features of each of them

23923974
orientdb	neo4j
in very short orientdb supports full replication while it seems neo4j does not natively but neo4j would be more widely adopted and has better documentation

23924234
fileinputstream	objectinputstream	fileinputstream	fileoutputstream	fileinputstream	objectoutputstream	objectoutputstream	objectinputstream	fileoutputstream	objectinputstream	fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
if you are writing the file using objectoutputstream and fileoutputstream then you need to read it using objectinputstream and fileinputstream

23924243
cos	sin
you mixed up sin and cos

23924263
int	double
outersum and tvar are double s the rest are int s

promoting from and int to a long in theory seems more efficient to me than promoting from and int to a double

23924488
clang	llvm
let me once again point to the llvm clang samples repository

23924535
prepare	execute
there is a common misconception about how the placeholders in prepare statements work they are not simply substituted in as escaped strings and the resulting sql execute

23924535
prepare	execute
instead a dbms asked to prepare a statement comes up with a complete query plan for how it would execute that query including which tables and indexes it would use which will be the same regardless of how you fill in the placeholders

23924592
prepare	execute
the other thing wrong with your code is that you don t check for errors from prepare or execute

23924592
prepare	execute
that would mean that you should expect prepare and execute to return false if they find an error

23924596
folder	directory
i m trying to add a directory directly to a github repo but the standard git add -a doesn t seem to be adding the folder for some reason

23924931
getter	setter
one of the few important reasons for using property getter setter methods is that it allows you to enforce certain conditions for a property such as to never be nil

23924931
getter	setter
you can easily ensure that properties such firstname are never nil by implementing a custom getter or setter method in a single place and then you don t have to bother with the weird ternary operators whenever you access such properties

23924952
subtract	add
it works with only lowercase letters and exploits the fact that the ascii values of the letters are consecutive ascii a is 97 which is why i subtract 97 when assigning an index and add it back when printing out the letter

23925223
innodb	myisam	postgresql	mysql
it s still nowhere near as fast as raw access to an isam table like myisam but it s probably pretty similar to what mysql s doing when you use a handle on an innodb table internally because it has to solve similar problems to postgresql

23925223
post	put
if you re prepared to put in the couple of months of work required to learn and implement it you could study the sources and then post a preliminary proposal on pgsql-hackers

submit	submission
if i understand your requirement correct me if i am wrong then you need a mechanism where there are several tasks and you need maximum n tasks to perform in parallel and the other tasks should be in queue waiting but once you submit a task then you do not want to hang around or keep the thread submission task busy and it can carry on with it s work

i have set the row count and column count but somehow i need to set a fixed cell size somehow uniform - as in cell width total num of columns and cell height total num of rows

23938829
width	height
i want to do this so that when i set height and width of imageview to match_parent the image view doesn t expand beyond the cell size and the layout looks uniform

23938853
post	get
php works with post get submit methods

23938861
width	height
so in your case you would apply a fixed width and a fixed height to your outer block

23938861
width	height
if it is not possible to applying fixed width and height css hs small tricks depending on the design

23938907
ubuntu	linux
the following x86 assembly code assembles fine and it used to run flawlessly on my school s linux server but when applying the same code to my linux virtual machine ubuntu 14.04 all of a sudden it causes a segmentation fault

i suspect that i have a problem with different versions of npm and nodejs not playing nice together since i installed bower with a different version of npm that the one i have installed now

23939078
post	get
the same patch demotes the message from a warning to a log so just upgrading chrome to any post march-2013 version would get rid of the yellow triangle

23939185
children	parent
i ve seen a lot of plugins and techniques but most of them fall flat because they don t allow a 2nd-level page to act as both a link to a page and a parent of children in a sub-sub-menu

23939185
children	parent
some techniques address this by having an arrow icon that exposes the children menu items while clicking on the parent page name goes to the actual page.

23939242
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
the problems starts when i show a uiwindow over a uiviewcontroller that sets the status bar to hidden

if we re speaking about the user experience in general client side technologies jquery ko ng offer a much better user experience becasue the page is much more responsive it s easy to show hide elements set the focus make trivial calculations remote validations.

23939395
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
apparently datatable implements inotifypropertychanged but does not implement inotifycollectionchanged

23939481
dependencyobject	uielement
if you have used data binding in .net you can think of widget as a control or uielement and eventdispatcher as dependencyobject

23939483
puma	thin
i have a puma server running for my faye and a thin server running via rails s

23939527
sorting	grouping
note this method sorts the entire data by grouping so if you really need a method without sorting this doesn t apply but it gets you the 3rd lowest value per state

23939545
width	height
instead of using border-width use width and height of the album class which wraps your images

23939553
writetofile	nsdata
you need to serialize your custom objects one way to do it is the following in your custom class write the following two methods encoding decoding each property that you want to persist then i am not sure if writetofile will actually use this but i do know that you can create nsdata from your object and write it to file with the following method

23939753
ant	maven
the reason most tools like the gmavenplus groovyc ant task don t support this is that groovy s official model classes don t keep the javadoc which holds maven 2 s annotation-like markers

23939812
put	get	post	get	post	put
next setup your web api controllers to implement apicontroller and start adding your get post put etc methods that are accessed by using those verbs against the endpoint you created

23939877
versioning	upgrade
so i am going to go back to the user and suggest that they may need to upgrade their uc browser to the latest versioning

23939891
mapquest	directions
obviously google mapquest and others have access to this information and use it to give you driving directions but i d like to do something else with the data

23939895
libreoffice	uno
libreoffice has api called uno for controlling it from another process

23939913
hash	md5
i am uploading a file using php which uses md5_hash to create a md5 hash of the file

when i upload that same file to other online md5 hash generators they return something else

23939916
int	chars
what i am trying to do is cast a group of int and floats to a chars then combine them into a single chars

23939935
ubuntu	debian	fastboot	adb
if you are running debian ubuntu 12.04 follow this guide to add the ppa for the 64bit fastboot and adb

23939938
getter	setter
a property like defined above acts like a getter and setter

23939940
udp	tcp
you seem to be using a stream-type socket tcp as opposed to udp

23939953
int	chars
if you look in the standard library you ll find that most functions that deal with chars values like getchar return int results

23939953
int	chars
i don t know what your test function is supposed to do but it s likely that it would be better for it to return int rather than chars

23939953
int	chars
if plain chars is signed then the value returned by test is chars -1 which is promoted to -1 of type int and then compared to -1 also of type int -- and the test succeeds

23939953
int	chars
so test returns chars 255 which is promoted to int -- and of course

23939953
int	chars
since chars values when used in expressions are usually going to be promoted to int anyway you might as well use type int in the first place

23939953
int	chars
if what you really want is a very narrow signed int you can use signed chars and any promotion to int will preserve the correct value -- but there s no much point in using signed chars rather than int unless you need to save space for large arrays

23939991
comparator	comparable
note that you will either need to implement comparable in the dataelement or specify a comparator to the sort method in order to control the sorting

23940024

i m using this code to show hide multiple divs fiddle

23940055

the show and hide effects also took some fine-tuning

23940154
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
besides configuring an ec2-instance you can also use the paas-solution of amazon-web-services namely elastic beanstalk

23940160
getter	setter
i think the issue is that the java stub generated contains getter and setter for id and name but doesn t include the constructors from the ast

23940166
width	height
currently your image is overlaying everything because the width and height of image is equals to your frame

23940188
thin	unicorn
i ve tried it under rails server thin and unicorn

23940196
width	height
important for you to know is that sprite.getwidth and sprite.getheight simply return the width height of the bitmap that the sprite holds

in ios web browsers safari google-chrome etc. when you click into an input field and the keyboard displays it keeps the viewport the same size but slides it up partially out of view

23940490
width	height
i am suspecting that the use of setlayoutparams inside customview classes may be stopping the scroll because i set the width height of all views after they are created

23940571
post	get
however you can get it from the global post object

23940601
super	abstract	superclass	subclassing
then the subclassing can t override the superclass method so it can t decide not to call super but it must override the abstract method to be concrete

post	get
when you try to store the form submitted values such as post or get it is really a good habit to check if the value is really sent

23940691
post	get
also mailchimp specifies that it is better to use post instead of get

23940695
for-loop	loops
by the way that second for-loop is redundant unless the city element can have children. you just need to loops through the list that you retrieved via getelementsbytagname

23940709
min	max	minimum	max
it forces the x axis to have a minimum of 0 and you can then set your min max intervals as desired or leave them to be determined automatically

highcharts	highstock
i can t use highstock just highcharts

23940798
width	height
you can check the textfieldrect sizes in ios 7 the height and width value will swap when device is in landscape mode so you need to change them on your formula

23940808
client-side	server-side
using onclientclick in c# is creating a javascript function client-side called edit_button_click but you are defining that function server-side in your code-behind

23940824
client-side	server-side
you re confusing client-side and server-side events

23940847
innodb	myisam
i always recommend innodb as a default choice over myisam

23940847
innodb	myisam
innodb when tuned well performs better than myisam

23940847
innodb	myisam
even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that innodb is on par with or faster than myisam under most workloads

23940847
innodb	myisam
innodb has continued to be improved since then while myisam has been stagnant and is gradually being phased out

mp3	ogg
..extract all mp3 ogg links from that example word

23940905
folder	directory
you can launch your ipython notebook in the folder that you want the server to have access to and the user won t be able to go to the parent directory but you should realize that when the user launches a kernel they will be able to chdir to any folder in the file system

23940929
children	parent
i have left lazy loading on as a parent can have many children and i don t want to always load the children

springboard	tweak
take a look at corefoundation s notification center api where you will be using cfnotificationcenterpostnotification in your application and cfnotificationcenteraddobserver in a tweak injected into springboard

23941075
getter	setter
furthermore the object is read only â it only has getter not setter

23941096
multiplying	division
the if for the positive p has been avoided as well by using integer division p 2 and multiplying with the remainder value if it exists p 2

23941148
move	drag
in the view you display chessboard and with javascript implement drag drop logic to move pieces

23941255
pull	push
you would clone the repository to a private repository giving you both access and you could push and pull with that central repository to your hearts content

23941255
pull	push
you could also set up local clones where you can push and pull between you but not push to the central repository

23941255
pull	push
here you would clone the repository on your local machines and then change the .hg hgrc file to point to your friends repo so that you can both pull and push with each other

23941255
pull	push
easier to set up doesn t involve having to push and pull between computers potentially behind firewalls and routers and gives you all the power you re used to from your normal central repository

min	max
i have replaced my data with a generated dataset of the same shape with the same value min and max

23941409

serializable	deserialization
if you use serializable directly the client needs to provide the deserialization and serializable code

23941720
serializable	deserialization
define a concrete class prototypeutility with a static method copy that implements the serializable and deserialization in one place

23941720
implements	extends
a class which needs to be a prototype can either implements prototype itself and use prototypeutility to do the work or can just extends abstractprototype

popover	tooltip
essentially it turns footnotes into clickable buttons that generate popover with tooltip pointing at the button

23941997
popover	tooltip
the script also needs to be able to reliably calculate the space between the footnote button and the top bottom of the visible page so that the popover can be positioned on top or bottom depending on which has enough space and to the right left of the visible page so that the tooltip can be positioned to actually point at the popover

additional question could someone explain me what actually - 0 does i know without it a chars casted to int would be and ascii representation and you need to add it to get actual number

23942019
division	multiplication
selecting a power of 2 allows the processor to use bit shifting instead of multiplication or division

23942019
division	multiplication
bit shifting by a power of 2 is usually faster than multiplication or division

23942019
division	multiplication
using powers of 2 as the base or denominator allows code to use bit shifting instead of multiplication or division

23942019
division	multiplication
division and multiplication take more operations than shifting and thus shifting is faster

23942196
width	height
change the 900 and the 640 values - width height

23942196
width	height
in appdelegate.cpp you should edit applicationdidfinishlaunching to add where the 900 and 640 are your width and height

hash	salt
with the code above you get a bcrypt hash with a unique salt but the consequence is that you cannot make a query and search for the password-hash

23942542
width	height
i then tried to set the width hoping it would expand vertically acting as height but that has an odd effect of causing the width of my parent container to expand as well

folder	directory
the working directory points to your project folder which is also where the fabfile.py is located at least with my configuration

23942630

23943176
width	height
you dont need the width and height attributes anymore they should now responsively conform to the size of the container they are in though you might need to define the size of the container because sometimes chrome will render extra white space below an svg if not defined

23943176
width	height
edit defining the width and height of the svg in css works too

23943180
post	get
i ve tried a few of the network tweaks recommended in a few other post as well though i get the impression they couldn t connect to the device at all

if you search replace the single-quotes for double-quotes within the entire command it should work as expected

23943254
uilabel	uibutton
if you wanted to do it all in interface builder you could place two uilabel where you want them in the view and then lay a uibutton over the top of them

23943254
uilabel	uibutton
this will make the button clear so both labels show through and you can set the uibutton s ibaction to do whatever you want to the two separate uilabel

23943260

postgresql	vertica
i have never tried entity framework with vertica however one piece of advice i can give you is that vertica s connection handling is very similar to postgresql

23943561
postgresql	vertica
very often if you can get your client-side to connect to postgresql it will connect to vertica

23943575

then show or hide your original buttons and the new ones using bootstraps responsive classes

23943581
n-gram	words
i ve figured out how to return results on a partial words result using n-gram

23943584
client-side	server-side

next we look for apple and any character except a line break 0 or more times

23943783
for-loop	arrays
if you want to use indexofobject to grab an object at an index of the arrays you re iterating through you should use a regular for-loop

23943785
for-loop	arrays
i would probably use a for-loop rather than a foreach since you need the arrays index i would code it like this

23943836
width	height
if the lens is correctly centered on the sensor then u_0 and v_0 are the half of respectively width and height of image resolution

23943853
ubuntu	linux

i would like to develop a website with asp and run it on a ubuntu or debian server using mono

23943933
mono	xamarin.android
said that i m personally using ef with xamarin.android ios with sqlite and still had no problems so i assume using it with xamarin.mac will work and for extension mono 3.4.x should also work xamarin.mac uses the linq part from mono

after savetourl forsaveoperation for over writing is called my managed document directory and files in my documents folder are all automatically deleted

23944076
nginx	lighttpd	apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd
lastly with this solution you can use your service with any server which implements fastcgi apache nginx lighttpd and in any os if you don t do native calls of course

23944093
onfocus	onblur
i handle this by changing the cursor attribute of all underlying objects to pointer at the onfocus event for the select object and restore them at onblur event for the select object

23944127
portrait	landscape
i just learned that the border will show up in landscape mode but will not in portrait

23944147
for-loop	arrays
once you have completely read the file you iterate your arrays and do the same for-loop shown above

23944191
carrierwave	fog
the reason i m concerned is because we re using the same credentials in other parts of our app to do things that we definitely don t want arbitrary users to be able to do and fog carrierwave don t seem to provide a way to use one set of credentials for one operation and another elsewhere

23944224
min	max
in principle you can make an estimate of standard deviation from the mean min max and the number of elements in the sample

23944224
min	max
the min and max of a sample are if you assume normality random variables whose statistics follow from mean stddev number of samples

23944240

23944302
serializable	deserialization
the first one is one i can definitively answer if you are capable of running your application in debug mode and stepping through the code you should be able to use the debugger to step through the serializable deserialization and examine the contents of the variable using a watch

23944303
pyzmq	zerorpc
you may either use zeromq directly if you check examples for pyzmq you will find they are really short and easy while serving very well in many difficult scenarios but today i will show use of zerorpc library which makes remote calls even simpler

23944387
post	get
using many examples here on so as well as others like this blog or this so post i still cannot get past the windows classpath limit

23944387

folder	directory
i saved the following in svndel.bat in my svn bin directory set in my path environment so it can be called from any folder at the command prompt

23944549
integer	unsigned
since there is no wider integer type than unsigned long the compiler promotes -1 to unsigned

23944549
integer	unsigned
i can t recall whether this is undefined behavior but on ios and mac os x it has the effect of treating the 2 s complement bit pattern of -1 as an unsigned integer

23944549
integer	unsigned
that bit pattern as an unsigned integer is the maximum unsigned integer value

23944556
post	get
i am using actionscript http services to communicate with the server with get post calls

23944593
serializable	deserialization
i have unit tests in the business layer to convince me that json serializable deserialization of the class in question works as expected

23944611
mamp	wamp
apache or if you like go for wamp or lamp or mamp depending on the platform you are using

23944618
client-side	server-side
so i guess angular uses the jade file without it being pre-processed but if i understand correctly angular is purely client-side and the jade pre-processor sits on the server-side

23944620
bmp	png	gif	png	gif	bmp	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
however the bitmap class accepts these formats bmp gif exif jpg png and tiff

23944620
bmp	png
i feel like if the bitmap class makes data modifications to the stream then it would have to decompress the stream which should make the bitmap class take the same amount of memory working with bmp streams as when it works with png streams despite the fact that the png streams is smaller

23944631
google-chrome	safari
whenever i use something in my terminal that requires a websocket to google-chrome or safari livereload node-inspector karma i get the following console error error during websocket handshake status line contains embedded null not sure if this is the right place to ask this question but any help would be appreciated

all examples of flexbox i ve seen either holds the height constant when the width changes or grows enough to contain its contents

23944935
put	get	post	get	post	put
restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit

23944935
post	put
as a recommendation use post to send temporary data or files and put to store it permanently it makes more sense to anyone using that api

23945001
build.gradle	gradlew
with gradlew you can enable it in build.gradle

23945002
mouse	keyboard
therefore the webview is still drawn on the screen although not responsive to mouse or keyboard

23945228
mousemove	mousedown
the sync classes give you useful information based on simpler events such as mousedown and mousemove

23945228
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
mousedown mousemove mouseup touchstart touchmove touchend

23945257
for-loop	arrays
second your for-loop needs to range over valid index values which are from 0 to arrays s length - 1

23945286
shadowing	named
only possible place for such code is hiding shadowing member of parent class with the same named

23945297
jobs	cron
that is you sign up for your cron jobs to run under the user cron.dguertin instead of just dguertin

23945297
jobs	cron
it is also usually not recommended to use these but in some cases such as with cron jobs or other batch jobs you don t have much choice

23945350
melt	reshape
i have basic knowledge of using melt and reshape but it is not obvious for me how to apply such reshaping in my case

23945388
put	get
so you should probably just get rid of the partial to save on rendering time and put this directly into your form

23945434
qvboxlayout	qwidget
i have a derived class from qwidget that uses a qvboxlayout with 2 items both of which are a qlabel

23945434

superclass	subclassing
i should have mentioned that i will need to be able to polymorphically access the subclassing through pointers to superclass

23945591
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
you can loops through the arrays using a for-loop and exec a query for each one radu vlad answer or you can build a long query and execute it once something like this

23945681
put	get
again my only goal here is to get information about all disks and partitions on computer and put them in an array so i can get info about them and manipulate them

23945712

23945941
put	get
i just don t get where i m supposed to put these

23945946
put	get
one issue is that if i put this cache killing code into a rails model callback i could potentially get multiple copies of the worker request at once

23945947
width	height
each contains an absolutely positioned div with 100 width and height so when displayed it fills the entire div

23945973

mouseleave	mouseenter
adding the mouseleave callback within the mouseenter callback is a bad idea

23946005
inherited	properties
and have them all inherited basic properties and methods from basespaceship

23946022
put	get
if you put a bunch of media files in that folder before inserting it into the emulator they will get picked up and added to the appropriate libraries

23946028
int	chars
as we know itoa tries to convert an int in any base but to chars array which has fix size i am trying to find an alternative which can do the same work but convert to string with base 2 in c++

23946042
mouseleave	mouseenter
you are attaching the mouseleave inside the mouseenter and i guess you didn t wont that

23946066
java.util.date	simpledateformat
first you need to use simpledateformat to parse the date string to a java.util.date object

23946066
subtract	add
second after getting the date object you can easily add subtract some time and get another date object

23946088
octal	binary
optparse supports the 0b 0 and 0x prefixes on integer arguments to signify binary octal and hexadecimal respectively

23946088

i need to support some additional prefixes including for binary and for hex

23946108
put	get
console.log statements put through the function calls indicate that the cy function is getting properly called and executed and the browser console doesn t seem t throw any errors however i cannot get the graph to show

23946117
mouseleave	mouseenter
to fix that i replaced the original mouseenter and mouseleave events with one which is similar to on but only catches on the event once

23946117
mouseleave	mouseenter
i then put the mouseenter event inside the mouseleave so we can continue doing the hover effect on the after we leave the active div

23946131
gmail	outlook.com
email clients like gmail and outlook.com sprinkle in a little lotus

23946135

incompatible conditional operand types int and boolean

23946261
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
my problem is how to create a default value in a subclassing for an inherited properties

23946263
listview	gridview
unlike gridview or listview if you use linearlayout it wont be reused when view draw outside screen

23946348
mpfr	mpc
gmpy2 uses the gmp mpfr and mpc libraries for multiple-precision calculations

23946362

23946375
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i m using an uinavigationcontroller with its default uinavigationbar and i m trying to turn the translucent effect off so i can have a solid color on it

23946392
int	boolean
the reason evaluates to true is that the int 0 when cast as a boolean converts to false

23946452
public	protected
consider using protected or public for your data members or provide getter also protected or public methods for those values in the car class

23946455
namenode	hdfs
namenode holds the meta data for the hdfs namespace

23946455
namenode	hdfs
namenode stores the hdfs

23946460
getter	setter

23946496
int	double
i changed my bitmap locations from rect s to a new positions class i created that uses double instead of int to simulate sub-pixel movement

23946553
superclass	subclassing
this is useful when you want to be able to perform the same or similar operations with different inputs and it has nothing to do with overriding which is useful when you have a subclassing whose implementation of a particular method needs to be different than that of its superclass

23946571
pbkdf2	hash
even with the iteration counts adjusted so that the time to compute a single pbkdf2 hash is the same you will have to hash 2 96 times as many random inputs to get a match with pbkdf2-sha-256 than with pbkdf2-sha-1

23946571
pbkdf2	hash
the limited password search space makes the size of the hash irrelevant as long as it s big enough and so the only thing affecting the difficulty of an attack is the time to compute a single pbkdf2 hash

23946571
pbkdf2	hash
besides pbkdf2 has a way of stretching the output length to be longer than the underlying hash length so you can actually make the two have an equivalent output space

23946571
pbkdf2	hash
furthermore because pbkdf2 uses many iterations of the hash combining rounds of hash output with the password over and over it s difficult to extend an attack on the hash into an attack on pbkdf2

23946583
dns	spf
the usual tests include reverse dns match spf record match clean from dnsbl and of course the domain must exist

23946615
google-chrome	firefox
the below sample code is working fine in firefox and google-chrome as well not tested for others

23958321
int	chars
so at the time of creation it converts it s values to a factor which is stored as a unique int for each observed chars string

23958321
int	chars
then when you go to do the assignment to the master data.frame that int 1 is converted to a chars 1

23958330
button	checkbox
i am dynamically creating various windows controls where the user supplies the text that will display on a button alongside a checkbox inside a label etc

23958334
nexus	artifactory
so only the maven remote repository artifactory or nexus will put it into the correct folder structure

23958340
folder	directory
i wanted to backup all the files that are smaller than 100 kb in my home directory and keep the file structure the folder tree and timestamp during the backup

23958413
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this works fine for google-chrome and ie but not firefox and safari

23958418
next	except
the label end is followed by d which deletes the current line and moves to the next cycle except there is no next cycle when the match is in effect so there s nothing left to print

23958428
post	get
i have a a view and several routes to this view get post ...

23958452
folder	directory
the only solution that worked for me was deleting the derived data folder of the hanging project i.e the derived data folder in above directory library developer xcode deriveddata

23958472
boost	allocator
and unless you use some funky allocator with non plain reference const_refeference and pointer types any boost container basic_string specialization has contiguous memory

23958490
int	chars
respectively evaluate to 100 000 with a type of long int and 100 000.00 of type float assuming 5 000 000 is a long and 50 is an int chars whatever

23958528
textblock	itemscontrol
instead of putting the items as textblock with hard coded commas you would likely use an itemscontrol see this answer

23958541
children	parent
i m using menu blocks with fixed parent and because of this only the children are rendered.

23958571
vim	sublimetext
one possible explanation is that the regular expression engine used in sublimetext is different than the engine used in vim

23958641
vim	emacs
i can get emacs to work by editing c.ipythonwidge.editor but i m not sure how to change it to use vim as the editor

23958662
children	parent
and any subsequent modification of the properties of one child will not be propagated to other children as even though all are children of the class they have no way of accessing properties of their parent which in this case is both a literal parent and a container

23958791
box-sizing	border-box
i ve found in the past that the css style box-sizing border-box

23958791
width	margin
for my code i didn t actually need any padding between my columns so i just set a negative margin on my columns to offset the extra width

23958798
int	chars
in short because chars are just numbers you can cast between int and chars and fundamentally nothing changes as long as you don t start messing with negatives and numbers possibly outside the range of the chars data type

23958798
int	chars
more precisely chars are like unsigned shorts see this question and obviously you can work without too many problems between unsigned shorts and int

23958848
folder	directory
go to your document root or www root directory or folder

23958871
express	node.js
i m just starting with node.js and express and i m doing a simple https server

23958896
for-loop	loops
by breaking out of the for-loop with break the else clause will be skipped and the infinite while loops will continue

23958928
folder	directory
2 you do not have a project in your workspace with the same name but you do have a folder or file on your hard-drive stored in the workspace directory that has the same name as your project

23959018
width	height
looks like sencha needs to know the height and width of the components that i m trying to put to my ext.panel object

23959018
width	height
after setting height and width for the ext.carousel component its contents show up properly

23959019
firefox	safari
and so on for firefox and safari

23959039
junit	testng
in my project we have both testng and junit actually spock tests

23959039
junit	testng
after a little research i found out that surefire-testng provider runs both testng and junit tests

23959039
junit	testng
well this was not a good solution either because it turned out testng provider runs junit tests but doesn t provide results in

23959098
factors	matrix	loops	if-statement	eigenvalue	diagonal
writing loops without eigen using directly the formulas for eigenvalue and eigenvectors of a hermitian matrix and an if-statement to check if the off diagonal is zero is a factors of 5 faster

23959106
express	node.js
webstrom didn t start your node.js server but serves static pages by its own internal http server which doesn t know anything about node.js and express

23959106
express	node.js
as lena suggested there is a way to configure your express node.js as a server known to webstorm

23959106
express	node.js
i haven t tried it but i suppose you can then just press the run-button and maybe the node.js plugin in webstorm is as intelligent to know the static-maps in express and know how to map an html-file to a web application url and open the page in the browser with the url served by your node.js application

23959106
express	node.js
of course node.js express is able to serve static files as well but imo placing something like nginx in front of node.js clustered bring a bunch of advantages for production sites load-balancing ssl-offloading avoid jsonp in many cases performance easier deployment updates availability

23959133
min	max
a will give this to you as will a bitarray indexed on max - min + 1

23959133
min	max
the absolute fastest ad-hoc solution would probably be a simple array indexed on max - min + 1 as usr suggests

23959165
hex	binary
given what you have already got converting the binary data into hex format might work for the insert as long as the length of the sql text doesn t exceed max_allowed_packet

23959213
client-side	server-side
the nc is dedicated to the business of mapping between client-side and server-side entity property names

unfortunately you have to export your module a into a jar and add it to the war web-inf lib directory of module b

23959293
matlab	simulink
i am writing the application control app in matlab simulink

23959293
matlab	simulink
i would like to use a configuration file to map the variables that matlab simulink generates with my hardware registers for gpio for instance

23959309
factors	mean
i m not sure i understand exactly what you mean by print all the levels of variables with the class factors p and q in cc but i think you are looking for subset

23959359
width	height
first the width height are not numbers so the yscale and xscale ranges are invalid that s why you get the nan in the line path

23959383
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
we have a fairly complex application that has been working perfectly fine in all browsers google-chrome firefox safari ie 10 and we just tried to test it in ie 11 and it simply doesn t work at all with no errors thrown

the inline width and height attributes within the tag shouldn t have the px unit in them

23959481
subtract	add
simply add 0x8000000000000000ul to each number before taking the unsigned average subtract it after taking the result and use an unchecked cast back to int64 to get a signed average

23959481
multiplying	division
it might possibly be further enhanced by replacing suml 3 with though the latter would depend upon the jit optimizer it might know how to replace a division by 3 with a multiplying and its code might actually be more efficient than an explicit multiplying operation

23959504
opcache	apc
this is especially true when you have opcode caches like apc or opcache because the first step can be skipped on subsequent occasions because the structure of the code is exactly the same

23959525
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested this with google-chrome 34 ie 11 firefox 25 - using express.js server and http basic authentication

0 evaluates to true the child execute execl then while the father steps forward to the next fork

23959538
range	max
and i have used 3 kinds of values 1st mode 2nd mean and finally most repeated value in histogram which means that i used something like a b hist data then mayor value b a max a and is very important to do not use a predefined range

23959554
hide	show
i ended up using jquery show hide and call resize after

23959558
post	get
in the first case if you want to communicate using an xmlhttprequest or other libraries that use this such as jquery s get or post you d need to make sure that your c++ java application starts a small webserver

23959561
post	put
but this still returns me all six post i have seen this answer but i don t think i should have to go through or extend the model in the middle of code just to append an id that and i use the model for the post put and delete actions while i use the collection for fetching data

division	modulo
where denotes modulo and denotes the whole part of division

23959708
dictionary	map
use a dictionary to map entries to a common sum

23959732
jar	war
use ironcamar.xml and package the lower version oracle jar file inside the ear file.package the driver jar and the war inside the ear file .configure jboss-deployment file to specify deployment structure.the war file will point to the packaged jar for the db connection and this will allow the lower version of oracle to work properly as it did in lower version of jboss

23959766
for-loop	arrays
so for my for-loop if a li is clicked the if statement will run to push in the updated codes onto the elements of the index in the contacts arrays

asterisk	pbx
i have an incoming call from ericsson pbx to asterisk through h323 trunk and i want to transfer this call back to ericsson and then shutdown asterisk

23959839
portrait	landscape
to achieve this i have adding a modal of a full screen view controller when the user rotates from portrait to landscape

23959839
portrait	landscape
when i dismiss the modal the tabbarviewcontroller is still rotated landscape when the phone is in the portrait orientation

23959839
portrait	landscape
the navigation bar tab bar and view on the screen do not rotate stay landscape when held in portrait

23959881
udp	tcp
i have had proof-of-concept success with a similar construct as this but where there is a program which reads the udp datagrams and turns them into tcp stream with 16-bit length prefixes a stream of length bytes length bytes etc and obviously does the reverse as well

23959908
hide	show
for my solution i wanted to be able to use the switch to hide and show an overlay layer that disables access to specified content the user is viewing if the user determines the section does not apply

children	parent
i am generating an advance link using a custom html helper to add new children for a parent object

23959959
public	protected
note that there is no api that exposes this type directly - its arguable that this class could have been made protected or package private instead of public

23959993
children	parent
how to force parent to expand with children width

23960015
width	height
typically you d choose the du and dv to be 1 width and 1 height of the depth image

i am new to elasticsearch logstash and kibana as well

23960081
elasticsearch	kibana
now the big question is when i go to localhost 9200 i see the dummy data that elasticsearch shows and kibana dashboard shows no data

23960100
width	height
there are also other options like setting width height extension etc for the url which you can find here

23960354
vb.net	vb6
had a problem using custom user controls in vb.net after migrating a project from vb6

23960355
vb.net	vb6
the issue was if the user control in vb6 used the usercontrol_initproperties method it does not get called automatically in vb.net therefore you need to call this method here

23960377
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing class subclassing of superclass sorry for the naming mess

23960377
ivar	subclassing
this subclassing however has an hidden category here s the mess where no compile error is given where the sharedobject ivar is overridden with the exact same name

23960391
webclient	httpwebrequest
after all webclient is just a convenient wrapper around httpwebrequest

23960410
wxpython	wxformbuilder
am new to python wxpython i created a text two frames using wxformbuilder

i m trying to put this in a directive so you could call it multiple times so if you wanted to add subtract or do combination of the two for multiple numbers you could

23960494
post	get
i understand how post and prefix work or at least i thought so but i don t get how the variable gets incremented twice

23960499
superclass	subclassing
when you then call usesharedobject on subclassing which doesn t implement usesharedobject the superclass s implementaiton of usesharedobject is run

23960731
opera	google-chrome
are obsoletes and they seems to cause issues in google-chrome it happens that by the time when this plugin was created google-chrome and opera have issues when printing an iframe content

23960731
opera	google-chrome
as of today that s not longer an issue and since opera uses webkit as google-chrome i must assume this also happens to work on opera as well

23960738
width	height
create an object that holds your text s characteristics x y width height textcontent

23960793
calloc	malloc
a second alternative to malloc is the calloc function

23960793
calloc	malloc
the call to calloc is slightly different than the call to malloc

23960793
free	malloc
in conclusion the malloc and free functions are perfect for creating dynamic arrays in c

23960793
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
remember to always call free on memory that you reserved with malloc or calloc

postgresql	mysql
i managed to create my app with a mysql db but then when i tried to generate a scaffold it started to nag about me needing to install postgresql which i thought was wierd but i did that and installed all the required libraries

23960850
postgresql	mysql
why would it bother me about postgresql when i said in my rails new command that i wanted to use mysql

23960864
subclass	accessor
the declaring class typically avoids calling its own accessor in init to avoid accidentally calling an overridden accessor in a subclass that might rely on the consistency of data you haven t initialized yet

23960864
accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
your superclass on the other hand should be completely consistent by the time the subclassing s init is run so there is no problem using superclass accessor at that time

23960940
put	get
at first i get metadata from db for all tables and create queries dml and all posible select for 1 table from existing data in db and put them to queue

23960967
keydown	keyup
but it seems you want to advance your game state at a point where there is no user input between a keydown and an keyup event

23961010
width	height
x denotes the column horizontal co-ordinate y denotes the row vertical co-ordinate and w h denote the width and height of the bounding box

23961040
width	height
p.s it works with everything that has a set height and width ex

23961060
width	height
every product has a different set of relevant dimensions width height density etc.

keydown	keyup
right now the view picks up submit there is no submit button and keyup keydown for navigating the dropdown

23961165
invalidoperationexception	objectdisposedexception
i would view the objectdisposedexception much like i view the collection-modified invalidoperationexception of if some condition either dispose or modification of a collection respectively would prevent a method from behaving normally the method is allowed to throw the indicated exception and is not allowed to behave in some other erroneous fashion

23961168
glm	predict
for each fold we train a glm model using the training data then use the model to predict output of testing data

23961181
zoo	xts
2 using holtwinters uses ts data not zoo dates or xts

23961269
getter	setter
i would use process.env or if you are using nconf put it into the app configuration as jordan said globals are bad idea also if you don t want to include nconf or any other conf module or use process.env then you can create a module and export a set of getter and setter to handle the value

23961270
post	get
the parameters all appear to be get not cookie nor post

23961346
restrict	shared
it can be shared by multiple apps by the same developer if desired or restrict to that app

23961349
int	chars
my question why does the program loop infinitely when a chars is entered instead of an int and how can i prevent this behavior

23961360
subtract	add
i am basically trying to write a function which will take an ipv6 address and add or subtract an arbitrary number of ip addresses to it

23961360
subtraction	addition
i have provided an sscce below which demonstrates the problem - it basically converts from an inetaddress to a biginteger and back again - the idea is to perform the addition or subtraction from the biginteger in the middle

23961379
int	chars
if you already have all each chars in an array iterate over the entire array using whichever loop you want and check the int value of each chars

23961403
int	chars
the problem is that the function strtok_r returns a pointer to chars witch you are trying to assign to an array of chars so in order to make it work you have to declare your line and int variables as a pointer of chars then allocate the memory with malloc

23961406
division	multiplication
this method would also make it fairly simple to add multiplication or division options clicking the button could cycle through the options

23961443
width	height
when i export to svg i know each objects properties scalex scaley rotation centerx centery movedx movedy and width of svg document height of svg document but i can t seem to get it to export right

23961443
width	height
export it as rectangle x left y top width right-left height bottom-right

23961466
firefox	safari
on firefox 3.0 from 2008 it works on safari 3.1 from 2008 too - not a old browser problem

23961476
debian	linux
i am running debian wheezy linux on a core i3 processor 64-bit

23961490
activemq	rabbitmq
i am using activemq instead of rabbitmq but still with amqp protocol on the app publisher using log4net

23961493
ivar	subclassing
initializes the ivar declared in subclassing

23961520
viewmodel	caliburn
yes it s bind to the selectedcustomer defined in the viewmodel thanks to one of the caliburn s convention

23961534
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested on ie firefox google-chrome and safari and the audio file plays perfectly

23961534
wav	ogg	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg
the files ogg wav mp3 play perfectly alone as well so i m 100 sure the files are good and the paths are good too if the paths weren t correct the other browsers would not play

23961550
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
imported audiotoolbox audiotoolbox.h and avfoundation avfoundation.h in my header file

try-catch	exception-handling
the contents of each block is wrapped in a try-catch block that log the exception-handling then continue processing

23961641
int	chars
nsnumber etc. not fundamental c data types int chars

23961686
getter	setter
that eliminates a bunch of getter setter methods which really should not do anything for dto s

23961698
children	parent
or you could have a parent entity of a one-to-many relation with removed children deleted and new entities added

23961701
int	double
note that your other line passes the int literal 9 which is implicitly castable to a float double does not implicitly cast to anything see msdn so it compiles

23961752
coalesce	isnull
really you d probably pass rows in all cases or null to select all rows then null coalesce via isnull to select the count from the table to get all rows

23961780
operands	scalar
as soon as you have more then one key value pair in the map a comparison expression which expects scalar expressions as operands will fail

23961801
sorting	filtering
i ve changed the code a little so the sorting and filtering won t actually affect your model s state

23961851
for-loop	loops
that s the format of a for-loop not a while loops

23961866
memcpy	memcmp
for small copies it is not clear that you will win because implementations of memcmp and memcpy are themselves quite optimized and work with larger units of data than just bytes

23961928
memcpy	memcmp
memcmp and memcpy are very optimized

23961936
for-loop	loops
i thought it might be a scope issue-- like vba doesn t allow variables defined outside of a for-loop to be used in a for loop-- but page is utilized perfectly well earlier in loops

23961972
google-chrome	firefox
however they are not centralized in google-chrome and not displaying in firefox

23961981
google-chrome	firefox
with further investigation i notice that if i wait 2 minutes the cpu comes back from iis but then the web browser firefox or google-chrome takes up 99 cpu for another 2 minutes

23962004
post	get
for example if the array is really big you should use post request instead of get by using javascript or forms

23962033
post	get
if you get the error message your post are empty else something else is wrong

23962055
post	put
the thing is i need to put div class row before the first post closing the the second post with div and it should repeat with every new post

23962074
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop that is creating a variable each time through loops

23962075
width	height
in your case in order to make the absolute positioned element recognize percentage values you have to define the properties you want it to be relative width and height to the body

23962100
post	get
for example if you read an article copy the url and post it on facebook you get a small preview in the post of what the website is and what s on it

23962139
rspec	capybara
capybara provides this method to rspec

23962156
filesystems	fat
rfs is a fat 16 32 based filesystems with a sort of journalling system on it

23962187
post	get
this hook allows you to create custom handlers for your own custom get and post requests

you can simply adjust the alpha of the uipageviewcontroller s uipagecontrol

23962273
uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
give it the uipageviewcontroller s uipagecontrol

23962273
uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
you re very limited in what you can do to affect the uipageviewcontroller s uipagecontrol but you can at least achieve this with little effort

23962279
memcpy	memmove
a great example is the difference between memcpy and memmove

23962279
memcpy	memmove
you can always use slower memmove but you can use faster memcpy only if you know that src and dst aren t overlaping

23962288

it seems the script is not run from the same folder so it does not find pictures in the working directory

23962394
gsap	velocity.js
at least add velocity.js to it or the gsap plugin you don t even have to alter your js you just add it in and it replaces the animate function with a more efficient one

if i manually apply the min and max as attributes the date format works just fine

23962622
google-chrome	firefox
selenium tests did not work neither for me on firefox browser this is why i use google-chrome

rsa	dsa
for each certificate type rsa dsa ec accepted by the server find any public private key pairs in the key store which have been generated with the specified algorithm

23962749

so for example let us imagine you wish to connect to 2 servers one of which asks for dsa rsa or ec keys signed by verisign and one of which asks for rsa or dsa keys with no preferred cas

23962749
rsa	dsa
if you have one dsa key pair signed by verisign one dsa key pair signed by go daddy and one rsa key pair signed by your internal ca there will be no ambiguities in either case

23963130
width	margin
they will naturally overflow the container if they have margin too since margin does by default not get included in the width value

23963130
width	margin
what you could do if you want both space around the content and have the element fill its parent in width is removing the margin 5px and adding this code to .text-line

23963134
width	height
you ll need to ensure your element has some height and width however as background images are not content and do not affect the size of the element

23963151
datamodel	powerdesigner
a good database design tool such as sybase powerdesigner will allow you to create the design changes to the datamodel then generate the code to implement those changes

23963157
width	height
example re-sizing the browser from 990px by 537px to 990px by 270px the image will look like it never moved because the width height will expand or contract depending on the resolution of the browser

23963157
width	height
like i said i figured out to make the width of the image fluid just not the height but if you have a better way please share

23963169

23963408
cos	sin
in fact even in my own functions i use sin and cos functions provided by processing

further you can channel your inputstream into a datainputstream to do more specific tasks like reading int double strings etc

23963418
maven	pom.xml
in your case spring-context depends on spring-core and therefore when you declare spring-context in your pom.xml maven will automatically resolve the spring-core transitive dependency that way you don t need to declare the dependencies of your dependencies and so on

23963423
pthreads	fork
one possibility would be to use pthreads fork as it copies the whole process including the call stack but i d rather not use fork if possible

23963433

try-catch	exception-handling	put	get
thus you could put a try-catch block around your the contents of onstart and if an exception-handling is occurring create a text file in a folder you have permission to access your users folder for example and write the contents of the exception-handling to that file including the stack trace so you can get a clearer picture of what is going on

the latest test is made with google-chrome 35 firefox 29 opera 21 and internet explorer 11 on the same computer

but with the tested data it is faster than split in google-chrome and opera and about the same speed in firefox

23963668

with the tested data it is slower than regex in google-chrome and opera almost the same speed in firefox and medium in internet explorer

23963668
google-chrome	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox
if there is only one separator in the input string this is much slower in google-chrome firefox and opera

23963668
opera	google-chrome
but if there are multiple separators it is faster in google-chrome and opera

23963668
opera	google-chrome
almost the same as split to array but slightly faster in google-chrome and opera

23963674
apache	nginx
or they use nginx or apache to handle outside connections both http and https and redirect traffic to the node server which can then just run on http

23963677

udp	tcp
the error was assuming that udp and tcp have same structure of connection and initialization

23964007
udp	tcp
tcp servers and udp servers operate in very different ways

23964007
udp	tcp
so in your example no a server that is listening for tcp requests a tcp server will never receive a udp packet

23964007
udp	tcp
the port namespaces for tcp and udp are completely separate

23964044
width	height
the image itself you give the properties i mentioned edit the width and height according to the image size you have and edit margin-top and margin-left to offset it to fit it exactly to the position you wish and it will all work fluidly hope that helps

23964136
put	get
but it doesn t seem to put it in the right path as i still get

23964146
google-chrome	safari
the reason for that is because google-chrome browser has both google-chrome and safari inside of useragent however safari browser has safari only

23964146
google-chrome	safari
in order to do that i needed to check useragent for safari but exclude google-chrome this way it will guarantee safari browsers only

if you don t understand why learn about hash and salt or better let others handle personal information for you openid is one of the ways of moving the responsibility of securing sensitive data from you to google-scale companies

23964500
width	height
if you don t want to get the width and height of the body you can use window.innerwidth and window.innerheight

23964500
width	height
this should get the height and width of the entire window excluding any scrollbars or toolboxes

23964500
width	height
you can also use documentelement to get the width and height of the entire document

23964500
width	height
this may be the final answer that you are looking for but you can also find the width and height of the entire document by using document in jquery

superclass	subclassing
for a particular program i essentially have an abstract superclass with several different subclassing

23964646
inherited	subclassing
however creating instances of the subclassing and then calling the inherited method getname will yield null due to field shadowing

23964652
for-loop	loops
also notice loops starts at 1 instead of 0 to prevent you from having an extra shift and there s a check for non-zero loop_int to prevent the for-loop from executing at least once

23964667
free	memcpy
since you re in control of the stack memory you re free to memcpy it in order to preserve it

folder	directory
the directory is set up inside the folder called amazon and there is one level of 20 subfolders inside of it with 20 html files in each of those

however i think rest api in sales force might sometimes refer to an optional means for native apps to retrieve salesforce data from within force.com

23964805
try-catch	exception-handling
alternatively you can wrap it in a try-catch but it is better to attempt the parse and handle it without exception-handling if possible

but if string sequences are not acceptable and you need sequential numbers you can use xpath node position in xquery or xslt to generate a number based on the element s position in the whole document which will be unique

23965305
xslt	xquery
if you want to retain the existing ids and only generate sequential ones for the duplicates it will be a bit more complicated but you can achieve that with keys or xquery instead of xslt

23973896
disk	ram
now suppose most of the time you do computations repeated on large number of objects like summing a particular value in the object or transform it in some way updating certain fields then you ld like to organise it to pack the data together so as much as possible is on one cache line and you aren t loading from ram or disk all the stuff you rarely need or use like may be identification strings link pointers or other values you don t expect to need for a while

23974790
int	chars
which one is implementation specific - it depends on whether chars is signed or unsigned by default and which int can take the full range of chars

23974798
bower	npm
since bower is based on npm i d say the same applies there too

23974798
bower	npm
anyway to answer the question the following one-liner should work assuming npm i m not too familiar with bower

23975184
ord	chr
if the function finds a place where a mutation can happen then it copies the dna and lets the second one mutate note that a bytearray is an array of numeric values so i use chr and ord all the time to change between string and int

from here we combine every adjacent 2-bit solution into a 4-bit solution using for multiplication for addition and the relationships described above then every adjacent 4-bit solution into a 8-bit solution then every adjacent 8-bit solution into a 16-bit solution and finally every adjacent 16-bit solution into a 32-bit solution

23975992
int	chars
i also need a function which take as parameter a regex and a int number between 1 and the size calculated with the function above like position regex number and return what the type of the chars in that position number letter or symbol

23976022
width	height
then i resize the center to fit the text and then i resize the borders to fit the center s new width and height and finally i reattach the corners

23976023
int	chars
i usually aggregate them into a single big buffer if there are many small buffers such as chars int long element so copy is not expensive

23976058
put	get
i had to put it inside data on the start event of the other sortable and to get it back on receive event

23976058
post	get
let me know if it helps post your code if you can get anything better

23976071
int	chars
in java an implicit widening conversion will take place if you use a chars primitive type when an int type is expected

23976072
width	height
i want to set the width and height of the imageview to be 50 of the width of its parent

23976119
int	chars
you can get chars using int chr

23976139
width	height
i think that there is no way you can re-size your image in half of the parent s width and height in relativelayout but in linearlayout you can do it easily by layout weight

23976155
children	parent
that form also takes two parameters the name of the selector that will represent the child nodes and the literal path of the parent under which the resulting nodes are children

23976173
partialfunction	fold
travis brown proposed to write a matchexhaustive macro that inspects the partialfunction but doesn t think that it s worth the trouble when you ve got the fold

23976182
min	max
the max and min functions work by walking through an iterable and comparing each element in the iterable picking out the biggest or smallest for min element

23976182
minimum	max
we then compare the sublists based on their minimum value and pick out the max which is exactly what your question asked for

23976255
put	get
for example if i put it andy sam as input i want to get back ydna mas not mas ydna

23976267
integer	unsigned
what you re seeing is sign extension when the negative integer value is assigned to the unsigned long long

23976275
for-loop	arrays
could also use a for-loop to edit the same arrays

23976301
vim	emacs
you also have pico vim vi emacs and probably a host of others in the terminal

23976315
hash	salt
this though is burping up a object that contains a salt hash as well as the model values

23976423
toolchain	newlib
i m trying to build a toolchain for my hobby kernel but i m running into problems when building newlib

23976423
libc	newlib
whenever i try to run autoreconf in my kernels directory under newlib libc sys i get an error

aether	pom.xml	maven	pom.xml
you should use the maven gae plugin and specifying the relevant aether libraries as dependencies in your pom.xml file

23976520
button	checkbox
using setenabled and setdisabled you can either enable or disable a widget by toggling a button action checkbox without needing an intermediate slot to invert the value

23976523
bluetooth	usb
check out bluetooth may also be an option but i m not sure if it will get you to the latency you want- usb can

23976566
macports	homebrew
i m new to imagemagick and homebrew just converted from macports so i may be doing something completely wrong here

23976674
serializable	deserialization
you can override the readobject method of the serializable interface to custom handle the deserialization of your class

23976674
serializable	deserialization
finally everything you ever wanted to know about deserialization but were afraid to ask is covered in the java serializable specification

23976738
put	get
if you needed to do this frequently then it may be easier to put a class name on all the objects that you want to operate on at once and get all of them in a query based on class name with something like document.queryselectorall

23976766
min	max
edit first answer brought up a good point about the min max radius hint for hough

23976785
firefox	safari
this works as i intend it to in safari but in firefox i believe due to the fact that by default the browser caches input values from session to session it causes issues when refreshing the page and attempting to select users

23976786
atoi	strtok
instead of using sscanf on the line repeatedly you have to use strtok to get to the next location in the string and use either sscanf or atoi on the next location in the string

23976789
int	chars
it means that int foo chars

23976828
int	chars
i m copying an int enum and 4 floats into an unsigned chars buffer then reading them back out to make sure the process is correct

23976854
subtraction	multiplication
a close examination of this algorithm reveals that it requires only the operations of subtraction left shift multiplication by 2 set bit and test if positive or zero

23976856
flask	django
you could use a wrapper of some kind either a function class or a custom queryset that checks the current django flask session and switches the db to the appropriate connection

23976859
jobs	cron
if a machine has many cron jobs i recommend you to avoid start of cron job at minutes 0th or 30th because of expected overloading

23976913
subtract	add
the above code just uses 4 basic for loops to add subtract the specific values the specified amount of times

23976931
translation	localization
the use of placeholder tags is explained in the android localization checklist look under the section mark message parts that should not be translation

23976950
allocator	stl
to stl memory allocator specifically - all containers unless have implementation bugs are raii so won t cause memory leaks even when allocator thrown an exception

23976971
folder	directory
you should check it anyway by going to the parent folder of that .git directory and doing a git ls-files looking for a special entry a gitlink mode 160000

23976986
versioning	upgrade
versioning 2.1.x is for mvc 4 and versioning 2.2.0 was upgrade to mvc5

23976990
int	chars
it means that int foo chars

23976995
width	height
it accepts a size and prints an x with the char variable it receives of height and width of size

23976995
int	chars
the calling method printshape int maxsize chars display accepts the maximum size of the shape and goes in a loop sending multiples of 2 to the printcross method until it gets to the maximum

23976996
post	get
what i did is i created a post http request in jmeter and added the above form data as parameters and when running the test plan i get no errors but the comment is not added

press f12 in google-chrome or firefox with the firebug plugin installed and see if there are any errors

23977060
post	get
i have create a page template and post type games with taxonomies gamecategory but whenever i m trying to get the categories from gamecategory it is showing that it is an invalid taxonomy

23977070
width	height
you might want to try setting the canvases width and height properties

23977070
width	height
changing the width and height in css doesn t change the number of pixels in the canvas it only stretches the canvas

23977138
margin	text-align
you can wrap your flash object in a div and then give a margin 0 auto and text-align center for horizontal center or use positon absolute with left and right for vertical center

23977213
i2c	spi
i might have a i2c port implemented in hardware or perhaps implemented via bit-bang io or spi port

23977228
hide	show
so you just need to use the ngshow directive on the divs you want to show hide based on the selection

23977290
google-chrome	firefox
the following actually happens google-chrome only firefox works as expected

23977342
versioning	upgrade
you ll have to upgrade to a more recent compiler versioning and standard library implementation if you d like to use what you have in your snippet

23977365
express	node.js
i am working on a node.js project using express and socket.io on an embedded sheeva board node.js 0.10.12 running on busybox linux

versioning	upgrade
if one of your pdfs is encrypted you ll need to make sure you also upgrade the bouncycastle versioning

23977431
hide	show
it s not exactly what you asked for but i think a popover is a great way to show hide long content inside a table cell without affecting table layout example

23977496
draggable	droppable
i ve added jquery draggable and droppable and i can drag individual people to one of the locations and then update the database but i can t get it to work with selectable to allow multiple items to be selected

23977528
width	height
you should also set your canvas width height properties on the canvas element not in the css

23977528
width	height
what happened in your case is that without width height properties specified it defaulted to 300x150 in size so only rendering the top left corner of your image scaled up to 500x500 pixels via css

23977549
post	get
you can goto create related content block view based on terms in drupal 7 blog post to get step by step instruction to create this block view

23977552
for-loop	loops
regarding the for-loop i thinks it s just that it s not as easy to detect as the use of a false constant inside a while loops

23977570
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i have an elastic beanstalk running on amazon-web-services that is 64bit amazon linux 2013.09 running tomcat 7 java 7

23977624

and then iterate over elements and show them you need to hide all first

23977655
for-loop	loops
try to use array_merge foreach for-loop while loops etc

23977682
persian	left-to-right

ienumerable	idictionary
getting the type can be complex because igrouping idictionary and lookup also implement ienumerable i ve not included the code for checking these

23978030
move	drag
i am trying to move slider using drag and drop

23978054
portrait	landscape
the problem is if the app is only allowed to run in landscape orientation not when you use portrait or both

23978054
width	height
when i debug with the pc the height and width of the viewport is set correct

23978054
width	height
but when i unplug and play the app after 1-2 times the viewport.height becomes the devices width and the viewport.width becomes the device height which completely makes the game unplayable

23978054
width	height
when deploying from vs everything is good the viewport.width is the actual device width and the viewport.height is the actual device height

23978063
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
you can only attach an onclicklistener to an existing view and since there is no onitemclicklistener for pageradapters you need to attach the onclicklistener to the appropriate views from within the adapter s instantiateitem method

23978083
google-chrome	firefox
the page works correctly with google-chrome browser but firefox 29 doesn t display it when i am offline

23978131

23978151
jndi	jta
i have used jta datasource and i have configured the jndi in jboss standalone.xml file

23978161
ogre	irrlicht
if you want to use ogre or irrlicht engine which can also rely on opengl cegui also supports these two renderers via the ceguiogrerenderer and ceguiirrlichtrenderer

23978174
filesystems	hfs+
one notable exception is mac os x which is unix-based but uses a default filesystems type hfs+ that is not case sensitive

23978271
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my animation is working fine in firefox but in google-chrome and safari it is not supporting

23978280

the height seems to be working fine however i want to set the width of the bitmap to fit the whole width of the devicewhile keeping the aspect ratio

23978284
put	get
i am playing around with rails and angular and trying to get a simple association to update via a json put request from the frontend

23978341
bash	subshell
a pure bash way with no eval no subshell no external tools no brace expansions you can have the number to repeat in a variable

23978366
post	get
the page will recieve the email msg as post or get parameters

23978373
put	get
on access 2010 i need to use vba to get the records in a table process them and put them in a new table

i can successfully list create delete instances with get post delete methods but put method does nothing

23978485
post	get
edit i tried to post this in a comment but the double and triple quotes don t make it and get replaced with just one quote

23978489
folder	directory
what i prefer is to write the logs to a certain directory all logs to var log and mount this folder to my host machine

23978498
serializable	deserialization
the reason being that i m using the serializable s accessor method which i will required certain services to be injected to do the deserialization

23978517
google-chrome	firefox
its possible to do the same in firefox and google-chrome but requires addons to be installed

23978554
getter	setter
to do this you ll have to use the attr_accessor method to create a setter getter for the attributes you wish to use

23978657
screens	tablet
this will suit all the screens densities in android devices including tablet and mobiles

23978753
post	put
however it doesnt create a put request and instead create a post request

23978753
post	put
my frontend uses a form to create new post or to edit existing put depending on presence of unique model id

23978774
button	checkbox
in this example when the button is pressed it ll print out the value of the checkbox

23978781
min	max
i wouldn t call it simple but i thought about calculating the time differences between the sunrise and sunset in each day then storing this data in an array and finally finding the min max value

23978785
mouseleave	mouseenter
the hover method is a shortcut for binding the mouseenter and mouseleave events so it s those that you need to unbind

23978862
mouseleave	mouseenter
there is another feature called event namespaces but this would involve separating your hover call into separate bind calls for mouseenter and mouseleave

23978931
folder	directory
i managed to push the contents of a folder to my repository but since i need to add other files and want to keep some structure i want to take the current files folder i have and move them into a new directory

23978965
free	realloc
initialize with a null pointer any pointer that you could have wanted to use your struct for and you can pass it to free or realloc without having to wonder whether or not it has been further assigned

23978968
ubuntu	debian
which is obviously specific to ubuntu debian but i just wanted to share my success

23978971
rtsp	rtmp
you must need format like rtmp or rtsp to play in website.

23978986
google-chrome	firefox
the form layout should work in all modern browsers google-chrome 35 firefox 29 and ie 11

23978986
google-chrome	firefox
here view looks correct like google-chrome and firefox

23979042
repo	egit
i think the repo got corrupted by either egit or sourcetree which i use in parallel and has nothing to do with actually hash collisions

23979086
pdostatement	bindvalue
unlike pdostatement bindvalue the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that pdostatement execute is called

23979086
bindparam	bindvalue
alternatively use bindvalue rather than bindparam

23979089
post	get
input all returns an array of all the elements in a get and post array but you re trying to access it as object properties

23979145
hide	show
i d also like to be able to define the text that s displayed in the popup from within the call to show hide the popup

23979179
ready	each
let s say you have ten view controllers in your app each displaying completely different content it does absolutely not make sense to keep all data for all possible view controllers in memory in a singleton just to have data ready in case the user wants to see any of the view controllers

23979282
getter	setter
in swing it was possible to create custom components purely in code by extending jcomponent or jpanel give it a layout and then add the components manually and expose some invented getter and setter to modify the set of controls

23979288
put	get	post	get	post	put
user controller - implements post put get delete

23979288
put	get	post	get	post	put
course controller - implements post put get delete

23979304
bmp	png
everything works fine on that example but now i d like to use png or any format with alpha and better compression rather than bmp

23979312
post	get
so i have setup my post request as follows but i can t seem to get it to work

23979344
put	get	integer	unsigned
when you put number 10 into 32-bit signed or unsigned integer you get

23979344
integer	unsigned
these 32 bits mean 4294967285 as an unsigned integer or -11 as a signed integer your computer represents negative integers as two s complement

23979394
integer	unsigned
the operator performs a ones-complement on its argument and it does not matter whther the argument is a signed or unsigned integer

23979394
integer	unsigned
for an unsigned number cout doesn t do this naturally and so you get a large number the largest possible integer minus the original number

23979416
graphedit	tuner
i have built filters for usb tv tuner in graph edit and its working fine in graphedit

23979451
int	double
if you provide the values of the string int and double it will use those values however without them it will use the default ones

23979567
jax-ws	jax-rs
if you are already using apache cxf for jax-ws then why not use cxf for jax-rs

23979567
jax-ws	jax-rs
continuing to use cxf will mean you can probably reuse some of your existing pojos if not all of them if you are implementing a jax-rs api that is similar in function to your existing jax-ws one

23979569
button	checkbox
custom list view should contain linear layout horizontal in that include checkbox textview and button

23979571
int	chars
in most oo languages you can only copy primitive types so int strings chars etc but not objects

23979584
width	height
do not give it any width or height there is no need

23979589
width	margin
so the solution is to avoid all of the above and simply give the content element a left margin of the width of the menu in your case 240px

23979599
for-loop	loops
you should at least be using a for-loop rather than creating and incrementing your own index in a while loops

23979666
onclick	onsubmit
instead of using onsubmit in input text field use onclick in submit button

23979756
maven	pom.xml
you can introduce your suite class to maven in your pom.xml like this

23979766
rss	feed
asynctask1 download an rss feed parse the xml and for every item recognized create execute asynctask2 inside the doinbackground method

23979778
symfony	silex
this is a demo of symfony s acl using silex

23979802
hide	show
step 3 you will get the data in the javascript and now return it to jsp page by creating a select tag using javascript or using the method to show hide div from js and set those values in those 2nd select tag

23979844
post	get
the benefit of this approach is it follows the post redirect get pattern so if you refreshed the page it wouldn t try to re-submit the form again

23979849
cobertura	jacoco
you could however combine unit-test-coverage generated with cobertura with integration-test-coverage generated with jacoco

23979895
hebrew	thai
using this entire elaborate mechanism causes the component to correctly display a page that has hebrew arabic thai and chinese all at the same time

23979943
rss	feed
i am using air to build an application that will search and show the thumbnails from deviantart the request url for getting resuts in form of rss feed i get the following

23979947

23979961
bmp	png
i can read a bmp file as binary but when it comes to png files i cannot

23979965
kerberos	ldap
i have two debian servers which use same ldap kerberos server but dates in output of klist on them shown in different format - m d y on squeeze vs d m y on wheezy

23979989
free	malloc	free	realloc	realloc	malloc
but don t forget it uses malloc and realloc internally so make sure to free the result

23979989
realloc	malloc
it uses malloc the first time realloc after that to resize.

23980001
post	get
for ex when somebody else comments on the post from the map we will get the corresponding broadcaster using the commentid and we broadcast the message to the clients

23980021
dictionary	map
i believed it was possible to map smaller pieces of an object dictionary entry

23980032
free	malloc
every malloc needs a free after you re done

23980075
dictionary	map
how about using a dictionary that map model names to model classes

23980078
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
nswindowcontroller is your equivalent of a uiviewcontroller its like a root nsviewcontroller there are nsviewcontrollers also but they are not as important you also have a nsdocument which is also a controller mac apps divide the controller laying into view controllers nswindowcontrol and model controllers nsdocument nsdocument is responsible for controlling the model serialising it view controller are more like presenters in the model view present paradigm where a nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller represent the xib file fill out field values act as delegates to view objects etc

23980104
implements	extends
now here is my main.js controller that extends from my base controller and that implements the login function

23980127
mouse	keyboard
i wish to make it possible that when user presses f1 on the keyboard - it s like he pressed button1 with mouse

not on google-chrome firefox etc

23980283
opus	ogg	mp3	ogg
i first want to resample this file to 22 khz and then convert it to mp3 opus ogg

23980287
button	checkbox
how can i get the event from the button and checkbox both going to same event handler

23980333
getter	setter
i m creating here an attr_accessor for each of the attributes so you are getting a getter and a setter for each

23980483
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade an old php script to versioning 5 - the server is running 5.4.17

23980503
uiview	subviews
also uiview with uilabel as subviews - adding background color to uiview and the label is just text sizetofit

23980503
uiview	subviews
when i am using uiview with uilabel as subviews i ve set

23980525
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to mongodb versioning 2.6 and that solved my problem

23980537
tostring	getter
when you iterate over the arraylist you need to typecast it to your blogposts object and use it getter methods or overridden tostring to display it s content

23980562
express	koa
koa is being developed by the same creators of express and this latter works in a similar way so it s only natural they reused the best ideas from expeess in koa

23980585
google-chrome	safari
currently trying to convert my google-chrome extension to safari

23980680
express	koa
it has simple integration with express and koa

also as per your eclipse directory structure you have your jsp under webcontent folder

23980782
min	max
i need only information about min and max temperature for 18 particular cities which means i need only the first 5 rows of data for each city

23980784
fseek	fread
first of all wildplasser is right your program may work but if you go on mixing mmap and stdio you ll need to make sure that writes done via mmap get committed use the msync function and that fread isn t buffering stale data fseek ing to the current position should do the trick

23980879
listview	gridview
yes there is but first you should decide how do you want to display your data in your application i mean you want to show them in a listview or gridview or just show them as text on text-view

23980908
getter	setter
the generictypewrapper is just a class for the getter and the the setter and the itypewrapper class is just a abstract class with the gettypename function in it

23980918
width	height
it works fine but i want to add height and width to the image

23980919
getter	setter
you don t have to write the setter and getter by yourself the property-statement do this for you

23980919
getter	setter
the getter setter is stored in the instance of gamemanager you use

23980930
width	height
or width and height attributes

23980945
int	chars
i tried casting the chars to unsigned int and some similar stuff

23980969

so since you mention eval and lexical environment in the same post makes me thing you won t get what you want

23981094
gif	png
g png gif txt i m not sure you intended to use the accept rule which is for mime types

23981094
client-side	server-side
you absolutely must have code on your server-side that also validates the incoming data and therefore will always protect your database from errors even when the client-side validation fails in any fashion

23981094
client-side	server-side
server-side validation is for protecting your database whenever client-side validation fails

23981094
client-side	server-side
in other words client-side validation is only an enhancement to server-side validation never a replacement

23981127
int	chars
you will first have to concatenate both strings since - is not a valid int chars an sich

23981222
int	double
the number of rows and columns of a matrix are stored as 2 32-bit unsigned int which should make a double matrix of size 8 2 32-1 2 32-1 possible

23981261
mouseover	mouseout
you were calling myf for every mouseover mouseout but it should only be called once to hook things up

23981304
int	chars
use a loop to write out a table of chars with their corresponding int values

23981436
setinterval	settimeout
the html5 spec proposes 4ms as the shortest interval for settimeout and 10ms as the shortest interval for setinterval but allows the implementor to use longer minimum times if desired

23981445
stdout	stderr
if you need the error messages as well you need to redirect both stdout and stderr

23981470
hash	salt
edit in the mean time i have ditched keyring and decided to use a salt hash of the machineguid as a machine unique consistent password

23981473
for-loop	loops
however i notice that if for instance i 0 the second for-loop loops over j in 0 1 0 and executes its contents not only for j 0 but also for j 1 which is irritating

23981477
httphandler	httpmodule
httpmodule are like java filters and they are executed before and after a request reaches the httphandler

23981498
for-loop	arrays
at the end of the script i am trying to run a for-loop for each arrays adding each stored value into a related object variable objecta and objectb

google-chrome	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari
i now tested it on the newest versions of safari opera and google-chrome and they are rendering it correctly

23981536
hide	show
use its hidden to hide and show it as necessary

23981536
viewdidload	viewwillappear
so you will also want to do this check generally in viewwillappear not just in viewdidload

23981546
width	height
the 3rd 4th numeric arguments specify the width and height of the area that is to be clipped from the original image

23981546
width	height
the 7th 8th numeric arguments specify the width and height of the image to be drawn on the canvas

23981602
bash	subshell
same thing making a gcc alias bash function before starting netbeans no inerithance between subshell that netbeans creates for compiling linking files also modifying .bashrc file with alias same results

23981673
getter	setter
or as trivial getter and setter are unpythonic just access the attribute directly

23981710
min	max
with the textboxes below the chart the user can set the min and max of the x-axis of the chart

23981795
stdout	stderr
please check the role log file stderr or stdout

23981831
public	protected
because #methods gives you only a list of the names of public and protected methods of obj

23981847
filtering	grouping
that may be ok if you were only using the first grouping to filtering by the count and don t need it anymore this option should work for you

23981866
google-chrome	firefox
however google-chrome reports that they are considering blocking cross origin fonts and firefox already blocks it

23981903
for-loop	loops
obviously i could write a for-loop to loops through the objects and append the season property into a list but this seems inefficient

23981905
postgresql	mysql
you are correct horizontal partition supported for example in mysql and postgresql splits a table up within a single server

23981979
stdout	stderr
try also to launch your browser from the console to see stdout stderr errors

23982004
width	height
i would like to take an image i have on it s own it is not big enough to fit the screen width and make it so that the image fits the screen width and adjusts the height accordingly to maintain proportions width 100 would not maintain the proportions and i don t want it to be the full height of the screen since the page will be longer than the fold

23982021
post	put
however webrtc does not actually work on webview and i found post saying that it was eventually left out no reason given i can only guess that google was in a hurry to put the chromium-based webview in kitkat and to reduce complication stuff like webrtc and webgl were left out

23982022
inherited	subclassing
however the spec forbids this because the object s state may not have been fully initialized for a subclassing of a type whose constructor sets some state inherited by the subtype

23982041
children	parent
this displayed the full sub-menu text and did not push the parent items over because the children effectively had a width of 0px

23982164
box-sizing	border-box	width	border-box
in my project i found it so useful that i ve been using it over and over i gave the div a width and a padding and the box-sizing border-box property

23982175
children	parent
so if you want to define an action that applies to a group of children routes it makes sense to put that in the parent route

23982196
google-chrome	firefox
this is working in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie 11

23982231
width	height
it s because the standard has historically always defined width and height to refer to content width and content height respectively

23982231
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing border-box is relatively recent and only came about as a result of an ie bug being loved by so many and even then the default remains content-box for compatibility with previous specifications

23982261
freetype	libpng
this piece of code is using boost libpng and freetype it reproduces the problem that i m experiencing and it s self-contained do not forget to customize the path to the ttf font

23982279
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
fyi in older browsers that do not generate the domcontentloaded event these functions will be called on a onreadystatechange notification when and in a really old browser it might not be triggered until window.onload occurs

23982308
put	get
you can also use the function itself as a key which can be useful in some circumstances for example you can put a description of the function in its docstring and use that to print something nice for the user or you can allow the user to retry the function or whatever it s much simpler to keep the function reference for later use in other words than to try to get it from the function name

23982429
google-chrome	safari
this is only available for browsers that use the webkit engine safari google-chrome but you could try the following

23982434
hash	salt
php hash the salt + #128525

mongohq	mongolab
mongohq and mongolab offer free 512mb mongodb sandboxes to test your app on you might want to consider checking those out instead

23982535
nsmutablestring	nsstring
but the copy is made with copy and not mutablecopy so you actually end up assigning an nsstring to the property and not an nsmutablestring

23982569
gif	png
something like screen shot or you can say writing a content of map division to png jpeg gif file

23982615

23982633
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i am using the scriptmanager object with the updatepanel in my project

23982678
maven	pom.xml
my guess is that the pom.xml for the maven s clean plugin is somehow messed up typically that happens when you are behind a firewall or proxy and you get a customized error message

23982684
put	get
now i know for a fact entries exist for this where clause and if i .showsql and copy the query to sql developer this is an oracle database it definitely returns rows furthermore if i remove my .where and put in a .take 10 i get records coming back

23982695
superclass	subclassing
by using a superclass you don t have to alloc init another class or use delegates all the subclassing will have access to the method

23982705
strcpy	memset
with your memset and strcpy calls you operate on which overwrites the name of the first entry

23982713
strcpy	memset
note that the memset before strcpy is not necessary

23982749
for-loop	arrays
if reduce is used for adding together numpy arrays by index it can be faster than a for-loop

also the application works on my nexus 7 2013 tablet with kitkat 4.4.2 and it doesn t work on my samsung galaxy s2 with cyanogenmod 11 m6 installed

23982769
put	get
you can put an onclick event handler on the link instead of an href attribute so that the user cannot get the url by right-clicking the link

23982788
screens	tablet
if it s a problem with setcontentview it s most probably an xml error within your layout file although it may be dependant on whether you have a seperate layout in a folder for tablet screens layout-sw600dp

23982826
post	get
if that is correct then what you d probably want to do in have your create action return the json and then change your code so that you do an ajax post with your serialized form.then in your ajax success handler process the result you get back just like you re doing now

23982832
namedtuple	dictionary
if instead of tuples you re using dictionary or even namedtuple provided all elements have the field you re indexing on you could just provide the field name for the column

width	height
how can i get text width and height methods like in java so i can center text like

for-loop	arrays
the right way to iterate an arrays is with a standard for-loop

23983310
inherited	properties
there is no guarantee that for...in will return the indexes in any particular order and it will return all enumerable properties including those with nonâ integer names and those that are inherited

23983310
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
therefore it is better to use a for-loop with a numeric index or array.foreach or the non-standard for...of loops when iterating over arrays where the order of access is important

getter	setter
i was taught to make variables private and just have getter and setter methods but it definitely looks better accessing a public list than a private one

you need not even implement comparable as you are providing your own comparator

int	chars
bool chars and short are implicitly converted int

23983510
libstdc++	libc++
both the libstdc++ and libc++ implementations of shrink_to_fit look conforming to me

23983510
queue	fifo
the libc++ implementation follows a slightly different design which is intended to speed fifo queue

23983510
libstdc++	libc++
while the libstdc++ invariant is that there is never an empty array in the entire deque the libc++ invariant is that there can be zero or one empty arrays at the front and back of the deque

23983510
queue	fifo
given a fifo queue with an approximately constant size this design will reach a state such that pop_front push_back sequence will never allocate a new array

23983510
libstdc++	libc++
the result is that a libc++ shrink_to_fit never invalidates references while a libstdc++ shrink_to_fit often will

23983510
libstdc++	libc++
each libc++ array typically takes up 4096 bytes 1 page while each libstdc++ array typically takes of 512 bytes

filtering	grouping
basically it dynamically detects the available properties based on the first wine element adds controls grouping of check-boxes for applying filtering based on each property and features a custom filtering function that

23983601
int	chars
since a chars really is an int with a shorter range there s no convenience method in int to convert from a chars to an int so one has to subtract the chars 0 to get a number back

mouse	keyboard
i m using gui i have 4 button in my gui and my callback detect mouse and keyboard event

23983646
getter	setter
the form itself uses automatically the getter and setter to generate fields and then extract information from request

23983646
getter	setter
with getter and setter the form will automatically create fields to be filled matching the name conventions and then later will bind information from this fields to your user object using a setter which has to be named setname string name

23983739
filtering	grouping
i created a filtering view of the database that only allows user with the grouping to get a copy of the replicated document hard coding the grouping of a in this example

23983755
width	height
you have to understand that the browsers apply scroll only when they understand the size height and width of the content is greater than the size specified for it

23983781
getter	setter
it be better to make a global list in a class private and have getter and setter methods

23983781
getter	setter
there are some advantages of using getter setter

23983781
getter	setter
getter and setter can have validation in them fields can t

getter	setter
here s an example when writing your own framework by implementing getter setter in defensive way in order to not alter the current state of your list

23983828
getter	setter
apart of this the javabean specification states that fields in a java class should not be public and their access should be through getter and setter methods

23983919
width	height
while noyulysses answer works well for centering along the x-axis and i m assuming that s what your question was asking about it s nearly impossible to both vertically and horizontally center an element with an unspecified width and height without using javascript

23983927
filtering	grouping
yes you can grouping necessary urls by single beginning uri that can be filtering by a filtering as suggested above

stderr stream is piped to stdout and

23984086
hex	binary
messages do not give you hex decimal they just give you binary numbers which you can then interpret as hex decimal as needed

23984090
integer	unsigned
part of the issue i suspect revolves around the fact that unsigned integer types in c are required to behave as members of an abstract algebraic ring rather than as numbers meaning for example that if an unsigned 16-bit integer variable equals zero decrementing it is required to yield 65 535 and if it s equal to 65 535 then incrementing it is required to yield zero. there are times when such behavior is extremely useful but numeric types exhibit such behavior may have gone against the spirit of some languages

23984090

personally i wish there had been separate integer types for unsigned numbers and algebraic rings

i m not a php guy already tried research and i found how to get the user role and another post was how to add body class and i m have trouble how to get them both to work

23984337
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer type should be thought of not as representing a number but as a member of something called an abstract algebraic ring specifically the equivalence class of integers congruent modulo max_value+1

23984337
integer	unsigned
thus assigning -1 to a 16-bit unsigned integer yields 65535 precisely because adding 1 to 65535 will yield 0

23984337
integer	unsigned
note that in an abstract algebraic sense every integer can be uniquely assigned into to algebraic rings of the indicated form and a ring member can be uniquely assigned into a smaller ring whose modulus is a factor of its own a 16-bit unsigned integer maps uniquely to one 8-bit unsigned integer but ring members are not uniquely convertible to larger rings or to integers

23984337
integer	unsigned
subtracting a value signed or unsigned from an unsigned value which is no smaller than int and no smaller than the value being subtracted will yield a result according to the rules of algebraic rings rather than the rules of integer arithmetic

23984337
integer	unsigned
if you want to operate on unsigned values as though they are numbers you must first convert them to a type which can represent numbers a signed integer type

23984359
subscript	superscript
effects side i saw superscript subscript

in few php versions register_globals is on by default.this setting tells whether or not to register the contents of the environment get post cookie server variables as global variables

in the case of hp microsoft stl std sort is usually quicksort unless the nesting gets too deep in which case it switched to heapsort

23986246
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort time complexity is typically o n log n but it s worst case is o n 2 which is avoided with the switch to heapsort since heapsort is always o n log n but slower than quicksort so it s only used to avoid o n 2

the issue is that you are attaching events to each individual elements directly and you do this only when the document is ready

23986359
children	parent
events from the children will bubble up to the parent node where you can intercept them

23986360
hide	show
if you don t wish to delete them you should change there parent either put them in a new layout if you still want to show them or move them to the parent and hide them if you are doing the later it would be best to keep member variables with pointers maybe in a list but the following adaptation of your code should work presuming foo inherits qwidget although storing the widgets and manipulating them directly will be a better solution

23986376
ord	chr
you probably want ord not int since ord is the opposite operation from chr

23986376

can someone help explain why the following code works in google-chrome and ie but not safari

23986807
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
an even easier way is to use the java classes objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

23986825
for-loop	loops
so if i run a for-loop in opencl does that mean all work-items run the same loops or is loops somehow divided up to run across multiple work items with each work item executing a part of loops ie

23986847
for-loop	loops
the j in the inner for-loop is now upper bound by i a value that changes every time loops restarts

23986847
for-loop	while-loop
do these nested for-loops essentially behave like a for-loop with while-loop inside of it

23986883
integer	unsigned
signed and unsigned integer types act as if they have the same representation as respectively intmax_t

23986892
children	parent
now i have a recursive function that starts with the head node no parent and moves down the chain recursively for every node base case being the last node having no children

23986926
addition	multiplication	subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition
while they are comprised of numeric characters you never would consider doing numeric operations on them such as addition subtraction or multiplication

23986940
switching	screens
i previously had the lists in the their own screens but would like to have them in a single screens and switching between the views using the selector

23986940

23987001
for-loop	loops
but i think you should store lines in a variable then use for-loop instead of loops through f

23987003
awt	swing
failures are generally possible in code and ejb web swing awt containers already cater for this by providing an outermost â œfailed requestâ exception-handler

23987018
google-chrome	firefox
this animated d3 example works fine in google-chrome but not firefox both latest version

23987040
hid	keyboard
if your external accessory doesn t need high bandwidth in the connection to ios and you wish to use or must use 2.x classic bt instead of 4.x le smart which is very low bandwidth but requires no mfi dancing you may be able to communicate by emulating a bt hid keyboard in your accessory

23987040
hid	keyboard
it s hardly optimal especially since the hid reverse channel is pretty limited i think to things like lighting the caps lock key in the basic keyboard configuration hid page 7 mapping if i recall correctly. otoh if your primary task is to push data to the ios device sending the data as keystrokes would not be too awful

23987072
g++	gcc
it could also be that the user overwrote his gcc with g++ surprisingly many people believe that gcc and g++ are the same thing but they are not

23987073
min	max
to get a fractional number of hours worked calculate the difference between min and max and divide by the appropriate scale

23987103

the method above targets only the first level children of the parent .container

23987144
width	height
for some reason i cannot get the width and height of the wrapper after using appendto

23987144
width	height
how do i get the width and height after using appendto see my code below

23987180
children	parent
i basically need a selector that counts the boxes as if they were all direct children of the same parent .container as if the .inner-container would not exist

23987251
passport	express-jwt
the main two options i am considering right now are passport and express-jwt

23987251

something exactly like rrd rrdtool ecosystem where i can specify the metrics to collect specify whether to collect sum average or min max etc

23987436
integer	unsigned
a bit-field is interpreted as having a signed or unsigned integer type consisting of the

23987565
int	chars
count is a int not chars or unsigned chars

23987570
for-loop	arrays
or you can use a regular for-loop over your arrays

23987588
jar	war
owb doesn t find the autoconversation class the wicket-cdi jar - i bundle the class inside the war in the lib directory using ant s standard task so that seems strange

23987588
jar	manifest.mf
owb doesn t recognize that the wicket-cdi jar is a beans jar - that sounds almost impossible especially since there s a beans.xml and manifest.mf in the jar under meta-inf as request by the cdi spec

23987597
versioning	upgrade
following the webpage of vincent an ipython versioning of 1.0 is required thus an upgrade to a more recent versioning ipython 2.1 is very likely to solve your problem

23987601
for-loop	arrays
you need a for-loop inside the constructor that sets the arrays elements to zero

23987602
button	checkbox
i want to delete rows checked with a checkbox upon clicking a delete button

23987617
int	chars
this bit of code is looping through an array and its supposed to be checking if the chars at each position is an int

23987623
hide	show
put that inside the statement then from the other page which contains the buttons you can use that session variable to know whether this user is an admin or not and based on that do the show and hide thing and for more info your code is vulnerable and can be hacked easily you need to use mysql_real_escape_string function to filter the variable and escape sql injections

23987676
integer	fractions
now to the actual power if we write y n + a where n is an integer and a is fractions

23987689
try-catch	exception-handling
since exception-handling is the class of checked exception-handling meaning that you do have to wrap them in a try-catch block you must declare them to be thrown in your constructor of bigint

23987729
spock	grails
spock is part of grails now since 2.3

23987738

you have to give a width and height 100 on tag in css like below

23987810
spaces	delimiter
spaces is not a delimiter so expected output will be

23987830
crypt	hash
id say use a marker field to annotate which users have been previously hash then crypt the existing hash

23987830
crypt	hash
for anyone with a true in the marker field when authenticating it becomes a 2 step process hash the password then crypt it for a match check

23987834
crypt	hash
when a user logs in and their password successfully hash es to what you have in the database you can now crypt that password and remove the old hash from the database

23987840
apache	nginx
two annoying things the omnibus install of gitlab uses the nginx web server rather than apache but there is a good reason for that given that nginx doesn t open a new process for every connection .

23987840
postgresql	mysql
and it uses postgresql rather than mysql for its database

23987840
postgresql	mysql
for home home-office usage of course you can have postgresql and mysql installed on the same machine

23987840
apache	nginx
less obvious is how to run apache and nginx or really how to get nginx to run multiple virtual servers while still maintaining gitlab

if any nodes have children which are also their parent ancestors this code will try to run for ever until it exhausts the stack

23988147
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
since you presumably already have on file for all your passwords it s possible to crypt each one of them with an appropriate salt to update your existing hash without having to wait for the user to log in

23988164
rsa	aes
my current way is by using the two encryption methods rsa keysize 512 and aes keysize 128

23988164
rsa	aes
the client generates an aes key and encrypts the aes key using the public rsa key provided by the server

23988164
rsa	aes
the client sends his encrypted aes key and the server decrypts the encrypted aes key using the private rsa key

23988176
gruntjs	package.json

you are creating a frame element which is meant for use inside a frameset element and lacks width and height properties

23988360
children	parent
i have also created a couple of simple properties on the todo controller to see whether each todo has a parent and children

23988360
children	parent
i used to believe that ember data should automatically update the children property on the parent when i update the parent property on the child

23988360
children	parent
so either i m wrong and i should manually update the children property of the old and new parent when i update the parent property on the child todo risking to damage the integrity of relationships or i m changing the parent in a wrong way

23988360
children	parent
the parent property gets updated but the children property won t

23988360
children	parent
in order to update current model s parent property we have to modify the relationship on the opposite end call a method on the children property on the parent

23988364
post	get
basically my confusion is whether to use get or post

23988364
post	get
but reading on net i found that get should be used mainly if there is read only access and post should be used when you create something on the server side

23988399
put	get	post	get	post	put
by convention get is used to retrieve information post for creating put for modifying and delete for deleting

23988406
postgresql	mysql
i m using postgresql but am interested in sqlite mysql also

23988443
width	height
unfortunately the exact same method cause error on s4 and s3 and s4 have the same screen width height 320ã 640

23988455
udp	tcp
however when tested on a vm i can t seem to get tcp or udp to process between a pc client application and the server hosted on the vm

23988455
tcplistener	tcpclient
as a bit of extra info i am using the tcplistener tcpclient and udpclient classes and their asynchronous functions for my server s main network control if this holds relevancy

23988526
int	double
on modern hardware floating point multiplications may run way faster than int ones so you might want to change the entire algorithm and start using double instead of int

23988526
int	double
if you re writing for modern hardware and you have a lot of operations like multiplying by 2.25 i d suggest using double rather than int if nothing else prevents you from doing that

23988543
postgresql	mysql
both postgresql sqllite and mysql applies the sql standard for storing varchar and chars

23988543
int	chars
chars n where n is a positive int

23988589
fpdf	fpdi
you can use fpdi to import a page of an existing pdf document and place it with fpdf onto a newly created page

23988632
width	height
the animated example is missing width and height attributes for the element

23988639

when i want to call one of my actions that needs to a authenticated user in firefox i can do this but in ie and google-chrome i don t

23988659
implements	extends
create a class which extends abstractidgenerator and implements the generate method as per your requirement

23988671
pyramid	colander
try to be more verbose clear with your code examples and do not mix up colander schema code and pyramid view code

23988673
google-chrome	firefox
so after randomly finding out that my code works in firefox but not google-chrome i did some searching

23988678
cashapelayer	calayer
note this property can be a subclass of calayer notably cashapelayer which allows you to specify a direct path for the mask here you can specify the hexagon

23988721
mp3	wav
as the server is 3rd party and we dont have access to it so i need to convert or record a file either in mp3 wav or gsm

23988721
mp3	wav
but i dont know how can i convert or record a file in mp3 or wav is there a way in android to do that

we need to set up a ssh without paraphrase for using cron job and identify the path to the rsa or dsa key in the identifier -i

23988857
versioning	upgrade
the solution was very simple after amazon s customer support told me i had to upgrade to the latest ami currently it s 3.1.0 that has the latest hadoop 2.4 and also make sure that i used the same hadoop versioning for the compilation of the java code

23988880
spring-data-mongodb	spring-data-commons
changed version of spring-data-mongodb from 1.5.0.rc to 1.5.0.release and version of spring-data-commons from 1.8.0.rc1 to 1.8.0.release and it fixed the problem

23988967
int	chars
note that object here does not infer an instance of a class so an object could be a chars array of int or pointer to void

23989017
range	max
because it s using the random#nextint max method which will return a random integer in the range including 0 and max-1

23989056
google-chrome	firefox
all other browser was working fine google-chrome and firefox only ie is the only problem i have right now

23989116
versioning	upgrade
that way you can set up filters to have different views for paid unpaid and still have a rollup view that displays values from both versioning for example to see how users behave that eventually upgrade to the paid versioning

23989136
post	get
i m trying to get all the recent activity post where i become friends with another person

23989164

i need use only hide show functions

23989175
width	height
this gave me an error that a bitmap must have a width and height bigger than 0

23989177
hide	show
unless your code is executing so slowly that it takes more than 1 full second for an alert to show it will execute before the hide completes

23989177
setinterval	settimeout
so long story short unless you re doing ajax settimeout and setinterval or using a third party library which should document its behavior your code will execute in order

23989225
google-chrome	firefox
i couldn t run your example on my windows machine ie and firefox so not only a google-chrome issue but well judging from the output format it seems that comma is required

23989294
width	height
i don t think you can do it without knowing the width and height of th bitmap

23989303
bmp	png
add into the rectangle stamp annotation from image file bmp or png or jpg

23989373

to answer your second question you can simply save any generated variable as a .mat file in your working directory current folder which can be accessed later

23989564
folder	directory
create folder mystore website under emagento directory

23989600
woocommerce	shortcode
the shortcode defined in woocommerce includes class-wc-shortcodes.php is a great starting place for this particularly as woocommerce is constantly evolving

23989649
int	chars
so the compiler transforms the pointer into an int chars which is usually not what s intended by the programmer

23989721
range	minimum
i have a grayscale image in which there are edges that follow the right half of a gaussian curve the intensity decreases from a local maximum to a local minimum following the gaussian curve over a range of pixels

23989749
stdout	stderr
another problem could be you do not call player.communicate and your process could block if stdout or stderr get filled by some output

23989761
width	height
a workaround for ios 7 is by increasing the frame width and height since it decreases both

23989823
zlib	quazip
i am using quazip library which has zlib dependency

23989823

this is because the getter and setter from a dependencyproperty is only a .net wrapper

23989896
addition	multiplication
thus when i d write a plus + sign in b1 i get an addition but if i write a star i get a multiplication

23989896
min	max
and in b1 i could write either min or max

23989904

what i noticed when i execute the request in a webrowser with a network tracer it shows the transfer-encoding as chunked

23990205
x86	64bit
i have worked with a number of functions to get the most significant bit but problems generally arise moving between 32 and 64bit numbers or moving between x86_64 and x86 boxes

23990205
x86	64bit
the functions __builtin_clz __builtin_clzl and __builtin_clzll work well for 32 64bit numbers and across x86_64 and x86 machines

23990208
x86	64bit
as you found out and noted in your comments windows will set processor_architecture to x86 for 32-bit applications even if they are actually running on a 64bit os for app compatibility purposes i d assume

23990237
ubuntu	linux

23990381
subscript	superscript
how can i make both the superscript and subscript numbers to be aligned to produce a common scientific notation like below

23990402
google-chrome	firefox
this should work in google-chrome firefox and ie ie needs to have console open before called

23990412
next	except
i have used datatable for pagination all is working fine except that next prev pagination is not showing first time after onkeypress event in search-box it is working fine in console it is showing following error

23990434
implements	extends
if the type cat is a class that extends from object and implements ianimal then it can be used in place of any expression that s expected to be cat ianimal or object

23990444
post	put
i know very little about java request mapping but by rest you use post usually to add a new item resource to a collection resource for example post rights in your case and put usually to edit an entire item resource for example where should be a unique resource id probably the same as one of your aggregate ids

23990448
put	get
but i only get out put as

23990459
subscript	superscript
if you just want subscript and superscript use subscriptspannable and superscriptspannable

23990510
implements	extends
of course i can implements this on my own by extends hashmap or surrounding every call to put with if map.contains key but i prefer using something ready-made that keeps my code clean

23990554
put	get
the logging works just fine but when i try to put a tail on the file at the same time i get a permission denied

23990579
folder	directory
also in addition to bodi0 you should find the database folder in mysql data if your database name was mydb the folder name will be mydb then put it in your current mysql server s data directory

23990590
children	parent
but when i am testing it the variable group it contains only the parent div without its children

23990618
folder	directory
this can be under the c wamp www directory or in a completely seperate folder like c websites

23990618
wordpress	joomla
this kind of code exists in many frameworks and cms s for example wordpress and joomla etc

23990618
wordpress	joomla
now this difference may seem trivial at first but if you were to use a framework like wordpress or one of the cms s like joomla for example this can and does cause problems when you move your site to a live server

23990618
folder	directory
this may seem a little confusing as once we create a virtual host definition for the sub directory of the wamp www folder some items will appear on both of the my projects menu and the my virtual hosts menu s

23990641
width	height
for height and width i am using this

23990646

23990708
uilabel	uibutton
i ve set up a number of uilabel and uibutton within 3 subviews in a storyboard

23990708
width	height
for example one subview is positioned at 0 0 in the xib with height 200 and width 320 simply for me to layout the elements before writing the code

23990708
uilabel	uibutton
this subview has a number of uilabel and uibutton within it and their cumulative height is supposed to define the height of the subview

23990720
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
there might be a null check that throws an argumentnullexception or it might just use it without checking and you could get a runtime nullreferenceexception

23990759
width	margin
for filler give it a margin that is equal to the width of the navs

23990795
post	get
if you re really looking for a semi-automated solution you might be able to stitch together selenium or similar and a screen reader emulator as described in the second linked post to pull down an audio file of the screen reader then submit the text to mechanical turk for transcription then diff your site text against the transcript you get to see how confused the writer was

23990798
couchbase	couchdb
depending on your application goal you can sync replicate directly to couchdb without using the couchbase sync adapter

when it redirects to cao.php it is a get request and so triggers the undefined index notice because there is no post data

23991111
post	get
you just send requests to the server with a post and get results back

23991132
put	get
but even if you ll put the line-height the same as font size you ll get the bigger result then it should be

while the search itself is ok it has one major drawback for me that makes it a pain to use for me both with keyboard and mouse

23991207
width	height
as there were many images with different sizes i wrote the following code to make them smaller if their height was biggher than 200px and else if their width was bigger than 118px but this script is not working properly sometimes it works when i refresh my page

23991217
google-chrome	firefox
this occurs at least in ie11 google-chrome but not in firefox

23991229

what i m trying to do is to insert into a stream std ostream a buffer

23991370
google-chrome	firefox
i have got a set of test that run fine on google-chrome but when i change the capabilities browsername from google-chrome to firefox don t even get a error info

23991374
width	height
you have to choose your layout width or height and say that all images have to match that width.

23991376
post	get
we were thinking of making a routine post calls on every minute and get result from server but i think this would be very costly and inappropriate way for syncing data with the web-service s result

23991436
backtracking	greedy
the issue with greedy quantifiers like is that you ll very likely consume too much in the beginning so that the regex engine has to do extensive backtracking

23991497
post	get
remember that in order to start the build process one must use post method not get - just a side note.

the above image button works fine in explorer and firefox but when it comes to google-chrome the image button works only on clicking but not on pressing enter key

23991690
subtract	add
there are no separate signed and unsigned instructions to add and subtract

23991690
integer	unsigned
again you decide whether 7fffh + 0001h is a valid unsigned addition or an overflow since 7fffh is the maximum signed integer in 16-bit twos complement

23991699
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in google-chrome version 35.0.1916.114 but firefox version

23991727
move	drag
you should see that on every touch and drag the getx gety results only start changing after your finger has move half a centermeter or so and from then on it is accurate

23991728
width	height
it is generally safest to use the same unit for different dimensions and this applies to border-radius too when the height and width of the element have been set in rem units

23991728
width	height
if you set the border-radius in px units and width and height in rem units and the font size of the root element is then set to say 32pt the element box becomes rather large but the border curvature remains small

23991805

google-chrome	firefox
for example the .small element on google-chrome will be given the -webkit-transform property whereas on firefox it will be given the -moz-transform property

23991997
width	height
as for how to generate the scale values you can simply base these upon the maximum of width or height according to some base value

23991997
width	height
if the largest of the height or width is 300 for example the scale will become 0.5 as 150 300 0.5

23992022
hide	show
to hide the tabbar but still show the content add the tabs-item-hide class

23992079
disk	ram
but when i test the queries which read a lot of data or files if i m working with ram disk i saw a huge different 20 vs 80 cpu usage

23992091

check out in google-chrome and firefox to see the problem

23992091
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome drag an item in the folders you ll have the same item displayed as visual feedback following the mouse not in firefox because firefox doesnt support e.clientx and e.clienty in the drag event

23992132
folder	directory
the top level directory stattests contains the setup.py file and the sub-folder tests a module that contains an __init__.py which imports all the functions from tests.py in the same module folder

width	height
it works quite reasonable in range of angles tilt rotation around axis parallel to image s width from -30 to +30 degrees pan rotation around axis parallel to image s height from -45 to +45 degrees

23992251
width	height
i have a feeling you may have wanted to do this for the height though and not the width .

23992251

serializable	deserialization
i have problems in retaining the order of certain elements between deserialization and serializable

23992772
stdout	fflush
these kinds of problems put a fflush stdout after each printf

23992815
implements	extends
as your model class does not implements anything it could be an interface but that s another topic you can extends it creating a class with less attributes when necessary an anonymous class will do the job

23992866
post	put

23998068
typedef	struct
will collide in strange ways because the struct and the typedef have the same name

23998068
typedef	struct
in c the name of a struct is considered a tag whereas a typedef creates a type name

23998068
typedef	struct
in my opinion it makes a lot more sense for the tag of the struct to be the same as the typedef assuming you use a typedef at all

23998068
typedef	struct
however in c++ a struct definition essentially creates an implicit typedef so that both of the above code snippets compile

this needs to be done by domain though rather than by protocol because all the https requests go through a load balancer that does ssl offloading so by the request arrives at the web server which is jboss 7.1.1 it is http even though the client would see it as https and would need the secure flag in the session cookie

that means that the control.background properties value is not inherited by child controls

23999035
inherited	properties
so the reason why you didn t need to specify the setter.targetname properties value for the foreground properties is because without specifying a target for it the value will actually be applied on the whole listboxitem and then that value will be inherited by all child controls within the listboxitem

23999036
