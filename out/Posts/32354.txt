50003
versioning	upgrade
so i guess our solution will be to upgrade our development installs with the full versioning of sql 2005 we have an msdn subscription of course

50064
awt	swing
this is pretty simple i come from a swing awt background

50079
png	tga	bmp	tga	bmp	png	gif	png	gif	bmp
i m after loaders for bmp gif jpg png and tga

50170
opera	google-chrome
but this doesn t seem to generate markers in either ff3 google-chrome or ie8 beta 2 and if i recall correctly not opera either although i ve since uninstalled opera

50199
post	put
edit i put together a sample implementation of this pattern and published a blog post walking through the code

50220
joystick	keyboard
i m not sure off the top of my head for keyboard or joystick

50258
cvs	svn
note to implement this i had to write a custom script that checked out the latest version from the repository compared it with the local copy and issued svn or cvs commands to add remove and update any changed files

50280
firefox	safari
the floated content and the content that has an additional margin both appear fine in firefox ie but on safari one of the divs is completely hidden

50378
put	get
you need to put the burden of proof back on him- get him to convince you otherwise- and that will force him to do the research and discover the answer for himself

50396
norton	mcafee
typically the real reason a modern machine starts running slow is due to everything from malware to virus scanners mcafee norton s etc are prime targets in my mind

50472
hex	binary
there are 26 characters in the alphabet and we have a number system just like hex or binary just with an unusual character set a..z representing positionally the powers of 26 26 2 26 1 26 0

50488
cassini	iis
since for various reasons i can t use iis for an asp.net website i m developing i run cassini from the command line to test the site

50558
width	height
i know the width of the data 22 values but i do not know the height estimated around 4000 records but variable

50569
vb.net	vb6
i m a bit rusty on vb6 and never learned vb.net but this should give you a jagged array

50632
integer	unsigned
your i will be converted to an unsigned integer by adding uint_max + 1 then the addition will be carried out with the unsigned values resulting in a large result depending on the values of u and i

50632
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned integer types the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is converted to the type of the operand with greater rank

50632
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

50632
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the operand with signed integer type

50632
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type

50632
integer	unsigned
referring to 3 above since both operands have the same rank your i will need to be converted to an unsigned integer

50632
integer	unsigned
a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type

50798
put	get
i m not sure what you mean about recognizing a path - if any of the above paths are passed as a parameter to a program the shell will put the entire string in one variable - you don t have to parse multiple arguments to get the entire path

50820
width	margin
float the first column left then set the margin to the width of the first column

50842
free	malloc
first you have to provide the entrypoints for malloc and free and friends

50848
free	malloc
since you re worried about memory leaks and talking about malloc free i assume you re in c

50861
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
you can set __malloc_hook __free_hook and __realloc_hook to point to functions which will be called from malloc realloc and free respectively

50909
youtube	vimeo
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users

51014
haskell	ocaml
languages with type inference like ocaml and haskell will probably make this easier on you although their error messages can be confusing as well

51027
postgresql	mysql
rdbms mysql postgresql etc..

51036
oodbms	db4o
db4o as mentioned by eric is an object-oriented database management system oodbms

51047
exif	xmp
you can embed your data in the xmp tag within a jpeg or exif or iptc fields for that matter

51056
haskell	ocaml
i agree that haskell s type classes are really well done but it s a bit different in that haskell has no oo semantics but ocaml does support oo

51071
ant	maven
if you are working on several projects with similar directory structures and want to stick with ant instead of going to maven use the import task

51071
post	put
it even allows overriding of the tasks in the template which allows you to put in project specific pre or post target hooks

51101
ubuntu	linux
linux supports a technology called pae that lets you use more than 4gb of memory however i don t know whether ubuntu has it on by default

51159
firefox	safari
css3 will have last-child too this is currently supported by firefox safari but not ie 6 7 beta 8

51178
profiler	yourkit
or you can use a commercial profiler like yourkit or any number of other profilers

51196
ilist	iqueryable
you may want to consider just returning an iqueryable customer instead of an ilist customer from your data-access method

51196
ienumerable	iqueryable
since iqueryable t inherits from ienumerable t the rest of your app should be able to deal with it quite well

51199
put	get
if you have to concatenate large strings put the string parts into an array and use the array.join method to get the overall string

51302
gif	png
the img tag lets you embed external image files jpeg gif png swf files and movie clips inside text fields

51307
prepare	execute
this utility method combines prepare execute and fetchall_arrayref into a single call

51348
organization	naming
blitz project naming conventions organization guidelines

51360
width	height
put the spinner in a div the same size as the chart you know the height and width so you can use relative positioning to center it correctly

51385
postgresql	mysql
postgresql sqlite and mysql as databases

51409
ubuntu	linux
the packages that could use more than 4gb of memory on ubuntu and other linux distro s are compiled with pae support

51558
profiler	yourkit
if you are worried about speed i d really recommend a good profiler and get evidence as to where your bottlenecks are - i use yourkit and have been very pleased

51602
free	malloc
you only need to manually free strings when you manually allocate the memory yourself using the malloc function in c or the new operator in c++

51611
inherited	properties
you have 2 choices interfaces and inherited otherwise you can t access similar properties of different types of objects

51619
pull	push
i want to make centralized push pull git repository available to all my team members over the internet

51640
stdout	stderr
you shouldn t be comparing the file descriptor with anything unless checking for stdin stdout stderr or doing math with it

51656
disk	ram
ram the drive is a ram disk

51664
free	malloc
there are also potential problems if you are passing memory between your main .exe and .dll files as if each of these static links the runtime you can end up with malloc free mismatch problems

51728
profiler	aqtime
in addition to the refactoring and source control tools listed here aqtime is a great windows profiler

51753
outputstream	inputstream
as wmr mentioned org.apache.commons.io.ioutils from apache has a method called copy inputstream outputstream which does exactly what you re looking for

51893
portrait	landscape
when possible i love me some portrait mode for writing code my current monitors are landscape bound

51934
put	get
every gis data of the same type should be a class but my user has the possibility to get new set of data and put it in the database

51994
mouse	keyboard
getting a big external monitor will help as will a nice mouse and keyboard

52098
keydown	keyup
edit apparently i can capture the keydown and keyup events on the combobox which allows me to set the focus or tab to the next control

52099
gridview	repeater
the best solution i was able to come up with was to nest the gridview in the repeater

52099
gridview	repeater
then i bound each repeated gridview during the repeater s itemdatabound event

52111
for-loop	loops
also in all honesty i ve never used a while loops so there is a good change you would end up with a nice concise list comprehension or for-loop instead

52116
keydown	keyup
i believe directionals are only captured on keydown and keyup not on keypress

52140
pop-up	dialog
when we chose flash 6 years ago we did so for its large number of features for user interaction like dragging stuff opening and closing menus tree navigation elements pop-up dialog etc

52179
put	get
in the end i can probably put up with 200 ms response times but knowing that 7 ms is a possible target makes me feel unsatisfied as even 20-50 ms times would enable more users to have more up to date queries and get rid of a lots of caching and precomputed hacks

52179
postgresql	mysql
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql

52266
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

52266
mouse	keyboard
if you had one controller running on the box in front of which you sit you could use keyboard and mouse input to switch it between open sockets with different renderers

52345
goto	break
using a break while looping is remarkably similar to a goto except it isn t a goto but again is an indication that the code may not be optimal

52357
stdout	stderr
usually stderr is the same as stdout so clog is the same as cout

52401
profiler	yourkit
so the only correct way is to ask the jvm which a good profiler i use yourkit which probably isn t what you want

52414
vbscript	jscript
a lot of people use vbscript for classic asp but you can use javascript jscript on the server as an alternative

52458
profiling	debugging
jvmti is the debugging and profiling protocol

52486
internationalization	localization
flash used well allows easy localization and internationalization

52541
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome ie8 and firefox 3.1 start to go in a better direction but it will take years for them to be mature enough to create javascript applications that actually can fully replace desktop apps

52549
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
addition subtraction multiplication division

52565
boost	stl
really c++ templates are the enabling technology for stl and much of boost and c doesn t have them

52586
profiler	vtune
i like using intel vtune as a profiler primarily because it is non-invasive compared to instrumenting profilers which change behaviour too much

52616
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs
i would look at a few options cvs subversion git bazaar visual sourcesafe and see which one s meet your team s desires the best

52633
width	margin
your problem is that the 100 width does not include any padding or margin values

52634
gridview	linqdatasource
i ve got a linqdatasource that points to my model and a gridview that consumes it

52634
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
i thought it might have to do with the linqdatasource so i added a sqldatasource and the same thing happens

52646
width	height
so i thought iframe - even though i m not a fan of frames i thought that i could create a frame that matched the width and height of the content so that it would appear native

52670
put	get
that would constitute one spot to get those resources and also the ones the asp.net mvc team put out

52703
ubuntu	linux
machine running ubuntu linux 8.04 with php version 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.3

52725
gridview	formview	gridview	repeater
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list

52732
post	get
once i get it figured out i ll post what i did here

52881
codeigniter	cakephp
also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby on rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with

52896
width	margin
the correct box model states that the width applies only to the content and padding and margin add on to it

52896
width	margin
the original ie box model also known as quirks mode includes padding and margin in the width

52994
ant	emma
first you need to setup where ant can find the emma libraries

53056
tostring	gethashcode
for some objects not this one a quick hashcode can be generated by tostring .gethashcode certainly not optimal but useful as people tend to return something close to the identity of the object from tostring and that is exactly what gethashcode is looking for

53239
gridview	repeater
personally i hate gridview so i wrote a paging sorting repeater

53246
elementtree	beautifulsoup
python developer fredrik lundh author of elementtree among other things has a function to unsecape html entities on his website which works with decimal hex and named entities beautifulsoup will not work with the hex ones

53260
post	get
that redirect works find for a url with only get parameters but if the request originally contained some http post data that is now lost

53359
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
also be aware of the affects that the current accepted solution may have on parsing hex octal and binary numbers

53359
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
in ruby numbers that start with 0x or 0x are hex 0b or 0b are binary and just 0 are octal

53486
unix	solaris
at university when i was doing most things under unix solaris i used gdb

53507
httprequest	httpresponse
this is true because it uses the new abstractions classes for httpcontext httprequest httpresponse etc

53518
children	parent
the children would need to be notice when the parent dies either through a failed ipc heartbeat or just wfmo wfso on the parent s process handle

53548
equals	gethashcode
we had a requirement to overload the equals operator and therefore the gethashcode function of our objects as they had become volatile and stateless and sourcing themselves directly from data so in one place of the application we needed to ensure that an object would be viewed as equals to another object if it was sourced from the same data not just if it was the same reference

53550
easymock	mockrunner
if you want to be able to test without a running container you can either simulate its components with your own mockobjects with easymock or you could try mockrunner which has pre-defined stubs for testing servlets jdbc-connections etc

53695
postgresql	mysql
can t you live with postgresql or mysql

53724
fasta	blast
fasta and blast biological sequence matching algorithms

53753
mouse	keyboard
i use a great piece of software called synergy this allows me to use one keyboard and mouse across 3 machines and use the copy paste buffer between machines including images

53766
jobs	cron
we use cron jobs on unix to schedule the build and host a simple apache web server to view and monitor the build

53787
ant	maven
in the end you should use the nicer build tools msbuild ant maven make ... where you can and fill the gaps for the odder tools with custom scripts

53816
textile	bbcode
one common way to do this is to use a markup language like textile markdown or bbcode

53822
implements	extends
since you say you have no control over it might i recommend extracting an interface from it of the methods that you do care about and making a mydbconnection extends db_connection class that implements your interface

53835
phpunit	simpletest
thus automated testcases like unit-tests - see phpunit or simpletest - and frontend-tests - see selenium are all the more important for big php projects to ensure the good health of the code

53839
mouse	keyboard
characters can change appearances make sounds move other characters respond to the keyboard and mouse etc

53883
ubuntu	debian
the erlang compiling process described in ciaran s post described for ubuntu 6.10 btw can be easily skipped using apt command in any debian based distro

53908
factors	mean
this is a problem many people have solved on a variety of platforms and the fact this you re on a microcontroller doesn t mean that the same tools and such don t apply - the relevant factors is the language you re using

53913
xsl-fo	xslt
i m trying to produce sheets of photographs with captions arranged in a grid using xslt and xsl-fo

53967
dictionary	map
i have a class that map objects to objects but unlike dictionary it maps them both ways

53988
single-quotes	double-quotes
you ll need to escape them for php too unless you change your double-quotes to single-quotes

53989
width	height
however if you link directly to a swf file it will open in the browser window and without looking in the address bar you can t tell that it wasn t embedded in html with the size set to 100 width and height

53999
ienumerable	ienumerator
just implement the ienumerable interface no need to implement the ienumerator unless you want to do some special things in the enumerator which for your case doesn t seem to be needed

54022
post	get
raymond chen s recent series of blog post the implementation of iterators in c# and its consequences is a good place to get up to speed

54026
required	placeholder
well i can but that would required scanning innerhtml content for script tags and replacing them in the string by placeholder and then inserting them using the dom

54038
rss	feed
for example read a bunch of rss feed and post a daily digest of all new entries

54188
put	get
or put another way can part of the write be complete and get interrupted and then the read happen

54219
inherited	properties
this was probably a mistake of the initial design but i ve spent a few days thinking about it and the classes really don t have much in common other than a guid properties that uniquely identifies each item so i can see why the original designer did not relate them through inherited

54270
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and the upcoming firefox 2.1 promise an order of magnitude better performance in javascript

54403
debian	linux
debian live provides the best tools for building a linux live cd

54403
ubuntu	debian
sudo apt-get install live-helper # from debian unstable which should work fine from ubuntu

54426
submit	submission
like the delicious submission bookmark-let i d like to have some standard javascript i can use to submit any visited url to a 3rd party site when that s possible by url

54444
atomic	interlocked
use atomic operations like interlocked on windows and the equivalent on linux

54527
vim	textmate
in regards to code chunks i have found and started using a vim plug-in called snipmate which mimics textmate s snippets feature

54557
min	max
you could also use max or avg instead of min it is only important to use a function that returns the value of the column if there is only one matching row

54656
getter	setter
however as soon as the data requires flow control getter setter that maintain or protect an internal state or starts acquring any major functionality basically more object-like it will get upgraded to a class to better communicate intent

54708
gridview	datalist
i can t seem to get at the data the way i would in say a datalist or a gridview and i can t seem to come up with anything else on google or quickly leverage this one to do what i want

54757
rss	feed
software that has an impact on human safety has much different requirements than say an rss feed reader

54765
rss	feed
to the user of an rss feed reader the value of high quality is considerably lower

54811
uptime	reboot
if someone will swear at the computer and looses productivity while it reboot when your software goes down then uptime is worth spending thousands on most internal software

54817
accessor	properties
throw the invalidoperationexception exception if a call to a properties set accessor or method is not appropriate given the object s current state

54817
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
this seems like an object state invalid scenario to me so i d pick invalidoperationexception over argumentexception the parameters are valid but not at this point in the objects life

54830
typedef	struct
struct are also handy for various metaprogramming tasks like traits templates that just expose a bunch of dependent typedef

54876
spaces	delimiter
the microsoft.visualbasic.fileio namespace in microsoft.visualbasic.dll has a textfieldparser you can use to split on spaces delimiter text

54887
try-catch	exception-handling
you should be catching the exception-handling in a try-catch block

54975
free	malloc
usually i just replace calls to malloc and free with functions that keep better

55029
ssl	https
i d suggest looking at the request in the code that renders the form and if it is not using ssl issue a redirect to the https url

55090
getter	setter
you might be tempted to avoid creating those setter and getter but they also help in maintenance in case it becomse pertinent to do some modification of outputs or validation of inputs

55147
pop-up	dialog
however for a variety of reasons it needs to be embedded in the parent control not a pop-up dialog

55203
pop-up	dialog
when the user clicks ok on that dialog box i want to insert that piece of text into a textbox on the page that initial popped up the dialog pop-up page

55215
subtraction	addition
+ - binary addition subtraction

55254
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable and ienumerable both work

55348
rss	feed
if you have asp.net generating an rss feed it will sometimes put an extra line at the top of the page

55377
firefox	safari
instead it neutralizes one possible attack and currently does that only on ie firefox exposes httponly cookies in xmlhttprequest and safari doesn t honor it at all

55441
put	get
i usually put the source into my project and then i can get better intellisense and a better understanding of them

55484
rdf	owl
microsoft interactive media manager is a metadata management system developed on the microsoft sharepoint platform that heavily leverages rdf owl and sparql

55489
vb.net	vb6
one of the big differences i noticed between a vb6 project and the converted vb.net project winform was with the built-in controls

55578
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
update microsoft now provide virtual machine images for various versions of ie that are ready to use on all of the major os x virtualisation platforms virtualbox vmware fusion and parallels

55578
vmware	virtualbox
the developer disk images we re going to use are will work with either vmware fusion or sun virtualbox

55578
vmware	virtualbox
vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details

55578
vmware	virtualbox
download q.app from and put it in your applications folder you will need it to convert the disk images into a format vmware virtualbox can use

55578
disk	ram
this will probably take a while it takes around 30 minutes per disk image on my 2.4ghz core 2 duo macbook w 2gb ram

55610
vim	textmate
and as of late 2010 i m making the push to use vim for development even over textmate on os x

55642
ienumerable	ilist
actually one of the great arguments for var is that it can make refactoring simpler because you no longer have to worry that you made your declaration overly restrictive you used list when you should have used ilist or ienumerable

55651
httphandler	httpmodule
in an httphandler or httpmodule implementation you cannot always access session from the beginrequest event

55677
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	safari
no legacy browser compatibility required safari opera and firefox will do

55736
inherited	subclassing
blindlyequals is overridden by subclassing equals is inherited and never overridden

55742
getter	setter
you can also write some method of your own todo comparison using getter setter

55744
post	get
a bit of researching found that greasemonkey has a a function built into it where you can send get post requests to the server called gm_xmlhttprequest

55767
post	get
you could do a redirect to buy.php after saving to the session object which then does a server redirect to check.php it would mean when the user clicks back they re going back to the get request not the post request

55788
outputstream	inputstream
instead aquire an inputstream for the data and copy the data to the servlet outputstream in pieces

55862
hash	salt
basically i m extrapolating from the common way to implement web-site passwords when you re not using openid that is which is to store the salt hash of the user s password in your db and never save the actual password

55876
implements	extends
if you do need to extends this to cover many many file types look at the associated file command which implements the engine to use the database correctly it s non trivial for many file formats and is almost a statistical process

55879
gif	png
# png portable network graphics or png s not gif images

55882
hash	salt
additionally i would recommend using a salt to reduce the possibility to create a dictionary of all password hash

55884
websphere	ibm
ibm s websphere solution suite obtained through their ascential acquisition includes qualitystage

55904
hash	salt	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash
regarding your desire to store a hash of the password if you use pbkdf2 to generate the key you could use a standard password hashing algorithm big salt a thousand rounds of hashing for that and get different values

55904
hash	salt
the salt changes the hash resulting from each password

55927
hash	salt
can t you just use the password or hash password with some salt and then encrypt the file with it

55964
installation	upgrade	folder	directory
the installation is correctly detected as an upgrade but the directory selection screen is still shown and with the default value not necessarily the current installation folder

55983
try-catch	exception-handling
i ve seen too many try-catch blocks where the catch does nothing but rethrow the exception-handling

55999
n-gram	words
however if you really want something even faster you could include all n-gram in your pre-process where an n-gram is any string of n words in a row

56005
serializable	deserialization
if we let each object of the graph serializable itself using a deserialization constructor we get a lot switches for all the different modes of deserialization

56005
serializable	deserialization
another approach would be to have some sort deserialization factory classes methods one for each mode that does the serializable and deserialization externally graphserializer.serializeobjecttypex objecttypex objecttoserialze

56109
nant	cruisecontrol
we checked them all out but after careful consideration we decided to roll our own with a combination of cruisecontrol nant msbuild and msdeploy

56113
rmdir	xcopy
if your build uses custom tasks they should still work if they don t depend on windows executables such as rmdir or xcopy

56269
lxml	elementtree
another way is using the e factory builder from lxml available in elementtree too

56298
interbase	firebird
i ve written dlls for interbase firebird and t-sql sprocs for sql server but never a clr routine

56342
spaces	delimiter
some are tab delimiter some are spaces delimiter some we simply don t know yet

56422
idictionary	ilist
i can tell you that xaml serialization of collections rely on them implementing either ilist or idictionary so non-generic collections are going to be with us for some time to come

56460
min	max
you could check that the standard deviation looks reasonable that the min is reasonable and the max value as well

56464
post	get
to make get post requests and update your ui accordingly

56498
submit	submission
as a more draconian approach you can always write a submit trigger which will reject submission of change-lists if they contain a certain file or files with a certain extension etc

56578
csla	.net
frameworks like csla in .net have a lot of aspects from this patterm i think entity framework looks a bit too much like this too

56595
subtraction	addition
while for most datetime operations i would normally convert to unixtime and perform addition subtraction etc

56596
typedef	struct
typedef struct _image_nt_headers

56596
typedef	struct
typedef struct _image_optional_header

56615
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari have a very similar console and right-click options for inspect element

56629

this allows us to use good object oriented principles like encapsulation and reuse and doesnâ t violate lsp

56961
public	protected
base classes can declare protected and public functions that can be accessed by derivations

57006

57104
postgresql	mysql
btw i want to be using postgresql and or mysql as the backend database

57166
ilist	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	icollection
you may also want to look at casting yout ilist to ienumerable for serialization since ilist just wraps ienumerable and icollection

57202
put	get
i would like to put a link to a webpage in an alert dialog box so that i can give a more detailed description of how to fix the error that makes the dialog box get created

57262
versioning	upgrade
your only alternative in 2008 is to get your users to upgrade their framework versioning now

57276
filesystems	ntfs
it explains how to use the ntfs filesystems with c++ through windows 2000

57291
websphere	ibm
i was hoping there would be a similar mechanism for websphere that doesn t involve calling the ibm libraries or rely on rad to be installed on your workstation

57310
jython	jacl
one way to do it could be using jython or jacl scripts

57320
migrate	upgrade
if you have a few spare cycles you could migrate a separate branch of your apps in your scm which is running with the 3.5 runtime and when you actually need to upgrade you have a working branch assuming that you keep it up-to-date with some bi-weekly merge

57335
agile	sprint
as to the more general how does fogbugz fit with the agile methodology your best bet is to do sprint as mini-releases

57547
gmail	hotmail
my university does not allow our student-mailbox to forward to a private e-mail account everybody uses either gmail or hotmail here

57573
for-loop	loops
indeed i seem to remember steve mcconnell s code complete advising against even using comma operators in a for-loop for readability and maintainability loops should be controlled by only one variable and the expressions in the for line itself should only contain loop-control code not other extra bits of initialisation or loops maintenance

57609
put	get
right now i m placing the cal values into registry keys that get put into the os image at build time

57619
goto	break
there probably is some overlap with arguments about goto but as far as i m concerned the use of continue is equivalent to using break statements in loops or return statement from anywhere in a method body - if used correctly it can simplify the code less likely to contain bugs easier to maintain

57641
profiling	debugging
phped also offers great debugging and profiling and the ability to add watches breakpoints etc in php code

57641
profiling	debugging
browser plugins also enable quick integration with firefox or ie visit slow url with browser then click button to profiling or debugging

57668
goto	break
you can goto anywhere thus break flow control arbitrarily

57681
for-loop	loops
if you have to write large for loops i would try to stick to using continue close to the top of the for-loop

57699
children	parent
so you need to create the state object in your parent appdomain and then pass it to any children that want to use it

57720
datediff	difference
it takes into account the fact that datediff computes the difference without considering what month or day it is so the month diff between 8 31 and 9 1 is 1 month and handles that with a case statement that decrements the result where appropriate

57759
opera	firefox
i ve tried installing some other commercial apps opera foxit firefox only firefox will install under nonadmin and only if you select something other than program files which i was aware is off limits to nonadmin acounts

jruby	mri
actually production-ready mri and jruby

57884
mef	prism
mef s heritage ala prism certainly shows through but i think it would be odd if it didn t given that both frameworks are about composition

57958
gridview	repeater	gridview	checkboxlist
i can t argue with the utility of gridview repeater checkboxlist etc so i use them when i need that functionality

57967
processors	hyperthreading
iirc the coolthreads technology is referring to the fact that rather than just ramping up the clock speed ever higher to improve performance they are now looking at multiple core processors with hyperthreading effectively giving you loads of processors on one chip

58070
getter	setter
so the classes folder had just the class properties and getter setter

58091
post	put
you could certainly put the static methods in post into the post class this is how csla works but they are still factory methods

58094
post	put
if you put the code to populate the post in the post class then your business layer is interceded with data access code and vice versa

58175
pascal	delphi
you might take a look at free pascal as it includes a 64 bit version and is mostly delphi compatible syntax

58218
actionscript	mxml
mxml just provides a quick way to build the ui etc but if you want to do it yourself with actionscript there s nothing stopping you this would also probably be easier if you already have that ui in as2 code

58232
mouse	keyboard
the way we use it is to replace users inputs by automating mouse mouse and clicks and keyboard presses

58248
firefox	safari
unless you re using some really esoteric browser features in general if something works in firefox i ve found it works without modification in windows safari

58301
directx	gdi
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way

58304
struts	stripes
in our evaluation we considered an alpha version of struts that supported annotations and a lot of other frameworks but stripes won because of it s superior documentation stability and clean-ness

58340
mvp	presenter
using win forms with an mvc mvp architecture i would normally use a class to wrap a view to test the ui while using mocks for the model and controller presenter

58363
memcached	apc
i would recommend memcached or apc

58369
opera	firefox
then there s an ie way to get the cursor position that also works in opera and an easier way in firefox

58375
sorting	filtering
if its something that will take fewer lines of clr code to tackle it string manipulation complex custom sorting or filtering etc. use this approach

58398
mouse	keyboard
if you plan on working off of the laptop by itself without external mouse kb monitor more than 60 of the time than the macbook pro with it s larger keyboard and monitor would be better suited

58432
firefox	safari
i m assuming you would like to be ablt to use if globally or at least in ie firefox not just be installing safari as other have suggested

58500
qtkit	quicktime
if you want to manipulate the camera directly from your code you must use the quicktime capture apis or the cocoa qtkit capture wrapper much better

58543
width	height
easy just set height and width to 100

58556
disk	ram
to clarify my question a little bit i can of course do the math to calculate the amount of ram and disk space i need to run 5 instances given the constraints stated above

58620
width	height
remark using use_cw_default for width and height results in a 0 0 size button so that s not a solution

58689
width	height
to get your own dialog base units you have to retrieve current text metrics with gettextmetrics and use character height and average width tmheight and tmavecharwidth of the textmetric struct respectively and translate them with muldiv by your own unless you are in a dialog then mapdialogrect will do all the job for you

58689
width	height
if buttons are the only control you want to resize automatically you can also use bcm_getidealsize message button_getidealsize macro windows xp and up only to retrieve optimal width and height that fits anything the button contains though it looks pretty ugly without any margins applied around the button s text

58700
robocopy	xcopy
i find robocopy is a good alternative to xcopy

58713
integer	fractions
and you want a least common multiplier n such that n each fractions an integer then n a b c gcd a b c

58785
robocopy	xcopy
robocopy functionally replaces xcopy with more options

58835
gdal	arcgis
i was originally using arcgis 9.2 but that doesn t work well with c# and 64 bit so i am now using gdal

58864
disk	ram
coming from a mac background i ve never really spent much time tinkering with assembling tweaking my own computer beyond occasional ram upgrades and swapping out hard disk

58923
goto	break
having an unsupported keyword ie continue or goto would break that

58929
postgresql	mysql
postgresql db2 mysql and mssql all refuse to run the first query as it s ambiguous

59006
getter	setter
the way getter and setter work a rectangle should satisfy the following invariant

59018
children	parent
hierarchical structure easy definition of a document tree with automatic links to siblings parent and children

59037
hash	salt
if you do not salt your password you re suspect to rainbow table attacks precompiled dictionaries that have valid inputs for a given hash

59037
hash	salt
the problem is that if you have a collisions two inputs with the same hash adding the salt to the wrong side will not change the resulting hash

59038
hash	salt
normally hashing functions allow you to provide a salt which makes the use of known hash table a waste of time

59038
hash	salt
based on the above as well as the fact that if you do somehow get clear-text expose a salt hash value is of little value to someone trying to get in

59054
hash	salt
the usual solution is to use a secret salt plus additional user information to make the hash results unique- something like

59093
actionscript	mxml
flex seems to be thier name for the flex builder ide based on eclipse and the general approach of building flash files using mxml and actionscript rather than the normal flash tools

59093
actionscript	mxml
i think the mxml and actionscript approach flex is designed to appeal much more to programmers where as the flash side is designed more to appeal to graphic designers

59097
versioning	upgrade
if you need more advanced database features sql server express can be seamlessly upgrade to more sophisticated versioning of sql server

59132
junit	testng
they all support junit and most support testng as well

59260
firefox	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so to do have a tooltip show up in both ie and firefox safari google-chrome opera use both an alt attribute and a title attribute

59281
hash	salt
i d symmetrically encrypt aes a secure salt hash sha-256 + salt

59281
hash	salt
the salt hash would be enough with a big salt but the encryption adds a bit extra in case the database and not the code leaks and there are rainbow tables for salt hash by then or some other means

59298
nant	cruisecontrol
we use a combination of cruisecontrol nant msbuild to generate a release version of the app

59460
httphandler	httpmodule
i did the parsing of the user-agent string at the page level but of course you could do this kind of logic in the httpmodule or httphandler level also

59480
hide	show
this is likely due to blocking from one of the controls wrapping it my gut feeling is that it s the popupcontrolextender - it tends to have odd behavior with updatepanels as it is intended to manage the events inside it for it s show hide purposes

59481
boost	stl
see boost pointer container for a container that does the automatic deletion of contained pointers for you while maintaining a syntax very close to ordinary stl containers

59540
caldav	webdav
icalendar is a calendar synchronization format specification and caldav is an implementation of icalendar atop the webdav protocol

59549
google-chrome	firefox
when downloading both firefox and google-chrome i ve noticed that the default version i got was in my native tongue of hebrew

59600
versioning	upgrade
personally i would suggest you stick with delphi maybe just upgrade to a new versioning

59600
versioning	upgrade
another option would be to upgrade to a more resent versioning of delphi for .net and port your code to .net that way

59638
ubuntu	linux
i have set up 3 laptops with linux 2 ubuntu and 1 fedora 8

59644
ubuntu	linux
that is how i found the linux distribution that would run on my laptop ubuntu
